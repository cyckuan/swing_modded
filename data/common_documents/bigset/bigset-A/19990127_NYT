<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a day of bitter partisanship, Senate
Democrats and Republicans sought Tuesday night to pull themselves
back from a divisive abyss and salvage a bipartisan accord on
handling witnesses and ending the impeachment trial as early as
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp shift in mood came after hours of closed debate. In an
unscripted end to the evening floor session, 20 senators from both
parties suddenly surrounded the Republican and Democratic leaders,
Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, prodding them to try to broker a
bipartisan and dignified conclusion to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators on both sides of the aisle were pushing for strict
time limits on taking depositions from witnesses, and then moving
swiftly to the end of the trial, with votes on the articles of
impeachment. Such an abrupt finish could effectively mean that the
Senate would not hear live testimony from any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events came on the eve of two crucial votes and as
House Republican prosecutors strengthened their case for witnesses
by paring their proposed list to three people: Monica S. Lewinsky,
Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were still scheduled to hold two votes on Wednesday.
The first would be whether to dismiss the two impeachment articles,
and that is expected to fail along party lines. A second vote, on
whether to depose the three potential witnesses, is too close to
call, senators said, and could win broader support if the Senate
reaches a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Although recognizing the growing likelihood of deposing witness,
some senators raised the prospect Tuesday night of delaying those
pivotal votes to try to broker a bipartisan agreement on the issue.
But others said the votes would indeed take place. Under
negotiation within the smaller groups were ground rules for
questioning witnesses in depositions, including limitations on
numbers of witnesses and subjects to be covered and how long they
would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the agreement for many Democrats would be a deadline
for a final vote to acquit or convict President Clinton.
Bipartisanship is a fragile thing in the Senate, and any single
senator could block the emerging deal and go immediately to the
scheduled votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to avoid a party-line vote tomorrow,'' said Sen.
Bob Graham of Florida, one of the few Democrats who has been open
to deposing witnesses. ``We would like to have an agreement that
has as its keystone a date certain for a vote on the articles of
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there were promising signs Tuesday night that the two
parties were trying to repair the rhetorical damage done during the
day. Senators spilled from the chamber, scribbling notes to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   One odd political couple _ Sen. Tom Harkin, a liberal Iowa
Democrat, and Sen. Sam Brownback, a conservative Kansas Republican
_ swapped notes and agreed to talk again Wednesday morning. ``We're
trying to bring this to a close,'' Harkin said, refusing to
disclose any details.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Republicans cobbled together a proposal
governing how witnesses would be handled, hoping it would satisfy
undecided senators in both parties. At a Republican caucus Tuesday
morning, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island offered a plan to limit
the questioning of each witness to three hours by the House
prosecutors and three hours by the White House, with questions only
on areas of factual dispute. The plan also provided for the
videotaping of witnesses so senators not at the interviews could
gauge their demeanor and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators suggested that excerpts from the videotapes could
be used in place of live witnesses before the Senate itself, if the
trial reached that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very rational, a very modest proposal,'' said Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. ``It is important for many of us who took the
oath, who are still weighing the evidence, who really want to see
these key witnesses testify, to have the opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, supports
the plan, which could become the centerpiece of a resolution that
guides the Senate through the deposition phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors, or managers, have also asked the Senate
to invite the president to give a deposition, but the White House
has flatly rejected that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans forged ahead at midday on the witness issue,
angry Democrats took to the microphones off the Senate floor to
play on Republican fears of a protracted and unseemly spectacle.
Democrats cautioned that by opening the door to witnesses,
Republicans would also have to allow White House lawyers to peruse
the 54,000 pages of House documents they have not seen as well as
documents held by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, which
they said could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our colleagues need to clearly understand that if it's a
choice between expeditious and fair, Democrats are going to fall on
the side of fairness,'' said Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would also have the right to call witnesses,
which presidential aides said would entail lengthy preparations.
``This motion for witnesses is a motion to delay,'' said a White
House spokesman, James Kennedy. ``It makes delay a certainty. There
is no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans immediately accused Democrats of employing
scare tactics to derail what they said was a legitimate part of any
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that White House has made a threat,'' said Sen.
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``It is not an appropriate way to influence the
Senate in deciding whether to grant the House managers' motion.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Entering the third week of the trial, the Senate seems close to
following the same partisan script that engulfed the House's
contentious impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle have consulted each other regularly through the
trial and brokered an unusual unanimous agreement that has steered
the Senate proceedings up to now.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Daschle said he had not been told of Chafee's plan,
and several Republican senators said they would use their majority
to muscle the framework for questioning witnesses, if need be. By
Tuesday night, some senators on both sides were seeking a way to
avoid a partisan showdown.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans and Democrats jockeyed over the witness
question in corridors, private hideaways and, by Tuesday night, on
the Senate floor itself, Lott was promoting a strategy to end the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under that approach, the Senate would vote to find that Clinton
had committed the offenses charged in the two articles of
impeachment: perjury and obstruction of justice. After that,
senators would take a second vote on whether to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for Tuesday's off-the-floor maneuvering was the
House prosecutors' decision, under pressure from Senate
Republicans, to trim their witness list to three people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't what we would like, but we have to be realistic,''
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the lead prosecutor, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were virtually united in opposing witnesses, while
most Republicans praised the prosecutors' new approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed dismay they did not
put Betty Currie, the president's secretary, on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised and disappointed,'' Collins said. ``She's
central to the obstruction-of-justice charges, and it's going to be
harder to resolve that without her.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Republican aide said the House managers decided that
Mrs. Currie probably would not clear up the question of whether
Clinton was trying to coach her about Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the
White House and would not resolve whether the president directed
her to retrieve gifts he gave Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the House prosecutors asked the Senate to consider,
but not vote on, whether to invite Clinton to submit to
questioning. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that senators would
welcome the president's testimony but should not compel it, a
common view among most senators.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has not decided whether to request that Clinton testify, a
senior Republican aide said.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ The humbling experience of losing four Super Bowls didn't
change Cornelius Bennett one iota. However, wrecking his reputation
and losing his freedom did.
</P>
<P>
   But quick.
</P>
<P>
   Spending 36 days in the Erie County (N.Y.) Correctional Facility
last spring was the final step in the facilitation of a major
correction in where Bennett was going with his life. Which was
pretty much straight to hell, he says, if he hadn't mended his wild
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have so much happen to me in one year's time, to come from
where I've come from and turn myself over to the Lord, putting all
my faith and trust in him,'' Bennett said, ``to go from being on
the bubble to starting and having a fine season and now going back
to the Super Bowl, is the best feeling in the world for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No, there's nothing corny about Corny's having found the Lord.
His being born again as a Christian, a religious conversion that
followed his jail sentence for sexual misconduct, made it possible
for him to become born again as a football player, too.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, here he is, hoping a fifth trip to the Super Bowl _ now,
improbably, as an Atlanta Falcon _ bears more fruit than those four
failed ventures with Buffalo. A city that he contritely admits he
and his self-indulgent, underdisciplined Bills teammates betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we thought we were the party team of the
'90s,'' Bennett said. ``We lost all four (games), and there was
good reason. I can only speak for myself. I don't want to name
names, but what we did was cheat ourselves and the Buffalo fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to distract ourselves and get
caught up in the hype. It's the biggest party in the world, and we
were world-class party people. Everyone tried to outdo everyone
else. I look back now and think of it as wasted opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, losing football games, even Super Bowls, is a minor
affront compared with the damage Bennett did to himself May 18,
1997, when he returned to Buffalo for a roast of his former
teammate, Jim Kelly. That night, he ran across a young lady he
knew, they wound up in his hotel room and well, some believe
Bennett got off lightly for what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital records say the woman suffered skin cuts and abrasions
and was traumatized. The judge who sent Bennett to jail _ in
addition to levying a $1,000 fine, making him pay restitution to
the victim for $600 in medical bills and requiring him to give 100
hours of service to the community _ did so as a ``wake-up call''
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett agreed he needed one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was going to be around (the NFL) anymore
because of the trouble,'' he said. ``Who wants that kind of thing
on the team?''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves, whose own Christian center gives him a
large capacity for forgiveness, decided to stick with Bennett,
although he did draft a potential replacement for him, Keith
Brooking, in the first round. When Brooking proved a slow learner,
the chastened 12th-year linebacker seized the moment to regain his
front-and-center role with the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``His play has been instrumental in where we've gotten this
year,'' defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said. ``He made a lot of
big plays. At a time when most people would think Cornelius should
start slowing down, he's still got some wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   At 33, seven seasons removed from his being the AFC's Defensive
Player of the Year, Bennett led the NFC champions in tackles.
</P>
<P>
   And in prayers, as well as, of late, sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly what to not do to win a Super Bowl,'' he said.
``I have a long list of those. I have talked to the team. I hope
that sharing my experiences on how to really blow one of the best
opportunities of your life will help us keep focused and lead us to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a great blessing. But just to have a chance to
be back here is unbelievable. I'm going to do everything in my
power to help this team win a Super Bowl. As (former Bills coach)
Marv Levy would say, `One more river to cross.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's wife and daughter are staying with him for the week.
His down time figures to be very quiet time. Unlike at his previous
Super Bowls, alcohol and raucous behavior won't be part of Corny's
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole year has been a miracle,'' he said. ``Other coaches
probably would have given up on me, and I probably would have been
blackballed around the league. But coach Reeves knows what kind of
person I am overall. He knows my character. He knows whatever
happened to me that particular evening was out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Bennett must spend what's left of his career
proving that. He's out of second chances. He is either redeemed, or
doomed.

BIBBY CAN DEALWITH HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC may be on a four-game losing streak, but coach
Henry Bibby said he isn't worried about any criticism he may be
receiving since the Trojans hit their recent slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the Internet,'' Bibby said. ``This is my
job. This is what I've done my whole life. In this position, you're
going to be criticized at times. That's what's great about this
country. You can voice an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. I'm not down or depressed. I'm excited about the
program. If the people aren't, that's their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it easy: With an eight-day layoff following last
Wednesday's loss to UCLA, Bibby decided to give his team a bit of a
break instead of holding longer practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of backed off a little bit. I gave guys a lot of
space. Guys have played a lot of basketball,'' Bibby said. ``I
wanted to give them some breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   No lineup changes: Asked if he was pondering a different lineup
to snap the Trojans out of their slump, Bibby said: ``I've shaken
it up every game. I don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Too great expectations? Considering USC got off to an 8-1 start
in nonconference games, the Trojans' 10-6 record seems awfully
disappointing. But Bibby said if there is any letdown over the
team's record, it comes strictly from the media, not him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you guys expect more than we expect. I think it's
pretty good,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   And realistic?
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, probably yeah,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown advantage: USC center Brian Scalabrine will be on a
welcome home tour this week. Scalabrine will have more than 20
friends and family members at Thursday's game against Washington.
He grew up in Enumclaw, just outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There will even be about 10 friends and family members making
the four-five hour drive to Pullman for Saturday's game at
Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Carey making strides: USC will face Washington freshman guard
Senque Carey on Thursday. Carey originally committed to USC but
signed with Washington after the Trojans began recruiting other
guards. Carey is averaging 10.1 points per game in Pacific-10
Conference play.

ROBINSON HOLDS COURT AT MEDIA DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Eugene Robinson squinted into the glare of the
mid-morning sun, and his face erupted into a smile that was even
more luminous.
</P>
<P>
   The free-spirited and fast-talking free safety of the Atlanta
Falcons, and former longtime Seahawk, was in his element and could
not hide the joy of being in the Super Bowl spotlight for the third
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good right now. I'm in my thing here right,''
Robinson said Tuesday. ``I get to talk. I've got a microphone in my
hand. I can go, `Check, 1, 2, 3.' I get to talk and have a good
time. This is part of what I do. I happen to enjoy this part.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, because he is so good at it.
</P>
<P>
   On what they call Media Day in this week of excess leading to
the Super Bowl, Robinson was the media darling. The group of
reporters and cameras surrounding him as he sat in the stands at
Pro Player Stadium dwarfed those of either quarterback, both
coaches combined and even outnumbered those who came to glean the
latest offerings from the unsinkable lips of Broncos tight end
Shannon Sharpe _ the self-proclaimed official voice of Super Bowl
XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rapid-fire rambling from Robinson ranged from his
humble beginnings in the sport, to his team's unlikely ascent to
the Super Bowl, to him being nominated for the Bart Starr award, to
his on-going rivalry with Broncos quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   No subject was off limits. No question went unanswered. No one
had to ask, ``Gee, Eugene, could you elaborate on that?''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was asked who talks more, him or Sharpe. Robinson just
smiled and suggested Sharpe would be the one to best answer that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to get into a jawing match with me because he
knows he can't win,'' Sharpe said. ``He can't out-talk me and he
can't cover me.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Sharpe words aside, to say Robinson talks a lot is like
saying that it rains a bit in Seattle this time of year. The words
don't trickle from Robinson's mouth, they flow. And often the flow
can become a deluge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eugene has not changed at all. Eugene is still Eugene,'' said
wide receiver Ronnie Harris, like Robinson a former Seahawk who has
traded his feathers for those of the Dirty Birds from Atlanta. ``He
loves to talk and he talks all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   All the time?
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks non-stop,'' Falcons cornerback Randy Fuller said.
``And you want to listen carefully, because if you don't, you'll
probably miss something important. He is our spiritual leader, and
everyone gravitates toward him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the case Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Players and reporters put up with Robinson's constant babbling
because he also is proficient at this game of football.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not the fastest on the field, or even the best
athlete, during his stints with the Seahawks (1985-96), Packers
(1996-97) and Falcons, Robinson has endured and matured into one of
the best safeties of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only a great athlete, but he's very smart,'' said
Broncos quarterback John Elway, who will match up against his
longtime friend and foe for the 25th time in Sunday's NFL title
game. ``You have to be very careful with him. You know he's not
going to be out of position, and he's going to make a lot of
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 14 seasons, Robinson has intercepted 53 passes to lead
all active players and made 1,244 tackles to rank second among
those still playing. Oh, and he has been voted to the Pro Bowl
while playing with three different teams.
</P>
<P>
   To realize just how far Robinson has come, it helps to take a
moment to remember where this guy came from. After not receiving a
single athletic scholarship out of Weaver High School in Hartford,
Conn., Robinson went to Colgate and walked on the football team
only after being challenged by some classmates. Undrafted coming
out of Colgate, he signed as a free agent with the Seahawks and
became a leader on and off the field, as well as in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Deemed too old in 1996, the Seahawks traded Robinson to Green
Bay, where he helped the Packers to two Super Bowls in two seasons
and also was voted to the NFC Pro Bowl squad. This season, same
story, same result, as the Packers decided to go with a younger
player. Robinson signed with Atlanta, where he helped lead the
Falcons to the Super Bowl and again was voted to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Sharper, the player who replaced Robinson in Green Bay,
blew the play that led to a last-second TD pass against San
Francisco that eliminated the Packers from the playoffs. Robinson,
meanwhile, broke up a late pass to Minnesota rookie sensation Randy
Moss that helped the Falcons upset the Vikings in the NFC title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Too old. Too small. Too slow. Too much.
</P>
<P>
   That's Eugene Robinson, who continues to make plays after all
these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't seem to be able to get away from this guy,'' said Gary
Kubiak, the Broncos offensive coordinator who has played and
coached against Robinson. ``Eugene plays the safety position like a
quarterback on defense. He knows where the ball is going. He knows
how to cheat to the ball by making quick reads. He knows exactly
what he's doing out there, and he usually knows exactly what you're
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, Robinson also knows how to talk.

MEDIA DAY HYPE-FEST SADLY LACKING IN BARB THROWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As official Super Bowl hype-fests go, this one Tuesday
was rather disappointing, really.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the 2,000 credentialed scribes or broadcasters asked
12-year Atlanta veteran Jessie Tuggle the ultimate Super Bowl Media
Day question:
</P>
<P>
   If you were a tree, what kind would you be?
</P>
<P>
   No one even asked him if Tuggle was short for something, or if
he ever considered changing his name.
</P>
<P>
   And excuse me, but if MTV can't bring back Downtown Julie Brown
for one lousy week of those wacky sort of Spice Girls/Generation
X/Real World Super Bowl reports, then what's the sense of
stretching this NFL title game into a weeklong affair?
</P>
<P>
   If MTV isn't here, should the commissioner be alarmed?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the pregame buildup has turned into an exercise in
how many times John Elway/Mike Shanahan and Dan Reeves can
backpedal on the issue of why they detest each other so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all been documented by now,'' Broncos tight end Shannon
Sharpe reassured the bored horde of sporting media at Tuesday's
interview session at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was willing to expound on what has been the most
compelling story of Super Bowl XXXIII, at least until Atlanta
cornerback Ray Buchanan showed up wearing a double-wide, stainless
steel-studded, black leather dog collar, which we'll get to in a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the saga of the Not-So Three Amigos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all proved their point. Dan can win without John. John
can win without Dan. Mike is a great coach,'' Sharpe said. ``And
John doesn't like Dan. Dan doesn't like Mike. And John and Mike are
best friends. Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, enough probably has not been said.
</P>
<P>
   There still are five days left until The Big Game, which gives
us plenty of time to dissect this obviously still sore subject, no
matter how much Reeves/Shanahan/Elway want to leave this dirty
water ``under the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't enough water in Biscayne Bay to drown out this
sub-plot.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as Super Bowl showdowns go, there was the sense
here that Bill Parcells and the Jets might have been greatly
appreciated Super Bowl XXXIII contestants from the AFC ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, last year's darlings and underdogs, are this year's
Billy Ray Cyrus: One hit is enough, thank you. Time to move on. One
Super Bowl win was enough to prove Elway is great and that the
organization does not have to spend another minute agonizing over
the failure of those four Super Bowl losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had to answer one question about why we haven't won
a Super Bowl yet,'' Elway said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Elway and the Broncos are last year's news,
which explains why so many reporters were heading back to the
shuttle buses before the Broncos' allotted hour of interactive
media face time was done. With the Broncos, it's been there, done
that, and how many Shannon Sharpe zingers do you need to fill a
notebook?
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with the Falcons _ a nice group of guys, but come
on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the Falcons would consider bringing back all the
ex-Falcons for this Super Bowl, things would be interesting. Brett
Favre. Deion Sanders. Andre Rison and the House of Fire. Jeff
George. Jerry Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons talk about having so many ``character guys'' on this
Super Bowl squad. We'd settle for some characters, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked the Falcons,'' Sharpe said. ``I've pretty much
been in Georgia my whole life. I grew up in Georgia. I live in
Georgia. And I still don't like the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't he like them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they lost all the time,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that if the Falcons were losing and you were in
Fulton County Stadium and owned a pair of cleats, they'd put you in
the game,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many fans do the Falcons have prior to 1998 versus after
1998? I rest my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Falcon bandwagon is still growing and deservedly so
for an outstanding season. But if this Super Bowl were in the hands
of the U.S. Senate, there might be a motion to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   With a juicy presidential impeachment trial underway on Capitol
Hill, even the billion-dollar juggernaut called the National
Football League is having a tough time convincing the world that
Miami is where all the action is during Super Bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you at least have to appreciate the effort on the
part of Ray Buchanan. The Falcons cornerback is the only Super Bowl
contestant going full metal jacket this week.
</P>
<P>
   First, Buchanan made a Joe Namath-like declaration that the
Falcons will win the Super Bowl. Tuesday, he topped that with a
very inspired Super Bowl fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the 7-point underdogs so I went to the pet store and
bought me this dog collar,'' Buchanan said, laughing. ``I wanted
the hardest, the meanest dog collar in the store so I could look
like a rottweiler.''
</P>

   Welcome to Super Bowl XXXIII's version of House of Style. If
only Versace were here . . .

BRUINS' LOSS DISGUSTS BURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ When his top-flight players failed to deliver
in the first 40 minutes, Bruins coach Pat Burns decided to send
them a message for the final 20 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Burns sat center Jason Allison for all but seven seconds of the
third period and benched the other two-thirds of the top line _
Steve Heinze and All-Star Dmitri Khristich _ for the entire 20.
Also languishing on the bench was defenseman Don Sweeney, who
didn't play a shift in the third.
</P>
<P>
   This all was a result of the Bruins falling behind by four goals
and ultimately losing, 4-1, to the New York Islanders at Nassau
Coliseum in eminently forgettable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   By no means was this the way the team wanted to start their
second-half run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to sit $6 million in salary on the bench in the third
period,'' said a disgusted Burns. ``Six million bucks. They showed
nothing. I don't know what's going on with them. I've been calm
with them. I've tried to talk to them to see if there's a problem.
After a while, enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was refreshing to watch the third period. Here's a bunch of
guys with not a whole lot of talent or skill who are out working
hard for 20 minutes. It's refreshing to watch that, but it
certainly wasn't refreshing to watch (the first 40).''
</P>
<P>
   Allison, whose contract negotiations caused him to miss almost
all of training camp, seems to be the biggest concern. Burns feels
he's not skating well. The coach was asked if the fat contract may
have made Allison softer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a crook,'' said Burns, who also dropped
Sergei Samsonov off the top line, in favor of Heinze. ``But he did
put a gun to management's head and said, `I want all this money.'
But when you do that, you have to come back and prove certain
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough. Sooner or later, it has to stop. If you
don't want to play, we'll stick you on the fourth line and you'll
play the odd shift. I'm not going to have a Bruins team that's
going to give that kind of effort like the first 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reichel and Bryan Smolinski scored 40 seconds apart in
the first period to give the Islanders a 2-0 lead. Reichel made it
3-0 at 2:01 of the second, and Zigmund Palffy made it a runaway at
14:33. Tim Taylor scored the lone Boston goal at 19:17.
</P>
<P>
   Burns had seen enough and took action in the third. Among those
equally peeved was goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite honestly sick of talking about what we should do or
how we should come out,'' said Dafoe. ``It's time to put up and
shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison seemed somewhat flummoxed by the coach's decision,
though he declined to challenge it. He is no stranger to benching.
Last year he was told to sit out a period against Carolina and
again after the All-Star break against his former team, the
Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was the worst game he's seen us play, so he was
going to make us sit out the period,'' said Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the worst game we've played. We had some pressure.
We didn't score four goals like their big line, I guess. I don't
know. I'm not making excuses. I haven't played as well as I can,
but I don't think  &UR; tonight &LR;  was a night where I was playing
exceptional bad. But obviously, he did, and that's all that
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Allison's skating is the crux of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Allison doesn't skate, he's just another borderline
player,'' said Burns. ``That's all he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he doesn't see any variation in the way he skated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't found the groove yet or whatever, but that has
nothing to do with  &UR; tonight &LR; ,'' he said. ``There might have been
times where we were tired. When you take that many days off and
then you play a lot, there might be a couple of shifts in a row
where it might look like you're . . . maybe that's what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you look at the zone time, I bet it wasn't that bad.
I'm not making excuses, I'm not saying I've been playing great
because I know I haven't, but it's disappointing when you have no
chance to help the team win (in the third). Obviously, it doesn't
make you very happy.''

MANAGEMENT-SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE WORLDLY OUTOOKS ON CLINTON
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ On the campus of Thunderbird, the American Graduate
School of International Management, where East meets West and
intersects with 74 nationalities, students have worldly
perspectives on the president's transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Two students from northern China dine on pizza, chicken-fried
steak and other American favorites at the campus cafeteria. Libo
Yang calls the treatment of the president ``shameful.'' Edward Yu,
who arrived just six months ago, worries about the global
implications of having the United States so focused on Bill
Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world still needs the United States. They can't
concentrate on events and matters around the world that need
serious attention if they are mired in this trial,'' he says.
``It's very unproductive. I worry about it. The world needs the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The cafeteria is a melange of cultures. Here languages from
different parts of the world blend together as students discuss
global issues. While the people here come from different
backgrounds, they are similar in that nearly all seem to be paying
attention to the presidential scandal and pondering how such a
dilemma would play out in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Daniela Malik and Morise Gusmao say this
presidential affair would be short-lived in Brazil, where both were
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``People there would have laughed about it and then gotten back
to their jobs,'' confesses Malik.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of Brazilians'political permissiveness, she cites
one official in Sao Paulo who keeps getting re-elected even though
he is known to be a swindler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people's motto for him is `He steals, but he gets the job
done,' '' says Malik.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this view from student Jean Qi Liu of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this is really a private issue, I believe it doesn't
matter when it comes down to the president,'' she says. ``The
president isn't a private person. He has a lot of privileges. In
order to have these privileges, there is a level of responsibility
he has to maintain. He needs to be held to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the president should be removed from office,
explains Liu, who sits outside the cafeteria editing a paper in
Chinese for a professor.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao is annoyed that the impeachment process is dragging on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did something wrong. But people shouldn't care about what
he did in his private life,'' Gusmao explains.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar and Marisa Corrales, who arrived on campus from Lima,
Peru, two weeks ago, are shocked to see such private matters being
played out on prime-time television and in front-page articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit shocking to see such intimate details about
a person's life out in the public,'' says Marisa. ``It's not
appropriate at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Husband Edgar is shocked that Americans would spend so much
money on such a ``frivolous'' trial, particularly given that so
many poor countries could do so much with such resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wasteful and a great travesty,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   An American from Michigan brings everything back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about what he did in his private life,''
confesses Kurt Neubauer. ``What I'm concerned about is that he lied
under oath. He obstructed justice. He's the top cop in the country.
What kind of system do we have if he's allowed to break the law?''
</P>
<P>
   No one has an answer. &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
is taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care about
President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from office?
What does captivate people? She looks for the answers. Amparano can
be reached at 444-8394 or at julie.amparano(at)pni.com via e-mail. &QL;

MAYOR BATTLES TO KEEP AMERICA WEST IN PHOENIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Caught off guard by last week's news that America West
Airlines is being courted by various airline companies, Phoenix
Mayor Skip Rimsza is pounding his bully pulpit and punching his
calculator to salvage a situation that could cost the city
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said in an interview Tuesday that he will try every way
he can to keep the airline in Phoenix, including reminding America
West that the city has invested nearly $500 million in airport
improvements that benefit the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city will hire experts to calculate how it can
best fill in the gaps that would be left by America West's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be sure we know what the consequences would be and
that we plan for a scenario that, until six days ago, was as
unlikely as frozen streets in Phoenix,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He met Tuesday with federal Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater to let him know of the city's interest in keeping its
``hometown'' airline.
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to get the mayors of America West's two other hub
cities _ Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio _ to form an alliance with
Phoenix so the three cities take the same approach to America
West's future, whether that be a sale, a merger or the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is exploring the possibility that Southwest
Airlines could fill part of the gap should Phoenix lose America
West.
</P>
<P>
   The airline last Wednesday acknowledged that it had been
contacted by a number of airlines about a possible merger or
alliance. United Airlines emerged as the initial suitor, but
American, Delta and Southwest all expressed varying degrees of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials would not comment Tuesday on Rimsza's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he's certain that any change to the status quo
would spell bad economic news for the Phoenix area. Area residents
benefit from having America West and Southwest Airlines both using
Sky Harbor as a hub. It heightens competition and keeps fares low,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the airline were sold, or merged, it likely would spell a
drop in operations here, just as recent bank mergers have resulted
in fewer banking outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said his plan is not meant to be a heavy-handed
attempt to get America West to call off any possible sales talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a threat,'' he said of his calculations that show the
city has risked $475.5 million in debt to help the airline grow.
</P>
<P>
   Just as airline officials say they have to be faithful to their
stockholders and get top value for their investment, he must show
how the city's investment in America West will help the airline to
grow even bigger if it stays put, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the airport is adding 12 gates to Terminal 4 for
America West expansion. The city is footing $30 million of the $41
million price tag through airport revenue bonds. If the airline
stays and uses the gates, the city's upfront investment will be
paid off over time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if America West leaves or has a reduced presence at Sky
Harbor, the city needs to figure out the best way to avoid losing
money it has poured into the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said the city might want to consider whether it is
necessary to move ahead next month on awarding a bid to expand the
Terminal 4 parking garage. Ultimately, a bigger garage will be
needed, but if America West leaves or is sold, there might not be a
rush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, work will continue on an expansion of 12 America West
gates at Terminal 4. The contracts for that work already have been
signed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said he was doubly surprised because just six days before
the sale or merger news broke, he had met with America West CEO
Richard Goodmanson and C.A. Howlett, vice president of public
affairs, at their request. The pair, he said, were pressing the
city to move even faster on airport expansion plans, such as the
new gates and plans to open a third runway in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza said he met with Slater because he will have a pivotal
role if antitrust concerns arise in any merger or sale.
</P>
<P>
   Slater and FAA chief Jane Garvey were in town for an aviation
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Gov. Jane Hull said her office has been
in contact with America West officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, the governor is not using public pressure to get the
airline to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is an incentive thing, this is business,''
Hull said at a Tempe news conference, noting the airline is not in
financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Francie Noyes, Hull's press secretary, said the governor
would prefer to see the airline stay. &QL;

FREDERICK SOMMER DIES AT 93; WRITER, PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Artist Frederick Sommer died Saturday at his home in
Prescott, Ariz. The widely respected photographer and writer was
93.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, who had lived in Arizona since 1931, was little known in
his home state, but influential elsewhere, from Europe to Japan. He
was the author of books and articles and the subject of even more
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona lost a hidden treasure,'' said Phoenix Art Museum
Director James Ballinger. ``Sommer's photographs have been loved
and respected by artists, collectors and museums internationally
for three or four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   His photographs are in the permanent collections of institutions
that include the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of
Chicago, the International Museum of Photography, the Getty Museum,
the George Eastman House and the Center for Creative Photography at
the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He had his first show at New York's Museum of Modern Art in
1952. His work was the focus of another show, ``The Mistress of
This World Has No Name,'' that visited the Phoenix Art Museum in
1988. A retrospective show was mounted at the Getty Museum in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Of that show, Getty Curator Weston Naef wrote, ``Sommer's style
developed in a near vacuum, but it was guided by some classic rules
of art _ severity, logic, balance _ which he applied to his
photography.''
</P>
<P>
   His photographic archives will be placed at the Center for
Creative Photography; his library will go to the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   He was given Arizona's Governor's Art Award in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He lived with his wife, Frances, in a small, wooden bungalow in
the pines a mile or so from downtown Prescott and continued to
create art until age slowed him down about six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He declined very slowly and very elegantly,'' said Naomi
Lyons, who had been Sommer's assistant since 1985. ``It's really
only in the past 10 days that he had trouble communicating, and in
the last week that he stopped eating and drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Italy in 1905, he grew up in Brazil. In 1925, he came to
the United States, where he earned a degree in landscape
architecture from Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Arizona to recuperate from tuberculosis and, in the
early 1930s, decided to take up photography.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs he made were daring and experimental. He went
against the grain of making pictures of beautiful scenes or items.
He photographed glistening chicken entrails, dead animals turned
into road leather, and saguaro-filled Arizona landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   They do not show the glorious West of Ansel Adams, but the dusty
interminable desert that we all try to avoid with our air
conditioning and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   His photographs and drawings display a wide range of approaches,
from realistic to completely abstract, but all the styles share one
basic quality: They made you take notice and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he experimented with cameraless photography,
creating his own negatives on glass with candle soot, and printing
them out normally.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he had been cutting up and rearranging medical
drawings from Victorian books, inventing new and infinitely odd
physiologies.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer was often called a Surrealist, but unlike most artists so
categorized, he was less interested in the Freudian subconscious
and more in the rational, organizing capacity of the human brain.
</P>
<P>
   His reliance on chance in his art, and his friendship with the
late surrealist painter, Max Ernst, who at one time lived in
Sedona, Ariz., probably have been responsible for Sommer being
labeled a surrealist; but Sommer shows little interest in merely
shocking his public. He was more interested in following his logic
to its end.
</P>
<P>
   His work, more than anything else, hinges on the way the human
mind creates order from its perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw three pebbles on the ground,'' he once said, ``and the
human mind will discover a order in the pattern they create.''
</P>
<P>
   That order, he believed, was art.
</P>
<P>
   His career is summed up in 1984 in the International Center of
Photography's Encyclopedia of Photography: ``Sommer may fairly be
said to represent the ideal of the photographer's photographer.
Neither as well known as many of the other acknowledged masters of
photography, nor as prolific, Sommer is nonetheless considered one
of the very great living photographers.''
</P>
<P>
   Graveside services for Sommer will be held Friday at 3 p.m. at
Mountain View Cemetery, 1051 Willow Creek Road, Prescott. It is
open to the public. &QL;

   PHOENIX - When Karen Williamson delivered twins in November, she
fortified their financial futures with savings accounts and college
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't enough for the Phoenix mom.
</P>
<P>
   So she banked a little of their blood just to ensure their
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn painlessly from their umbilical cords moments after their
Caesarean births, blood from each child was whisked by courier to a
cord blood bank at the University of Arizona campus in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   And, after being processed, it will remain there indefinitely,
preserved in liquid nitrogen at 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit
until one of the twins needs it for a lifesaving cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first gift to them,'' said Williamson, who paid
slightly more for twins than the single banking enrollment fee of
$1,190. ``I just couldn't resist buying them an insurance policy
against the `God forbids' of life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to David T. Harris, who in 1992 established the
laboratory bank now known as Cord Blood Registry, the list of ``God
forbid'' diseases that one day might be conquered with little
Elizabeth and Branch's deposits is growing every day.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cord blood is used to treat about 30 life-threatening
diseases such as leukemia and other cancers, as well as certain
blood and immune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Like bone marrow, cord blood is found to be rich in stem cells,
the building blocks of the blood and immune system. And stem cells
from cord blood have proved to be a viable alternative to bone
marrow transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's now been about 1,500 transplants (with cord blood),
and people are convinced that it's just as good as bone marrow,''
said Harris, a professor of immunology at the University of Arizona
who helped to pioneer the concept of cord blood transportation
after first delving into organ and bone marrow transplanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now I think it's much better than bone marrow in terms of
things it can provide for the patient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that finding a suitable donor through cord blood is
faster and less painful than the bone marrow route, which can
sometimes take months.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly frustrating for ethnic and racial minorities,
who are dramatically underrepresented in donor banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So with cord blood, we see patients go to transplant sooner
and with better outcomes,'' said Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplants also require a closer genetic match than
cord blood. ``In cord blood, we don't have to have a perfect
match,'' he said, ``and it appears to have fewer side effects than
bone marrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The news gets better for Elizabeth and Branch. Cord blood stem
cells from a sibling result in double the survival rate for certain
diseases when compared with treatments using cord blood stem cells
from an unrelated donor.
</P>
<P>
   But only recent research has granted cord blood use the
validation Harris has sought since opening the private, for-profit
bank seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very limited that first year, and we only did about
100,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With financial assistance from San Francisco investors, however,
Harris generated more publicity and opened to the public, banking
close to 400 samples during 1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us more support, because before that, we spent all our
time answering the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 13,000 samples reside in his bank, a direct result of more
acceptance from the field of private physicians who will at least
display his informational pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a 180-degree turnaround,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But although physicians like Ole Georg Torjusen do make
literature on Harris' bank available in their waiting rooms, they
rarely make a sales pitch for banking to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a little careful about that,'' said the Valley
obstetrician-gynecologist. ``But if a mom is high risk, I take the
time to talk to her about it. I think the public awareness of this
is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Mothers-to-be that Torjusen would approach are those with a
family history of leukemia and certain types of cancers and immune
disorders, including sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, approximately 1 to 2 percent of Jordan Perlow's patients
have reserved their babies' cord blood for banking.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't always just for the good of the child, but the
family, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one patient right now, who has yet to deliver, who was
diagnosed with breast cancer while she was pregnant and had a
mastectomy,'' said the Phoenix ara perinatalogist. ``She elected to
bank the stem cells for her future use.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither physician will dismiss the dividends that might one
day come from Harris' bank, now open to private and public
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all is still in the infant stages of development, but
there's enormous potential,'' said Torjusen. ``Within 10 years, who
knows where this will go?''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question in Perlow's mind that the direction will be
gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stem cells are a way to deliver normal genes to people with
abnormal genes,'' Torjusen said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why 91 percent of those who bank with Harris made
deposits strictly for their peace of mind, hedging their bets
against what dividend cord blood samples might pay in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get one shot at this, and I didn't want to miss it,''
reasoned Williamson, who was not considered high risk, except by
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I was over 40 and having twins,'' she said. ``Plus, I was
intrigued by the technology and I thought it was neat that Arizona
had a repository.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, see such banking as unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I can't see the use of individuals doing it
unless they are high risk,'' said Jeff Schriber, director of bone
marrow transplantation at City of Hope-Samaritan Bone Marrow
Transplantation Program. ``Their chances of needing it are
exceedingly small.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Schriber hopes to see the day when umbilical cord blood
will be banked routinely for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd need funding for the registry, but it wouldn't be that
expensive to store,'' he said. ``You'd just need a lot of space.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
CORD-BLOOD TRANSPLANTATION &QL; 
 &QL; 
How the cord blood bank works &QL; 
- Clients should contact the Tucson depository at least several
months before due date. &QL; 
- Enrollment and processing fee is $1,190 and includes a cord blood
collection kit that must be made available to medical personnel at
the time of delivery. &QL; 
- The insulated kit, which includes directions and syringes, is
then used for transporting blood back to the bank by overnight
courier. Transportation fee is extra, generally running less than
$50. &QL; 
- After processing, blood will be preserved with liquid nitrogen
until needed. Yearly storage fee is $95. &QL;

A CARAVAGGIO LEAVES ITS DUBLIN HOME TO VISIT BOSTON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 Ken Shulman writes about art from Boston  
 By KEN SHULMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Since it was rediscovered in the Jesuit Residence in
Dublin in 1990, Caravaggio's ``Taking of Christ'' has left Ireland
only twice. In 1995, the painting spent a month at the National
Gallery in London and two months in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taking of Christ'' was not scheduled to leave Dublin _
where the Jesuit Fathers have left it on indefinite loan at the
National Gallery of Ireland _ for the next 25 years. Yet Monday it
will be on view in Boston, as the centerpiece of ``Saints and
Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' a show of 17th-century
Italian religious art that opens at the McMullen Museum of Art at
Boston College, through May 24. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply a case of one Jesuit institution helping out
another Jesuit institution,'' says Franco Mormando, the director of
``Saints and Sinners'' and a Jesuit priest who teaches art history
at the college. ``There are also long-standing ties between the
Catholic communities of Dublin and Boston, as well as the Jesuits
in those two cities.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Saints and Sinners'' is ostensibly a show about the stylistic
and thematic changes that occurred in Italian religious art
following the Protestant Reformation and the Council of Trent. The
art of this period, which is known traditionally as the Italian
Baroque, is characterized by a heightened sense of drama and
naturalism designed to draw the viewer into the composition.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College exhibition features 30 paintings, including
canvases by Guido Reni, Domenichino, Bernardo Strozzi and Ludovico
Carracci. But the long-lost Dublin Caravaggio _ one of two
Caravaggio compositions in the show, and the only work coming from
outside the United States _ is definitely the show stopper, and its
reason for being. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caravaggio's ``Taking of Christ'' depicts the moment when Jesus
is captured in the Garden of Gethsemane. At the center of the
painting, Jesus and Judas Iscariot lock in an embrace, an instant
after the traitorous apostle has planted what is perhaps the most
famous kiss in Western tradition on the Savior's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The pair is pressed together by a handful of armor-clad guards
come to arrest Jesus. Caravaggio himself is also present in the
drama, a figure on the right-hand edge of the group holding the
lantern that illuminates part of the scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 5{ feet wide by 4 feet high, ``The Taking of
Christ'' was rediscovered in 1990 by Sergio Benedetti, a
conservator at the National Gallery of Ireland whom the Jesuit
Fathers invited to their residence during a renovation. Caravaggio
executed the painting in 1602 on a generous commission from Ciriaco
Mattei, a merchant banker from Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The work hung in the Mattei family palace through 1802, when one
of Mattei's heirs sold it to William Hamilton Nisbet of Scotland.
Somewhere along the way, the attribution was changed from
Caravaggio to Gerrit von Honthorst, a Dutch follower of Caravaggio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, ``The Taking of Christ'' and five other Nesbit
paintings were offered for sale at an Edinburgh auction house. The
lot was withdrawn when bids did not reach the eight-guinea ($50)
minimum estimate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taking of Christ'' entered the Jesuit residence in the
1930s as a gift from a Dublin woman. It was hanging in the library
when Benedetti first saw it. On close inspection, he was stunned by
the quality of the painting and suspected it might be by
Caravaggio. His intuition grew stronger as he restored the painting
over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Benedetti did extensive archival research to
retrace the itinerary of the masterpiece and invited several
leading Caravaggio scholars to authenticate the attribution. All of
them concurred. In 1993, the Dublin Caravaggio was made public. The
exquisite and rare painting _ there are fewer than 60 known
Caravaggios _ made headlines around the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Saints and Sinners'' is not, despite its full title, a show
about Caravaggio. It is an intimate and elastic period show. Too
small to be encyclopedic, it aims instead for effect. Apart from an
economical wall text, the Baroque atmosphere is evoked entirely
through inflection, through the selection and juxtaposition of the
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The show's didacticism is subtle, almost subliminal, a series of
images that re-create some of the sensations _ if not the knowledge
_ of 17th-century Italian spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of the whole world living within a tradition
both classical and Christian,'' says John O'Malley, a professor of
church history, a Jesuit priest and a collaborator on the
exhibition. ``For these people, the past was incredibly vivid and
had an immediate import in the present. For them, the stories of
saints were not mere curiosities. They were relevant to daily life.
This is something most of us in the 20th century seem to have
lost.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following the Protestant Reformation, which began in 1517 with
Martin Luther in Wittenburg, Germany, leaders of the Roman Catholic
Church met in Trent from 1545 through 1563. There the Council of
Trent drafted its strategy for countering the Protestant challenge.
It also discussed long-neglected matters of internal church reform.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the subjects of the council was the use of images in
religious art. The Tridentine document stipulated that ``in the use
of sacred images, all superstition shall be removed, all filthy
quest for gain eliminated, and all lasciviousness avoided.'' In
1564, the year after the council concluded, Pope Pius IV ordered
Daniele da Volterra to paint loincloths over some of the racier
nudes in Michelangelo's ``Last Judgment'' in the Sistine Chapel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the religious art of Baroque Italy, a period historians
chart between 1580 and 1700, is hardly puritan. If anything, it is
more carnal and sensual than the religious art that preceded it.
There may be less nudity than in the paintings of the High
Renaissance, but the figures in Baroque art are usually real
people, with real pain and passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The element of flesh was hardly expunged from Italian
religious art,'' says O'Malley. ``The proscriptions against avarice
and lasciviousness in art that came out of Trent are incredibly
mild when compared with Erasmus' strictures against seductiveness
in churches.
</P>
<P>
   Erasmus educated the rest of Europe to be prudish in this
regard, while Italy pretty much followed its own path. I also think
there was much more of a sense about the goodness of the flesh in
Italy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church had always used painted images as devotional
aids. But the Baroque images represented both a thematic and
stylistic departure from the images that preceded them. Saints
began to be featured in the moments of their martyrdom. Penitence
and conversion paintings became extremely popular.
</P>
<P>
   There was a tremendous resurgence in ``fallible'' saints like
Mary Magdalene and St. Peter. Indeed, an entire section of the
Boston College show is dedicated to them. ``Mary Magdalene and
Peter became popular as penitential icons,'' says Mormando. ``They
were effective role models precisely because they had sinned. They
had failures. They repented. And they were forgiven. In short, they
were human.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This same humanism seeped into the treatment of religious
subjects in Baroque art. Artists working in 17th-century Italy
focused on breaking down the visual barrier that kept viewers from
participating in the drama of their religious subjects. They set
their figures at the forefront of their canvases, and heightened
their already moving scenes with acute effects of light and shade.
It was the 17th-century equivalent of today's hand-held movie
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that Caravaggio did with remarkable power,''
says Pamela Jones, the head of the Department of Art History at the
University of Massachusetts, Boston, and a member of the curatorial
committee for the Boston College show. ``He was acutely aware that
there was going to be somebody there looking at his paintings. It
just makes his art look very different from anything that came
before it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Baroque was an age of paradox. During the Papacy of
Clement VIII (1592-1605), the Pontiff issued a strict edict against
prostitution, and even banned nude swimming in the Tiber. Yet
during those same years, Caravaggio used nude street boys and
prostitutes as models in paintings he then sold to some of the most
refined _ and devout _ connoisseurs in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   It was an age that vacillated ``tra il devoto, et profano'' _
between the sacred and the profane _ as Cardinal Ottavio Paravicino
described the art of Caravaggio in a 1603 letter.
</P>
<P>
   This friction animated Baroque art, which in turn injected new
vitality into a church still smarting from the blow of the
Reformation. ``One could even argue that this art speaks toward a
new legitimization of Catholicism, and of the Catholic Church,''
says O'Malley. ``Toward the validity of sacrament and of
confession. For Lutherans and Calvinists, once you're saved, you're
saved. Sinning and getting up again is very Catholic.''

FOR STUDIOS, `DIRECTOR' IS A MALE NOUN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Nancy Hass, who teaches journalism at New York University, is a
frequent contributor to Arts and Leisure  
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Hollywood studios announced their 1998 grosses earlier
this month, women there raised a quiet cheer. Both Mimi Leder
(``Deep Impact'') and Betty Thomas (``Dr. Dolittle'') had made
films that earned more than $150 million domestically. It was the
first time ever that two female directors had simultaneously
surpassed the magic $100 million mark that certifies a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   But another set of numbers, released a few months earlier, made
the triumph ring a little hollow. A study by the Directors Guild of
America showed that in the year that both Ms. Thomas and Ms.
Leder's films were being made, the overall number of women employed
on studio projects declined dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Female directors worked fewer than 5 percent of the total days
guild members spent on theatrical films in 1997. That represented
an almost 50 percent decline from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Directing is the final frontier,'' said the producer Gale Ann
Hurd, who was involved with ``The Terminator'' and ``Armageddon''
and who knows a bit about the perils of breaking into a male
bastion. ``It's the one area where women have made no real
inroads.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while the 1980s saw dramatic gains _ the number of
women directing studio releases rose from zero to 7 percent or 8
percent of the total _ those figures have remained flat through the
1990s. The female membership of the guild has grown to about 2,000
of the 11,000 total, but no more than 10 percent of the major
feature films made in any year have been directed by women.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has the business perplexed. ``It's like the myth
of Sisyphus,'' said the producer Lynda Obst, a longtime power in
Hollywood. ``It makes very little sense and causes a huge amount of
frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s it was assumed that the root of the problem was
that there still weren't enough women making hiring decisions. With
more women in control, the logic went, the Hollywood hierarchy
would come to understand that many women possessed the talents of a
good director _ juggling multiple tasks, getting diverse
personalities to cooperate, delegating authority.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not worked out that way. In the past decade, the
number of women in top decision-making roles has escalted. Not only
is the Paramount chairwoman, Sherry Lansing, one of the most
powerful people in Hollywood, but in 1996, Lucy Fisher also became
co-chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star's motion picture group. Amy
Pascal is now president of Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a group of independent producers with as much
clout as their male counterparts, including Ms. Hurd, Ms. Obst,
Lauren Shuler Donner (``Bulworth,'' ``You've Got Mail''), Kathleen
Kennedy (``Jurassic Park,'' ``Schindler's List'') and Denise DiNovi
(``Practical Magic'').
</P>
<P>
   But no new generation of female directors has taken root at the
studio level. Even though directing programs at film schools have
been 60 percent female for years now, there are still only a
handful of women making big films. Most important, the few women
who do break through seem to fade away much faster than their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Hollywood can say definitively why female directors
have barely a toehold in studio films. Among the reasons cited are
deeply embedded sexism, fearful executives under intense financial
pressure, and a lack of interest from female directors themselves
in the sorts of films that are available.
</P>
<P>
   And while there's little consensus on the underlying causes, one
thing is sure: in an industry more comfortable discussing
box-office results than debating gender and culture, the dearth of
women directors is a subject most people _ certainly most male film
executives _ would prefer to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no smoking gun,'' said Chris Lee, who until recently
was head of production for Columbia Pictures. Many women directors
are equally uneasy with the topic. ``I like to think gender isn't
an issue at all, that it's my talent that has gotten me to this
point,'' said Ms. Leder. ``I know the numbers are really bad, but I
prefer to think that the industry is somehow on some level becoming
less myopic.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Leder, whose career has been aggressively championed by
Steven Spielberg (he hand-picked her to direct her first feature,
the 1997 action movie ``Peacemaker,'' for Dreamworks), such a
measured stance may be wise. But other women say they don't have
the luxury of tact.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Spheeris has found the going rough since ``Wayne's
World'' (1992) made her the first female director of a movie that
earned more than $100 million at the box office. ``For me,'' she
said, ``this is the only issue: how women are treated. It says just
about everything about the way this industry works, what it values.
But no one wants to really face it.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy answer is that the fault lies in the economics of
making movies. In the wake of blockbusters like ``Independence
Day'' and ``Armageddon,'' the conventional wisdom _ though recent
demographic research in the domestic market calls it into question
_ is that male audiences drive movie grosses.
</P>
<P>
   So many executives of both sexes have decided to forego most
mid-sized films and stake their livelihoods on just a few
action-adventures whose budgets regularly top $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   With such films defining the top end of the market, the outlook
for women directors is bleak all the way down the food chain. To
begin with, only two women have ever been hired to make a big
budget action movie: Ms. Leder and Kathryn Bigelow, whose
futuristic ``Strange Days,'' an expensive box office failure in
1995, will be screened on Feb. 7 as part of the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's retrospective of women's films, ``The Feminine Eye.'' And
like Ms. Leder, Ms. Bigelow also had a connection with a powerful
man in the film industry _ she was mentored by and married to the
action director James Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe women aren't typically hired to make action movies
simply because they are women. ``A lot of women just aren't
interested in making movies that involve a lot of flying rocks and
explosions,'' said Ms. Bigelow. In addition, some women, she
conjectured, may not be ``tenacious'' enough to cope with the
enormous pressure that comes with trying to get big-budget projects
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes everything you've got,'' she said. ``Women may just
not be able to wait it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg suggested that the formulaic quality of action films
may not appeal to women. ``You don't need touch, or feel, or taste.
It's very mathematical.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Obst believes women are willing to work less frequently in
order to ``make personal movies. They come to the business more for
reasons of expression than for careerist reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martha Coolidge, who directed ``Valley Girl'' and ``Out to
Sea,'' calls such reasoning ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are women like me who like to work. Period. Sure, we
want to make the films close to our heart. So do guys. But while
you're waiting for that, you want decent work. John Frankenheimer
said to me recently, `You don't learn anything from not directing
movies.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a woman is willing to orchestrate an explosion with the
best of them, she insists, there is little chance she would even be
called to ``take a meeting'' on the project. ``They want you to
have all this experience directing action,'' she said. ``But if
they don't let more women direct action, how will they ever get
experience?''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of experience _ in action genres or in film at all _ hasn't
stood in the way of some young male first-time directors. ``Con
Air'' was directed by Simon West, who was fresh from the music
video scene; Michael Bay, a director of commercials and videos, had
no feature experience when he was given ``Bad Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay went on to direct ``The Rock'' and ``Armageddon.'' The bias,
said Ms. Thomas, goes beyond the practical to the perceptual.
``With budgets that big, there's a feeling out there that it's a
war that you have to win or die,'' she said. ``And in a war, the
director is the head dude. I guess it's harder to imagine the
general as a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But why, then, don't women fare better in so-called women's
pictures? Last year, the only one of several such films to be
directed by a woman was Nora Ephron's ``You've Got Mail.'' The
other big-budget female-oriented features _ ``Stepmom,'' ``Hope
Floats,'' and ``As Good As It Gets'' _ were directed by men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Obst insists she tried ``desperately'' to find a woman to
direct ``Hope Floats,'' but that ``none of them was completely
right,'' so she chose Forest Whitaker, who has, she said, ``the
directing sensibility of a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only genre that women have had much luck in for the
studios is lowbrow comedy. Ms. Thomas, who cut her teeth as a
director on television's ``Hill Street Blues,'' has in the past few
years succeeded with ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``The Brady Bunch'' and
``Private Parts.'' Ms. Spheeris followed ``Wayne's World'' with
``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   But both women say they took those projects mainly as
springboards to better films. After ``The Brady Bunch,'' in 1995,
Ms. Thomas said she ``got nothing but offers for things like `The
Love Boat'.'' Now, after three huge commercial hits, she has been
asked to direct ``28 Days'' a ``rehab comedy,'' with Sandra
Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ms. Thomas started her own production company, Tall
Trees. She is developing a movie about Evel Knievel and a remake of
``Valley of the Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spheeris, who is a highly respected documentarian (``The
Decline of Western Civilization''), has had even less luck. After
the unexpected success of ``Wayne's World,'' she felt confident she
would get a chance to direct the next script she was up for, ``Leap
of Faith,'' about a traveling evangelist played by Steve Martin,
for Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I was basically out of my mind,'' she recalled.
Instead, she was offered juvenile comedies like ``George of the
Jungle'' and ``Curious George.'' Executives wouldn't even invite
her to meet about more substantial movies, she said, even though
her documentaries are about the underbelly of rock and her earlier
work includes some edgy, youth-oriented dramas like ``The Boys Next
Door.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she took ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' even though
she felt the project was doomed. ``Having lived in poverty for 45
years, I did it for the $1 million. But I would have taken a better
job for a fraction of that. I never got the chance.''

 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the little-known Mercury Gallery in Boston, a mostly
forgotten group of American artists from the 1930s is the focus of
an exhibition that also turns attention to the group's sole
surviving member, a very fine painter named Joseph Solman. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Having just turned 90 last week, Solman, you should be glad to
know, is still painting in his cluttered studio above the Second
Avenue Deli in the East Village of Manhattan, where he has worked
more or less since Jackson Pollock was a new name on the American
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The show in Boston (through February) is about the Ten, as the
group chose to call itself, somewhat eccentrically, considering
that there were only nine of them in the beginning. (The numbers
changed over the years.) Solman was the youngest member and became
something of a ringleader. He was a Works Progress Administration
artist, and an editor, with Meyer Schapiro and Harold Rosenberg, of
the progressive Art Front magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten also included Mark Rothko, who was still calling himself
Rothkowitz at the time, and Adolph Gottlieb. ``Rothko was a big
talker and Adolph's Svengali,'' Solman recalled recently. ``I
almost think Rothko convinced him to go Surrealist. I'd loved
Gottlieb's earlier work, which was wry and had an awfully nice
paint quality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other artists who belonged to the group are familiar
today only to specialists or to an aging generation of art lovers
with very long memories. Do the names Lee Gatch, Karl Knaths and
Ben-Zion ring any bells? At one time they were well known _ Gatch
was twice in the Venice Biennale and for a while, in the 50s, was
so much in demand that collectors bought his pictures before they
were painted. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  During the 1930s, along with Rothko, Solman and the others,
these artists had united as the Ten in opposition to what was then
the American art establishment, meaning above all (what else?) the
Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   Conforming neither to the American Scene painting of Grant Wood
and Thomas Hart Benton nor to Social Realism, they generally found
themselves excluded from the Whitney's surveys of new American art.
So, like many ambitious young artists before them and since, they
organized their own exhibitions, issued decrees (``the symbol of
the silo is in ascendancy,'' they railed against Wood, Benton and
company in their ``Whitney Dissenters' Manifesto,'' which Rothko
wrote), until they finally achieved recognition and were able to go
their own ways. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  As the show in Boston proves, they had never really shared a
common style, just a common enemy, so their breakup was essentially
predestined.
</P>
<P>
   Their works were linked only by a general regard for European
modernism, which was enough to distinguish them from the American
mainstream and to make them seem virtual radicals at the time. It's
easy to forget that the Museum of Modern Art was still new then. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Even its opening show of Seurat, Gauguin, van Gogh and Cezanne
_ all long dead at that point _ had come as a revelation to many
Americans, including some of the Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' Solman remembers. Tartly opinionated but
generous and essentially optimistic, he happens to have one of
those infallible memories that allow him to remember exhibitions
that took place 70 years ago, not to mention almost every other
event in his life.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Jamaica, Queens. His father was a tailor. For $10
per term, he got an art education at the National Academy of
Design, but he likes to say that he learned more by sketching
people on the subway. He still rides buses around town, making the
rounds of galleries, sketching along the way.
</P>
<P>
   His shows were steadily reviewed over the years; Art News
published ``Solman Paints a Picture'' in 1951 as part of its famous
series, and he acquired a good deal of respect among other
painters. But for a long time, like most artists, he wasn't making
a lot of money from his art. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  So to make ends meet he taught and also worked half of each
year as a parimutuel clerk at Aqueduct and Belmont. That job, he
points out, always impressed his son more than the fact that his
artist friends included people like de Kooning and Milton Avery,
because he was able to bring home autographs of Brooklyn Dodgers
who had placed bets at his window. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In 1964, when he showed some of the gouache portraits that he
painted while commuting to the track, The New York Times called him
a ``parimutuel Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   He started out by looking at Rembrandt and Rouault and painting
pictures so murky that he says even he couldn't make them out. Then
his taste, and palette, changed. He looked at Klee and Morandi. He
painted still-lifes and city scenes, with an inclination toward
urban clutter, jauntily drawn. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  He became a distinctive and subtle colorist, particularly when
he turned to portraiture, which, bucking fashion, he did
increasingly after the 1940s. There was something of Modigliani and
also something of Daumier about his portraits. They looked both
lean and expressive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Daumier I consider part of my lineage. Klee is my favorite.
But Cezanne is the most important in the end because he taught
humility through his persistent attempt to climb the mountain of
realism, whether he was painting landscapes or people. Over all
these years, I've never felt the need to go entirely abstract
because there are just too many things in the world, too many
faces, that I want to paint.''
</P>
<P>
   So with Solman, in other words, we are dealing with someone for
whom the mid-century debates over pure abstraction are still fresh.
That period was a turning point for all American artists, but,
having been on the cutting edge during the 1930s, he found himself
facing a particular paradox. He and the Ten had prepared the way
for precisely the changes that took place in American art by
promoting European modernism and adapting it to an American
situation; now the new American art, Abstract Expressionism, had
replaced Scene painting as the establishment style, with Solman
once again on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   He seems without rancor, however. ``Listen, I've seen so many
movements come and go. I wasn't impressed with Gottlieb going off
in that direction and I didn't understand Rothko at first, although
now I love his work. I think Rothko's art has a wonderful glow, a
mystical quality. On the other hand, I'm not a fan of Pollock.
There was a lot of gimmicky stuff going on, a lot of people jumping
on the bandwagon. They wanted to forget Social Realism, but I
wasn't connected to that anyway. It had always seemed to me like
poor art for poor people, as Gorky said. The important point is
that I was already a modern in 1935. I was addicted to the
two-dimensional flat surface, which is the hallmark of the modern
to me, as opposed to illusionistic space. And I was satisfied with
what I was doing, so I didn't need new credos like pure
abstraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Put differently, Solman continued to see himself as a craftsman,
an artist grounded in tradition and experience, painting modern
pictures, while the Abstract Expressionists went off in their
direction, taking American art history with them.
</P>
<P>
   What, we might ask, is the value of constancy or the cost of
fashion? We can of course appreciate art without regard to the
judgments of history, which has its own shifting standard. Solman
is in many ways a paradigm of the American artist, which is not to
say the American art star, during this fickle century.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors now steadily buy his works for good money and, like
many artists who can afford to do so, he has even been buying back
some of his old pictures, which he sold years ago for a song. He
exhibits regularly.
</P>
<P>
   His gallery in Washington, Robert Brown, is showing (through
February) a small retrospective of gouaches from the 30s and some
of his latest paintings, to celebrate his 90th birthday. And the
Eleonore Austerer Gallery in San Francisco, also through February,
has various monotypes and paintings on view.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years he has been mostly drawing
skyscrapers, turning their stepped-back silhouettes into jagged
shapes flanking lighter, narrow passages. ``What intrigues me is
the space and color of the sky between the buildings, which I see
when I ride the bus around twilight.''
</P>
<P>
   These are near-abstract images, although not really much more
abstract than his work from the 30s, in which he reduced the city
to similar zigzag forms, idiosyncratically disposed.
</P>
<P>
   He remains, in other words, a modernist enthusiastically
tethered to the world around him. ``As I've said before, subject
matter yields more poetry and drama and abstract tension than any
shapes we can make up.'' Productive after seven decades, he's a
prime example of the lifeblood of American art.

AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, PAINTING WITH A SAXOPHONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note sub slugline for JAZZ-MUSICIANS-ABROAD)  
 (af)  
 Adam Shatz is an arts journalist in New York  
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the be-bop era, jazz musicians seeking a better life have
landed with their suitcases on the shores of Europe. In cities like
Paris, Stockholm and Berlin, they have found steady work, low
rents, congenial audiences and a more hospitable racial climate.
But for all its attractions, living abroad has seldom advanced the
art itself.
</P>
<P>
   The music Dexter Gordon and Bud Powell made while living in
Paris, for instance, pales in comparison to their best American
work. Why? One argument is that foreign audiences rarely challenge
jazz musicians to push beyond what they already know.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that jazz can only evolve on American soil or,
rather, pavement. Cut jazz off from urban America, with its racing
nervous system and Afro-Latin rhythms, and it wilts.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lacy, a soprano saxophonist and native New Yorker who has
been living in Paris for 30 years, is an exception. Like the writer
Paul Bowles, Lacy has been nourished by exile; he has made it his
muse and, at times, his subject. He is an urban nomad in search of
routes rather than roots.
</P>
<P>
   Being an expatriate has diminished Lacy's influence on young
soprano players, who are more likely to invoke John Coltrane and
Wayne Shorter. But it has also kept him at a healthy remove from
the rancorous disputes over the direction of jazz that have divided
American musicians since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At 64, he has amassed a remarkable body of work, and he shows no
signs of slowing down, with two new albums: ``Sands,'' a solo
recording released last summer, and ``The Cry,'' a two-CD song
cycle to appear in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy left the United States in 1968 when he could no longer
support himself by playing. Already a well-regarded free jazz
musician and interpreter of Thelonious Monk, his mentor in the late
50s, Lacy soon became a prominent participant in the heady European
experimental music scene of the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   He performed with groups like Musica Elettronica Viva (a
new-music collective that included the American composer Frederic
Rzewski), staged musical protests against the Vietnam War and began
giving solo concerts, a radical proposition at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lacy has distinguished himself as a composer of
urbane, lyrical art music in which post-bop jazz and European
modernism commingle. On paper this calls to mind the bungled
attempts of the 50s at a ``third stream'' fusion of jazz and
classical music; fortunately, Lacy is both too idiosyncratic and
too laid-back for such impersonal formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not recorded for a major label since the late
80s (after six fine albums, Lacy was dropped by RCA Novus in a
purge of jazz modernists that included the saxophonist Henry
Threadgill), he has not lacked for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   A MacArthur ``genius,'' he has composed music for the French
Bicentennial celebration on an official commission and he has
written for the Kronos Quartet. With the bassist Jean-Jacques
Avenal and the drummer Jon Betsch, he leads one of the finest
working trios in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdly beautiful, buglelike tone of his soprano has grown
so lucid that he might as well be writing or painting with sound.
In a sense, he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 75 percent of what I write is inspired by literature and
painting,'' Lacy said during an interview last fall at the Museum
of Modern Art, where he had come to see the Jackson Pollock
retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 60s, when he began writing for his collaborator
and wife, the Swiss vocalist Irene Aebi, he has set to music poems
by Samuel Beckett, Osip Mandelstam and Robert Creeley, among
others. Even when he's not writing vocal music, he often has a
specific text in mind.
</P>
<P>
   From painters, he explained: ``I've learned how to improvise,
how to let things emerge from play. The last time I walked into the
permanent collection at MOMA, there were four Kandinskys from 1909
that I'd never seen before. They were pure improvisations.''
</P>
<P>
   To discuss music with Lacy is to invite a swirl of references to
other artists, including Paul Klee and Duke Ellington, Bach and
Merce Cunningham, Brion Gysin and Bob Thompson. It's his way of
crediting his sources, while also defining the context in which he
feels his work ought to be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy's outlook was formed by the New York bohemian scene of the
late 50s. In his youth, jazz musicians, action painters and beat
poets caroused at clubs like the Five Spot and saw one another's
work as part of the same revolution of the imagination. If you
didn't think that art could change the world, you had no business
calling yourself an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy has remained true to this heroic credo, which gives him and
his music a sweetly nostalgic air. A tall, graceful hipster with a
taste for loose-fitting, modish suits, he shapes his sentences,
like his improvisations, unhurriedly, with a sense of surprise and
pleasure over how they turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his tunes _ he has written several hundred _ are
portraits of his favorite musicians, writers and painters (often
personal friends), including Stravinsky, Max Roach, Jimi Hendrix
and Kenneth Noland. (Their pictures appear at the bottom of his
beautifully drawn charts.) It's tempting to see these homages as
Lacy's effort to create an imaginary republic of like-minded
artists _ a home for an expatriate.
</P>
<P>
   The themes of place, belonging and identity are at the heart of
Lacy's most recent records. ``Sands,'' which is named after a
Beckett poem, is a stark, elegiac meditation on the performer's
Jewish identity or, more precisely, his disconnection from it. (His
name was Lackritz until 1952 when he was, as he puts it,
``christened'' Lacy by his boss, the band leader Rex Stewart.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When John Zorn invited him to record ``Sands'' for his Radical
Jewish Culture Series, Lacy composed a companion piece to George
Perec's essay, ``Ellis Island,'' in which the French novelist
characterized his Jewishness as ``a question, a throwing into
question, a floating, an anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy, who calls himself a ``Jewgitive,'' said: ``Perec talks
about this break, this feeling of having no continuity with your
parents' history. It's like somebody put a suit on you that you
didn't buy, and it's not your style. I had to find my own style,
and I found it in jazz and the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Where some Jewish jazz musicians infuse their work with Yiddish
accents that all but disappeared several generations ago, Lacy
rejects such sentimental acts of ethnic recovery. On ``Sands'' he
wrestles with the question of his identity against a void, denying
himself the consolations of a rhythm section.
</P>
<P>
   (On two of the tracks, Lacy plays his instrument into a piano
with his foot on the sustaining pedal, producing a richly baleful
echo.) And while the plaintive mood of ``Sands'' may carry faint
echoes of the shtetl, it has far more in common with the stately
red-and-white canvas on the album's cover by Mark Rothko, like Lacy
a deracinated Jewish modernist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cry'' is also haunted by a powerful sense of displacement,
only here it is cruelly literal. In the Sept. 12, 1994, issue of
The New Yorker, Lacy read a poem called ``Happy Marriage'' by the
Bangladeshi feminist Taslima Nasrin, who had been placed under a
fatwa for her criticisms of the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   (On a recent return to Bangladesh to take care of her ailing
mother, Ms. Nasrin had to go into hiding, where she remains.) The
poem begins, ``My life/like a sandbar, has been taken over by a
monster of a man'' and grows even bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy recalled: `I experienced a kind of shock, and nearly all my
work begins with a shock, something that moves or upsets me. Irene
had been interested in finding some mature women's poems, and she
asked me to set `Happy Marriage' to music. I said, `How can you
sing this? It's too strong!' But then I sat down at the piano, and
it started going by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, while living in Berlin as a guest of the German
government, Lacy and Ms. Aebi discovered that Ms. Nasrin occupied
an apartment just a few floors above them. They became friends.
``Taslima showed us more of her poems,'' said Lacy, ``and Irene
said, `Let's make an opera.' I called it `The Cry' because it was a
cry from a woman, a cry of oppression, of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy's 40-page score for ``The Cry,'' which he calls a ``jam
opera'' because it involves extensive improvisation, is written for
an unusual ensemble of harpsichord, accordion, bass, percussion,
two reeds and voice. The music swings, but the seductive, vaguely
menacing sonorities are classical ones, inviting comparison with
cabaret-influenced chamber pieces like Pierre Boulez's ``Marteau
Sans Maitre.''
</P>
<P>
   The original idea was to have Ms. Nasrin reciting on stage, but
tensions broke out between her and Ms. Aebi, the vocalist. (``It
was like having two queens on stage,'' Lacy recalled, chuckling.
The women have since made up.) Without Ms. Nasrin, ``The Cry'' is a
vehicle for Ms. Aebi, whose heavily accented, rather muffled
delivery is not to everyone's liking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Ms. Aebi sings Ms. Nasrin's acid protest against
patriarchy, there's no denying her commitment to the material or
her acute understanding of it.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy hopes to bring ``The Cry'' to the Brooklyn Academy of Music
or Merkin Concert Hall sometime next year. He and Ms. Aebi are also
considering moving to New York once their lease runs out in 2000.
``Nothing's happening in Paris except soccer,'' he grumbled.
``Soccer is happening; soccer is solid. But that's it, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, meanwhile, is beginning to look more promising to
Lacy. ``Ten years ago, it looked like the giants were dead, and the
midgets had taken over,'' he said. ``Now I'm more optimistic. I
admire what Dave Douglas is doing, and I've begun to play with
Danilo Perez, who really understands my tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lacy has no immediate plans to return home. ``Everything
I've done, I've done because I've heard the call,'' he said. ``When
I first heard Sidney Bechet, it was a call. It's my own voice
calling me, the call that led to my calling. So I'll know when it's
time to go back.'' Until then, he said, he will remain ``an
unassimilated American in Paris.''

AN ORIGINAL AT EASE IN THE STUDIO SYSTEM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By LAURA WINTERS  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Fischer, 15, the protagonist of Wes Anderson's comedy
``Rushmore,'' is hardly your typical teen. A dapper, bespectacled
young man, Max (the newcomer Jason Schwartzman) is fanatically
devoted to his prep school, Rushmore Academy.
</P>
<P>
   President of most of the school's extracurricular activities, he
is failing his classes but nonetheless plans to apply to Oxford and
the Sorbonne.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Anderson, 29, the director of ``Rushmore,'' which opens on
Friday, is as singular a personality as Max, his comic creation.
Where Max is flamboyant, however, Anderson is quiet. Underneath
this reticence, though, lurks a gentle fierceness that has enabled
him to make two thoroughly offbeat films within the Hollywood
studio system.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wrote both ``Rushmore'' and his first movie, ``Bottle
Rocket,'' with his friend, and fellow Texan, Owen Wilson. ``Bottle
Rocket,'' a story of three earnest would-be criminals, launched
Anderson's directing career in 1996, as well as the acting careers
of Wilson and his brother Luke. The three friends and collaborators
share a house on the outskirts of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' features Bill Murray in an indelible turn as an
unhappy tycoon, Blume, who befriends Max and then competes with him
for the affections of a teacher (Olivia Williams). The film has
already proved a surprise hit at several festivals, including
Toronto and New York last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes has his own peculiar voice and vision,'' said the director
Peter Bogdanovich, who introduced the film at the Telluride Film
Festival. ``His films have such a hilarious point of view about the
idiocies of men, and yet they're done so straight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Anderson is polite yet wary, dressed in a pair of
brown corduroy pants and sporting glasses and red New Balance
sneakers. ``Whenever people describe me in print, they always say
that I'm 6-foot-1 and something like 112 pounds,'' he said over a
glass of iced tea in one of his favorite New York spots, the parlor
of the Inn at Irving Place. ``They make me out to be a total rail _
which I am, but I hate reading my weight in articles.''
</P>
<P>
   To go with his bookish appearance, he has an old-fashioned
literary sensibility. His enthusiasms run from the films of Ernst
Lubitsch and Elia Kazan to the writings of E.B. White. But he has a
pop sensibility as well, which shows up in ``Rushmore's'' many
small, telling details _ Blume's Budweiser swim trunks, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Wilson met in a playwrighting class at the
University of Texas at Austin. Their affinity _ besides being the
middle sons of ad executives _ springs from an interest in
questions of friendship and a generosity of spirit
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of cruelty or meanness to the stuff we like,''
Wilson said. ``We're interested in characters who have
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   They create a fablelike universe, although the acting is
realistic. ``We wanted to have `Rushmore' become its own slightly
heightened reality, like a Roald Dahl children's book,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both agree that Max embodies elements of each of them. Wilson
was expelled from his prep school in 10th grade, while Anderson was
avowedly not a strong student but, like Max, cast his sights high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one day while we were working on `Rushmore,' I told
Wes that Max was a lot like him,'' recalled Wilson, laughing. ``Wes
didn't think so. And I said, `Wes, we were at UT together and you'd
had a horrible freshman year and you told me you were planning to
transfer. I asked where and you said, `Yale.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though he never made it to Yale, Anderson's quiet determination
has enabled him to get places as a director. After ``Bottle
Rocket'' came out, he and Wilson set about completing the script of
``Rushmore,'' which they had started writing some years before.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, they and the producer Barry Mendel held an auction
for the film rights and struck a deal with Joe Roth, the chairman
of Walt Disney Studios, who offered them a $10 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Murray agreed to play the part of Herman Blume, and
Anderson even managed to obtain St. John's, his Houston high
school, as the setting for ``Rushmore.'' But despite an extensive
search, he hadn't found the right Max.
</P>
<P>
   In October, 1997, roughly a month before shooting was to begin,
a casting director met Jason Schwartzman, 17, at a party.
Schwartzman, a musician whose mother is Talia Shire and whose uncle
is Francis Ford Coppola, had no previous film experience. When the
casting director told him that the character was short, libidinous,
wrote plays and liked older women, Schwartzman rejoined, `Boy, that
sounds like me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It fell to Anderson to harness Schwartzman's considerable energy
and guide him into carrying the film. ``Wes and I spent weeks
together talking about the character, working on hand gestures and
body language,'' Schwartzman said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Anderson is quiet but a perfectionist. ``He
doesn't play games with his actors,'' mused Ms. Williams, the
British actress who plays the teacher, Miss Cross, in the film.
``He'd come up and say, `The thing you do with your face when you
smile _ don't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though Anderson creates detailed storyboards for each scene, the
shoot had its moments of improvisation. In one scene, Murray was
required to drive a pricey Bentley into the frame and slam on the
brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill drove it like a Camaro,'' Anderson recalled. ``Instead of
backing the car up and flying in again, he went peeling out across
this giant parking lot, skidding around corners, and then as he
came back around he yelled `Roll camera!' and slid into the
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's performance as the humane and deeply conflicted steel
magnate has won him the best supporting actor award from the New
York Film Critics Circle and talk of an Oscar nomination. Anderson
recalls that Murray told him at one point, ``I want to go deeper
with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating, Murray said, ``If you're doing a connect-the-dots
drawing, you can draw a cabin with just a few lines, or you can
draw a very nice cabin with about 30 lines. That's the kind of
cabin I wanted to draw here _ one with lots of lines, lots of
connections between things, places and ideas that were in the
script.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Bill Murray on the campus of his old high school must
have been a sign, for Anderson, of how far he had come. His first
camera was a Super-8 given him by his father. His parents divorced
when he was 8, and his mother, who now works in real estate, became
an archeologist.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Rushmore'' is set at his alma mater, Anderson does
not have much nostalgia for his student days.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson and Wilson graduated from college, they were
already hard at work on the script for ``Bottle Rocket,'' which was
conceived, as Wilson puts it, ``as a `Mean Streets' where the
streets aren't so mean.'' They drummed up enough money to shoot a
13-minute short, and with the help of the writer and producer L.M.
Kit Carson, the short was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   It was eventually sent to Polly Platt, who was working for James
L. Brooks's Sony-based production company, Gracie Films. Ms. Platt
loved the material, and she and Brooks came down to Dallas for a
reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole cast _ director, stars and writers _ were living in
one small space,'' Brooks recalled. ``You'd think it would have
occurred to somebody to read the thing through, but it hadn't. It
went on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks was impressed with the script and its creators and
signed on as executive producer. Anderson and Wilson moved out to
Los Angeles, where they cut and shaped ``Bottle Rocket'' and, in
the fall of 1994, Anderson began to film the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of ``Bottle Rocket'' was both an exhilarating and
a difficult one for Anderson. The film did not do much business,
but it earned good reviews and established his reputation. It also
seems to have clarified for him how to work to protect his vision _
by enlisting high-placed supporters like Brooks and Roth, and by
building a close-knit group of repeat collaborators in front of,
and behind, the camera.
</P>
<P>
   He is already working with Wilson on their next script, an
ensemble comedy that will take place in New York. ``I like the
literary history of this city,'' he said. ``The new movie's about a
family of geniuses that have grown up on the Upper East Side.''
</P>
<P>
   As he moves gradually away from his native ground, it doesn't
seem likely that Anderson will lose the odd mixture of enthusiasm
and discernment that he shares with his characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes is uncompromisable,'' Brooks said. ``To be in the studio
system making personal films is the hardest goal to reach. The
question is `Can these guys be who they are, in pictures today?'
It's great that the answer is `Yes.' ''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
There were times Tuesday night when the Rockets clicked, times the
belated debut was ugly. But coming almost three months late, and so
close to not at all, even those moments could be considered
beautiful.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering everything, the Rockets got all they could ask from
their exhibition exercise and debut of Scottie Pippen against the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich got enough positive signs to know
it can all work as planned, but there were enough ragged moments to
keep up the two-a-day pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also gave away a full house's worth of tickets. And
in their first game following the six-month lockout, they saw
roughly three-fourths of the 16,285 Compaq Center seats claimed.
</P>
<P>
   And they took a 106-104 win that, if nothing else, was better
than losing to the rival Spurs. It wasn't artistic and featured
long stretches of sitting stars. But at least they were sitting for
a reason, as opposed to during the long labor haggling that pushed
back the season's first night to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to play,'' said Rockets forward Charles
Barkley, who had 22 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. ``I was
just glad to be out there. Any time you play an elite team, it's
more than a preseason game. The season starts next Friday (Feb. 5).
There was a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, as plays clicked, the possibilities were obvious, and
the prospects of starting a season with less than two weeks of
training camp seemed less daunting. The opportunities that will
come with the combination of Pippen outside and Hakeem Olajuwon or
Barkley inside flashed the sort of potential that seemed to leap
from Tomjanovich's blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments that went beyond the imagination of
late-night doodling of X's and O's. On one third-quarter
possession, Pippen went up to block a Tim Duncan alley-oop dunk,
setting up Matt Maloney for a 3-pointer. On the next trip down,
Pippen flicked away a David Robinson shot at point-blank range, and
Maloney went down for a jumper and a 75-74 Rockets lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Pippen said. ``We know we have to pick it up.
We made a lot of mistakes. I made lots of turnovers (six). But it
will come in time. I'm still getting used to my teammates and them
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were times the Rockets seemed a step behind in their
half-court offense, almost awkwardly feeling each other out. While
Pippen exerted himself defensively and was all over the glass, he
seemed almost hesitant to take over offensively, seeking his niche
somewhere between playmaker and scorer while still maintaining the
emphasis on Barkley and Olajuwon in the post.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that, Pippen finished with 15 points to go with 11
rebounds and three blocked shots. And though he had just two
assists, he far more often started a succession of passes that led
to open looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good playing with Scottie,'' Barkley said. ``Scottie
played terrific. He moved the ball really well and played great
defensively. He is such a versatile player. I am really glad to be
playing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the ragged stretches, and all the time in which
Olajuwon and David Robinson sat (they combined to play 42 minutes),
with eight minutes left the teams were tied at 88 and shot a
surprisingly high percentage for a game in the middle of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Rockets went with their quickness. Othella
Harrington, too quick for Will Perdue, scored six consecutive
points before Michael Dickerson drove for a layup and a 92-90
Rockets lead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr hit a jumper for the Spurs to tie the score, but
Barkley twice posted up to set up Matt Bullard for 3s and hit a
pair of free throws himself to push the Rockets ahead 100-94.
</P>
<P>
   Having already blown a 17-point first-half lead, the Rockets did
just enough to close out a win. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich almost
seemed to be offering Rockets fans one of the many make-good,
post-lockout promotions. He finished the game with guard Jaren
Jackson, Rockets expatriate Mario Elie and the depths of his bench,
while the Rockets closed with Olajuwon, Barkley and Pippen all on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   They still had to hold their breath _ if anyone cared enough
about such a meaningless exercise as a preseason game to sweat out
the final seconds _ while San Antonio's Malik Rose missed a free
throw with 1.6 seconds to clinch the two-point outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater significance might have been all the details that
offered glimpses of what could be. Rockets point guards Maloney and
Brent Price both showed signs of renewed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Price decided he would serve as Pippen's
Michael Jordan, or at least his John Paxson. Price played nine
second-quarter minutes and tossed in 11 points in the half, nailing
each of his three 3-pointers and driving for another basket. He
even blocked a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt so good to be back, running up and down the court,''
Price said. ``You can play, but there's nothing like the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, meanwhile, made three of four shots in his 24 minutes.
And Bullard, working as usual in the orbit around the inside
threats, also missed just one of four shots to finish with 11
points.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, meanwhile, showed few signs of rookie nerves, scoring
11 points on 5-of-9 shooting in just 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley might have shown the most, offering an explosive
first step rarely seen in last year's troubled, injury-racked
season. He made just four of 12 shots and missed seven of 21 free
throws. But he was too quick for the San Antonio big men and was
the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really impressed with Mr. Barkley coming off the golf
course and playing so many minutes (36),'' Robinson said. ``He
looked real good and took over the game at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Barkley, ``I have a lot to prove to myself. This was a good
starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, any starting point was welcome. This one, however,
was everything the Rockets had reason to hope for, if only because
it offered reason to keep hoping for more.

SENATE URGED TO SUMMON THREE WITNESSES, QUESTION PRESIDENT UNDER
OATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors pleaded with senators Tuesday to
summon three witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial
and, in a surprise move, challenged the Senate to invite the
president to answer questions under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Senators met behind closed doors for three hours Tuesday night
to debate the volatile witness issue, which is set for a vote
Wednesday along with a motion to dismiss the perjury and
obstruction-of-justice charges against Clinton and halt the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioned by Senate Republicans to keep the list of potential
witnesses short, the House prosecutors pressed the Senate for
permission to subpoena former presidential paramour Monica
Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two people who know the most about this are Monica
Lewinsky and President William Jefferson Clinton,'' Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., said. ``We think it is exceedingly important that
.. we have an opportunity for you to examine him and these other
witnesses to get at the truth of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trial, only the second of a president in U.S. history,
nears the end of its third week, the White House scoffed at the
suggestion that Clinton might submit to questioning, even if the
Senate votes to issue an invitation. Under the Constitution, the
president cannot be compelled to appear at his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to wrap this up,'' said presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart. ``No matter how much you slim down the witness list,
there is still going to be delay.''
</P>
<P>
   The perjury and obstruction-of-justice charges against Clinton
are outlined in two articles of impeachment that the
Republican-controlled House approved in party-line votes in
December. The charges grew out of his effort to cover up his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate listened to arguments over the witness issue,
Lewinsky and Clinton left Washington. Lewinsky flew home to
California after three days here to meet with House prosecutors.
Clinton flew to St. Louis to welcome Pope John John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   By Republican estimates, the trial would end, at the earliest,
sometime in mid-February if senators agree to let prosecutors and
the president's defense team interrogate witnesses, even if the
testimony is taken in the form of depositions that later would be
presented to the Senate. With the depositions in-hand, senators
then will decide whether any of the witnesses should appear in
person at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it is terribly critical, not only that we are
permitted to depose these witnesses, but ... that we be permitted
to bring those witnesses here at the end of the day and examine
them and let the president's counsel examine them,'' McCollum told
the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against summoning witnesses, David Kendall, a private
attorney who heads Clinton's defense team, compared the House
prosecutor to a blackjack player betting against long odds. ``Here,
they're simply gambling'' that witnesses will help salvage their
case, Kendall said. ``I think it has no place in the impeachment
trial here when the fate of the president is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said the president's defense team will try to avoid
delaying the trial if the Senate votes to call witnesses or add
other evidence sought by House prosecutors. However, he added: ``In
the event the genie is out of the bottle, we need time, we need
access to defend the president in the way any client ought to be
defended.'' And that, Kendall said, would mean extensive
``discovery'' _ depositions and the gathering of other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with public opinion polls showing support for a quick end
to the trial, Senate Democrats called for rejecting the call for
witnesses and approving the resolution to end the trial Wednesday.
``The time to end the trial is now, and the correct number of
witnesses is zero,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate
unanimously agreed to postpone any decision on witnesses, hoping to
avoid the partisan rancor that marked the House impeachment
hearings and floor debate. Over the past few days, the likelihood
of witnesses became unavoidable as the Senate's partisan lines
began hardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is going the distance,'' said Texas Sen. Phil
Gramm, a Republican who has been pushing colleagues to allow for a
full-blown trial before voting on the articles of impeachment. ``I
believe we'll have witnesses on the floor of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, predicted that the motion to
subpoena witnesses could draw anywhere from 53 to 59 votes.
Fifty-one are needed for the motion to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats concede that the trial likely would go to the
witness phase as sought by the 13 Republican House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on the vote on dismissal and the vote on witnesses, it
sounds like the line is going to be drawn,'' said Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``I think it's going to be
virtually a party-line vote, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial reconvenes at 1 p.m. EST with the Senate
scheduled to vote first on a proposal by Democratic Sen. Robert C.
Byrd of West Virginia to dismiss all charges and bring the trial to
an end. If that fails, as anticipated, senators then will vote on
deposing Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   As explained by Senate aides, if the witness proposal is
approved, senators will have to adopt guidelines for the
depositions. Late Tuesday, one GOP proposal provided for one
Republican and one Democratic senator to attend each deposition and
to serve as a mediator if disputes arise. Only a handful of House
prosecutors and Clinton attorneys would be allowed to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The draft proposal did not deal with anticipated demands from
the White House for time to review documents related to Lewinsky,
Jordan and Blumenthal, evidence that has been kept under wraps by
House Republicans and independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clinton's lawyers said they might need to call their own
witnesses to rebut anything new gleaned from the Lewinsky, Jordan
and Blumenthal depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said the majority leader will
propose time limits on depositions calling for them to be wrapped
up by early next week. Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., has drafted ground
rules for the depositions. Chafee proposed allowing four hours for
questioning each witness _ two hours by prosecutors, two hours by
Clinton's lawyers.

 &HT;    Barbecue fans, change can be good when it means more meat
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAYLOR, Texas _ I figured the reason Louie Mueller Barbeque, in
this Williamson County town 40 miles northeast of downtown Austin,
Texas, kept running out of meat around 1 or 2 in the afternoon was
that management wanted to go home and drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, that wasn't it, and I was projecting my own
no-account, worthless, layabout personality into the situation.
</P>
<P>
   No, the reason Louie Mueller's has had a problem with running
out of meat early is that they don't have enough barbecue pits to
keep up with their business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in May of 1997, this barbecue joint with perhaps the
world's smokiest walls was named one of the top three barbecue
places in the state by Texas Monthly. And they have only two pits
behind the counter. And there's no room to squeeze in another one.
</P>
<P>
   So to fix the problem, Mueller's is making one of a very few
changes in its approximately 55-year-old history by building an
addition _ a 2,400-square-foot screened-in porch dining area and
kitchen with two more pits.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue fans generally tend to develop nervous disorders when
they hear their favorite place is undergoing any change whatsoever.
Introducing a new line of paper towel, for example, can start a
riot. And for good reason. If there's one thing that ruins a
barbecue joint, it's uppity design. A simple rule of thumb: Ferns
and brisket don't mix.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to worry about that in this case.
Construction guy John Hughes of Taylor, who is doing the Louie
Mueller's project, intends to make the new dining area look just as
non-yuppie and comfortably rustic as the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who once attached a crop duster to the roof of his house
in Taylor to make it look like a plane had crashed through it, says
the look for the addition he's shooting for is ``neo-salvage
yard.'' As in the current dining room, all of the furniture in the
addition will be old and used.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is real proud of a piece of furniture he refers to as
``the termite table,'' a plain, wooden kitchen table eaten up by
termites. He found it on a salvage job in East Texas. It's being
used in the Louie Mueller kitchen to store mustard jars.
</P>
<P>
   The slab for the addition was poured Saturday on the west side
of the building, in the parking lot. Hughes hopes to finish the
project by March. Louie Mueller's will stay open during the work.
John Mueller, who owns the place with his dad, Bobby, says it
``won't take long at all'' to get the walls in the new dining room
just as smoke- and grease-covered as the walls in the current
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using the same eyesore motif that we've always had,''
John Mueller promised.
</P>
<P>
   But the old motif comes with new hours. In November, John
Mueller started keeping the place open on weeknights until 8.
Previously, the place closed in the afternoon when the meat ran
out.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller's opened at its current address, at 206 W. Second St.,
in 1959. Before that, it operated out of a tin shed in an alley in
the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The joint is decorated with ancient, non-matching wooden tables.
Pepper sauce jars on the tables serve as toothpick holders. An old,
broken down jukebox sits in a corner. When the screen door slams
behind you, you have been transported back to about 1961. The new
addition will look about the same, if Hughes can help it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my goal is, if people come out here in two years
they'll think this building has been here 50 years, without being a
cliche,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the additional dining area and kitchen is
that John Mueller wants a dining area that is less smoky than the
current one.
</P>
<P>
   The current dining room has virtually no ventilation. Oh, sure,
there are two fans over the front door and a small ventilation fan
on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   But when the wind is blowing from the east, or the place is
closed up for cold weather, when you leave, your clothes are so
smoky that stray dogs will follow you around.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller says the new screened-in porch will ave three fans in
the front and a larger fan in the back to blow the smoke out.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of smoking and no-smoking sections like we have in
Austin restaurants, with the new addition, Louie Mueller's will
offer ``smoky and less smoky,'' John Mueller said.

 &HT;    Turn off telemarketers
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A recent column about telemarketing calls driving
me crazy prompted more telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the callers wanted to know how to stop the unwanted
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have been unable to stop these calls to my house, I
offered no help stopping nuisance calls to someone else's house.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ron Culpepper of the Ohio Consumers' Council said he
could help stop unwelcome telemarketing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper sent me the same information sent to Ohio residents
who want to curb telemarketing calls.
</P>
<P>
   My response to telemarketers has been, ``I'm not in the market.
But thank you, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking around the newspaper office, I found most of my
colleagues respond similarly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, 'I never buy anything over the telephone. Thank you.'
Then I hang up,'' said one colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Another always says, ``No, thank you'' and hangs up.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone knows, these polite
``go-away-and-don't-bother-me-again'' responses are routinely
ignored by persistent telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out there are magic words that must be spoken to
prevent telemarketers from bothering you repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Ohio Consumers' Council, ``If you don't want a
repeat call, be sure to tell the caller to place your name and
number on their 'do not call' list. Your name remains a part of
this list for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the council recommends that persons bothered by
telemarketers call their local phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask to have your name removed from their 'selling' list,'' the
council suggested. Local phone companies often make extra money by
selling their customers' phone number to telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason telemarketers respond to specific, magic words is
because the Telemarketing Sales Rule under the Federal Trade
Commission has established strict guidelines and penalties for both
in-state and out-of-state telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides requiring telemarketers to do as told when someone
instructs them to ``place my name and number on your 'do not call'
list,'' telemarketers also are required to not make sales calls
before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., to not withdraw money from a
person's checking account without permission and to state the name
of their company as well as the product description and cost, among
other requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to abide by these requirements makes telemarketers
subject to a potential $10,000 fine for each violation.
</P>
<P>
   Individual states can impose additional restrictions on
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas now is considering a bill that would allow anyone to sign
up for a single, statewide ``don't call'' list. This would
eliminate the need to tell each individual telemarketer to place
your name and telephone number on the company's ``do not call''
list.
</P>
<P>
   If it passes, telemarketers would be subject to hefty fines from
the Texas Public Utility Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because the nation's seniors are most often victimized by
unscrupulous telemarketers, the American Association of Retired
Persons supports similar bills nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Consumers' Counsel also reports that people can reduce
calls from national companies by as much as 75 percent by
requesting that their names and telephone numbers be placed on ``do
not call'' lists by writing to:
</P>
<P>
   The Telephone Preference Service, Direct Marketing Association,
P.O. Box 9014, Farmington, N.Y. 11735-9014.

   One friend said she already knew all this. There's one in every
crowd.

 &HT;    Harassment? No, they asked for it
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A fifth-grade boy touched a fifth-grade
girl inappropriately, and the nature of his repeated offenses
prompted a student-to-student sexual harassment case now before the
Supreme Court. Has this country gone litigation mad? Or is our
legal cup running over because there's something on this table we
can't see?
</P>
<P>
   Little boys teasing little girls at school is nothing new. But
when teasing turns sexually threatening in nature _ as when a
little boy puts his hands on a little girl's bottom or bosom _ the
girl only should have to tell her teacher to get relief. Typically,
the boy receives appropriate punishment and counseling, depending
on the severity of the offense. If this intervention doesn't end
the matter, suspension or expulsion follows. At least, that's the
common-sense approach schools once applied.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, common sense was absent at the elementary school in
Forsyth, Ga. In December 1992, 10-year-old LaShonda Davis went home
and told her mother that a boy who sat behind her in class had been
``messing'' with her. The mother immediately asked if she had told
her teacher. ``Yes, ma'am.'' The boy, later identified in court
records as ``G.F.,'' had grabbed LaShonda's breast and crotch, made
sexually suggestive remarks and threatened her _ repeatedly.
Despite the mother's and daughter's complaints, his sexually
offensive behavior continued without the school providing LaShonda
with even the minimal protection of moving ``G.F.'' to a different
seat, until three months later.
</P>
<P>
   During the five months that followed the initial complaint,
LaShonda became withdrawn and depressed, unable to study. Her
parents became truly alarmed one night, when her father found a
suicide note she had written. So, in May 1993, they brought charges
against ``G.F.'' When confronted in Monroe County juvenile court,
he didn't deny any of LaShonda's descriptions of his behavior and
pleaded guilty to sexual battery.
</P>
<P>
   The school has no written record of disciplinary action taken
against the boy, no reprimand of the experienced teacher who seemed
to have ignored the matter or censure of the principal who failed
to take steps to end the boy's abusive behavior. The Davises say
their daughter's ordeal changed her from the upbeat child she had
been before the school left her defenseless against her tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, Aurelia Davis filed a suit seeking damages from the
Monroe County Board of Education for ``what the school did for my
child, and that was nothing.'' Her attorneys brought the case to
the high court under Title IX, arguing that school officials did
not act appropriately to protect LaShonda from sexual harassment.
The school board's main defense is that no grounds for the suit
exist, since sexual harassment liability laws covering the
workplace do not cover what happens to children in school.
Requiring a Supreme Court ruling to protect little girls from
little boys in the classroom seems like using a sledgehammer to
kill a gnat; some damage will be done to the surrounding
environment. Still, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg said during the
arguments before the court this week, judging whether the school's
response demonstrated ``deliberate indifference'' may be the main
issue. That focus alone seems to make some sense out of a case that
never should have reached the point of requiring legal intervention
by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't school officials take effective action to stop G.F.'s
harassment of LaShonda? Was race a factor? The little girl is
black. The boy is white, as are the female teacher and the male
principal. Were the parents' repeated complaints and demands for
action to protect their child callously disregarded because, for
some reason, school officials felt no obligation to respond?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court won't deal with such questions, but school
board members should have. Because they didn't, the board deserved
to be sued.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ Take One.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail

<P>
   Q: It was a pleasure to read that President Jimmy Carter is
writing his first novel. The article mentioned that he had written
a number of other books. Can you list the titles, years and
publishers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Carter Center says the former president is the author of
14 books, many of which are now in revised editions. The historical
novel, set in Georgia during the Revolutionary War, will be his
15th. The previous ones:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Not the Best?'' (1975, Brodman Press; 1996, University
Press of Arkansas); ``A Government as Good as Its People'' (1977
and 1996, University Press of Arkansas); ``Keeping Faith: Memoirs
of a President'' (1982, Bantam; 1995, University Press of
Arkansas); ``Negotiation: The Alternative to Hostility'' (1984,
Mercer University Press); ``The Blood of Abraham'' (1985, 1993,
University Press of Arkansas); ``Everything to Gain: Making the
Most of the Rest of Your Life,'' written with Rosalynn Carter
(1987, Random House; 1995, University Press of Arkansas; ``An
Outdoor Journal'' (1988, Bantam; 1994, University Press of
Arkansas); ``Turning Point: A Candidate, a State, and a Nation Come
of Age'' (1992, Times Books); ``Talking Peace: A Vision for the
Next Generation'' (1993 and 1995, Dutton); ``Always a
Reckoning''(1994, Times Books); ``The Little Baby
Snoogle-Fleejer,'' illustrated by Amy Carter (1995, Random House);
``Living Faith'' (1996, Times Books); ``Sources of Strength:
Meditations on Scripture for a Living Faith'' (1997, Times Books);
and ``The Virtues of Aging'' (1998, Ballantine Books).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Iditarod race be run in Alaska this year? It usually
gets a lot of advance publicity, but I haven't heard a peep about
it. How long has it been going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Iditarod Trail Dog Sled Race indeed will be run this
year. It will begin March 6 in Anchorage, in south-central Alaska,
and end about 1,050 miles away, in Nome, on the coast of the Bering
Sea. The race typically takes two-to-three weeks. The modern race
was organized in 1967 in a much shorter form, covering 56 miles. It
evolved in 1973 into the longer version, whose course follows an
old dogsled mail route blazed from Knik to Nome in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to its history, however. The race commemorates an
emergency dog sled run in 1925 that delivered serum when a
diphtheria epidemic threatened Nome. Bad weather in the area kept
airplanes from Fairbanks on the ground, so the serum was taken from
Nenana to Nome, about 675 miles away, by dog sled teams. It reached
the community in 127 1/2 hours. A footnote: Edgar Nollner Sr., 94,
the last survivor of the 1925 dog team relay, died Jan. 18 in the
Yukon River village of Galena.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Postal Service says it didn't raise the price of post
cards, keeping them at 20 cents apiece, but when I bought a packet
of five from a post office vending machine, I had to pay $1.05.
What's the extra nickel for?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cost for post card stamps remains at 20 cents, but as of
Jan. 10 the cost for postal cards indeed has risen by a penny, said
Postal Service spokeswoman Sandra Harding in Washington. So five
post cards, at the new rate of 21 cents apiece, is the $1.05 you
had to pay at the vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that Susan McDougal's prosecution in the
Zubin Mehta case is ``undoubtedly connected to (Kenneth) Starr's
aggressive pursuit of McDougal.'' I thought the Mehta charges had
been initiated before the start of Starr's investigation into
Whitewater and President Clinton. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: McDougal and her supporters claim a connection, but none has
been proved. Your statement about timing is correct. McDougal was
arraigned in Los Angeles in late 1993 on charges of forging nearly
$200,000 in checks in the names of orchestra conductor Mehta and
his wife, Nancy, while McDougal was serving as a personal
bookkeeper for the couple between 1989 and 1992. The arraignment
initially was reported Jan. 6, 1994. Seven months later _ on Aug. 5
_ Starr was appointed by a panel of federal judges as the
independent prosecutor investigating Whitewater, replacing Robert
Fiske. McDougal was acquitted in November.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you print the entire military phonetic alphabet, from
Alpha to Zulu, so we non-military people can use it to eliminate
confusion when talking over the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dictionary of the Modern United States Military lists
this system for the phonetic alphabet, as adopted in 1955: A
(Alpha), B (Bravo), C (Charlie), D (Delta), E (Echo), F (Foxtrot),
G (Golf), H (Hotel), I (India), J (Juliet), K (Kilo), L (Lima), M
(Mike), N (November), O (Oscar), P (Papa), Q (Quebec), R (Romeo), S
(Sierra), T (Tango), U (Uniform), V (Victor), W (Whiskey), X (X
Ray), Y (Yankee) and Z (Zulu).
</P>
<P>
   Before 1955, this was the system, according to the dictionary:
Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King,
Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle,
Victor, William, X Ray, Yoke and Zebra.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen anything lately about the alleged kidnapping
more than a year ago of infant Sabrina Aisenberg in Florida. What's
the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been little to report. The 5-month-old was put to
bed the night of Nov. 23, 1997, according to her parents, Steve and
Marlene Aisenberg of Valrico, Fla., near Tampa; the next morning,
she was gone. Since then, authorities have conducted numerous
interviews and extensive searches, including a 10-mile stretch of
the Alafia River after a tip was received from ``America's Most
Wanted.'' After intense questioning by investigators, the
Aisenbergs hired Tampa defense attorney Barry Cohen and stopped
speaking to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury began hearing testimony last February, and
that's where the case stands. ``It's still a very active
investigation, and the federal grand jury is still in session on
it,'' said Lt. Greg Brown of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's
Department. He said the task force investigating the case has
followed up on more than 1,800 leads in 48 states and three
countries, and has interviewed more than 4,500 people. ``Law
enforcement is still prohibited from discussing anything pertaining
to the night Sabrina disappeared or the Aisenbergs' actions the
night of the disappearance,'' Brown said. ``The parents still have
not been ruled out as suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was really impressed with White House lawyer Cheryl Mills,
who spoke at the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. Can
you print some biographical information about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House press office didn't provide any personal
information, but told Q&AMP;A that Mills, 33, graduated in 1987 from
the University of Virginia with a degree in economics and
philosophy, and in 1990 from Stanford Law School. In her third year
at Stanford, she co-chaired the Third National Conference on Women
of Color and the Law. During law school, she co-founded DC Works,
described by the White House as ``a nonprofit organization devoted
to the academic enrichment and interpersonal development of
underprivileged rising senior high school students of color.'' She
continues to be active in DC Works.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1992, Mills worked in the civil rights and
education litigation department at the Washington law firm Hogan &AMP;
Hartson. In 1992, she joined the Clinton-Gore campaign in Little
Rock, ultimately serving as deputy general counsel of the
Clinton-Gore Transition Planning Foundation. She returned to
Washington in 1993 to serve as associate counsel to the president,
handling ethics issues, D.C. court selections, 25th Amendment
issues, pardons, appropriations matters, travel issues and
congressional investigations. Clinton appointed her in 1997 to be
deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the latest on science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke?
Is he writing any new books?
</P>
<P>
   A: If he is, he seems to be keeping it under wraps. The
British-born author of some 80 works, including ``Childhood's
End,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (written as a screenplay with film
director Stanley Kubrick), ``2010: Odyssey Two,'' ``2061: Odyssey
Three,'' ``3001: The Final Odyssey,'' ``The Ghost From the Grand
Banks,'' ``Rama Revealed'' and ``Richter 10,'' seems to be living
quietly in his adopted home of Sri Lanka. He was in the news most
recently last year when a British tabloid published a report saying
he had sexually abused children, an accusation Clarke denied. Last
June, Sri Lanka's justice minister, Lakshman Peiris, said there
wasn't sufficient evidence to begin prosecution, and the case was
dropped. Clarke, 81, has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone told me we can mail bills with less postage than the
current 33 cents for first class, and they still will be delivered.
Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. When the Postal Service proposed its rate case more than
a year ago, it included a proposal to have a reduced rate for
bills. But that provision wasn't approved by the Board of
Governors, said Sandra Harding, Postal Service spokeswoman in
Washington. So the full first-class postage of 33 cents is required
for bills, just as it is for letters.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've watched Justin Wilson's cooking show on television for
years, but lately have noticed that he seems to have extreme
difficulty maneuvering and walking, and seems to be just going
through the motions of cooking. What's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing other than the normal problems of advancing years,
the Louisiana-born Cajun humorist said. ``I have arthritis, but
otherwise I'm in pretty good shape,'' he told Q&AMP;A. ``I'm 84, and
when you get older, you can't help slowing down. But I'm still
making personal appearances and enjoying myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's first cooking show was filmed in 1970. The likely
reason for what seems to be an abrupt change in his appearance is a
gap of several years between the time he taped his previous series
and the taping of his latest series. The earlier shows have been
repeated on PBS for about five years, so viewers haven't been
seeing anything new in quite some time. His latest series for PBS
is ``Easy Cooking,'' which he tapes in a studio in his Mississippi
home.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he doesn't plan to stop cooking, making jokes or
being on TV anytime soon, although he may quit someday. He
expressed his philosophy this way: ``My motto is, if it ain't no
fun, don't do it.'' And, he adds, he's still having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep hearing the expression ``15 minutes of fame,'' but
don't know its origin. Do you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It appears to have originated in slightly different form. The
Dictionary of Contemporary Quotations attributes it to American pop
artist Andy Warhol (1927-87). The standard version is this: ``In
the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.'' The
artist later wrote: ``I'm bored with that line. I never use it
anymore. My new line is, `In 15 minutes everybody will be
famous.'''
</P>
<P>
   Q: C-SPAN showed the Senate trial of President Clinton late at
night, and on replay. Why wasn't it televised live?
</P>
<P>
   A: Viewers with cable systems that carry C-SPAN2 were able to
see the Senate impeachment trial proceedings live. Those who get
C-SPAN only got live House proceedings. This is the normal routine
for both _ C-SPAN, House; C-SPAN2, Senate _ said C-SPAN spokeswoman
Erika Robinson in Washington. She acknowledged that it was
inconvenient for some people, because cable companies offer C-SPAN2
to fewer households.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When is the annual Westminster Dog Show in New York? For
those who can't attend in person, will it be televised?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dates: Feb. 8-9. The site: Madison Square Garden, New
York. The event will be televised on USA Network, a spokeswoman for
the Westminster Kennel Club said. Dog show fans interested in
attending the prestigious event live should call the Madison Square
Garden box office for ticket information: 212-465-6741. Assigned
seats are $32 daily; general admission is $22.50 daily; a two-day
general admission pass is $42. Ticketmaster also sells tickets,
with a surcharge, and can be accessed at the box office number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you print some biographical information on Morten
Andersen, the Atlanta Falcons kicker who won his team's Jan. 17
game against the Minnesota Vikings by making his sudden-death field
goal attempt?
</P>
<P>
   A: Andersen was born Aug. 19, 1960, in Copenhagen, Denmark, and
along with his twin brother, Jakob, grew up in Struer, a Danish
town of 9,000 residents. Morten came to the United States as a
foreign exchange student. Although his parents had requested a home
in Idaho, Oregon or Washington, the 17-year-old landed instead at
the home of Dale Baker in Indianapolis in August 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer player in Denmark, Andersen didn't know anything about
American football until he went to football practice one day with
one of Baker's sons. Andersen kept kicking field goals through the
uprights until his distance reached 50 yards. After word got out,
coaches came calling. He suited up for Ben Davis High School in
Indianapois and booted five of seven field goals to earn collegiate
offers from Purdue and Michigan State. He chose the latter. A first
team All-America as a senior, Andersen is still the school record
holder at Michigan State for his 63-yarder during his final season.
He set a then-Big 10 Conference record with 45 career field goals
while establishing Spartan school records for
points-after-touchdowns and total points.
</P>
<P>
   His first season as a Falcon was in '95, after 13 brilliant
seasons with the New Orleans Saints, where he set team records of
career points (1,318), field goals (302) and consecutive games
scored in (174). He was signed by the Falcons within 24 hours after
he was released, for salary cap reasons, from the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   In college, Andersen studied communications, marketing, German
and French. He has said he would be a translator if he didn't make
a good living with his foot. Off the field, his varied activities
have included sports analysis for Danish television; acting, with a
bit part in a dinner theater play; and extensive fund-raising for
children's hospitals. He married Jennifer Rich in May 1997. His
twin, by the way, went on to become an exporter in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently that a self-proclaimed white
supremacist, Joseph Paul Franklin, had confessed to shooting
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and others, including Vernon Jordan.
I didn't know Jordan had been shot. When, where, and what were the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: On May 28, 1980, shortly after he addressed the Fort Wayne,
Ind., branch of the Urban League, Jordan was shot in the back and
seriously wounded by a sniper using a high-powered rifle. The
incident occurred in the parking lot of a Marriott hotel. The
bullet lodged dangerously near Jordan's spine, and he spent the
next 98 days recuperating in hospitals in Fort Wayne and New York.
In 1984, Franklin, in an Illinois jail for murder, confessed to
this and numerous other race-related shootings. Jordan recovered
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Chelsea Clinton gone back to California for college after
the year-end holidays, or is she staying close to home during the
president's impeachment proceedings?
</P>
<P>
   A: She has returned to school, said a spokeswoman in the first
lady's press office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about the jet stream? How high is it
above Earth? How wide and thick is it? And does it flow east or
west?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three main jet streams _ polar, subtropical and
equatorial _ in the upper troposphere, the layer of atmosphere
nearest Earth. They occur at altitudes of 6 to 9 miles above the
ground. The fast-moving air currents flow in wavelike fashion
around the northern and southern hemispheres, changing position
constantly and moving both vertically and horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   The core of strongest winds is about 60 miles wide and about 1
mile thick. The length of the core varies greatly, averaging about
3,000 miles. The polar and subtropical streams, which circle the
Earth, flow from west to east, but the equatorial, which occurs
only over Southeast Asia and Africa (and only in the summer), flows
from east to west.
</P>
<P>
   Other jet streams, such as the polar night jet, occur at higher
altitudes. It's in the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer about
the troposphere. It moves in an easterly direction and occurs only
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV report about bad weather at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport claimed it was the busiest in the United
States. I thought Atlanta's Hartsfield International was. Can you
settle it, once and for all?
</P>
<P>
   A: The standard for measuring airport traffic is passenger
arrivals and departures, according to Airports Council
International-North America. The latest year-end statistics, for
1997, list O'Hare with 70,294,501 and Hartsfield with 68,205,769.
But we can't settle it once and for all because passenger
statistics are subject to change, and Hartsfield has, on occasion,
topped O'Hare. So it's not impossible for Hartsfield to become No.
1 at some point.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, these airports rounded out the nation's top 5 in
1997: Dallas-Fort Worth, 60,488,713; Los Angeles, 60,142,588; and
San Francisco, 40,499,947.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard references to Zulu time in military jargon. What
is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a code word used internationally for the time at
Greenwich, England. It's used as a reference standard when in, or
crossing through, other time zones around the world. Almost all
military messages, including Emergency Action Messages, use Zulu
time as their standard of reference. When time is expressed in
Greenwich Mean Time, it's indicated by adding the word ``Zulu'' or
``Z,'' such as 1645 Zulu or 1645 Z.
</P>
<P>
   The military's phonetic alphabet is intended to eliminate
confusion in radio transmissions because some letters sound alike
(V and G, N and M, P and T, B and V, for example).

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've watched Justin Wilson's cooking show on television for
years, but lately have noticed that he seems to have extreme
difficulty maneuvering and walking, and seems to be just going
through the motions of cooking. What's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing other than the normal problems of advancing years,
the Louisiana-born Cajun humorist said. ``I have arthritis, but
otherwise I'm in pretty good shape,'' he told Q&AMP;A. ``I'm 84, and
when you get older, you can't help slowing down. But I'm still
making personal appearances and enjoying myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's first cooking show was filmed in 1970. The likely
reason for what seems to be an abrupt change in his appearance is a
gap of several years between the time he taped his previous series
and the taping of his latest series. The earlier shows have been
repeated on PBS for about five years, so viewers haven't been
seeing anything new in quite some time. His latest series for PBS
is ``Easy Cooking,'' which he tapes in a studio in his Mississippi
home.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he doesn't plan to stop cooking, making jokes or
being on TV anytime soon, although he may quit someday. He
expressed his philosophy this way: ``My motto is, if it ain't no
fun, don't do it.'' And, he adds, he's still having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep hearing the expression ``15 minutes of fame,'' but
don't know its origin. Do you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It appears to have originated in slightly different form. The
Dictionary of Contemporary Quotations attributes it to American pop
artist Andy Warhol (1927-87). The standard version is this: ``In
the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.'' The
artist later wrote: ``I'm bored with that line. I never use it
anymore. My new line is, `In 15 minutes everybody will be
famous.'''
</P>
<P>
   Q: C-SPAN showed the Senate trial of President Clinton late at
night, and on replay. Why wasn't it televised live?
</P>
<P>
   A: Viewers with cable systems that carry C-SPAN2 were able to
see the Senate impeachment trial proceedings live. Those who get
C-SPAN only got live House proceedings. This is the normal routine
for both _ C-SPAN, House; C-SPAN2, Senate _ said C-SPAN spokeswoman
Erika Robinson in Washington. She acknowledged that it was
inconvenient for some people, because cable companies offer C-SPAN2
to fewer households.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When is the annual Westminster Dog Show in New York? For
those who can't attend in person, will it be televised?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dates: Feb. 8-9. The site: Madison Square Garden, New
York. The event will be televised on USA Network, a spokeswoman for
the Westminster Kennel Club said. Dog show fans interested in
attending the prestigious event live should call the Madison Square
Garden box office for ticket information: 212-465-6741. Assigned
seats are $32 daily; general admission is $22.50 daily; a two-day
general admission pass is $42. Ticketmaster also sells tickets,
with a surcharge, and can be accessed at the box office number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you print some biographical information on Morten
Andersen, the Atlanta Falcons kicker who won his team's Jan. 17
game against the Minnesota Vikings by making his sudden-death field
goal attempt?
</P>
<P>
   A: Andersen was born Aug. 19, 1960, in Copenhagen, Denmark, and
along with his twin brother, Jakob, grew up in Struer, a Danish
town of 9,000 residents. Morten came to the United States as a
foreign exchange student. Although his parents had requested a home
in Idaho, Oregon or Washington, the 17-year-old landed instead at
the home of Dale Baker in Indianapolis in August 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer player in Denmark, Andersen didn't know anything about
American football until he went to football practice one day with
one of Baker's sons. Andersen kept kicking field goals through the
uprights until his distance reached 50 yards. After word got out,
coaches came calling. He suited up for Ben Davis High School in
Indianapois and booted five of seven field goals to earn collegiate
offers from Purdue and Michigan State. He chose the latter. A first
team All-America as a senior, Andersen is still the school record
holder at Michigan State for his 63-yarder during his final season.
He set a then-Big 10 Conference record with 45 career field goals
while establishing Spartan school records for
points-after-touchdowns and total points.
</P>
<P>
   His first season as a Falcon was in '95, after 13 brilliant
seasons with the New Orleans Saints, where he set team records of
career points (1,318), field goals (302) and consecutive games
scored in (174). He was signed by the Falcons within 24 hours after
he was released, for salary cap reasons, from the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   In college, Andersen studied communications, marketing, German
and French. He has said he would be a translator if he didn't make
a good living with his foot. Off the field, his varied activities
have included sports analysis for Danish television; acting, with a
bit part in a dinner theater play; and extensive fund-raising for
children's hospitals. He married Jennifer Rich in May 1997. His
twin, by the way, went on to become an exporter in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently that a self-proclaimed white
supremacist, Joseph Paul Franklin, had confessed to shooting
Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and others, including Vernon Jordan.
I didn't know Jordan had been shot. When, where, and what were the
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: On May 28, 1980, shortly after he addressed the Fort Wayne,
Ind., branch of the Urban League, Jordan was shot in the back and
seriously wounded by a sniper using a high-powered rifle. The
incident occurred in the parking lot of a Marriott hotel. The
bullet lodged dangerously near Jordan's spine, and he spent the
next 98 days recuperating in hospitals in Fort Wayne and New York.
In 1984, Franklin, in an Illinois jail for murder, confessed to
this and numerous other race-related shootings. Jordan recovered
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Chelsea Clinton gone back to California for college after
the year-end holidays, or is she staying close to home during the
president's impeachment proceedings?
</P>
<P>
   A: She has returned to school, said a spokeswoman in the first
lady's press office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about the jet stream? How high is it
above Earth? How wide and thick is it? And does it flow east or
west?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three main jet streams _ polar, subtropical and
equatorial _ in the upper troposphere, the layer of atmosphere
nearest Earth. They occur at altitudes of 6 to 9 miles above the
ground. The fast-moving air currents flow in wavelike fashion
around the northern and southern hemispheres, changing position
constantly and moving both vertically and horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   The core of strongest winds is about 60 miles wide and about 1
mile thick. The length of the core varies greatly, averaging about
3,000 miles. The polar and subtropical streams, which circle the
Earth, flow from west to east, but the equatorial, which occurs
only over Southeast Asia and Africa (and only in the summer), flows
from east to west.
</P>
<P>
   Other jet streams, such as the polar night jet, occur at higher
altitudes. It's in the stratosphere, the atmospheric layer about
the troposphere. It moves in an easterly direction and occurs only
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV report about bad weather at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport claimed it was the busiest in the United
States. I thought Atlanta's Hartsfield International was. Can you
settle it, once and for all?
</P>
<P>
   A: The standard for measuring airport traffic is passenger
arrivals and departures, according to Airports Council
International-North America. The latest year-end statistics, for
1997, list O'Hare with 70,294,501 and Hartsfield with 68,205,769.
But we can't settle it once and for all because passenger
statistics are subject to change, and Hartsfield has, on occasion,
topped O'Hare. So it's not impossible for Hartsfield to become No.
1 at some point.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, these airports rouned out the nation's top 5 in
1997: Dallas-Fort Worth, 60,488,713; Los Angeles, 60,142,588; and
San Francisco, 40,499,947.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard references to Zulu time in military jargon. What
is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a code word used internationally for the time at
Greenwich, England. It's used as a reference standard when in, or
crossing through, other time zones around the world. Almost all
military messages, including Emergency Action Messages, use Zulu
time as their standard of reference. When time is expressed in
Greenwich Mean Time, it's indicated by adding the word ``Zulu'' or
``Z,'' such as 1645 Zulu or 1645 Z.
</P>
<P>
   The military's phonetic alphabet is intended to eliminate
confusion in radio transmissions because some letters sound alike
(V and G, N and M, P and T, B and V, for example).

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ Take One.)
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or E-mail

<P>
   Q: It was a pleasure to read that President Jimmy Carter is
writing his first novel. The article mentioned that he had written
a number of other books. Can you list the titles, years and
publishers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Carter Center says the former president is the author of
14 books, many of which are now in revised editions. The historical
novel, set in Georgia during the Revolutionary War, will be his
15th. The previous ones:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Not the Best?'' (1975, Brodman Press; 1996, University
Press of Arkansas); ``A Government as Good as Its People'' (1977
and 1996, University Press of Arkansas); ``Keeping Faith: Memoirs
of a President'' (1982, Bantam; 1995, University Press of
Arkansas); ``Negotiation: The Alternative to Hostility'' (1984,
Mercer University Press); ``The Blood of Abraham'' (1985, 1993,
University Press of Arkansas); ``Everything to Gain: Making the
Most of the Rest of Your Life,'' written with Rosalynn Carter
(1987, Random House; 1995, University Press of Arkansas; ``An
Outdoor Journal'' (1988, Bantam; 1994, University Press of
Arkansas); ``Turning Point: A Candidate, a State, and a Nation Come
of Age'' (1992, Times Books); ``Talking Peace: A Vision for the
Next Generation'' (1993 and 1995, Dutton); ``Always a
Reckoning''(1994, Times Books); ``The Little Baby
Snoogle-Fleejer,'' illustrated by Amy Carter (1995, Random House);
``Living Faith'' (1996, Times Books); ``Sources of Strength:
Meditations on Scripture for a Living Faith'' (1997, Times Books);
and ``The Virtues of Aging'' (1998, Ballantine Books).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the Iditarod race be run in Alaska this year? It usually
gets a lot of advance publicity, but I haven't heard a peep about
it. How long has it been going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Iditarod Trail Dog Sled Race indeed will be run this
year. It will begin March 6 in Anchorage, in south-central Alaska,
and end about 1,050 miles away, in Nome, on the coast of the Bering
Sea. The race typically takes two-to-three weeks. The modern race
was organized in 1967 in a much shorter form, covering 56 miles. It
evolved in 1973 into the longer version, whose course follows an
old dogsled mail route blazed from Knik to Nome in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to its history, however. The race commemorates an
emergency dog sled run in 1925 that delivered serum when a
diphtheria epidemic threatened Nome. Bad weather in the area kept
airplanes from Fairbanks on the ground, so the serum was taken from
Nenana to Nome, about 675 miles away, by dog sled teams. It reached
the community in 127 1/2 hours. A footnote: Edgar Nollner Sr., 94,
the last survivor of the 1925 dog team relay, died Jan. 18 in the
Yukon River village of Galena.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Postal Service says it didn't raise the price of post
cards, keeping them at 20 cents apiece, but when I bought a packet
of five from a post office vending machine, I had to pay $1.05.
What's the extra nickel for?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cost for post card stamps remains at 20 cents, but as of
Jan. 10 the cost for postal cards indeed has risen by a penny, said
Postal Service spokeswoman Sandra Harding in Washington. So five
post cards, at the new rate of 21 cents apiece, is the $1.05 you
had to pay at the vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that Susan McDougal's prosecution in the
Zubin Mehta case is ``undoubtedly connected to (Kenneth) Starr's
aggressive pursuit of McDougal.'' I thought the Mehta charges had
been initiated before the start of Starr's investigation into
Whitewater and President Clinton. Am I correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: McDougal and her supporters claim a connection, but none has
been proved. Your statement about timing is correct. McDougal was
arraigned in Los Angeles in late 1993 on charges of forging nearly
$200,000 in checks in the names of orchestra conductor Mehta and
his wife, Nancy, while McDougal was serving as a personal
bookkeeper for the couple between 1989 and 1992. The arraignment
initially was reported Jan. 6, 1994. Seven months later _ on Aug. 5
_ Starr was appointed by a panel of federal judges as the
independent prosecutor investigating Whitewater, replacing Robert
Fiske. McDougal was acquitted in November.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you print the entire military phonetic alphabet, from
Alpha to Zulu, so we non-military people can use it to eliminate
confusion when talking over the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dictionary of the Modern United States Military lists
this system for the phonetic alphabet, as adopted in 1955: A
(Alpha), B (Bravo), C (Charlie), D (Delta), E (Echo), F (Foxtrot),
G (Golf), H (Hotel), I (India), J (Juliet), K (Kilo), L (Lima), M
(Mike), N (November), O (Oscar), P (Papa), Q (Quebec), R (Romeo), S
(Sierra), T (Tango), U (Uniform), V (Victor), W (Whiskey), X (X
Ray), Y (Yankee) and Z (Zulu).
</P>
<P>
   Before 1955, this was the system, according to the dictionary:
Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King,
Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle,
Victor, William, X Ray, Yoke and Zebra.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen anything lately about the alleged kidnapping
more than a year ago of infant Sabrina Aisenberg in Florida. What's
the status?
</P>
<P>
   A: There has been little to report. The 5-month-old was put to
bed the night of Nov. 23, 1997, according to her parents, Steve and
Marlene Aisenberg of Valrico, Fla., near Tampa; the next morning,
she was gone. Since then, authorities have conducted numerous
interviews and extensive searches, including a 10-mile stretch of
the Alafia River after a tip was received from ``America's Most
Wanted.'' After intense questioning by investigators, the
Aisenbergs hired Tampa defense attorney Barry Cohen and stopped
speaking to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury began hearing testimony last February, and
that's where the case stands. ``It's still a very active
investigation, and the federal grand jury is still in session on
it,'' said Lt. Greg Brown of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's
Department. He said the task force investigating the case has
followed up on more than 1,800 leads in 48 states and three
countries, and has interviewed more than 4,500 people. ``Law
enforcement is still prohibited from discussing anything pertaining
to the night Sabrina disappeared or the Aisenbergs' actions the
night of the disappearance,'' Brown said. ``The parents still have
not been ruled out as suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was really impressed with White House lawyer Cheryl Mills,
who spoke at the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. Can
you print some biographical information about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House press office didn't provide any personal
information, but told Q&AMP;A that Mills, 33, graduated in 1987 from
the University of Virginia with a degree in economics and
philosophy, and in 1990 from Stanford Law School. In her third year
at Stanford, she co-chaired the Third National Conference on Women
of Color and the Law. During law school, she co-founded DC Works,
described by the White House as ``a nonprofit organization devoted
to the academic enrichment and interpersonal development of
underprivileged rising senior high school students of color.'' She
continues to be active in DC Works.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1992, Mills worked in the civil rights and
education litigation department at the Washington law firm Hogan &AMP;
Hartson. In 1992, she joined the Clinton-Gore campaign in Little
Rock, ultimately serving as deputy general counsel of the
Clinton-Gore Transition Planning Foundation. She returned to
Washington in 1993 to serve as associate counsel to the president,
handling ethics issues, D.C. court selections, 25th Amendment
issues, pardons, appropriations matters, travel issues and
congressional investigations. Clinton appointed her in 1997 to be
deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the latest on science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke?
Is he writing any new books?
</P>
<P>
   A: If he is, he seems to be keeping it under wraps. The
British-born author of some 80 works, including ``Childhood's
End,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (written as a screenplay with film
director Stanley Kubrick), ``2010: Odyssey Two,'' ``2061: Odyssey
Three,'' ``3001: The Final Odyssey,'' ``The Ghost From the Grand
Banks,'' ``Rama Revealed'' and ``Richter 10,'' seems to be living
quietly in his adopted home of Sri Lanka. He was in the news most
recently last year when a British tabloid published a report saying
he had sexually abused children, an accusation Clarke denied. Last
June, Sri Lanka's justice minister, Lakshman Peiris, said there
wasn't sufficient evidence to begin prosecution, and the case was
dropped. Clarke, 81, has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone told me we can mail bills with less postage than the
current 33 cents for first class, and they still will be delivered.
Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. When the Postal Service proposed its rate case more than
a year ago, it included a proposal to have a reduced rate for
bills. But that provision wasn't approved by the Board of
Governors, said Sandra Harding, Postal Service spokeswoman in
Washington. So the full first-class postage of 33 cents is required
for bills, just as it is for letters.

 &HT;    In honor of Miami's Cuban population, try some spicy Super Bowl
treats
 &HT;    (EDS: Recipes that accompany this story can be found at
FOOD-RECIPES28-COX.)
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ So what are the cooks serving on Super Bowl
Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mountain oysters? Not likely, even if the Denver Broncos
are half of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   Mile High Pie? Denver may be the Mile High City, but that
legendary pie is from New Orleans. Its team didn't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Hot nuts for nibbles? Not this year. The Atlanta Falcons may
have soared, but the Georgia pecan crop took a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Fans looking for food to spice up halftime need to focus on
Miami, where the game is being played in Florida sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban fare is a natural choice, from a Cuban sandwich to black
beans and rice.
</P>
<P>
   That classic sandwich begins with the leftovers of roast pork,
and if you've complained of late of dry pork loin, or if you have
become bored with the predictable tenderness of pork tenderloin,
this is a pork roast that carries a memory of what pork used to
taste like.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it begins with an inexpensive cut that includes
the bone and, frankly, some fat. The end result is flavor and
juiciness rarely found this side of a sparerib.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts such as shoulder roast, which may be labeled Boston butt or
a blade end pork loin roast, are ideal. The trouble is such cuts
can be hard to find except in budget supermarkets. Substitute a
pork sirloin roast or fresh ham, but do not use boneless pork loin,
which will be too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the roast is marinated in a mixture of citrus
juice and garlic, then cooked long and slow. For the most casual
football fare, cut the cooked roast into rough slices, pour the
juices over them and serve with rice and black beans. Or prepare
the roast ahead and use the meat for classic Cuban sandwiches.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Crab is a favorite of American diners, and the good news is that
the 1998 harvest of Alaskan king crab was record-breaking, doubling
the 1997 harvest. The '99 harvest of snow crab, which began in
mid-January, is expected to be a record as well. The result _
reasonable prices along with abundant supply.
</P>
<P>
   One good catalog
</P>
<P>
   For those who like to turn back the clock, at least in the
garden, there's Burpee's Heirlooms catalog of seeds and plants of
vegetables and flowers that date to the last century. Old-fashioned
varieties new to the catalog this year include a Watermelon
Beefsteak tomato (left), legendary Cajun long green eggplant and
Jenny Lind muskmelon (named for the 19th century singer). For a
free catalog, call (800) 888-1447 or use the Web site,

   `Eating Well' going out of circulation
</P>
<P>
   Eating Well magazine managed a 10-year run but will be out of
business with the March-April issue, according to the New York
Times .
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which had an admirable appreciation of taste,
reached a circulation of 650,000, but the competition, Cooking
Light , outpaced it with a circulation that hit 1.4 million this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Eating Well had been losing money, and editors said they thought
the advertisers wanted a younger audience.

   CUBAN ROAST PORK
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 entree servings or 12 to 16 sandwiches
</P>
<P>
   Marinade:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   cup dark rum (optional)
</P>
<P>
   cup fresh orange juice
</P>
<P>
   cup lime juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Roast:
</P>
<P>
   1 4- to 6-pound pork shoulder
</P>
<P>
   Combine all the marinade ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Place the roast in a large sealable plastic bag and pour the
marinade over. Seal and shake the bag until the meat is well
coated. Place the bag in a glass baking dish (in case the bone
punctures the bag) and refrigerate overnight. Turn occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat from the refrigerator for 1 hour before
roasting. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the roast from the bag and place the meat and marinade in
the baking dish or any shallow roasting pan. Roast for 2 to 2
hours, basting occasionally. Test for doneness with an instant-read
thermometer, which should read 150 to 155. When roast reaches
desired doneness, remove from the oven and let it rest, covered
loosely with foil, for 15 to 20 minutes so the juices can be
redistributed and the carryover heat will finish the cooking, to a
final temperature 5 to 10 degrees higher.
</P>
<P>
   Carve the meat into into half-inch thick slices. Skim the fat
from the juices and pour over the meat.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to use the pork for sandwiches, remove external
layers of fat once the roast has cooled. Cover and refrigerate
overnight before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the juices into a small container and refrigerate
overnight. Remove and discard the fat and use in flavoring
mayonnaise for sandwiches.

</P>
<P>
   The classic accompaniment for this roast pork is black beans and
rice and a green salad.
</P>
<P>
   Black beans are a staple across the Caribbean and Latin America,
and there are as many recipes for black beans as there are
cookbooks. This one from a neighbor, who has used it for 20 years,
is the best I've had. With their generouse use of spices the beans
are more Southwest style than Cuban. Don't be alarmed at the amount
of the spices. The results are excellent and the recipe doubles
easily. It can be served as a soup, or the beans scooped out with a
slotted spoon and served over rice.
</P>
<P>
   SPICY BLACK BEANS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 medium onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (13 ounces each) beef broth
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (13 ounces each) chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 pound dried black beans, rinsed and picked over to remove any
grit
</P>
<P>
   1 meaty ham hock or bone
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons ground cumin (amount is correct)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 pickled jalapenos, minced
</P>
<P>
   sour cream
</P>
<P>
   diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   chopped green onions
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan heat the olive oil. Add the onions and
garlic; cover and cook over moderately low heat, stirring
occasionally, until tender, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the broths, beans, ham hock, spices, jalapenos and 2 cups of
water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to moderately low and
simmer, partially covered, stirring and skimming occasionally, for
about 2 hours, until the beans are tender.
</P>
<P>
   Remove and reserve the ham hock. In a food processor puree half
of the mixture. Return the puree to the pan with whole beans.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat from the ham hock, shred and return to the soup.
Simmer for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve as is or ladle soupy beans over rice. Offer the sour
cream, tomato and green onions as condiments to sprinkle on top.
</P>
<P>
   The original recipe called for 5 pickled jalapenos. Two provides
a warm heat that will be tolerable by all.
</P>
<P>
   Note: the original recipe called for an optional split pigs
foot. My neighbor, who grew up on a farm, sometimes uses that as
well as the ham hock, but says its not necessary.

<P>
   Now for the hard part. If you want to turn the pork _ or
leftovers _ into a Cuban sandwich, understand that it is grilled in
a sandwich press until the pork, ham and pickles have warmed and
the cheese oozes. The bread is flattened and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   When a sandwich press is not available, there are makeshift
options. One is to use a waffle iron. Or the effect can be
approximated by using a foil-wrapped brick on top of the sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe calls specifically for Cuban bread, and aficianadoes
are quick to detect imposters.
</P>
<P>
   In A Taste of Old Cuba, (Harper Collins), author Maria Josefa
Lluria de O'Higgins also suggests using French or Italian bread for
a ``delicious facsimile.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins and Himilce Novas and Rosemary Silva, authors of Latin
American Cooking across the U.S.A . note that the sandwich has a
second life when it's called media noche. In the middle of the
night, when Cuban Americans raid the refrigerator, they make the
smaller ``midnight'' sandwich. The fixings are the same, but they
use a soft, round egg bun rather than the crusty Cuban bread. You
can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Note that if mustard is used it is yellow ballpark mustard.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN ROAST PORK SANDWICH
</P>
<P>
   For each sandwich:
</P>
<P>
   1 soft sweet French roll, 6 to 8 inches long
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon mayonnaise mixed with 1 tablespoon leftover sauce
from Cuban Roast Pork
</P>
<P>
   prepared mustard, optional
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 thin slices Cuban roast pork
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 thin slices prosciutto, Serrano, Westphalian or other
high-quality ham
</P>
<P>
   2 slices Swiss cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 thin slices dill pickle
</P>
<P>
   melted butter
</P>
<P>
   Split the roll in half and brush both sides with the mixture of
mayonnaise and citrus sauce. If using mustard, spread on one side.
</P>
<P>
   Layer the meats, cheese and pickle slices on the bottom half.
Cover with the other half of the roll. Brush the outside with
melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   Place the sandwich on a griddle or in a large cast iron skillet
over medium heat. Place a foil-wrapped brick on top. Grill over
medium heat 3 to 4 minutes per side until the roll is nicely
browned and cheese is melting.
</P>
<P>
   Prosciutto, Serrano and Westphalian ham are all available at
Dorothy Lane Market Washington Square.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe is from The Complete Meat Cookbook by Bruce Aidells and
Denis Kelly (Houghton Mifflin $35). The authors suggest serving the
sandwiches with chopped jalapenos en escabeche.

 &HT;    A Super Bowl party with spice
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Thursday, Jan. 28, 1999
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Super Bowl in Miami calls for a salsa
beat from the marching band's drums. It also cries out for a party
spiced with Caribbean-inspired foods.
</P>
<P>
   No matter if you're in the parking lot at the stadium or on the
patio watching TV, the menu we've put together using Cuban and
Caribbean foods works well. It's also great for those who like to
work in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of traditional potato chips for snacking, make a plate
of yuca chips covered in a fresh garlic-citrus mojo, or use
storebought plantain chips and give them the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect go-with for beer is arepas _ traditional street food
in several Latin countries. Grilled cornmeal pastries have cheese
or ground meat fillings. We offer a cheese filling and a sweet-hot
combination of chiles and honey.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Cuban sandwich is easy to put together, travels
well, and makes a great substitute for the storebought hoagies. Use
the softer medianoche bun for easier slicing nd wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   What's a Super Bowl without a pot of chili?
</P>
<P>
   Grilled sausages are another tailgate tradition, and the Latin
version is the chorizo, available in mild or hot flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   Flan would be a natural for dessert, but it doesn't lend itself
to traveling. We've taken the caramel flavor and added it to
cheesecake _ it packs well in a cooler and is great served cold.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the recipes:
</P>
<P>
   Cheese arepas
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fine-ground white or yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   2 cups boiling water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated mozzarella cheese
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal and salt. Add the melted
butter and boiling water and mix until smooth. The dough should be
soft and a bit sticky; add more water or cornmeal if necessary. Add
the mozzarella, mix well and let rest for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the mixture into eight equal parts and roll each into a
ball with your hands. Put the balls on a clean surface, cover with
plastic wrap and gently press down on each to flatten to a
half-inch thick. (Can be made up to this point one day ahead and
refrigerated. Bring them to room temperature before the final
cooking.)
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large griddle or a nonstick or cast-iron skillet over
medium-high heat. Grease very lightly with oil, and working in
batches if necessary, cook the arepas on both sides just until
golden brown. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 large arepas.
</P>
<P>
   For Honey-chipotle arepas, substitute 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2
tablespoons honey and 1 tablespoon chipotle puree for the butter
and cheese. Follow directions above, except after combining
cornmeal and salt, add the water, olive oil, honey and chipotle
puree. (To make the puree, empty the contents of a can of chipotle
in adobo into a blender and process until smooth. One chipotle in
adobo yields about 1 tablespoon puree.)

</P>
<P>
   Medianoche sandwich
</P>
<P>
   1 soft egg bun (medianoche), about 8 inches long
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   3 thin dill pickle slices
</P>
<P>
   2 thin slices roast pork
</P>
<P>
   2 slices ham, boiled or baked
</P>
<P>
   melted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 slices Swiss cheese
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 300 degrees. Trim off ends of the bun and slice
lengthwise. Spread mayonnaise on both sides of the bread.
</P>
<P>
   Layer ham, pork and cheese and top with pickle slices.
</P>
<P>
   Place sandwich on a cookie sheet and brush with melted butter.
Place in the oven, weighted, if possible with a heavy, cast-iron
skillet. Heat until warm. It is not necessary to melt the cheese.
Makes 1 serving.

</P>
<P>
   Caramelized arequipe cheesecake
</P>
<P>
   Two 8-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk (do not open until
caramelized _ see below)
</P>
<P>
   One 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   6 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Caramelize the milk by putting the cans in a pot deep enough to
hold water to cover the cans. Cover with cool water and bring to a
boil over high heat. Boil for 1 hour, 45 minutes, adding more water
as needed to keep the cans covered. Never boil the cans for more
than 2 hours _ they may explode. Turn the cans occasionally to stir
the milk. Let the cans cool to room temperature before opening.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a food processor or electric
mixer, process the cream cheese until soft. With motor running, add
eggs, cream and caramelized condensed milk. Scrape mixture into a
9-inch pie dish and place the dish in a roasting pan. Add hot tap
water around the dish until it comes halfway up the sides. Bake,
uncovered, 60 to 70 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the
center of the cake comes out clean. The top should be dry and
golden. Let the cake rest 1 hour. If refrigerated, let the cake sit
at room temperature for at least half an hour before serving.

</P>
<P>
   Yuca chips and garlic-citrus sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 yuca, peeled, cut in half horizontally
</P>
<P>
   Water for boiling
</P>
<P>
   Oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   one-half head garlic, about 6 very large cloves
</P>
<P>
   1-and-a-half teaspoons coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter cup full-flavored olive oil, preferably Spanish
</P>
<P>
   1 small sweet white onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   one-half cup sour orange juice (or 3 tablespoons lemon juice
plus 5 tablespoons orange juice)
</P>
<P>
   Place yuca in pot with water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a
boil; lower heat slightly. If water starts to boil again, add cold
water.
</P>
<P>
   Cook until the yuca begin to soften, but are not cooked through.
Remove and drain.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil to frying level in heavy skillet. Cut cooled yuca
lengthwise into thin, wide strips, or into rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Drop into hot oil in small batches and fry until crisp and
golden. Drain on paper towels, keeping warm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, make garlic sauce: crush garlic and salt in mortar to
a coarse paste. Combine with olive oil and onion in a small pan.
Cook over lowest heat, stirring often, until garlic colors just
slightly (about 5 minutes). After yuca is fried, add citrus juices
to hot oil and bring to a simmer. Pour over chips; serve
immediately. Makes 4 servings.

   3 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground pork
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground chuck
</P>
<P>
   One 14-and-one-half-ounce can beef broth

   One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, drained
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   one-third cup raisins

<P>
   2 tablespoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

</P>
<P>
   Add beef broth and tomatoes, squashing each tomato by hand

<P>
   Grilled chorizo
</P>
<P>
   with hot papaya salsa
</P>
<P>
   For salsa:
</P>
<P>
   1-and-one-half cups seeded and diced red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1-and-one-half cups peeled, seeded and diced ripe papaya
</P>
<P>
   one-half cup minced fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   three-quarter cup pineapple juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chipotle puree or less to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients in a medium-sized nonreactive bowl and
mix to combine. Use immediately or cover tightly and refrigerate up
to 24 hours. Mix well before serving.
</P>
<P>
   For chorizo: Chorizo is a Mexican fresh pork sausage or a
Spanish smoked pork sausage. Uncooked sausage needs to be precooked
before grilling to release some of the natural fat, which can cause
flare-ups on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, prick each sausage several times and simmer in water
(flavored, if you wish, with wine, beer or apple juice) for 5 to 10
minutes or until they're fully cooked with no trace of pink in the
center. Grill over medium heat until browned and crisp on all
sides, turning often.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked sausages need only a few minutes of grilling.

 &HT;    `When I see a football fan, I see a person who is living'
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This is not about football.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so it's about football, but it's also about
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   A man, perhaps after one beer too many, decides to sell his
house, buy an RV and hit the road in search of the last great
American neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it in the parking lots of stadiums around the country,
where people gather hours before kickoff to eat, meet and throw
badly aimed footballs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the community party, Joe Cahn says, one great, big
covered-dish dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the only Clinton-free zone in America,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Cahn, 50, is in his third season on the road as football's
unofficial ``Commissioner of Tailgating.'' One last stop in Miami
this week for the Super Bowl, and his 45-game season is over.
</P>
<P>
   (As commissioner, he is impartial about Sunday's game, just as
he was about college football's Fiesta Bowl. He went 31-12 the rest
of the season, however, rooting for the home team.)
</P>
<P>
   Cahn _ whose true allegiance is to his home team, the New
Orleans Saints _ travels alone. Every morning, he listens to
Charles Kuralt's Life on the Road. Between games, he takes the back
roads where he can, stopping in diners where people solve the
world's problems, then come back the next day and solve them again.
</P>
<P>
   But he prefers the football fans. At first, he followed them
simply to study the eating habits of Americans across the country
(he is trained as a chef). Now, he loves the whole shebang. Between
games in Tampa and Miami in December, he went to a high school
playoff game in Orlando, just to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of walking dead out there, passionate about
nothing,'' he says from his fold-out chair, TV at his left hand and
picnic table at his right.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I see a football fan, I see a person who is living.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and tater tots
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a stupid question,'' Cahn says, ``but why are the
flags at half-staff?''
</P>
<P>
   It is Dec. 13, the day of the Dolphins-Jets game, the day after
Gov. Lawton Chiles' death. Cahn says that since his first game on
Sept. 5 in San Diego, he has bought exactly two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He steps from his door, past the pile of dead charcoal, into the
RV parking lot of Pro Player Stadium. It is four hours before
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, some ponytailed yahoo has climbed on top of his
camper and stands, screaming, a bottle in his hand. The Giants are
beating the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Player parking holds about 24,000 vehicles _ 25,000 when
they use land around a nearby canal. Tonight is one of those
nights.
</P>
<P>
   And tonight, Cahn has a Commissioner of Tailgating job to do.
</P>
<P>
   Cahn is here to present the Miami parking staff with his ``Best
Parking Lot Attendants'' award. A fellow tailgater takes a picture
of him and parking manager Michael Cregan outside the RV, shaking
hands and holding the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' Cregan says, pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Cahn became ``official'' last season, when he was invited to New
York to present The NFL Family Cookbook, a collection of recipes
from players and their families. Since he had the microphone, he
named himself tailgating commissioner. No one seemed to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even the big shots know him. Once, at a Patriots game, NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue dropped by the RV to visit. They talked
``commish stuff,'' Cahn says.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Cahn does endorsements (his Joemobile is
covered in stickers for Kentucky Fried Chicken and others) and
shares recipes for Hearty Touchdown Hot Dish and Festive Tater Tot
Feast on his Web site (www.tailgating.com).
</P>
<P>
   In the off-season, he says, ``I'm seeking counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   `People are still wonderful'
</P>
<P>
   Cahn wants to write a book about tailgating. His theory: This is
the one place where you can introduce yourself _ where you want to
_ and not feel threatened, he says. ``We don't talk to people in
elevators. We don't introduce ourselves on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailgating is an extension of people's homes, he says. Here, you
can walk away and leave your door open. Strangers invite you over
for a hot dog. You don't chase off the kids throwing footballs _
the ball hits you or your car, and you just say, ``Hey'' and toss
it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most incredible nonviolent community of its kind,''
Cahn says. ``(Opposing fans) say, `We hate you, we're gonna beat
you up _ but would you like a Bloody Mary? Would you like some food
first?''
</P>

   One of the Miami parking lot attendants drives by in a golf
cart. ``There's a guy who forgot to bring buns. I'm asking
everybody,'' he says and drives off.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still wonderful,'' Cahn says. ``Problem is, all we
get are sound bites from the national news.''
</P>
<P>
   U-Hauls, bowling balls
</P>
<P>
   Cahn makes the rounds on foot, visiting with people he met last
year, lending a nearby group a folding table, sitting down with a
new friend for some chicken.
</P>
<P>
   He tells the story of the Ohio State fans who have tailgated in
the same place since 1961 and have a ``deed'' to the land signed by
former coach Woody Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about the guy in Seattle who tows his boat to games.
The law in Seattle says no cooking except in your vehicle, Cahn
says. So the guy cooks in his boat.
</P>
<P>
   And up north, people rent U-Hauls and tailgate inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gentleman in Buffalo who cooks on his car,'' Cahn
says. ``He lights four pans of charcoal on the hood. Obviously, the
hood is scorched. But the car is a 1980 Pinto, so it's debatable
whether it's a car or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a bar set up so you can drink a shot out of a bowling
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gathered a small audience of fellow tailgaters, friends
old and new. Night falls. Two hours to kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Buffalo, did you know they have the only limo tailgating
section in the NFL? It's been there 30 years ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Fans' notes from the Commish
</P>
<P>
   The tailgating commissioner picks the best of Florida's fans:
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE: It's Florida over Florida State, says tailgating expert
Joe Cahn. In many towns, you can wander a stadium and have no idea
where you are. ``In Seattle,'' he says, ``you can't tell if people
are going to a football game or a concert.'' But in Gainesville,
you can tell. ``UF people wear a lot of orange,'' he says. Florida
State, though, has the better band. (He has never tailgated at a
University of Miami game.)
</P>
<P>
   PRO: Tampa Bay over Miami and Jacksonville. Tampa has the most
beautiful tailgating spot in the country (Al Lopez Park), Cahn
says. Since Jacksonville is a new team, there's no tradition yet.
``They are still finding out who to park next to.'' And Miami?
``Here, you have more New York hurry-up. Hurry to get in, hurry to
get out. Jacksonville and Tampa Bay are more laid back. And the
people actually from Florida? They're so laid back, you have to
wake them up to get them to the game.''

 &HT;    Just call her Marie
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_There's a story Marie Barnes likes to tell about the
recognition that comes with being the Georgia governor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   She's buying a television at Kmart not too long after her
husband, Roy, was elected. The cashier does a double take.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at my credit card signature and the receipt
signature and said, `Marie Barnes! Are you related to the Roy
Barnes who owns the pest control company in Cobb County(Ga.)?'''
Barnes, 50, claps her hands and laughs at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, fame. Roy Barnes and Republican challenger Guy Millner spent
nearly $27 million on their election battle last year, the most
expensive gubernatorial race in Georgia history, and the big man
gets mistaken for the bug man.
</P>
<P>
   As for Marie, it's a wonder her name gets recognized at all. The
New York Times referred to her as ``Mary.'' Her husband calls her
``May-ree,'' a pronunciation he picked up from the doctor who
delivered her. But she was raised as just plain Marie and when Roy
introduces her as ``May-ree,'' she extends her hand and says
``Marie'' the way she always has.
</P>
<P>
   She shook a lot of hands during this most recent campaign, when
she was constantly at her husband's side. She's kept up that hectic
schedule since the inauguration this month, from dawn prayer
services to appearances at the Capitol to late-night breakfasts.
Yet she's still unknown to many Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it that way,'' she says. ``Roy's the candidate and the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know her, though, say she's far from retiring. An avid
tennis player on an ALTA (Atlanta Lawn and Tennis Assoication) team
that won a city championship last May at the A-5 intermediate
level, she puts a wicked spin on the ball in a style that's earned
her the title ``Slice Queen'' from teammates. At 5-foot-8, she's
competitive and intimidating when she rushes the net. Her racket
bag sports 17 tags, mostly for division titles. Bright, floral
tennis dresses line one of her closets at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   While still living in Mableton, Ga., she filled her home with
elaborate animated decorations and held Christmas Eve parties for
friends' children, with an appearance by Santa. She's got a
just-folks demeanor, chatting about mending her husband's ``ragged
old pajamas'' before they moved and bringing her sewing machine
with her. She's quick to joke with daughter Alyssa, who will live
at the Governor's Mansion during college breaks, and readily gives
a tour of their new digs, right down to a closet in the den of
their private quarters that she's prepared for 13-year-old C.C.,
complete with the small mixed-breed dog's favorite upholstered
chair and a sleeping cushion. She likes country music and, with her
husband, is a regular at the Longhorn Steakhouse near their former
home.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping is another passion. She's a bargain hunter who
frequents T J Maxx and Marshalls and regularly watches and orders
from cable shopping channels _ ``So I don't have to look at
political commercials,'' she quips.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Barneses put their holdings into a blind trust (a May
financial disclosure statement put their net worth at $8.1 million,
much of it from investments in banks and extended-stay lodges), she
managed their rental houses and apartments. Flamboyant jewelry is
her one indulgence, friends say. It's rare to see her without
chunky earrings, a necklace, large rings and bracelets. During a
recent match, she sported several tennis bracelets. As a joking
acknowledgment of her love for gold, someone gave her a
gold-colored special recognition tag for her racquet bag.
</P>
<P>
   Friends describe her as organized, disciplined and
compassionate, a devoted mother and loyal friend who would call
late in the evening from the campaign trail to share a joke. Ask
her what her friends would say about her, and she replies: ``That
she's crazy. That I don't take myself too seriously. That I like to
have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At high school basketball games where Alyssa, now 19, played
center for South Cobb, Barnes would paint her fingernails in the
school colors, dress in orange, blue and white and give the
referees hell.
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa's coach, Mike Thompson, once asked her to tone it down to
set a good example for students. The next game, she led a group of
parents in holding up signs printed with slogans like ``good call''
and ``boo.'' That lasted one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have referees come up to me before the game and try to
find out where she was sitting,'' Thompson says. ``They knew that
she was going to be loud.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which she cheerfully admits to, while joking about what
would have happened if the gubernatorial race had depended on the
referee vote. Even her family refused to sit with her during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was something else, but when they wouldn't call those fouls,
by golly I shook 'em,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to protective instincts for her family, says the
Rev. Sam Storey, associate pastor of First United Methodist Church
in Marietta, Ga., which she has attended since childhood. He
accompanied her to several games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she thinks she's right, she stands up for it,'' Storey
says. ``Especially if her children are involved, she's very
strong-willed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know her well emphasize her love for children, from
inspiring a friend to donate books to Colbert Elementary, a Madison
County school where she taught for two years, to teaching Sunday
school and working in South Cobb booster clubs. She's a former
board member of the North Georgia chapter of the March of Dimes,
has worked on programs for children in several service groups and,
as first lady, plans to do public service announcements for Safe
Kids of Georgia, an accidental-injury prevention organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's well-informed and knows a lot more than people might
think when they see her doing things with children and her family
and tennis,'' says Jo Ellen Page, a longtime friend and volunteer
coordinator for Roy Barnes' 1990 campaign. ``She's very, very smart
and definitely has a role in a lot of the things he's interested
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, after seeing two young children go home each day
to an empty apartment, she talked to her husband about the
situation and the two helped set up an after-school child care
program at Mableton Elementary. More recently, she convinced him of
the need for alternative schools for students with disciplinary
problems; he worked to get the funds set aside for them. Ensuring
school discipline and supporting after-school programs were a part
of the Barnes campaign platform. Yet Barnes is cautious about how
her influence with her husband, a state senator for 16 years and a
House member for six, is portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's my job to get involved in policy-making
decisions,'' she says, choosing her words carefully. ``Certainly,
as any other citizen or person is allowed to do, (I'll) voice my
concerns. But those types of decision have always, and will always,
be made by Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met on a blind date set up by their roommates in January
1969. They married in August 1970, after Marie Dobbs graduated from
the University of Georgia and Roy Barnes finished his first year of
law school there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there has ever been a marriage where you became one, it's
us,'' he says. ``We think so much alike and are so very close, you
know, she's just a part of me and I'm a part of her. It's been a
true blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two years of their marriage, she supported them by
teaching school in Madison County until he graduated and they moved
to Mableton, his hometown. Then she settled into raising her three
children and doing volunteer work; he practiced law and, in 1975,
joined the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she's someone who works to help others without
seeking credit. She gave the family's old Suburban, in constant use
on the campaign trail when Barnes ran unsuccessfully for governor
in 1990, to a friend and campaign volunteer. She drove children to
summer basketball camp and pitched in behind the scenes for school
activities, coach Thompson says. Now that she's first lady, staying
out of the spotlight will be more difficult. Negative campaign
advertising focusing on Barnes' political positions, branding him
soft on crime and DUI offenders, signaled that the family had moved
on to a higher level of scrutiny. She worried about the effect on
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get so bent out of shape about it, it was unbelievable,''
she says. ``I thought I'd kick the TV in before it was all over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   As upset as she got, though, her husband credits her with being
a calming influence on him then and at other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I want to be too sharp-tongued,'' he says, ``and the
best thing she does for me is, she's a very cooling influence that
will remind me gently, `Well, think a little while before you say
that.' She's a good counterbalance to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election over, she's adjusting to a new home and new
requirements, like managing a small staff, having a security
officer escort her whenever she leaves the mansion and carving out
personal time from a schedule filled with meetings and public
appearances. She plans to promote an office of women's health that
her husband wants to set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have to do more speaking, but I'm gradually
trying to get into this role,'' she says. ``I've spent 25 years
raising children and he's been the politician and the speaker and
done that kind of thing, and that's the way we wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's always campaigned hard for her husband, shaking hands and
staying by his side, though she's done little public speaking. Her
involvement hasn't changed much since he moved into the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give her a copy of my schedule for the next day every night,
and we talk about where I'm going and what I'm doing,'' Barnes
says. ``She never asks or intrudes, but I know her so very well and
she's such a good sounding board for me that we talk about
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At a church service just before the inauguration, the Barnes
family lined up in the foyer of their home church to greet
well-wishers. Already living in the Governor's Mansion, the
Barneses were just one day away from achieving their dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's enjoying every minute of it,'' says Pam Webb of
Marietta, a friend since childhood. ``She looked like a bride
getting ready to walk down the aisle. I have never seen her that
excited, so much joy and excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has a lower-key take on the dramatic changes in her life.
``If I can get through this experience known as a nice lady who
cares about the people of the state of Georgia,'' she says, ``I'll
be happy.''

 &HT;    Lady Vols represent Dogs' ultimate test
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ After a brief absence from the late rounds of the
NCAA Tournament, the Georgia Lady Bulldogs appear to be ready for a
spot in the Final Four in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Landers has rebuilt a program that reached the
national title game three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Home attendance is up, the team set a school record for
victories at the start of the season, and Landers has Deana Nolan,
a player who has flirted with dunking during a game.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't the Lady Dogs causing more of a stir? They're
ranked No. 4 this week with an 18-1 record, with the only loss
coming two weeks ago at top-ranked Tennessee, which visits Stegeman
Coliseum on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we get respect, but maybe not as much as we should,''
senior guard Pam Irwin-Osbolt said. ``We've been ranked just about
every year. You'd think people would notice. We know we're a good
team, but the greatness is still waiting to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has found keeping pace with Tennessee to be daunting.
The Lady Vols, who won the first of three consecutive NCAA crowns
against Georgia in 1996, have captured all six of their titles in
the past 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols, who lead the country with a home attendance
average of 16,971, treated Georgia to a loud pregame ceremony Jan.
14, then asked more than 22,000 onlookers to whip out their
cardboard masks of coach Pat Summitt. Tennessee, which beat Georgia
in Knoxville by 59 points last year, cruised to a 33-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   At practice Tuesday, Landers pulled out a copy of a Georgia
student newspaper column exhorting Bulldogs fans to pack the house.
The Lady Dogs are drawing a respectable 2,461 at home, 3,659
against SEC opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing them at home, and you'd like to think that's an
advantage,'' Landers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said the Lady Dogs won't back down. ``Everybody knows
Tennessee is pretty good, but we're not going to make it seem like
they intimidate us,'' she said. ``I think of it as another SEC
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Landers, who commented recently on his radio show that Stegeman
is a recruiting hindrance, has done well to hang with national
media entities Tennessee and Connecticut, which have dominated
recruiting the past five years. But it's gotten tougher, because
those schools have done something Georgia has not _ won national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools bring in two or three quality players a year,''
Landers said. ``For some reason, we've been into a four-year
rotation. Maybe that's good because those classes have been ultra
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he signed Kelly and Coco Miller from Minnesota and
this year added center Tawana McDonald and her Michigan high-school
teammate, Deana Nolan, who tried dunking against Ole Miss on Sunday
before the ball rolled off her arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Tennessee is pretty good, but we're not going
to make it seem like they intimidate us,'' Nolan said. ``I think of
it as another SEC game.''
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE VS. GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   -- When; where: 7:30 p.m. Thursday; Stegeman Coliseum, Athens.
</P>
<P>
   -- Records: No. 4 Georgia is 18-1, 6-1 SEC; No. 1 Tennessee is
17-1, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   -- Series: Tennessee leads 24-12.

 &HT;    Mashburn still in Miami...for now
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON _ Pat Riley was asked about Jamal Mashburn, the man
who leads the league in trade rumor appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to use Jamal 48 minutes a game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a man Riley wants to trade?
</P>
<P>
   There has not been a major trade rumor in the last 18 months in
which Mashburn was not mentioned. He was a lock to go to Sacramento
for Mitch Richmond. He was going to be reunited with Rick Pitino in
Boston. Any report involving Latrell Sprewell and Miami included
Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of trading Mashburn was so fashionable that some had
him traded from teams he had yet to be traded too, like going from
Golden State to Boston after the Sprewell deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
   When all the trades were made, Mashburn remained in Miami. ...
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Mashburn returning as Miami's starting small forward?
Partly because Riley is reluctant to make a major move with a core
player and also because there is a perception around the league
Mashburn is not tough enough and only only be a good player on a
bad team.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's final offer for Sprewell did not included Mashburn,
according to several sources. Riley angered the Warriors by leading
them to believe Mashburn would be part of the package, and then
offering Terry Mills, Dan Majerle and Brent Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Riley would not confirm who was offered for Sprewell, but he did
reveal why he would rather not trade a core player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see what the team can do,'' Riley said. ``We aren't
in a position to constantly keep changing. You build a team, you
augment it, and if it doesn't win, then you start thinking this
isn't going to be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we'll get a better indication as to exactly where we
are. That's where my reluctance is. I'd hate to break up a team
that may be right before you know it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Riley sincere when it comes to Mashburn? Given the right
opportunity, Riley would be less reluctant to deal Mashburn than
any other starter except Voshon Lenard. But he showed he's not
eager to include him in just any trade. Riley's decision not to
take Sprewell if it meant including Mashburn was telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him out there, we need his versatility,'' Riley said,
explaining his `48 minutes' comment. ``There are some guys you ride
like a horse and who have the ability to handle it. He's strong.
He's in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn has been far more at ease recently than any time since
coming to Miami 23 months ago, and not because Sprewell was traded
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest event of this off-season for Mashburn was not when
Sprewell was traded, but when he reached down to pick up a
basketball at Florida International University and retrieved it
with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest thrill I've had in a long time,''
Mashburn said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because when Mashburn's right thumb shattered last
Valentine's Day, he was told he would never palm a basketball
again. When he palmed the basketball that July day, he realized he
would fully recover from the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with playing basketball again,'' Mashburn said.
``With the injuries (thumb and knee surgery in Feb. 1995) and then
seeing your name in the paper (in trade talks), it makes you feel
unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from my situation in Dallas where I sulked a little
bit because I wanted to get out of there. That wasn't the best way
to deal with things like that. I used the injuries and the talk
last year for motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley discounts the perception that Mashburn is soft and cannot
fill the role of the team's third star. Mashburn was playing his
best basketball in Miami when he was injured, talking the ball to
the basket and looking like the third option a contender needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was what I expected him to be,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   And Mashburn said he is not what the rest of the league may
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Zo (Alonzo Mourning), I don't lash out at people,'' he
said. ``I'm not Tim (Hardaway). I'm not outgoing like that. I'm
quiet and things come easily as far as basketball is concerned and
people take that as not playing hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was too passive when I got here. With the reputation I
had in Dallas of being an obnoxious rookie, I wanted to get rid of
that perception. This year, I will be aggressive.''

 &HT;    Just call her Marie
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_There's a story Marie Barnes likes to tell about the
recognition that comes with being the Georgia governor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   She's buying a television at Kmart not too long after her
husband, Roy, was elected. The cashier does a double take.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at my credit card signature and the receipt
signature and said, `Marie Barnes! Are you related to the Roy
Barnes who owns the pest control company in Cobb County(Ga.)?'''
Barnes, 50, claps her hands and laughs at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, fame. Roy Barnes and Republican challenger Guy Millner spent
nearly $27 million on their election battle last year, the most
expensive gubernatorial race in Georgia history, and the big man
gets mistaken for the bug man.
</P>
<P>
   As for Marie, it's a wonder her name gets recognized at all. The
New York Times referred to her as ``Mary.'' Her husband calls her
``May-ree,'' a pronunciation he picked up from the doctor who
delivered her. But she was raised as just plain Marie and when Roy
introduces her as ``May-ree,'' she extends her hand and says
``Marie'' the way she always has.
</P>
<P>
   She shook a lot of hands during this most recent campaign, when
she was constantly at her husband's side. She's kept up that hectic
schedule since the inauguration this month, from dawn prayer
services to appearances at the Capitol to late-night breakfasts.
Yet she's still unknown to many Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it that way,'' she says. ``Roy's the candidate and the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know her, though, say she's far from retiring. An avid
tennis player on an ALTA (Atlanta Lawn and Tennis Assoication) team
that won a city championship last May at the A-5 intermediate
level, she puts a wicked spin on the ball in a style that's earned
her the title ``Slice Queen'' from teammates. At 5-foot-8, she's
competitive and intimidating when she rushes the net. Her racket
bag sports 17 tags, mostly for division titles. Bright, floral
tennis dresses line one of her closets at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   While still living in Mableton, Ga., she filled her home with
elaborate animated decorations and held Christmas Eve parties for
friends' children, with an appearance by Santa. She's got a
just-folks demeanor, chatting about mending her husband's ``ragged
old pajamas'' before they moved and bringing her sewing machine
with her. She's quick to joke with daughter Alyssa, who will live
at the Governor's Mansion during college breaks, and readily gives
a tour of their new digs, right down to a closet in the den of
their private quarters that she's prepared for 13-year-old C.C.,
complete with the small mixed-breed dog's favorite upholstered
chair and a sleeping cushion. She likes country music and, with her
husband, is a regular at the Longhorn Steakhouse near their former
home.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping is another passion. She's a bargain hunter who
frequents T J Maxx and Marshalls and regularly watches and orders
from cable shopping channels _ ``So I don't have to look at
political commercials,'' she quips.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Barneses put their holdings into a blind trust (a May
financial disclosure statement put their net worth at $8.1 million,
much of it from investments in banks and extended-stay lodges), she
managed their rental houses and apartments. Flamboyant jewelry is
her one indulgence, friends say. It's rare to see her without
chunky earrings, a necklace, large rings and bracelets. During a
recent match, she sported several tennis bracelets. As a joking
acknowledgment of her love for gold, someone gave her a
gold-colored special recognition tag for her racquet bag.
</P>
<P>
   Friends describe her as organized, disciplined and
compassionate, a devoted mother and loyal friend who would call
late in the evening from the campaign trail to share a joke. Ask
her what her friends would say about her, and she replies: ``That
she's crazy. That I don't take myself too seriously. That I like to
have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   At high school basketball games where Alyssa, now 19, played
center for South Cobb, Barnes would paint her fingernails in the
school colors, dress in orange, blue and white and give the
referees hell.
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa's coach, Mike Thompson, once asked her to tone it down to
set a good example for students. The next game, she led a group of
parents in holding up signs printed with slogans like ``good call''
and ``boo.'' That lasted one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have referees come up to me before the game and try to
find out where she was sitting,'' Thompson says. ``They knew that
she was going to be loud.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which she cheerfully admits to, while joking about what
would have happened if the gubernatorial race had depended on the
referee vote. Even her family refused to sit with her during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was something else, but when they wouldn't call those fouls,
by golly I shook 'em,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to protective instincts for her family, says the
Rev. Sam Storey, associate pastor of First United Methodist Church
in Marietta, Ga., which she has attended since childhood. He
accompanied her to several games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she thinks she's right, she stands up for it,'' Storey
says. ``Especially if her children are involved, she's very
strong-willed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know her well emphasize her love for children, from
inspiring a friend to donate books to Colbert Elementary, a Madison
County school where she taught for two years, to teaching Sunday
school and working in South Cobb booster clubs. She's a former
board member of the North Georgia chapter of the March of Dimes,
has worked on programs for children in several service groups and,
as first lady, plans to do public service announcements for Safe
Kids of Georgia, an accidental-injury prevention organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's well-informed and knows a lot more than people might
think when they see her doing things with children and her family
and tennis,'' says Jo Ellen Page, a longtime friend and volunteer
coordinator for Roy Barnes' 1990 campaign. ``She's very, very smart
and definitely has a role in a lot of the things he's interested
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, after seeing two young children go home each day
to an empty apartment, she talked to her husband about the
situation and the two helped set up an after-school child care
program at Mableton Elementary. More recently, she convinced him of
the need for alternative schools for students with disciplinary
problems; he worked to get the funds set aside for them. Ensuring
school discipline and supporting after-school programs were a part
of the Barnes campaign platform. Yet Barnes is cautious about how
her influence with her husband, a state senator for 16 years and a
House member for six, is portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's my job to get involved in policy-making
decisions,'' she says, choosing her words carefully. ``Certainly,
as any other citizen or person is allowed to do, (I'll) voice my
concerns. But those types of decision have always, and will always,
be made by Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met on a blind date set up by their roommates in January
1969. They married in August 1970, after Marie Dobbs graduated from
the University of Georgia and Roy Barnes finished his first year of
law school there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there has ever been a marriage where you became one, it's
us,'' he says. ``We think so much alike and are so very close, you
know, she's just a part of me and I'm a part of her. It's been a
true blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two years of their marriage, she supported them by
teaching school in Madison County until he graduated and they moved
to Mableton, his hometown. Then she settled into raising her three
children and doing volunteer work; he practiced law and, in 1975,
joined the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say she's someone who works to help others without
seeking credit. She gave the family's old Suburban, in constant use
on the campaign trail when Barnes ran unsuccessfully for governor
in 1990, to a friend and campaign volunteer. She drove children to
summer basketball camp and pitched in behind the scenes for school
activities, coach Thompson says. Now that she's first lady, staying
out of the spotlight will be more difficult. Negative campaign
advertising focusing on Barnes' political positions, branding him
soft on crime and DUI offenders, signaled that the family had moved
on to a higher level of scrutiny. She worried about the effect on
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get so bent out of shape about it, it was unbelievable,''
she says. ``I thought I'd kick the TV in before it was all over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   As upset as she got, though, her husband credits her with being
a calming influence on him then and at other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I want to be too sharp-tongued,'' he says, ``and the
best thing she does for me is, she's a very cooling influence that
will remind me gently, `Well, think a little while before you say
that.' She's a good counterbalance to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election over, she's adjusting to a new home and new
requirements, like managing a small staff, having a security
officer escort her whenever she leaves the mansion and carving out
personal time from a schedule filled with meetings and public
appearances. She plans to promote an office of women's health that
her husband wants to set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have to do more speaking, but I'm gradually
trying to get into this role,'' she says. ``I've spent 25 years
raising children and he's been the politician and the speaker and
done that kind of thing, and that's the way we wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's always campaigned hard for her husband, shaking hands and
staying by his side, though she's done little public speaking. Her
involvement hasn't changed much since he moved into the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give her a copy of my schedule for the next day every night,
and we talk about where I'm going and what I'm doing,'' Barnes
says. ``She never asks or intrudes, but I know her so very well and
she's such a good sounding board for me that we talk about
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At a church service just before the inauguration, the Barnes
family lined up in the foyer of their home church to greet
well-wishers. Already living in the Governor's Mansion, the
Barneses were just one day away from achieving their dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's enjoying every minute of it,'' says Pam Webb of
Marietta, a friend since childhood. ``She looked like a bride
getting ready to walk down the aisle. I have never seen her that
excited, so much joy and excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has a lower-key take on the dramatic changes in her life.
``If I can get through this experience known as a nice lady who
cares about the people of the state of Georgia,'' she says, ``I'll
be happy.''

 &HT;    Art or racism? 'Presence of the past' angers some
 &HT;    By Peter Donald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Racist stereotypes fuel the art of
Michael Ray Charles. He's the first to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the presence of the past,'' the 30 year-old-Texas
based painter said of the outrageous racial iconography that
connects his work. ``It's about subconcious forms of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   A parade of Sambos, black-faced minstrels, watermelons and Aunt
Jemimas has brought the young, black artist fame _ but they have
made blacks some of his toughest critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's commercializing painful images,'' said Ed Golson,
President of the African American Cultural Arts Organization of
West Palm Beach. ``It reminds me of a day when it was done not for
this particular reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, Golson said he expects some people to protest
Thursday's opening of Stereo Typocal Errors, Charles' joint show
wth sculptor Joyce J. Scott at FAU's University Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of flack from black people who don't know what I'm
doing,'' Charles said from his home in Austin _ where he is a
professor at the University of Texas. ``They say: `Brother, what
are you doing? You're selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an unwritten rule that you should be making art that
all blacks like,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest Washington, who owns the African American Art Gallery in
Lake Park, said some of his clients _ particularly older ones _ are
too upset to talk about Charles' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of initial viewing is upsetting,'' Washington said.
``There's a lot of hurting on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But art should be free to express what art feels,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Other blacks are less sympathetic. Angela Tribble, a children's
counselor who admitted she'd never seen a Michael Ray Charles
painting, was concerned about how children will react.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is racist,'' Tribble said. ``It's a really old mentality
from years and years ago. I would picket it.''
</P>
<P>
   An internationally recognized artist who earns as much as
$25,000 for a canvas, Charles spends a lot of time defending
himself. After heated exchanges occurred at a symposium discussing
his work in Texas, Charles declared ``I feel like OJ''.
</P>
<P>
   And as he prepared to visit Florida, Charles said the funding
for a planned show in his native Louisiana had just fallen through
after the local arts commission said the show might cause problems
in the community.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles said he understands the visceral reaction people
have to his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of emotional ties,'' Charles said. ``To see
grown people cry, to see people angry. I'm trying to figure out how
these images from mass media cut at people's hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   FAU galleries director W. Rod Faulds was shocked the first time
he saw Charles' work in New York at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery, the
same venue that made Keith Haring and Jean Michel Basquiat famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was this guy better be black,'' Faulds said.
``But one painting moved me.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, Can I Be Of Any Assistance?, was of a black face
with watermelon lips in a demonic smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It connected me with how my parents had influenced my sense of
how African Americans should be viewed,'' said Faulds, who has
championed Charles' work ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerrated concepts of blacks have always existed in
advertising _ from the black faced minstrelry of the 1900's to high
amplitude sneaker advertising featuring today's NBA stars, Charles
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ad companies have depended on it for some time,'' Charles said
of the continuum. ``It's never really changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people would be more open about discussing these
things,'' Charles said. ``Today our society appears to be more
progressive but it's actually regressive.''

   1. ANCIENT INSTRUMENTS YIELDING SECRETS OF THEIR MUSIC Flutes
and their kin - including whistles, recorders and pipe organs - are
among music's oldest and most versatile instruments. Yet science
has long had trouble understanding all but the most elementary
aspects of how they work. Researchers are now starting to learn
some of the secrets. The new insights centre on how jets, eddies
and waves of air pressure come together at the heart of such wind
instruments to form the complex vibrations heard as agreeable
tones. By William J. Broad. New York Times Science Times. 2,000
words + graphic.
</P>
<P>
   2. ACTING THEIR AGE Veteran actors Sean Connery and Gena
Rowlands are the stars of ``Playing By Heart,'' a drama about the
search for meaningful and lasting love in contemporary Los Angeles.
They play Paul and Hannah, a married couple who find their 40 years
of togetherness threatened by an old infidelity. Unlike most modern
on-screen couples, Connery and Rowlands (both in their '60s,)
actually look like husband and wife. Willard Carroll, who wrote and
directed the film, says he wanted to create romantic roles for
older actors. By Renee Graham. From The Boston Globe. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   3. MICHELLE PFEIFFER : STILL GORGEOUS AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
Actress Michelle Pfeiffer has been trying, in vain, to make people
forget she's gorgeous. She's played a waitress, a farm wife and an
embattled inner-city teacher, but her face is perfect and there's
not much she can do to hide it. Now a middle-aged mother of two,
actress Pfeiffer is still stunning. In this interview she talks
candidly and intelligently about her family and her forthcoming
films. By Merle Ginsberg. WWD. 1,000 words + photo.
</P>
<P>
   4. BRENDAN FRASER IS HAVING A 'BLAST' It was a very good year
for Brendan Fraser : ``George of the Jungle'' brought in $100
million-plus at the box office, while his performance in the
prestigious ``Gods and Monsters'' stirred talk of a best supporting
actor Oscar nomination. Now he begins 1999 with ``Blast From The
Past,'' (an odd-man-out romantic comedy about a man who emerges
from a bomb shelter after 35 years underground,) the first of three
releases in which he stars that will open this year. Premiere
magazine once called Fraser ``a prime specimen of male
musculature,'' but he doesn't focus on his physique. Fraser talks
about the new film, his recent marriage, the importance of being
George and why he doesn't want to appear in any more nude scenes.
By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
</P>
<P>
   5. LEE ANN WOMACK Since her 1997 debut, Lee Ann Womack has
become one of country music's hottest young stars. Womack talks
about her new album, the pressure of the so-called ``sophomore
jinx,'' (the more successful an artist's 'breakthrough' project is,
the greater the pressure to match or even better it with the second
one,) the January birth of her daughter Anna Lise and her recent
appearance at the Gstaad Country Music Festival in Switzerland. By
Janet E. Williams. 1,300 words + photo.
</P>
<P>
   6. BALLROOM FEVER It looks like ballroom dancing, but to Suzie
Hardt and Phil Jensen it's a passion and a sport. This
'you-are-there' story follows the couple as they compete at the
Sapphire Ballroom in San Francisco. Beneath the glamour and
sometimes garish glitz, ballroom dance championships mean serious
competition, and the dancers have the focus and drive of athletes.
The International Dancesport Federation is lobbying to have its
sport join the Olympic Games within a decade. By Meg McConahey. New
York Times Regional Newspapers. 1,200 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
FREDDIE PRINZE Hollywood is full of the sons and daughters of the
famous who decide they want show business careers as well. You can
get pretty far on a name alone, but ultimately talent is the key.
Freddie Prinze Jr. is lucky enough to have both. The son of
groundbreaking comedian Freddie Prinze, who died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1977, the actor is carving out a
niche in teen-oriented movies like ``I Know What You Did Last
Summer.'' His latest, ``She's All That,'' is a homage to the
classic high-school comedies of the '80s. By Joshua Mooney. BPI.
1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
ANNIE DiFRANCO Musicians adopt very different strategies for
releasing a new album. Some turn into control freaks as they force
managers and record companies to make sure an aggressive marketing
campaign is in place. Others, like indie-folk singer Ani DiFranco,
take the opposite approach. ``Whenever I release an album, I just
leave the country,'' Di Franco said before heading off to tour New
Zealand and Australia. By Steve Morse. Boston Globe. 1,100 words.

INTERNET COMPANIES PAY TODAY FOR PROMISE OF PROFITS TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The mind-numbing sums being paid for Internet
companies that may not even make a profit are part of a gamble to
dominate the next generation of computer couch potatoes and their
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Investors believe Web sites such as Excite Inc. will be the
Internet equivalent of a television network with an important
twist: The Internet has the potential to knock down the shopping
impulse barrier and allow users to instantly buy, for example, a
pair of jeans they see worn by a TV character.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the At Home Corp. announced it would acquire Excite
in a $6.7 billion stock swap. At Home, which like Excite is based
in Redwood City, Calif., sells high-speed Internet access over
existing cable TV lines. Neither company has ever made a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous gamble on portals _ the Internet home pages that
provide links to other sites _ is based on the possibility of
accessing a wealth of personal data as more and more people gain
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``User information is the currency of Web portals,'' said Peggy
O'Neill, an analyst with the Dataquest research firm in San Jose.
The portals ``can get a lot more worth out of their advertising
sells with that kind of data.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Excite, other popular portals include Yahoo, the
Lycos Network and the Disney-backed Go.Com.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the At Home-Excite deal, but one influential
commentator said the current wave of portal deals had gotten out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fad,'' said Esther Dyson, who publishes the Release 1.0
industry newsletter. ``Sure, the higher access speeds are going to
get more people on the Web, but then it means that people will
leave portals for other sites that much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said companies like Excite were ``way overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home founder Will Hearst, a former publisher of the San
Francisco Examiner, countered that high-speed access would make
portals more, not less, important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster access will affect the style of Web usage, but people
still need a centralized site to organize their experience,''
Hearst said. ``You can click through TV channels pretty fast these
days, but you still need some sort of a channel guide to tell you
what's on. The Web is a million channels, and portals help organize
all that information without having to remember a hundred URLs or
keep track of thousands of bookmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The At Home-Excite deal comes on the heels of America Online's
$4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape Communications Inc. Last week,
telecommunications companies Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic each
rolled out Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line service for
consumers. The service transforms ordinary phone lines into a
high-speed Internet access lines that are always on, much like a
telephone dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   At Home offers its own always-on high-speed Internet access
service through existing cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, who is also a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers, a Silicon Valley venture capital company that helped broker
the Excite sale, said the burgeoning success of portals has made
them a valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest ones just keep getting bigger,'' Hearst said.
``Once everyone realized that there were not going to be that many
portals, other companies started to buy in, instead of trying to
create their own.''
</P>
<P>
   This allows advertisers to target their portal messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is AOL worth more than General Motors, Yahoo worth the
same as Boeing and Amazon worth more than Sears?'' said Beth
Vanderslice, president of San Francisco's Wired Digital, which is
about to close the deal that makes it part of the Waltham,
Mass.-based Lycos Network. ``Wall Street is acknowledging the
millions of people who visit portals and the ability of these sites
to gather information about their visitors and act on this
information to their mutual continuous benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the interactive payoff,'' said Patrick Keane, a senior
analyst with the New York-based Jupiter Communications. ``The
potential to focus an ad message is what makes portals tick, as far
as investors are concerned.''

 Linking Up Several PCs At Home  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  My wife just got a new computer, so now we're a
two-computer household. The PCs are in different rooms. Is there a
simple way to link them so that we can easily move files back and
forth? How about a way that I can use her high-speed modem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You're probably a good candidate for home networking.
Several products are available now that can connect multiple PCs in
a house without having to wire the computers together. One of them,
WebGear's Aviator ($150), uses radio-frequency technology to
connect computers as far as 125 feet apart. It works through walls,
ceilings and floors. A second option is a system such as the
soon-to-be-available HomeFree from Diamond Multimedia ($100). It
connects two or more PCs through the telephone lines in your home.
</P>
<P>
   Both Aviator and HomeFree let connected PCs share a single
resource such as a printer or modem. So yes, you'd be able to get
on the Internet from your PC by connecting via the modem in your
wife's machine. How's that for cool?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have so many promotional floppy disks, especially from AOL,
that I don't need to buy any. However, in order to erase and reuse
these freebies, I have to cover the extra square hole in the
corner. I have often done this with Scotch tape, but I wonder
whether I am risking glomming up my disk drive. Is this safe, and
is there a better way?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's safe, and in fact, it's a great idea. People do the same
thing with VCR cassettes all the time. The only problem would be if
the tape were to come loose and get stuck inside the drive. If you
use a taped floppy a lot, consider changing the tape now and then
to keep it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My Windows 95 taskbar with the Start button on it has
vanished. How do I restore it? I have double-clicked all over the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like a mystery worthy of Hercule Poirot. The Case of
the Vanishing Taskbar. But there's no body, no motive and no love
subplot, so it probably wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that you inadvertently dragged the top edge of the
taskbar downward with your mouse, which caused the bar to
disappear. You still should see a very thin gray line across the
bottom of the screen. Place your cursor on it, and with the left
mouse button pressed, drag upward a little. The taskbar should
reappear.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a Windows 3.1 user and would like to upgrade to Windows
95. However, all the stores I have gone to only sell the Windows 98
upgrade. Will that program give me Windows 95 as well, or do I need
a different one?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're a little unclear on the concept. Windows 98 is the
successor to Windows 95. It's basically the same operating system
but with some improvements. You can upgrade directly from Windows
3.1 to Windows 98. So you don't need Windows 95. Think of it this
way: Why would you buy a 3-year-old car when you can get this
year's model for the same price?
</P>
<P>
   Q: My ISP is AT&AMP;T WorldNet. When I signed up, I used a CD that
installed special software on my hard drive and then guided me
through the sign-up process. (It's similar in that respect to AOL.)
Now I'd also like to use WorldNet on my laptop, but it doesn't have
a CD-ROM drive. Is it possible to use the Windows Internet
connection wizard on the laptop to add the WorldNet account? And if
so, where can I get the account information such as my password?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, you can use the Internet wizard to create a Dial-Up
Networking connection for WorldNet. All the information you'll need
is in a file called Account.txt, which is stored on the hard drive
of your PC. The latest version of AT&AMP;T's software puts it in a
folder called User, which is a subfolder of the main WorldNet
folder. The file includes your log-in name and password, the DNS
numbers for the Internet connection, and other useful stuff such as
the server names for mail and news.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you do a lot of downloading from the Net, consider a program
such as GetRight, which makes downloading a breeze. It lets you
pause anytime during a download and resume later on without having
to start all over. (This can come in handy if you're accidentally
disconnected during a download.) And if a download is going really
slowly, you can ask GetRight to switch to a faster site. You can
get this $17.50 shareware program at www.getright.com.

LYCOS LOOKS TO BOOST PROFILE, NOT PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things happen fast on the Internet. At Lycos Inc., they happen
even faster.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Lycos was one of the Internet's coulda-beens. The
firm had been one of the first to offer an in-depth index of Web
sites. Yet as millions of new users came on line, relatively few of
them paid a visit to Lycos. According to the market research firm
MediaMetrix, only about 20 percent of Web users passed through
Lycos each month, while half of them were visiting the top spots
like Yahoo and the America Online site. The company's stock price
was hovering at around 17 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 12 months, and the change is dramatic. MediaMetrix
now figures that 45 percent of Web users visited Lycos in November,
just a few percentage points behind Yahoo. According to Lycos chief
executive Bob Davis, about 50,000 people sign up for various Lycos
Internet services every day, compared with a few hundred a day last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a remarkably short period of time, the audience shifts have
been significant,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   So has the industry's view of Lycos. ``I think the perception in
the marketplace is that they're now a close number two to Yahoo,''
said analyst Sherri Wolf of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The positive vibes have also helped run up the stock price of
the Waltham, Mass. company. Even after last week's slump in
Internet stocks, Lycos shares closed Friday at 87 7/8, giving it a
total stock market value of $3.8 billion. Not bad for a company
whose fiscal 1998 sales were just $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, many people believe that Lycos shares _ and other
Internet stocks _ are still wildly overvalued. It faces the tough
job of staying ahead in a fast-changing business where differences
among rivals can often be hard to discern. And some of those
rivals, notably America Online Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Netscape
Communications Corp., have deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lycos has something that many other pure Net
stocks don't: a history of making profits. The firm was in the
black in the first two quarters of its 1998 fiscal year, which
ended July 31. Lycos has run up $112 million in losses since then,
but then, eyeballs are expensive, and Davis has been buying them by
the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Since last February, Lycos has expanded its audience by buying
up an attractive stable of Internet properties. The shopping spree
began with a deal that nearly didn't get made.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bo Peabody, a political philosophy student at Williams
College in Williamstown, Mass. launched an Internet site called
Tripod. Peabody and Williams economics professor Richard Sabot
wanted to create an Internet community for people his age:
twentysomethings in college, or those recently embarked upon their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of traffic because we were one of the only good
sites out there,'' Peabody recalls. Traffic built even faster when
Tripod added a feature that for its time was quite radical. Anybody
who joined Tripod could set up a personal Web site at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1997, Tripod had a million users and was being
courted by a variety of Internet companies, including Lycos. On the
verge of an acquisition deal with Lycos, Tripod announced it was
backing out and selling itself to AOL instead. But the deal fell
through, and Lycos was still interested. In marathon talks that
began on New Year's Eve of 1997 and ended late the next day, Lycos
and Tripod cut a deal worth $61 million. Sabot joined the Lycos
board and Peabody became a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Tripod deal set the tone for 1998, and the transformation of
Lycos. As the year wore on, Lycos acquired two more major Web
properties. The company paid $133 million for WhoWhere, a Internet
``white pages'' service for looking up the addresses and phone
numbers of people throughout the country. WhoWhere also gave Lycos
another free Web site service, Angelfire _ which targets
middle-of-the-road users rather than Tripod's Generation-X emphasis
_ and MailCity, a site that offers free e-mail services to anybody
with a Web browser. Between them, these sites brought at least 11
million more users into Lycos' orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible coup came in October, when Lycos plunked down
$83 million for one of the Internet's best-known brand names: the
on-line assets of Wired magazine. Included were the popular HotBot
search engine, the Wired magazine Web site, a technology news site,
and the satirical Web magazine Suck.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Lycos had thrown off its reputation as an on-line
weakling, a search service that people visited just long enough to
look up the location of a really interesting Internet site. Davis
had turned Lycos into a diversified network of Web communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole essence of Tripod is about belonging and
participating,'' says Davis. ``That is why we have been so
successful in growth this year. We've given people a reason to
stay, not a reason to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Yahoo and Netscape's Netcenter offer most of the same
features as Lycos, but in the form of a single large site. Davis
wasn't interested in that model. Instead, he's taken his cues from
the television industry. Consider the Walt Disney Co. It operates
the ESPN cable sports network, the cable Disney Channel for kids,
and ABC for viewers of traditional broadcast television. Each
channel aims at a different market segment, but Disney owns them
all.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Lycos is now positioning itself as the Lycos
Network _ a system of distinct yet interrelated Internet services,
each with its own style and content. Some visitors will enjoy the
corrosive humor of Suck, while others will prefer the high-tech
savvy of Wired. The HotBot search engine specializes in brute-force
Internet searching for experienced surfers, while the original
Lycos site has a more Yahoo-like, user-friendly feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided the best way to catch Yahoo was to pursue a network
of branded sites, rather than one megasite,'' says Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Lycos properties has links to the others woven into
its fabric. Visit any Lycos site and at the top of the page,
there's a window that lets the visitor search the Lycos index. At
the bottom of the search page, there's a ``second opinion'' link
that'll run the same search in HotBot. Pages are lined with
enticements to look up phone numbers, sign up for free e-mail, or
do a bit of on-line shopping. Each of these offerings will whisk
you off to some other Lycos-owned site.
</P>
<P>
   Davis credits the cross-linking between Lycos sites for most of
his network's booming growth rate. People come for the Internet
searching and stay for the free Web pages. ``This is the whole
point about multiple brands,'' says Peabody. ``We don't care if we
lose the user if they come to someplace we own.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rappaport, an Internet analyst at Zona Research Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif., says the Lycos model is a clever way to keep
users on the reservation, by constantly giving them reasons to go
to a Lycos destination, instead of wandering off elsewhere.
``They're capturing what could be customer attrition within their
network.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is also capturing the attention of businesses who
want to sell their wares on line. The on-line bookseller
BarnesandNoble.com, for instance, has a strategic relationship with
Lycos that links its on-line bookstore to the company's sites. Run
a search on any topic, and BarnesandNoble will offer to sell you a
book on that subject. The bookseller also plasters its ads across
the other Lycos sites.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Rosendorf, a vice president of marketing at
BarnesandNoble.com, has nothing but praise for the Lycos strategy.
``Lycos is more than an Internet play,'' said Rosendorf. ``Lycos is
a savvy media company...I think they're some of the smartest people
on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart enough to challenge dominant sites like Yahoo and AOL?
Peabody certainly believes so. ``I think that we will likely
surpass Yahoo in reach, probably in three months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is a bigger challenge. Not only does AOL make a big
profit, but its core on-line service charges its customers, and 15
million people are happy to pay up. That gives AOL a cash flow that
other Internet companies only dream about. No surprise that Barry
Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services, is losing no sleep
over the Lycos challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth is stronger than ever,'' Schuler says. In addition,
Schuler argues, visitors to portal sites like Lycos don't stick
around for long, but soon wander off to other locations on the
Internet. ``They haven't demonstrated any particular loyalty yet to
any brand,'' he said. On the other hand, Schuler estimated that
typical average AOL user stays on line for 50 minutes a day. That
gives AOL plenty of time to bombard visitors with ads and sell them
merchandise. Until Lycos and other portals can match this level of
brand loyalty, Schuler thinks he has little to fear from them.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis sees plenty of growth ahead for Lycos. In fact, he
worries that the Bay State may not be big enough for him.
``Massachusetts doesn't have the base that Silicon Valley does in
Web companies,'' Davis frets. ``As a result, we have a smaller
talent pool.'' His biggest worry is finding enough talented workers
for the next growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   And where will the growth come from? Advertising revenue, of
course, and exclusive deals with partners like BarnesandNoble.com.
Lycos is also planning a much stronger focus on generating revenue
from selling goods through its own on-line store. Peabody says the
ultimate goal is to have on-line retailing generate half of Lycos'
revenue, up from the present 15 percent. Then there's the highly
visible Lycos Chevrolet racing on the NASCAR circuit, and a
nationwide ad campaign keyed to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, says Davis, there are so many deals still to be made.
``Any day of the week, there are scores of companies presenting
partnership offers to us,'' he says. Davis spends much of his time
weeding through them, looking for deals that will give Lycos one
more burst of speed.

CERTIFICATES OF AUTHENTICITY AIMED AT LIMITING MUSIC PIRACY ON THE
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move designed to cut down piracy of music on the Internet,
three dozen software and hardware companies and online retailers
plan Monday to endorse the use of a so-called certificates of
authentication that would accompany songs and albums distributed
digitally.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies and other authorized sellers of licensed music
would be able to include the certificates, which would appear on a
computer monitor when users open a music file, said Gerry Kearby,
chief executive of Liquid Audio. His company makes online audio
software and is a leader of the new group, the Genuine Music
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Various factions in the record industry, including musicians and
executives, are pondering ways to cope with what they say is
rampant proliferation of pirated music files on the Internet.
Kearby said the certificate will not prevent illegal copying, but
is meant to help publicize the names of licensed dealers, provide
links to their World Wide Web sites, and perhaps deter users from
making unlicensed copies of music.

CHAT GETS REAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a younger, dumber man, I wasted hundreds of hours and dollars
hanging around in chat rooms on the CompuServe on-line service,
typing messages in real time to other users of the network. You
paid a dime a minute back then, and the massive CompuServe bills _
along with the massive idiocy of on-line conversations _ soured me
on Internet chat for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I've left the issue of on-line chat pretty much
alone, until now.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since I gave up on chat. Cheap Internet access
lets you chat your life away for $20 a month on Internet Relay
Chat, a worldwide network used by tens of thousands every day. With
a piece of chat software, available for any kind of computer at
little or no cost, Internet users can plunge into thousands of
never-ending discussions of computers, politics, sports _ and yes,
sex, even sex. For more information, visit http://www.irchelp.org.
</P>
<P>
   My experiments with Linux software led me back to the universe
of chat. Desperate for help, I found an excellent IRC channel where
Linux users swap advice 24 hours a day. Those guys have bailed me
out on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But I've no idea who helped me, because IRC chatters are usually
anonymous. As a result, most IRC channels are filled with
trashtalk. While CompuServe and America Online chat rooms have at
least a few rules, IRC is like Chicago in the era of Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional chat has a bad reputation among serious computer
users, but the technology is getting a second chance thanks to the
concept of ``instant messaging,'' a variation of chat which could
become an indispensable business tool.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging brings new precision and power to the concept
of chat, mainly because it introduces a concept called
``awareness'' _ the ability to know whether particular people are
actually connected to the network at that time.
</P>
<P>
   America Online made the first big move in instant messaging
three years ago. Its Buddy Lists would tell you if a friend was
connected to AOL at that moment, and let you pop him a message. But
the most dramatic success story comes from Tel Aviv. There a
company called Mirabilis Ltd. produced I, a system that allows any
Internet user on Earth to hunt up friends and colleagues for an
instant chat.
</P>
<P>
   A network of Iservers is scattered around the Internet, and
members like me download a small piece of free software that runs
on my computers. (You want it? Go to http://www.i.com.) Whenever I
log onto the Net, my Isoftware tells the server I'm available.
Other Iusers can now message me, or I can block out everybody but
my friends and colleagues. You can set Iso that you're only visible
to people you want to hear from.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis hasn't advertised its product, instead counting on
word of mouth. That was enough. Over 25 million people worldwide
use I, 60 percent of them outside of the United States and Canada.
Last summer, AOL bought the company for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of people who live their life on the Web, and
Ibecame their product,'' said Fred Singer, chief operating officer
of AOL's Isubsidiary. Most are hobbyists, but a growing number use
Ias a powerful business messaging tool. Imagine knowing at a glance
whether a client or colleague is at his desk. Or being able to
round up several co-workers at a moment's notice for an impromptu
chat session about an important project.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is well past the hobby stage. Inow offers a
version designed for corporate networks. The company is also
looking at ways to let Internet retailers use Ito communicate with
customers. Millions of us get e-mail messages announcing bargain
airfares, but it may be hours before we see them. Send that same
message via I, and many customers will whip out their credit cards
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus Development Corp. foresees a bright future for instant
messaging inside the corporation. On Monday, at the Lotusphere
conference in Orlando, Fla., Lotus showed off SameTime, which lets
anyone on a corporate network locate and chat with anyone else on
the network _ wherever he or she is. Lotus CEO Jeff Papows told me
he used SameTime to collaborate with colleagues on his keynote
speech while zipping southward at 30,000 feet in the corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time communication about real work. It's enough to give
Internet chatting a good name.

said of the outrageous racial iconography that connects his work.
``It's about subconcious forms of racism.'' A parade of Sambos,
black-faced minstrels, watermelons and Aunt Jemimas has brought the
young, black artist fame _ but they have made blacks some of his
toughest critics. ``He's commercializing painful images,'' said Ed
Golson, President of the African American Cultural Arts
Organization of West Palm Beach. Because of this, Golson said he

   NEW YORK _ There's no business like show business, unless of
course you count the stock market in the age of the Internet: one
part Fellini film, one part trapeze act. It was in the spirit of
infusing the Web with a bit of literal high-flying that the Cool
Site of the Year Awards were held in New York on Thursday at
Webster Hall in the East Village. The crowd of 700 was mesmerized
by a French acrobat but less receptive to the celebrity host, Robin
Leach, late of the television program ``Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be quiet,'' he demanded, trying to start the show and
becoming increasingly frustrated. ``Please shut up!'' Indeed, few
in the crowd seemed concerned with following the winners and more
interested in talking among themselves while imbibing the
complimentary spirits poured by one sponsor, Wine.com. (After all,
one might get famous by claiming an award, but not necessarily
rich, and rich appears to be far more important to those in
business on the Web.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that those nominated weren't hoping to take home a trophy,
for which Web surfers cast online ballots to determine the best in
15 categories. Mark Walling, for instance, trekked from Redmond,
Wash., at the expense of his employer, Bill Gates. He genially
masked his ambition to win Best Reference Site for Terraserver, the
Microsoft geography site he was representing. ``I don't expect
we'll win,'' he said, smiling. ``Everyone hates the `evil
empire.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leach, after admonishing one award recipient for his sloppy
dress and unsuccessfully rallying the crowd to move the event
``uptown to Lincoln Center next year,'' announced the winner in
Walling's category. Sure enough, Terraserver lost to How Stuff
Works, a home-grown noncommercial site created by Marshall Brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met him in the elevator at the hotel,'' Walling's wife,
Tammy, said of Brain. Like her husband, she had not visited New
York before, and was mystified by touches like a lithe man in black
platform shoes who donned a blue bunny suit and handed out the
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Walling returned from the wings, just in case, and this time he
was masking his feelings a bit less transparently. But when,
moments later, Brain's was named Cool Site of the Year, he beamed
with pride on behalf of his new friend. ``We'll all have to go
out,'' he said to his wife. After all, as Leach would be the first
to say, everyone loves a celebrity.

   Linux Users Going Straight to Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Linux software operating system would rather
not have Microsoft Windows on their personal computers _ and would
most definitely rather not pay for Windows, which is standard issue
on most PCs. Now, with a militancy that seems to be part of the
movement, a band of Linux users plans to demand its Windows money
back.
</P>
<P>
   The users are hoping to use a loophole that they say they have
found in the end user licensing agreement for Windows, which says,
in effect: If you do not agree with the stated terms and
conditions, do not use the software. Those who do not agree to the
terms, the agreement states, should ``promptly contact manufacturer
for instructions on return of the unused product(s) for a refund.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Linux aficionados has started the Windows Refund
Center (www.linuxmall.com/refund), taking inspiration from Geoffrey
Bennett, an Australian PC customer who got back $110 (Australian)
last year after refusing to accept the terms of the Windows
licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Bennett's case, the refund came from Toshiba, the maker of
his PC. But the folks behind the Windows Refund Center would like
to simplify things by having Microsoft supply the refunds. So on
Feb. 15, which they have declared ``Windows Refund Day,'' they are
going to present their case to Microsoft, en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to quietly walk up to the Microsoft office and
people are going to turn in their disks, manuals and
certificates,'' said Don Marti, a leader in the Bay Area Windows
Refund campaign. ``And they're going to get a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not so sure about that. Tom Pilla, a spokesman,
said the Windows end user licensing agreement is intended only to
insure that people use Windows properly and do not make illegal
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC manufacturers are free to ship any software applications
and operating systems they want,'' Pilla said. ``By the time
they're reading the end user agreement, they've already purchased
Windows, presumably consciously.'' And besides, he said, so far
``we've gotten no requests for refunds.''

   Repentant King of Spam Serves Humbler Kind of Fare
</P>
<P>
   Until his disappearance from the online world early last year,
Sanford Wallace was easily the most reviled man in cyberspace.
Wallace, the self-professed ``king of spam,'' infuriated millions
of Internet users daily with his mass e-mailing campaigns and then
reveled in his right to do so. In its heyday, his company sent out
30 million pieces of electronic junk mail a day.
</P>
<P>
   That was until last February, when a judge ordered Wallace's
company, Cyber Promotions, to pay $2 million in damages to
Earthlink, an Internet service provider whose members were the
mostly unwilling recipients of Cyber Promotions' junk mail. The
judge then promised to impose a $1 million personal penalty were
Wallace ever to spam Earthlink subscribers again. And that was only
the most expensive of 13 lawsuits filed against Cyber Promotions
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The ignominy was enough to send Wallace into virtual seclusion
from the online world. And then he saw the light. Today, Wallace
says he is repentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a healing process that had to take place,'' he said.
``There were so many people who hated what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has started a new online business: Smartbot.net, a free
service for corporations looking to automate the e-mail replies
they send in response to customer inquiries. With 46,000 clients
since Smartbot.net started operations in September, the service is
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. To sign up for the service, companies have
to agree to add their names to Wallace's bulk e-mail lists, to
receive the advertising he sells to support his service. If this
bulk-mail proviso makes it sound a lot like the spam king's
previous business, there's a difference: Once they've signed up for
the service, they can opt out of the bulk-mail obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' Wallace said. ``I haven't been
kicked off the Internet since I've been back. I couldn't have done
that for 20 minutes before.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said his low start-up costs made Smartbot.net a money
maker almost immediately. ``Without legal fees to pay,'' he said,
``it's amazing how much easier it is to make a profit.''

BUILDING A MUSICAL DREAM WITH MP3 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a revolution going on, and Brett Fasullo and Ty Rauber
are true believers. That's not to say the two Boston men don't
resemble revolutionaries. With his tawny ponytail and pierced
eyebrow, Rauber is an intense, exceedingly mature 21-year-old
Boston University student. By night, Fasullo, 28, is a member of
the local band Flexie; by day, he sunlights (as opposed to
moonlights) as a computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   These two believers embrace a technology called MP3, an
audio-compression format that enables anyone with a computer and a
little technical know-how to copy CDs into MP3 computer files and
post them on the Internet. They recently launched a site called
DMOD.com, where Web browsers can sample MP3 music files and buy
them for $1 a track. There's nothing particularly new about this
idea; MP3.com offers music for free, and goodnoise.com sells tracks
for 99 cents a pop. But the DMOD player, like other commercial
formats, encrypts its files, so you can't share the music with 200
of your closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse behind this local venture is the age-old hope: Some
day, one band is going to leap out of obscurity by distributing
music on-line. Now, musicians have been on-line since the early
days of the Web, but to date, there hasn't been a single band that
catapulted to fame via the Internet. ``That's the dream,'' Fasullo
admits.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that dream just might be MP3. College students
certainly adore the technology; visit any dormitory that has
high-speed Internet access and you're just as likely to hear music
blaring out of a computer as out of a stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less than thrilled about the technology. Take a quick
guess who those folks might be? Did I hear you say recording
industry executives? Two points.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Recording Industry Association of America and
five major record companies announced plans to develop a standard
for digital distribution that would prevent illegal copying. The
RIAA routinely shuts down sites that offer free MP3 recordings by
major artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's piracy,'' says Cary Sherman, senior executive vice
president and general counsel for the RIAA. ``When you had piracy
on the high seas, you didn't have commerce because no one would put
their goods on ships when they knew they would be plundered.''
</P>
<P>
   But the $12 billion recording industry isn't exactly trembling
in the face of collegiate Captain Hooks; even Sherman admits that
the big issue here is the realignment of the music business. How do
you sell and distribute music digitally and insure that the profits
go back to the label and the artist? Hollywood types had the same
type of fears when VCRs first became popular in the '80s; they took
a lawsuit to the Supreme Court to prevent VCR copying for home use.
Guess what? They lost, and the film industry is doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The move to digital distribution is undoubtedly going to happen:
It's just a question of when. ``We take it as a given that at some
point down the road, we're going to be irrelevant,'' says Mike
Dreese, co-founder of Newbury Comics, a Boston-based music store
chain. ``You will see a steady erosion in retail record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the industry sorts out the issues, the question remains
what it will mean for independent artists. Established names like
the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy have defied their own record
labels and posted MP3 files on their Web sites. But what of the
little guys, the folks who could truly benefit from global
exposure?
</P>
<P>
   A time-honored truism applies. No technology can replace the
essence of art, that little human thing called talent. You can
market bad music in any format, and it still won't sell.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the legal MP3 music available on-line isn't all that
good. There are some exceptions. Frank Black, former leader of
alt-rock sensation The Pixies, is selling his terrific new album on
goodnoise.com. But most of the stuff available on MP3.com is
garage-quality for quirky niche markets (like one band called
Celtic Elvis, which is neither.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For every 1,000 bands, only one is going to become a star,''
says Bob Cohn, Goodnoise chairman. ``We haven't found that band
yet, but we predict it will happen.'' Goodnoise, launched last
year, reported $12,400 in earnings for its first quarter. But Cohn
predicts profits will arrive some day, too.
</P>
<P>
   The local believers are equally optimistic. ``Keep your fingers
crossed,'' says Fasullo, an avid snowboarder. ``If it happens,
that's more snowboarding for all of us.''

LEGISLATURES ACROSS U.S. TO TAKE UP INTERNET ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The contentious and complex debates over protecting
children from the evils of cyberspace, controlling unwanted
commercial e-mail and protecting consumer privacy online are
expected to move to statehouses in the coming months as state
legislatures convene around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine of the 50 states will hold legislative sessions this
year, with 46 of those scheduled to be under way by Feb. 2. At
those sessions, some 1,200 to 1,500 proposals dealing with the
Internet are expected to be filed, said Paul Rusinoff, state policy
counsel for the Internet Alliance, the largest high-tech and
Internet trade association in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting if you look at this context,'' Rusinoff said.
``We saw some of the first state bills dealing with the Internet in
1995. There were three of them. Last year, the association looked
at over 700. And I think as more and more legislators go online
themselves, and start hearing from constituents, the issues are
going to multiply.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list, he and officials with the National Conference
of State Legislatures and the U. S. Internet Council agree, will be
bills intended to protect children from adult material and online
predators, and measures to outlaw or regulate unsolicited
commercial e-mail, known as spam.
</P>
<P>
   But well-intentioned efforts to protect children from indecent
materials and online predators, and even measures involving spam
e-mail, often raise constitutional questions regarding free speech
and censorship. Another problem is that federal and state laws are
aimed at regulating a global medium.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians have won virtually every court challenge of
efforts to limit minors' access to the dark side of the Internet,
including a lawsuit against the original Communications Decency
Act, passed by Congress in 1996, and state laws passed in recent
years in New Mexico and New York. A second federal law, named the
Child Online Protection Act, which was passed last year, is being
challenged in federal court in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, personally, that there is going to be much
appetite for content-control legislation in state legislatures
because they realize that is going to be very difficult to
accomplish,'' said Mark Rhoads, legislative director of the
Internet council, a coalition of Internet and high-tech companies
formed in 1996 specifically to work on Internet legislation at the
state level.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rhoads said he expected that several bills aimed at
controlling content on the Internet would be proposed, he said
lawmakers ``are more likely to move in the direction of trying to
empower parents to more intelligently supervise their children's
online time'' with filters and other new technology.
</P>
<P>
   A number of bills to curb unsolicited commercial e-mail are also
expected. Last year, legislation seeking to control such e-mail was
introduced in 17 states. Bills were passed in two states,
Washington and California, bringing to three the number of states
with such laws. Nevada was the first, passing a bill in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While some argue that it seems futile for a state to try to
regulate e-mail on a global network, proponents say such laws can
help slow the barrage of unsolicited messages that often advertise
get-rich-schemes and adult-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington law prohibits companies from sending e-mail with
a misleading subject line or false return address to Internet users
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   California's law also requires that all unsolicited commercial
e-mail sent to users in that state contain the word
``advertisement'' in the subject line.
</P>
<P>
   California enacted a second law that allows owners of computer
systems in the state to sue the senders of spam e-mail in an effort
to recover losses caused by network clogs or computers crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads and Rusinoff said they also expected the federal debate
over whether laws are needed to protect consumer privacy online to
move to the state level. Other proposals they expect to see, Rhoads
said, include those seeking to outlaw online gambling, and several
to establish digital signatures, online notary publics and other
means of verifying identities on the Internet so that more private
and government business can be conducted online.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress has passed a three-year moratorium on new state
and local taxes on Internet services and Internet commerce,
Internet taxes are not expected to be an issue in state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Rusinoff and Rhoads said they thought few of the bills would
become law. But the flurry of legislation should raise the
awareness of the importance of forming new committees and state
offices to deal with Internet issues, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the odd features of the state policy environment right
now is that there is not really a committee structure to deal with
the Internet,'' Rhoads said. ``Only four or five states have
science or technology committees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusinoff, whose group worked with Virginia to write the first
comprehensive state Internet policy agenda, says his group will be
urging other states to follow that model.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia proposal calls for tougher laws against
sexually-oriented solicitation of minors via the Internet and the
posting of information on how to contact a child on a pornographic
Web site; a requirement that Web sites clearly post what private
information they collect and how it is used, and a law that would
allow the prosecution of senders of unsolicited bulk e-mail that is
``fraudulent, unauthorized, or otherwise illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   It also proposes making online transactions and contracts
legally binding and would require the state to offer more
government services over the Internet.

WILDFIRE: STILL NOT READY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife hates my new secretary. The intruder's name is Wildfire,
and for the past month she has been answering my telephone, taking
messages when I am not around, and helping me to return my
telephone calls. Wildfire is friendly, smart and sexy _ bonus
points with some of my associates, but not with my wife. Another
thing my wife hates is Wildfire's chatty, non-professional demeanor
and the fact that Wildfire often misinterprets what my wife says.
What makes it all the worse is the fact that Wildfire isn t a
person at all: she's a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire is a digital personal assistant, an artificial
intelligence-based voice-mail system created by Wildfire
Communications of Lexington, Mass. I wrote an article last October
about my experiences calling into voice-recognition systems like
Wildfire and a Portico, a similar service created by General Magic.
A lot of readers wrote me that week, saying that I hadn t given
these digital assistants a fair shake. A typical letters was sent
to me by Stewart Duggan: You don t just dislike digital or virtual
assistants such as Portico or Wildfire, you simply don t like
waiting, he wrote. It would seem that for you to be satisfied, the
business world would need to move to or adopt all direct-dial phone
numbers and eliminate all secretaries, receptionists, and virtual
assistants. Thus the reason your article was myopic, at best.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly kinder e-mail came from Wildfire Communications
itself. They offered to let me try Wildfire for a month so that I
could write about my experience with the service from the other
side. I took them up on the offer, and a few weeks later a Pacific
Bell GSM wireless phone showed up at my front door. Pacific Bell
has integrated Wildfire with its cell phone system, and thanks to
the miracle of nation-wide roaming, I m able to use that GSM phone
in Boston by roaming on the Omnipoint wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a traditional voice mail system, the GSM phone has
Wildfire. So I call-forwarded my home phone to the mobile, and for
the last month it's been my primary phone.
</P>
<P>
   The way it is set up with Pacific Bell, Wildfire is a lot like a
super voice-mail system. If somebody calls me and I pick up my
phone, I get to immediately speak with the caller. But if I don t
pick up, or if I m busy, Wildfire comes on the line. The computer
asks the caller for his or her name, then says that I m not
available and asks to take a message. Wildfire will also learn the
caller's phone number, either from Caller-ID or by having the
caller tap it in on the touch-tone keypad. After the same person
calls more than a few times, Wildfire will learn the caller's name
and store it in the voice recognition database, so that the caller
can get through faster.
</P>
<P>
   When I call to get my messages, I first have to type my access
code. Oh, Hi! says Wildfire. The computer then lets me browse
through my voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   For each message Wildfire plays back the caller's recorded. I
can then command the computer with short, easy-to-remember phrases
like what does it say? to hear it; describe it, to learn when the
message came in; next one, to go to the next message, or throw it
away.
</P>
<P>
   I can even say call this one, which causes Wildfire to call the
person at the number they left behind; during the call I can say
Wildfire! to bring the system back into the conversation, in case I
want to look up somebody else's phone number or conference a third
party into the call.
</P>
<P>
   One of the real powers of the cell-phone integration is the
ability to use Wildfire to place calls, like this one:
</P>
<P>
   Me: Call
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Call who?
</P>
<P>
   Say the name of one of your contacts, or say phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Dan Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Dan Greenberg. Is that correct? Yes or No?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: At work, home, mobile, pager, or other?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Work.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Dialing. Press 88 or say Wildfire if you need me.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the way it's supposed to work. Unfortunately,
Wildfire frequently misunderstands my command, especially if I m
someplace with a lot of background noise. Recently, at a computer
conference, my dialog with Wildfire went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Me: Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Call whom?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: Call whom?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: I m sorry, did you say other?
</P>
<P>
   Me: No. Next message.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire: I m sorry. I did not understand you.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with Wildfire is that you can't interrupt the
computer when it is talking or when Wildfire is playing a message,
something that is called barge in in the technical world of
computer telephony.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Wildfire does has a way for dealing with both noisy
environments and for barging in when the system is talking: you can
control Wildfire by pressing the buttons on your phone's keypad.
Indeed, using the keypad is significantly faster than using the
voice-recognition prompts. To me, this indicates that the voice
system could be a lot better than it is.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot more to both Wildfire and Portico than I was able
to experience through Pacific Bell's offering. For example,
Wildfire Communications has developed a system that lets Wildfire
users hear their messages and program in contacts over the Internet
using a web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Pacific Bell doesn t make this feature available
because of security concerns. Portico, meanwhile, lets you send
voice messages to people over the Internet as e-mail attachments.
This is a neat gimmick, although in practice it doesn t seem all
that useful.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that I like about Wildfire is the way that the system
will automatically build an address book from frequently contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-activated address books also make it a lot easier to dial
when driving. Unfortunately, the way that Pacific Bell has the
system set up means that I have to dial Wildfire first, then place
my other calls. I would much rather have Wildfire always listening,
always ready for my commands.
</P>
<P>
   My wife has a different take, of course. She objects to having
Wildfire take her messages, and she hates it when Wildfire is
listening in on my calls to her. The program needs to learn that
not everybody is a business contact, Beth says.

Apple sees game-playing power as key to expanding home market 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The jazzy iMac, released last August, was Apple's
beachhead in the home market. Now the company plans to expand this
foothold by making the iMac and other Apple computers the best for
playing games.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that entertainment applications drive the home
sales for all electronic gear. For most of its history, Apple's
ignored game developers and saw its share of the home market fall
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's strategy is twofold. First, it hopes to build the best
hardware on which to run games. That's already under way with the
iMac, built with a super-sharp screen and the microprocessing power
to run today's graphics-intensive games.
</P>
<P>
   This year Apple Computer will further enhance the game-playing
power of its next generation of computers. These machines will
incorporate Silicon Graphics' OpenGL 3-D graphics standard, already
the standard among PCs. That means PC developers, which write most
games, won't have to completely rewrite their code when converting
products to the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer also plans to add Rage 128 graphics accelerator
cards in all upcoming computers. This card will speed up game play
by up to 20 percent, say company engineers.
</P>
<P>
   These recent announcements have been well-received by game
developers, many of whom had abandoned the Mac in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   A small but steadily growing number of developers have announced
they will once again publish for the Mac. Among those renewing
their commitment are PopTop Software, Terminal Reality, Epic
MegaGames and the all-important Id Software, maker of ``Quake.''
</P>
<P>
   Games coming to the Mac this year include ``Railroad Tycoon
II,'' ``Fly'' and ``Jazz Jackrabbit 2.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Connectix recently announced it will soon release
software that lets Macs play Sony PlayStation games. About 70
PlayStation titles will be compatible with its new software,
Connectix says.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was this return to the Mac market better represented
than at the recent MacWorld industry conference, where Id Software
co-founder John Carmack shared the stage with Apple Computer
interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today because Apple Computer has finally gotten its
act together,'' Carmack told the audience.

FRUSTRATION IN ONLINE TRADING CUTS BOTH WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many small investors are becoming frustrated with the
limitations of stock trading over the Internet, even as they
continue to pour money into the online brokerage firms that now
account for one of every four retail stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   But the same trading frenzy that is causing headaches for them
is also causing trouble for market makers _ the professional
trading firms that match buyers with sellers or take the other side
of trades themselves _ forcing them to change their procedures to
keep up. Some have quit trading the most popular stocks of online
investors or shut their automatic trading systems, delaying orders
by up to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile online brokerage firms are continuing to have problems
like Web pages that are slow to load, servers that conk out and
some trades that fail to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to cope with the turmoil, some brokerage firms like
Waterhouse Securities Inc. are requiring online investors to make
trades in the most volatile stocks by talking to a broker instead
of using a computer. Many firms, including Charles Schwab Corp.,
the online trading leader, have limited or eliminated the ability
of customers to own some of their stock through margin loans. And
others are scaling back the aggressive advertising that industry
analysts say has contributed to the Internet logjam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors and some industry officials worry that a big
market tumble could completely freeze out online traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If on normal days this doesn't work at all, that's a bad
enough problem, but whenever there is a big downdraft on the
market, a lot of people are going to be shut out,'' said Steve
Salgo, a computer programmer in Plano, Texas, who trades stock
options from his home. He said he has changed online brokers eight
times in hopes of improving performance, but things only got worse
during the last few weeks. ``Most of the time there is a slow
response. And then sometimes there is no response.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bernard Madoff, whose firm Bernard Madoff Investment
Securities is one of the largest market makers, said, ``This thing
is not going to stop until people start losing money. I've never
seen this type of mania, people trading 100 and 200 shares without
any regard to fundamentals.'' Attempting to address the extreme
volatility in some stocks and initial public offerings, a special
Nasdaq committee of market makers, brokerage firms and other
industry officials will meet again Monday to discuss whether to
recommend any trading-rule changes to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the group has suggested extending the time market
makers have to post prices before an initial public offering begins
trading, but the SEC has not acted on the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas under discussion include allowing Nasdaq officials
to temporarily halt trading in extremely volatile stocks and
requiring retail customers buying shares immediately following an
initial public offering to place limit orders that guarantee they
will not be filled at a price far higher than they expected to pay,
according to a person involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict investors will see more Internet delays this
week, even though popular high-flying stocks with online traders
like Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have now fallen more than 30
percent from their highs two weeks ago. But some industry officials
say the stunning rise in online trading volume this year has begun
to level off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``I think it's going to take a slowdown in the market in
combination with more infrastructure spending to turn this around;
that will take months,'' said John Robb, co-founder of Gomez
Advisors Inc., an Internet consulting firm in Concord, Mass. He
said online brokerage firms' failure rates _ the number of times
Web pages failed to load _ rose 63 percent in the first week of
January, compared with the average rate during the third quarter of
1998, and he said the situation has not improved since.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Waterhouse, Web trading went down for about 35 minutes on
Tuesday and another few minutes Wednesday, said John Chapel, the
company's president. For the time being, the firm has cut back
advertising and prohibited trading in 10 stocks through its Web
site, including Amazon.com and Yahoo. The firm has eliminated
margin borrowing for the same 10 stocks, meaning customers who call
Waterhouse to place a trade in those stocks must cover the entire
price of their purchase with money in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary measures will be reversed when ``the frothiness
lifts,'' Chapel said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of online trades has held steady at Discover
Brokerage Direct after jumping more than 20 percent at the
beginning of the year, said Tom O'Connell, executive vice
president. ``We are looking at this as our new level,'' he said.
The firm, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., has
eliminated all margin lending on 16 stocks, up from just two issues
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have spilled over to Nasdaq market makers, and at
one point at least 16 had stopped trading Amazon.com, Madoff said.
Many that continue to trade the most volatile stocks have removed
them from their automated trade systems and are executing them by
hand, causing trades that normally take two to 20 seconds to take
up to 20 minutes, he said. His firm has temporarily stopped trading
Yahoo, Amazon.com and Infoseek Corp., though it is still averaging
about 125,000 trades a day in other issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the most extreme volatility may have abated somewhat,
industry analysts expect online trading growth to continue to surge
throughout the year. Online trades now account for 25 percent to 30
percent of all retail stock trades, double their market share a
year ago, according to Gomez Advisors. The firm expects the number
of online brokerage accounts to top 10 million by the end of the
year, up from 6.8 million at the end of 1998.

 EBay, Auction Sites Subject of Fraud Investigation  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least two law enforcement agencies are investigating alleged
fraud on eBay and other Internet auction sites after consumers
complained that they had been cheated.
</P>
<P>
   New York City consumer authorities confirmed yesterday that they
are ``actively investigating complaints regarding alleged
fraudulent sales'' at online auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported that city officials are looking into
sales of sports memorabilia on eBay in which supposedly
one-of-a-kind items were sold to more than one person. City
officials are said to be holding eBay responsible because it
collects commissions on sales.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's position has been that it is an innocent middleman.
Although it may assist consumers who believe that they have been
fraud victims, the San Jose company urges them to work with law
enforcement agencies. Yesterday, eBay issued a statement saying it
will ``offer to fully cooperate with any investigation involving
improper items on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has hosted some 43 million auctions since it
was founded in 1995, recently added new safety tools to protect
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the state attorney general's office said
consumers in 20 states will be reimbursed for Furbys they bought on
eBay from a seller who is accused of not delivering the popular
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Jamison T. Piatt of Mocanaqua, Pa.,
advertised the sale of nearly 500 Furbys at $60 apiece, which he
promised to deliver in time for Christmas. He accepted payments
from dozens of bidders but delivered less than 10 Furbys, according
to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ripped people off from New York to California,'' said
Barbara Petito of the Pennsylvania attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a settlement, Piatt will pay morethan $2,600 in
restitution to 29 customers, deliver two Furbys to one customer and
pay $1,000 for civil penalties and investigation costs. Piatt, who
also was known as George Williams or George Lijerus, also agreed to
pay additional restitution on all legitimate complaints against him
filed within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania authorities said they are investigating other cases
of alleged fraud on eBay, and they expect to file additional
complaints. The enforcement action against Piatt was their first
involving illegal Internet trade.
</P>
<P>
   The actions come a little more than a week after eBay, the
nation's most popular online auction site, tightened its security
and stiffened penalties for fraud. The company, which hosts
auctions selling everything from baseball cards to Beanie Babies,
in March plans to start a user-identification program allowing
consumers to register their driver's license, Social Security
number and date of birth for $5. The program is designed to let
eBay users identify fellow traders.
</P>
<P>
   EBay also will provide free insurance through Lloyd's of London
for transactions valued at $25 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   According to eBay, fraud occurs only in about 27 of every 1
million transactions.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways consumers can be cheated. Besides paying for
goods never delivered or receiving goods that don't match product
descriptions, auction users have complained of such practices as
``shill bidding,'' in which sellers bid on their own merchandise to
drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dodd, founder of AuctionWatch, a Web site where auction
users post messages and complaints, said auction sites are ripe for
fraud because it is so easy to be anonymous on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for you to get a new driver's license and become a
new person,'' he said. ``On the Web, all you have to do is go to
hotmail.com (or other sites providing free e-mail) set up a new
e-mail account and you're a new person.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>

<P>
   Consumers who believe that they have been sold fraudulent
merchandise online can contact the New York City Department of
Consumer Affairs at (212) 487-4444 or at
www.ci.nyc.ny.us/consumers. Consumers who purchased Furbys from
Piatt but never received them can get a complaint form at (800)
441-2555 or www.attorneygeneral.gov.

COLLEGE FRESHMEN'S INTERNET USE A WAY OF LIFE, BUT DISPARITIES
EMERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Use of the Internet as an educational tool by college freshmen
has become so prevalent as to be practically a way of life, a
survey of college freshmen shows.
</P>
<P>
   A huge 82.9 percent of new freshmen _ more than four out of five
students _ say they are using the Internet for research or
homework. Nearly two-thirds, 65.9 percent, report that they
communicate by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a great disparity in computer mastery between
students entering elite private colleges, 80.1 percent of whom say
they use computers regularly, and those attending traditionally
black public institutions, 41.1 percent of whom say that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disparity came as a kind of shock,'' said Alexander W.
Astin, founding director of the annual freshman poll taken at the
start of the fall semester by researchers at the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the survey shows an inequity that will exacerbate
other inequities,'' Astin said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also brought to light a continued decline in interest
in public affairs, but an increase in interest in community
service. It also showed a rising interest in higher education as a
means of increasing personal income though not as a means of
intellectual development. In addition, the study found a decline in
the consumption of beer and in support for abortion and casual sex.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has been conducted every year since 1966, sponsored
by the American Council on Education and the Graduate School of
Education and Information Studies at the University of California
at Los Angeles. The current survey got responses from 275,811
students at 469 two- and four-year colleges and universities in the
United States. The data were statistically adjusted to be
representative of the 1.64 million students who entered as
first-time, full-time freshmen last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The large size of the sample means that even shifts of half of a
percentage point have statistical significance, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Astin said it was becoming clear that computer literacy
and access to the Internet were creating a society sharply divided
into the haves and have nots, Linda J. Sax, the survey director,
said, ``What remains to be seen is whether proficiency on the
Internet enhances student learning during college.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig E. Runde, director of the International Center for
Computer Enhanced Learning at Wake Forest University, was more
certain of the importance of Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will not mean the disappearance of books and
libraries,'' Runde said, ``but if you don't have access to it, your
work will suffer in comparison with those who do. It's like not
having a telephone. You can get along by using the telephone booth
on the street corner, but not very well.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. backed away on Monday from a plan to embed an
identifying signature in its next generation of computer chips,
bowing to protests that the technology would compromise the privacy
of users.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which makes about 85 percent of the world's computer
processors, announced last week that each of its new Pentium III
chips would have an identifying serial number that would enhance
the security of electronic commerce and guard against software
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   But advocacy groups said they feared it would mark a further
erosion of anonymity on the Internet and would allow companies to
collect detailed profiles of consumers, which could then be resold.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Intel said it would modify the identification system
in the new chips so that it is automatically disabled unless the
computer user voluntarily turns it on. The company said it would
also offer free software to allow customers to turn off the feature
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always understood that there are security questions that
get raised when someone is providing identification in a
transaction,'' Tom Waldrop, an Intel spokesman, said in explaining
the reversal. ``Whether an individual is showing a driver's license
of handing over a credit card number, it always raises a privacy
question. We have done things to address that. You have to weigh
the positive value of having more secured Internet transactions,
more secure electronic commerce, against any privacy concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, D.C.,
which had called for a boycott of the new chip, said, ``It looks
like we won Round 1.'' But he said much more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a temporary fix, he said. ``It can be as easily disabled
as enabled. There's not enough assurance here that the chip will
not be misused.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it would continue to work with consumer groups to
allay fears about the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, with $26.2 billion in
sales last year, said the chip signature was intended to promote
the growth of electronic commerce by giving companies a better way
to verify the identities of their customers. It said the feature
could also be used to avoid piracy by preventing a single copy of a
software program from being installed on several machines.
</P>
<P>
   But after Intel last week announced plans to include the
identification technology in its Pentium III chips, which are due
for release in a few months, a furor ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Junkbusters, a high-tech lobbying group based in Green Brook,
N.J., said in a statement on its Web site: ``Intel's proposal to
put a unique ID code inside of every computer it sells will
significantly reduce the level of privacy available to computer
users around the world. The unique code will make possible far more
extensive tracking and profiling of individual activity, without
either the knowledge or consent of the user.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rep. Edward Markey, the senior Democrat on the House
consumer protection subcommittee, wrote a letter to Intel's chief
executive, Craig Barrett, asking that the company reconsider its
plans, ``to better balance both commercial and privacy
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he understood the technology's implications for
online commerce, where the anonymity of the Internet can encourage
fraud. But he expressed concern that it would also help online
marketers surreptitiously track consumers on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in
a way that compromises personal privacy,'' Markey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over the Pentium III is the latest front in the
struggle between security and privacy on the Internet. Earlier
rounds have focused on the use of an identifying mechanism called
``cookies,'' which enable Web sites to write information onto a
computer's hard drive that could serve to identify the computer
user on future visits. Many Web sites now require users to accept a
cookie as a condition of entry. But unlike cookies, which are
contained in a text file that can be altered or deleted by the
user, the Pentium III signature would be a part of the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to reassure consumers, Intel said it would not
maintain a master database of consumer names matched to Pentium
serial numbers. The company said it would also encourage Web sites
and software programmers to warn consumers whenever the serial
number is retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the privacy debate has focused on how online
marketers and companies collect personal information, the new
technology also raises concerns about whether it could be used by
law enforcement officials and governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought that in this debate over authentication,
governments would like more rather than less,'' Rotenberg said.
``This is the flip side of anonymity, and governments are pushing
for authentication. So there are some real concerns about
government control.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute erupted at an awkward time for the Clinton
administration, which has for months been trying to convince the
European Union that American companies are doing enough to protect
consumer privacy on line.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the European Union enacted a tough privacy law that
prohibits companies doing business in its 15-member countries from
disclosing personal information about customers without their
consent. Rather than pass a law adopting the European Union
requirements, the Clinton administration has been pushing online
marketers and merchants to adopt self-regulatory models for
protecting consumers on line. But it has had a tough time selling
that approach as adequate to the European Union, although the union
has delayed sanctions against the United States while negotiations
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Clayton, counsel and senior privacy analyst for Stone
Investments, a technology investment firm based in Dallas, said
that while there are some legitimate privacy concerns with the new
technology, ``this is designed to actually protect people from
something privacy advocates have been talking about, which is theft
of personal information and fraud.''

WEBTV HELPING TO CREATE AN INTERNET FOR ALL AGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Dan Fost   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 93, Ruth Hyman can remember the days before television.
Now, she not only watches television _ she uses her set for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, who lives in Palo Alto's Lytton Gardens senior housing,
is one of a large number of senior citizens making a hit out of
WebTV, which connects to the Internet over people's television
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps me going,'' said Hyman. With her newfound Internet
access, ``I learned how to look up medications, and I met a lot of
cousins I hadn't seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of WebTV's700,000 users are age 55 or older. That's
more than double the rate of older people on the Internet in
general. According to a late 1998 survey by Media Metrix in New
York, 14 percent of all Internet users are age 50 or older.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the noncomputer-generation people want is all the
benefits of the Internet without all the hassles and pain of a
PC,'' said Larry Marcus, an analyst in San Francisco for BT Alex.
Brown. ``And WebTV really simplifies the whole process. You don't
have all the configurations and system crashes. It's not trying to
be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Software giant Microsoft Corp. bought Mountain View's WebTV two
years ago for $425 million. While Microsoft makes most of its money
from software for personal computers, its investment in WebTV
stands as one of the key markers on the road to the convergence of
PCs and television sets.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV makes software that runs hardware ``set-top'' boxes made
by Sony, Philips and Mitsubishi. Those companies make a black,
VCR-size box that sits near the television set and connects to the
Internet. The boxes cost $99 or $199, depending on the level of
service. A keyboard that connects via infrared so you can balance
it on your lap is $49. WebTV then acts as an Internet service
provider, selling two tiers of access for $19.95 or $24.95 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   To set it up, you just plug one cord into the phone line and
another into either the television, the VCR or the cable box,
depending on your setup at home. Then you program a remote control
that comes with the WebTV box so that it will work with your TV and
VCR.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn on your TV the first time, you register for the
service; once you're up and running, each time you turn on the TV,
you get the WebTV home page, with links along the outside and a TV
show running in the center. You can then choose between going
entirely online, solely to television or doing both at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' said Erna DeAnna, 73, of Bedminster, N.J.
She fears the personal computer _ ``I'm very intimidated by it,''
she said _ but her son, a computer programmer, bought her a WebTV
and it has proved perfect to keep in touch with grandchildren at
college and friends who've moved to the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's marvelous for e-mail,'' she said. ``It's easier than the
telephone, where you can't get through or they're not in. This way,
they get the message quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   With WebTV Classic, users can e-mail and surf the Web just like
on a PC. In the more advanced WebTV Plus, people get an interactive
TV guide, in which they can click on a listing and tune right to
that channel. Some shows are now carrying special programming
allowing WebTV users to link to a Web site or other special
information right from a show.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV is only one company in a highly competitive race toward
PC-TV convergence. All the big players in the computer, television
and consumer electronics industries are trying either to put TV
shows on the PC desktop or give TV sets more computerlike
functions.
</P>
<P>
   While few of these gadgets have found widespread success, WebTV
has grown to 700,000 customers _ from 200,000 two years ago _
largely by making the Internet's killer application, e-mail, easy
for people who are otherwise computer-phobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help _ the Internet is trapped in the PC and someone needs to
let it out,'' said Marcus, the analyst. ``I happen to think that
the TV is going to help bring the Internet to the whole next level,
and bring it to the mass market.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus is a big believer in television because of its ubiquity _
it's in nearly every home, while PCs are in barely half the
nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   But PC penetration grew by at least 3.5 percent last year, to
48.5 percent of all households, according to Ziff-Davis. David
Card, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, said PC
growth is encouraging and that PC penetration will increase as
younger people grow up to head their own households.
</P>
<P>
   The ZD Market Intelligence study found that most PCs are in
homes with children. Older people regularly admit that computers
are too hard for them to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically am computer-illiterate,'' said Lora Hoffer of East
Harrisburg, Pa., a retired registered nurse. ``I'm 64 years old and
I'm not interested in learning computers. I lived all these years
without them and I think I can survive some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffer's three grown sons bought their parents a WebTV for their
wedding anniversary in 1996, and ``I've been hooked ever since,''
Hoffer said. ``I don't think they should sell a television without
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffer not only keeps in touch with her far-flung family via
e-mail, but when her teenage nephew was diagnosed with a rare form
of cancer, she conducted extensive research on the Internet. She's
also used WebTV's partnership with Internet chat service TalkCity
to open a chat room for eight former nursing classmates scattered
across the country, and now they're planning a reunion for the
first time in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marzenda McComb, 63, of Portland, Ore., bought her WebTV when
she embarked on a nine-week, 11,000-mile journey across the country
in a recreational vehicle, visiting friends and relatives. She had
a list of local access numbers that worked everywhere ``except in
little Podunk towns,'' and plugged her box into friends' phone
jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting an 80-year-old cousin in Denver, McComb and her husband
were snowed in for four days. ``My cousin had never had her fingers
on a keyboard in her life, but she so wanted to mail her
grandchildren,'' McComb recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin wrote a typo-filled e-mail, and typed in, ``Please
forgive my mistakes.'' But McComb told her, ``This is so awesome
that you can do this at all. Apologies are not allowed on WebTV.''
</P>
<P>
   McComb turned her WebTV box over to her cousin and bought
herself a new one, and she's become what her sister calls a
``Web-seeder, because I was doing the Johnny Appleseed with it.''
She bought units for a cousin who receives oxygen and can't leave
his house and for an energy therapist friend who wanted to have
access to a spiritual teacher online, and for other friends as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weaving the Web between our hearts, that's what e-mail
does,'' said Marna McComb, Marzenda's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   McComb is only gingerly stepping off the e-mail onto the
Internet itself. She was searching for airline tickets the other
day and thinks maybe someday she'll look into online investing.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Caldie, 69, of Los Banos (Merced County) said he uses his
WebTV to access the Web all the time, from medical research to
reading the Boston Globe and the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel. ``The old
guy across the street in back of me has his hooked up to a little
camera on top, and he talks to his daughter in Hawaii, face to
face,'' Caldie said.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV itself continues to add even more features, such as
interactive television links connecting certain shows to special
Web sites, and searchable TV listings. These features are in WebTV
Plus, while the cheaper WebTV Classic offers basic Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what's proving popular with the senior set. ``E-mail
is very important to all of our customers, especially senior
citizens,'' said Bill Keating, WebTV senior vice president of
business development. ``They have the time to write e-mail, and
it's something they're familiar with. They grew up with postal
mail, in the olden days when people actually wrote letters.''
</P>
<P>
   WebTV doesn't go out of its way to court senior citizens,
Keating said. ``Our advertising and marketing programs are very
broad-based,'' he said, although he did note one television
commercial last year featured an old hippie in a retirement home
using WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, the Palo Alto nonagenarian, received her WebTV when Sony
donated several units and a year's subscription to Lytton Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hyman said, when they heard her age, they balked and
told her to wait. But she called a month later, and they agreed to
give her a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman is a lifelong volunteer. ``I sold Liberty Stamps in World
War I, and bonds in World War II,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's gearing up for her next volunteer project: Sony
recently donated more units to Lytton for use in the common areas
so they can be accessible to all residents. ``I'm going to be one
of the instructors,'' Hyman said.

COMPAQ TO SELL SMALL STAKE IN ALTA VISTA SEARCH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Tuesday that it would sell a minority
stake in its Alta Vista service to the public as part of an effort
to build a leading player in advertising and shopping on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes just days after extended negotiations
between Compaq and Time Warner Inc. collapsed, according to
executives familiar with the talks. Time Warner was going to
exchange its extensive Internet operations, including sites linked
to its magazines, CNN and Warner Bros. entertainment properties, in
return for a big stake in Alta Vista, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks ended because, among other reasons, Time Warner was
not willing to cede Compaq any control over its news and
entertainment content, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chief executive, said in an interview
Tuesday that Compaq now wants to control its own Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we dug into the capabilities of Alta Vista, we concluded
that rather than give away the tremendous opportunity we had, we
would make the leap into the Internet space in a much broader way
than we have until now,'' he said. ``We intend to be among the top
three leaders in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Alta Vista had mainly been known for its vast index
that allowed people to search millions of pages on the Internet to
find a specific word or phrase. It was started mainly to be a
demonstration of Internet technology by Digital Equipment Corp.,
which Compaq bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock-market valuations of Internet companies have surged
in recent months, Compaq has realized that Alta Vista may well have
been one of Digital's unappreciated crown jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq will establish Alta Vista as an independent company based
in Palo Alto, Calif. It will be run by Rod Schrock, the executive
who introduced Compaq's Presario line of consumer personal
computers, which are now the sales leaders in their class.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes the stock offering will be in the second half
of this year or early next year, Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that in today's market, an offering could value
Alta Vista at between $1 billion and $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said it wanted Alta Vista to expand from merely a search
service to resemble what have come to be known as portal sites
because they are doorways to everything from news to chat rooms to
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   To flesh out Alta Vista's offering, Compaq had been upgrading
the site with more features and had also engaged in a flurry of
deal making.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Compaq agreed to buy Shopping.Com, an Internet
retailer that had been plagued by accounting irregularities and
management changes. While its sales have been small, Shopping.com
has links to suppliers to offer a very wide range of products from
doghouses to disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Compaq said it would offer electronic mail on the
site using software based on Microsoft's Hotmail service. It will
also use Microsoft's chat software when it is released this spring.
In exchange, Compaq will allow Microsoft to use Alta Vista
technology to provide Internet searches on its MSN Web site. (Now
Microsoft has been paying another search company, Inktomi, to
operate its search service.)
</P>
<P>
   And Compaq is looking to replace the abandoned Time Warner deal
with another arrangement with a media company, which could provide
information content, perhaps in return for a partial stake in Alta
Vista, Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alta Vista faces stiff competition in the portal business. The
leaders are Yahoo and America Online, which has recently bolstered
its presence on the World Wide Web with an agreement to buy
Netscape Communications Corp. Other aspirants include Microsoft's
MSN network, Walt Disney Co.'s Go Network, and Excite, which
recently agreed to be bought by At Home.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts said they do not yet see how Alta Vista will rise
above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part is to give people something better than they
already have,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist.

Monitor attachment sheds light on eyestrain 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An outfit called One-Tech recently sent me some
material stating ``It has been reported that the No. 1 problem
leading to missed work is eyestrain.'' Along with the promotional
material came a lamp intended to eliminate all this missed work.
</P>
<P>
   The lamp is made in China. Perhaps in China, workers are wont to
call in sick with eyestrain, although given that nation's reported
views on slackers and idlers, I have to doubt it. Here in the
United States, with its enlightened treatment of the working class,
I have never heard of anyone calling in sick with eyestrain.
</P>
<P>
   I have not worked for many places, granted, and the ones for
which I have worked may not have yet emerged from primordial labor
policies, but I don't think I would have much luck calling the
office tomorrow and saying, ``Hey, I can't make it today.
Eyestrain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny eyes can't be strained by looking at
monitors. I have a friend, a very important one in this operation,
just two cubicles away, who has major problems with glare on his
monitor. To alleviate this, he gets up on a chair, lifts the
ceiling panel over his allotted space, and loosens the light bulb.
With some regularity, a maintenance fellow comes along with a
ladder and tightens the bulb. This arrangement provides exercise
for both men.
</P>
<P>
   Enough about the problem. On to the proposed solution, an
odd-looking lamp called the Eclipse Computer Light.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the instructions, I might never have figured out how
this little thing works. It sits on top of a monitor with the aid
of a couple of adhesive feet, but this arrangement results in the
base, which contains a fluorescent bulb, pointing up. That's the
way it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the base is a frame which carries a reflective hood.
This hood can be raised and lowered on the frame, and turned
forward and backward.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is you turn on the light and then adjust the reflector
until the light spills down on the screen and the keyboard. You'll
be sure to do this right away, since otherwise it is reflected
directly into your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I'll have to admit I was expecting a mere gimmick, but the
Eclipse light actually is very nice. It provides a cool, rather
bluish light that is very pleasant to work around. Being confined
to trifocals, I probably have chronic eyestrain, and I can't say
objectively whether the Eclipse light makes my eyes feel better. I
can only say I like it, and it certainly doesn't produce any glare
that I notice.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions say the light ``provides the proper amount of
the light for the workspace.'' That depends on your definition of
workspace, of course. Certainly it illuminates the monitor and
keyboard just fine. It does not, however, provide sufficient light
to illuminate the entire desk on which my computer sits _ not
enough, at any rate, to read relatively small print comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse light costs $65, including shipping, from One-Tech,
which is located at 23 Acorn St. in Providence, R.I. 02903, and has
a toll-free number, 1-877-ONE-TECH, and a Web site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .onetech.net.

Rating rumors on `Star Wars' 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next installment of the movie series that spans
generations is due for a Memorial Day release. The Internet is
lousy with rumors about plot twists, cameos and dish on ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' The February issue of
Yahoo! Internet Life looks into the rumors and tries to sort fact
from fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine rates the rumors on a reliability scale of 1 Artoo
to 4 Artoos, 4 Artoos being the most reliable. ``Artoo'' was the
nickname for R2-D2, one of the series' main mechanical characters.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which is on newsstands but can be read online at
http://www.yil.com, also features a collection of useful Web sites
that have nothing to do with the movie. Included is a site called
http://www.supporthelp.com, which lists tech support numbers for
hardware and software makers, in case you lost yours.
</P>
<P>
   And, in time for Valentine's Day, the magazine takes a look at
online matchmaking sites, most of which are free, including
http://www.swoon.com and http://www.personals.yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the new issue compares whether it's better to do
certain tasks on the Internet instead of the old-fashioned way,
like by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The article looks at fixing a dishwasher, buying office supplies
and renting a foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwasher repair was determined to be easier using online
support. Some manufacturers' sites have online support information
that list frequently asked answers and give the answers ... so you
can often fix your problem without looking any further.
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, buying office supplies online was more
convenient, but there was little price difference between buying
online and at the store. Going to the video store was considered
the simplest way to rent a foreign firm. The selection at online
sites was better, but the prices were higher and, with shipping,
you had to plan ahead to have Cinema Paradiso in your hands by
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A pricey PC add-on
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb, the folks who sell contact lenses among hundreds
of other optical products, has come up with a new twist on the
computer screen magnifier.
</P>
<P>
   The PC Magni-Viewer is the first acrylic optical lens PC
magnifier. It is designed to reduce the strain on the eyes from
spending too much time at your PC.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer, which sells for $295, magnifies the screen 175
percent. It can be ordered at http://www.bauschvision.com.
</P>
<P>
   The eBooks are coming
</P>
<P>
   A new electronic book, which will retail for about $500, is
expected to be in stores by spring.
</P>
<P>
   NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook will be released by Franklin Electronic
Publishers and sold at electronics retailers, office superstores
and office supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   The eBook is a hand-held receptacle for the electronic version
of books that will be downloaded from the Internet. The electronic
versions of the books will sell for a price comparable to what
printed books cost. There are hundreds of titles available.
Participating publishers include HarperCollins, McGraw-Hill, Random
House and Harvard Business School Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket eBook is 22 ounces. It can hold up to 4,000 pages of
text and graphics at one time. Its batteries last up to 33 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The digital format lets the reader browse, search, annotate,
underline, bookmark, link and reference.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to beat
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an indestructible case for your PalmPilot
that's also chic, check out the Titanium Hardcase ($99.99) from
RhinoSkin.
</P>
<P>
   This handsome case uses sheets of folded titanium, a slotted rod
hinge and aircraft rivets, and it has a blasted finish.
</P>
<P>
   It's lined with neoprene rubber padding and has a cut-out area
under the Pilot for stashing money, credit card, ID, etc. The
Hardcase also holds the IBM Workpad but, sadly, not the PalmPC. It
weighs 5.6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   For those in search of a softer, sportier case with room for
more accessories, look at the RhinoSkin 2000 ($49.95). It will hold
any personal digital assistant or PalmPC, along with a modem,
cables, and other small gear.
</P>
<P>
   Made of tough material, it has a belt loop, a small zipper
pocket, a mesh pocket, battery pockets and a holder for an extra
stylus or ``analog'' pen.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn more at the company's Web site at
http://www.rhinoskin.com or by telephoning 307-734-8833.

Webbys taking a spot among coveted awards 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look, Web geeks _ an awards show for us!
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by the Oscars, the Emmys, the Grammys or even
the American Music Awards, the International Academy of Digital
Arts and Sciences (don't ask, we're not sure who they are, either)
has announced nominees for the 1999 Webby Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Webbys are given in 22 categories including Arts, Commerce,
News, Games and our personal favorite, Weird.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the nominees is available at
http://www.webbyawards.com. A large panel of judges ranging from
``Dilbert'' creator Scott Adams to musician David Bowie, along with
Electronic Frontier Foundation pioneer John Perry Barlow and
conservative pundit Arianna Huffington, will pick the winners, to
be announced March 18.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fun of the Webbys _ or any awards show for that
matter _ is handicapping the winners. So put on your virtual formal
wear and let's take a look at this year's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce category (that's online shopping to regular people)
is pretty much a no-brainer. We have Amazon.com, CDNow, online
auctioneer eBay, the Gap and the Tie Rack (http://www.tierack
</P>
<P>
   .com) battling for top honors. In this category, the Tie Rack is
the equivalent of a foreign film or Disney animated feature getting
tossed into the Best Picture Oscar category. No matter how good it
is, it won't win anything, and it's not that good to start with.
The Gap won't win anything because it has actual stores in the real
world _ good for business, bad for Web awards.
</P>
<P>
   While we'd love to give the Webby to eBay for innovation, sheer
quirkiness and all-around fun, we think Amazon.com will win in a
walk with its combination of easy ordering, overwhelming product
selection and excellent design. Amazon is the only site nominated
in two categories. Its second Webby nod is for technical
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Webbys are a little harder to handicap. Some of
these sites are fairly obscure but worth a look, just to see what
Web taste-makers have lifted above the din to merit-worthy status.
</P>
<P>
   In the Print and Zines category, known quantities Salon and
Slate were both nominated, but so were Feed
(http://www.feedmag.com), an intelligent and intellectual 'zine
from New York, and Nerve, a risque online magazine that tries to
take a literate and intelligent look at love, sex and
relationships. (Warning: This site isn't for everyone and
definitely not for children.) Categories like this illustrate Salon
isn't the only online publication with intelligent writing designed
for intelligent people.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting category is Sports, where ESPN Sportzone,
one of the most popular sites on the Web, didn't get a nomination
and neither did CBS Sportsline. Nominees in this category include
Quokka Sports (http://www.quokka.com), a beautiful but very odd,
hard-to-navigate Web site that claims to offer viewers an
``interactive sporting experience.'' Also in the Sports category is
SoccerNet (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .soccernet.com) and GolfWeb. The selection here feeds into the
stereotype of Web surfers as a bunch of nerds staring endlessly at
their PCs with a bag of Doritos and a six-pack of soda at the
ready. Lots of neat sports sites like Fastball, FansOnly and a
variety of creative and interesting sites for individual teams were
left off the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Politics category was clearly selected by California
residents, with two sites of California-specific content nominated,
further adding to the myth all Web surfers live in California.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what's nominated but don't have the time to
look over every category, take a trip to the nominees in the Arts
category. Each site is an example of outstanding Web design and
innovation. It's a good bet you've never heard of Park Bench
(http://www.cat.nyu.edu/parkbench) and Doors of Perception
(http://www.doorsofperception.com), but they are worth a visit to
discover the Web is a truly creative medium that offers users much
more than one-click ordering.
</P>
<P>
   What's Hot
</P>

regarded by fans to be one of the best Dylan resources on the Web.

 Netscape's Andreessen Joining Ranks of AOL  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, the Internet boy wonder who co-founded Netscape
Communications Corp., is taking his technical wizardry to America
Online, which acquired his company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, 27, will join AOL as chief technology officer when
the $4.2 billion merger of the online titans closes next month,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is followed by anyone else from Netscape's executive
team is uncertain, however.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, who oversaw Netscape's software development, is
expected to spearhead AOL's use of fast-changing interactive
technologies but will not oversee any of AOL's day-to-day technical
operations. He will report directly to AOL chief executive Steve
Case, according to the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping AOL and Netscape integrate their
technologies as the combined company faces Microsoft, Yahoo, Excite
and others in the fledgling Internet market, Andreessen's
appointment is rife with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   AOL officials hope the hiring averts a potential brain-drain at
Netscape, where engineers historically dismissed AOL as the
``McDonald's of cyberspace'' _ a high-tech lightweight that catered
to the lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen has dropped his disdain for AOL after concluding that
Silicon Valley companies did not pay enough attention to what
average consumers wanted. ``A lot of people were wrong about AOL,''
he said in a telephone interview in November. ``They gave the
public what it wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen _ who is considered a driving force behind the Web's
explosion because he created the first graphical Web browser while
still a student at the University of Illinois _ will shuttle
between AOL's Dulles, Va., headquarters and Netscape's campus in
Mountain View. His role is considered crucial to merging AOL's
consumer-oriented focus with Netscape's technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a reassuring signal to Netscape's engineers that AOL
is serious about technology, and it maintains Andreessen's valuable
cachet as an articulate spokesman for the company to the outside
world,'' said Jim Balderston of Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   Still up in the air is whether anyone else from Netscape's
executive offices will join AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape chief executive Jim Barksdale is penciled in to serve
on the merged company's board of directors, pending the deal's
approval. Barksdale will not be involved in day-to-day operations
and is mulling future plans, including another stint as chief
executive elsewhere. Barksdale _ who already is a board member of
3Com, AtHome, Oracle's Network Computer Inc. and others _ also
might take a seat on Sun Microsystems' board, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AOL's general counsel job is open, leaving Netscape
legal head Roberta Katz in line to replace AOL's George Vradenburg,
who recently was promoted to senior vice president for global and
strategic policy. AOL's acting general counsel is Sheila Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Some question if Katz will stick around, though. She was
personally recruited by Barksdale at Netscape after he accepted the
position of CEO in 1995 and is extremely loyal to him. Previously,
the two worked at McCaw Cellular Communications before its $12
billion merger with AT&AMP;T in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Netscape officials cannot comment until their merger is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear about AOL's takeover of Netscape: Bob
Pittman, AOL chief operating officer, likely will oversee Netscape
from his Virginia office.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the heads of Netscape's two product divisions _ Mike
Homer, responsible for Netcenter, Netscape's popular Web site that
reaches 20 million people; and Barry Ariko, who is in charge of
enterprise software _ will report to Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman, a co-founder of MTV, is credited with pioneering the
``selling of eyeballs'' to advertisers. AOL currently boasts 15
million paid subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, founded in 1994 by Andreessen and Silicon Valley
veteran Jim Clark, burst onto the spotlight by developing the first
commercial Web browser for navigating the Internet, based on
Andreessen's earlier work at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has been badly damaged the past few years by the
hardball marketing tactics of Microsoft, which gave away its
competing browser for free.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, several members of a hacking group called
Legions of the Underground declared an ``electronic war'' against
China and Iraq. Citing violations of human rights, the hackers
vowed to punish those countries by destroying their computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   This virtual call to arms went largely unnoticed by most of the
world, and the threat of destruction never materialized. But it
created an uproar in the cyber underground: A coalition of hacking
groups, known for their staunch independence and insular rivalries,
issued an unprecedented joint statement condemning the audacious
declaration and ``any attempt to use hacking to threaten or destroy
the information infrastructure of any country.'' Legions of
Underground quickly backed down.
</P>
<P>
   The incident intensified an ongoing debate about ``hacktivism''
_ the use of computers to advance political causes. The term,
coined in recent months, covers everything from animal rights
groups defacing the Web pages of fur companies to the use of
computers by dissidents to promote democracy in totalitarian
regimes. Targeted Web sites have included government pages of
Indonesia and India, Mexico and China, as well as sites operated by
NASA, the US Army, and the Department of Defense. The tools range
from legitimate e-mail campaigns to on-line graffiti to software
programs with names like Back Orifice and Floodnet.
</P>
<P>
   Political activists, who until recently got their message across
through rallies and marches and sit-ins and slogans, are taking
their causes on line in record numbers; they are now engaging in
what they call ``electronic civil disobedience.'' At the same time,
however, young hackers in their teens and early 20s are defacing
Web sites and, apparently as an afterthought, attaching a political
cause to their efforts. Such actions worry activists and veteran
hackers alike, and raise several thorny questions:
</P>
<P>
   What are the limits of political protest in cyberspace, where
the boundaries between public and private space are murky? How far
can activists go without infringing on the rights of the people
they are protesting? As international reliance on computer
technology increases, can anyone with a little technical know-how
declare their own war?
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, varying views on those questions stem from the
tension inherent between members of two generations. The older
hackers _ many of whom hold jobs and have families, and are known
as the ``elites'' _ fear trouble on the horizon. Meanwhile, some of
the youngsters _ called ``script kiddies,'' a term to describe
cyberpunks who borrow other people's programs to seek on-line
thrills _ have no such reservations.
</P>
<P>
   But at the very least, the emergence of hacktivism has created a
tentative esprit de corps among some hackers and nonprofit
political groups, who until recently inhabited vastly different
worlds. Consider what happened in October: A 25-year-old computer
science student who goes by the name Bronc Buster hacked into
China's official human rights Web site on the day it was launched.
He scrawled the words ``Boycott China,'' along with a screed
riddled with obscenities, across the page and added links to such
legitimate activist organizations as Amnesty International and the
New York-based group Human Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Bronc Buster, who does not give his real name and is a member of
Legions of the Underground who criticized the war declaration, said
in a telephone interview that he studied contemporary China in a
college course and was motivated by both his outrage over human
rights abuse and the fact that the Chinese computer system was
``pathetically easy'' to crack. ``Everything I read on that site
was total baloney,'' he said. ``The idea of human rights in China
is like the Nazis saying the Holocaust never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiao Qiang, executive director of Human Rights in China, a
dissident group founded after the 1989 Tianamen Square massacre,
said he does not endorse such political techniques but that his
group benefited from the attention. His group's Web site, which
chronicles human rights abuses, received 5,000 hits the day after
the hack and signed up scores of new members. ``They certainly did
a brave thing in terms of exposing the Chinese government
propaganda site,'' Qiang said. ``We don't officially encourage
hacking activities, but it certainly helped our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, outgoing president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, says that electronic civil disobedience in the United States
may be well-motivated, but it also may be an act of vandalism. An
FBI spokesperson in Washington said there are no closed
investigations to date, but Steinhardt predicts that test cases are
inevitable _ and perhaps imminent.
</P>
<P>
   More and more hackers, particularly the older generation who got
their kicks breaking into computer systems in the '70s and '80s,
are becoming more politically motivated. ``It's a natural
evolution,'' said Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of the hacking
magazine 2600 and a member of the coalition that condemned the
recent ``cyber war'' call. ``People believe in something, and they
do anything they can to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   But some insiders in the hacking world see a need for a
hacktivism strategy that goes beyond on-line graffiti and inflamed
battle rhetoric. ``You may make yourself feel good and get a lot of
attention, but when you crack a Web site, you are violating another
person's rights,'' said a Canadian computer consultant who goes by
the alias Oxblood Ruffin, and is a member of a hacking group called
Cult of the Dead Cow. ``Sure, China is the worst place in the
world, but if we can do that to them, what does that mean? We can
yell louder. We can shout the other guy down. I believe there is a
better way for political dissent. I believe we can make a better
technical argument. We can mount a better moral argument.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Some say that political activism could change the negative
public perception of hackers, who are commonly seen as social
misfits. The hacking underground became politicized in 1995,
rallying around the cause of the infamous hacker Kevin Mittnick,
who was arrested in 1995 on charges of obtaining unauthorized
access to corporate computer systems and stealing and copying
proprietary software. Mittnick, who is awaiting trial, had already
done time on similar charges. Many legendary ``hacktivist''
actions, including the break-ins in China, refer to the Mittnick
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people who are supposedly engaged in political causes
have links to Kevin Mittnick?'' asked Michael A. Vatis, chief of
the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, an agency
formed last year to monitor computer terrorism and oversee FBI
computer-related crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's misleading to use the term `hacktivism' to apply to a
broad array of conduct,'' he says. ``People should be more specific
about what they mean. It connotes some sort of legitimacy to what
they are doing, and some people are using it to cloak activity that
is potentially serious and dangerous conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater are, in fact,
quite precise about their activity, and like political activists
who practice civil disobedience in the real world, they back their
action up by using their real names.
</P>
<P>
   Since last April, they have conducted on-line sit-ins to protest
the Mexican government's treatment of the Zapatistas in Chiapas.
They use a program called Floodnet, which repeatedly requests
access to a targeted Web site, such as the home site of Ernesto
Zedillo, president of Mexico, or the School of the Americas. If
thousands of people run the Floodnet software at the same time, it
could tie up the server so that browsers would not be able to gain
access to a targeted site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create enough of a disturbance to talk about
what is going on in Mexico,'' said Carmin Karasic, a Quincy digital
artist and computer consultant who is one of the four members of
the collective.
</P>
<P>
   Karasic equates her group's virtual tactics with real-world
sit-ins. ``If we had a civil disturbance at Neponset Circle, you
wouldn't be able to get to my house,'' she said. ``But you wouldn't
think that those people should be arrested. A sit-in means that
someone is going to be inconvenienced. We're trying to push the
limits of political interaction on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other ``hacktivists, the members of the Electronic
Disturbance Theater are well-versed in both political and cyber
theory. Their on-line efforts, they say, supplement traditional
forms of political dissent. ``There are things you can do on line
that you can't do in real space and vice versa,'' said Stefan Wray,
a New York-based freelance journalist and graduate student at New
York University. ``On-line, you can't have a virtual sense of group
cohesion or the euphoria or camaraderie that you get with a large
gathering in the real world. But that group of people on the street
doesn't have the speed and sense of interconnectivity at the global
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The group on the street, however, does know the boundaries: If
they choose to throw paint at a nuclear reactor or block access to
a women's health clinic, they are willingly defying the law to
promote their cause. ``In front of a building, you get to play your
First Amendment card all the way to the door before you are dragged
away,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of Harvard's
Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cyberspace, you don't have clear public byways intersecting
private spaces, so there is no place to camp out and play your
First Amendment card. If you try to deny service to someone else,
by whatever means you use, you could be in pretty big trouble.''
The FBI spokesperson said that the use of Floodnet could constitute
a federal crime: It is illegal to intentionally block access to an
Internet server. But the members of the collective argue that they
are simply gathering at the gateway, not chaining themselves to the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Disturbance Theater's activities fall into a gray
area of the law, but one thing is clear: Political activism is
evolving as quickly as the technology itself. Karasic and her
partners are speaking at a national conference on civil
disobedience _ they'll enlighten the group on hacktivism _ that
wraps up Sunday (Jan. 24) at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The worlds of the hacker and the activist are interconnecting in
ways that civil rights organizers and antiwar protesters of other
eras could never have foreseen. But members of both groups are
concerned that they don't inadvertently start a war themselves by
prompting zealots or thrill-seekers to mimic their actions and make
sweeping threats like the one issued a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of recent ``war'' declaration by the Legions of the
Underground, the very hacker groups who advocate for free access to
information on the Internet acted to police their own underground
community, condemning the action and issuing a hacktivism manifesto
of sorts at the same time. ``Do not support any acts of cyberwar,''
the statement said. ``Keep the networks of communication alive.
They are the nervous system for human progress.''

GROUP RETHINKS RATINGS ON YEAR 2000 READINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fearing that they might inadvertently cause a flight of capital
and destabilize some large developing countries, a group of
international banks, securities companies and insurers is weighing
a retreat from plans to publicly rate the readiness of more than 30
nations to avoid major year 2000 computer disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Global 2000 Coordinating Group, which includes more than 230
institutions from 46 countries, announced its ratings plan at a
U.N. conference in New York last month with a promise to publish
its findings early in February. Countries exhibiting
``satisfactory'' progress and disclosure would be rated green;
those somewhat lacking in either category, yellow; those in
trouble, red, and those not providing enough information, black.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, or Y2K for short, is the inability of
some computers and electronic machinery to correctly read dates
after Dec. 31, 1999. Such devices can malfunction by freezing or by
spewing out incorrect data.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are already providing country ratings, most notably
Gartner Group, a consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., that
grades 87 countries. But the Global 2000 effort raised concerns
because of the worldwide financial influence of its members. The
group's access to central banks, national telephone and power
companies and other major institutions in the countries rated might
give the ratings extraordinary credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Global 2000 members said last month that the report should impel
countries that had been lagging in year 2000 efforts to work harder
and put pressure on all countries to make more information about
their progress public. Year 2000 consultants had called the planned
publicity a valuable alert and praised the group for setting an
example of cooperative information-sharing for the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the announcement, though, critics began
suggesting that the financial group's ratings might create more
problems than benefits. That set off an internal debate that could
be resolved in a private meeting that begins in London on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, and a lot of other members, can see both sides of the
argument,'' said James Devlin, the Citibank delegate to Global 2000
who has headed the working group of institutions that developed the
rating system and the plans to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers familiar with the debate said that federal regulators
and some major banks had raised concerns about capital flight,
especially from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks questioned whether publicizing the ratings might bog
the group down in lawsuits because the United States is the only
country with a law protecting those issuing good-faith readiness
assessments. And officials in countries with bad ratings might be
discouraged from sharing accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   Some also argued that the ratings pushed the financial companies
too far from Global 2000's main focus, which is encouraging
cooperative efforts to make sure that the financial sector faces
minimal disruptions. The group also develops model tests for banks
to follow in assessing their own Y2K progress, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But those who favor publication are not giving up easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think publicity will create panic,'' said J.P.
Rangaswami, a Global 2000 steering committee member from Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, the investment banking arm of Germany's Dresdner
Bank. ``Others, including me, think publicity will create action
that reduces panic. Once we use our collective leverage to gather
information, we have a duty to make it public.''
</P>
<P>
   Another backer of issuing ratings, Robert Aylward of the Royal
Bank of Canada, said the issue was not whether the assessments were
perfect but whether they would create more opportunities for
dialogue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Susan Jarrett, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's representative on
the working group headed by Devlin, agreed, saying: ``The best
reaction we could hope for is for people to dispute it. We got more
documentation than ever before when countries found out that they
were rated red.''
</P>
<P>
   Global 2000 members said that virtually all the material used in
the ratings had been gathered from public sources, although some
was from meetings in foreign countries that might not have been
widely publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed ratings for each country have been shared with its
national Y2K coordinator. As of this week, no more than a handful
of national coordinators had objected to the accuracy of the
proposed ratings, according to a banker involved in the research.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings are not intended to be more than a snapshot of year
2000 readiness in key countries. In general, Global 2000 does not
intend to predict how far countries will get in their repair
programs. But the group has bluntly warned on its Web site
(www.global2k.com) that Russia will not solve its year 2000
problems in time.

 &HT;    Runs set up opportunities to look deep
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ During the final four games of the regular season and
the two victories in the Atlanta Falcons' improbable postseason
run, quarterback Chris Chandler compiled a passer rating of 113.4.
Not bad for a guy playing in a Dan Reeves-designed system that
Denver Broncos counterpart John Elway felt was anything but
quarterback-friendly. It was the system that helped to precipitate
the long-standing rift between Elway and Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 18 seasons since Reeves left Dallas, but the
philosophy of his passing game has its roots in a dusty Tom Landry
playbook. The Falcons set up the long routes with the running game
and play-action. But as their opponents discovered in 1998, the
Falcons' attack is not conservative: The Birds will go deep.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta averaged a league-high 15.8 yards per completion this
season _ the best mark in the NFL since the Oakland Raiders
averaged 16.3 in 1989. Unlike the West Coast-style passing games
that are prevalent in the league, the Falcons will stretch the
secondary down the field. Just as with his running game, Reeves
wants the pass going ahead, not sideways.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves likes strong-armed passers with touch on the deep ball.
One of the reasons he did not re-sign popular Bobby Hebert in 1997
was that Hebert lacked the arm strength to play in his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play ball possession with the running game, not with the
pass,'' New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian
said. ``When the Falcons throw, they're looking for the big play
downfield. They want something substantial from it. Their approach
is to draw you in with the run, make you commit another body to the
line of scrimmage and then bomb you deep. It's been very effective
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons ranked fourth in the NFL in 1998 in pass completions
of 25 yards or more. Chandler led the league in yards-per-attempt
at 9.65. Most NFL teams regard the yards-per-attempt statistic as
the most significant on offense and are happy with anything around
7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's passing attack does not appear to be complex. But the
system is effective, creating openings into which the wide
receivers run. Many times, if wide receivers Terance Mathis and
Tony Martin beat the initial hit at the line, they encounter little
traffic downfield because zones have been cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it is a two-wide-receiver set. Chandler's passer rating
with two wideouts on the field this season was significantly better
than with three wide receivers. One of the ironies of Atlanta's
victory against Minnesota in the NFC Championship Game was the
29-yard catch by slot receiver Ronnie Harris on the late drive that
tied the game. Like the Broncos, the Falcons got little production
from their third wideout; slot receivers Todd Kinchen, Tim Dwight
and Harris combined for 16 catches.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also don't throw often to their ``checkdown''
receivers. Tight end O.J. Santiago caught 27 passes. Starting
running backs Jamal Anderson and Bob Christian had 46 catches
between them. While the West Coast offenses are about timing,
Atlanta's is designed to give Chandler time to find a receiver in
the deep seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual passing tree,'' former NFL quarterback Hugh
Millen said. ``Really, it's a tough offense for quarterbacks. If
you just look at the `checkdowns,' you can see that. Most teams
check down to a dump, just flipping the ball out to a running back
who might be standing 5 yards away from the quarterback in the
flat. In the Atlanta scheme, the checkdown route is a 25-yard
comeback to one of the wide receivers. It demands you make some
really tough throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Falcons must run the ball well to win Sunday, the
consensus is that they will throw early against a Broncos secondary
that has been vulnerable in the middle of the field. Neither of the
Broncos' safeties, free safety Steve Atwater and strong safety
Tyrone Braxton, has great range. At age 32, Atwater remains a
physical hitter but never has been a superb athlete breaking on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Falcons is that they don't normally attack
the intermediate zones on the inside. Most teams overplay Mathis to
the inside, allowing him the release to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he isn't a very big target,'' Vikings defensive
coordinator Foge Fazio said of Mathis, ``it's a little harder
passing lane for the quarterback when he's throwing the ball
outside.'' Mathis, however, is smooth on double-move routes and
often will run the out-and-up route to surprise defenders.
</P>
<P>
   League defenders think that Martin doesn't like coming across
the middle and give him the inside release because they think it
limits his options to the deep post route. Martin, a nine-year
veteran, has lost a half-step but still is fast enough to run
through some double coverages. He will force Atwater to check him
deep.
</P>
<P>
   For the Broncos, the riddle is how to pressure Chandler. By
nature, Denver is not a big blitzing team on the early downs. But
because the Falcons will use maximum protection to insulate
Chandler, sometimes sending only two receivers out on routes, the
Broncos might have to come at him more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons passing game vs. Broncos pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   The passing game should provide some nice matchups for a Falcons
offense that could come out throwing early in the Super Bowl.
Outside of cornerback Darrien Gordon, the Broncos secondary has
average speed and must try to compensate for the vulnerabilities of
its safeties. Unless the Broncos find a way to pressure quarterback
Chris Chandler, the Falcons should be effective.

 &HT;    Come on, Foxy; time to move on
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were so many disturbing things about Foxy Brown when she
made her 1996 debut: the fact that the 17-year-old rapper trumpeted
she had a sex drive like a trucker. Her frequent crotch grabbing.
And her incessant name-dropping of couture labels.
</P>
<P>
   That her ``Ill Na Na'' (her name for what she grabs) still sold
1.5 million copies was probably due in part to hype (after
appearing on popular remixes with Toni Braxton and LL Cool J) and
in part to her provocations. Fans wondered: ``Hmmm, how far is she
really going to take this?''
</P>
<P>
   This time around the 19-year-old's still giving veteran R&AMP;B
vocalist Millie Jackson a run for music's rated XXX title. That is,
when Foxy's not taking an opportunity to boost Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But what was disturbing three years ago is boring now. It'll
certainly be boring to the Foxy follower who has heard this all
before. And, surprisingly, this talk seems to be boring the
purportedly cocky one herself. Brown moves listlessly through many
of her magniloquent statements. She's like someone whispering a
threat with her hand over her mouth. And it's certainly lazy of
Foxy to adopt the husky grunts and huffs of her material girl
competitor Lil' Kim, which she does on the album's few standouts:
``Hot Spot'' and ``Ride (Down South).'' Maybe Brown's drive as an
artist has pulled over at a rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chyna Doll''
</P>
<P>
   Foxy Brown. Def Jam. 17 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This ``Chyna Doll'' is nothing to
</P>
<P>
   treasure or play with for very long.

 &HT;    Pick a Peckinpah for trip to wild west
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more interesting things about ``The Hi-Lo Country,''
a western starring Woody Harrelson that opens here Friday, is its
lineage. Based on a 1961 novel by Max Evans, the movie was
originally supposed to be directed by Sam Peckinpah. In fact,
Peckinpah tried for more than 20 years (he died in 1984), but his
version never quite got saddled up, so to speak. Stephen Frears,
who ultimately filmed it, has certainly worked hard to honor his
predecessor's style. Still, if you're in the mood for a dose or two
of the Peckinpah West, consider these rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild Bunch'' (1969)
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably Peckinpah's most famous film and now revered by
many as the movie that ushered slo-mo violence _ up close, personal
and very, very bloody _ onto American movie screens. The outlaw
gang is actually the same group that was known as the
Hole-in-the-Wall gang in ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
But consider these guys the grunge answer to Newman and Redford.
Gang leader William Holden, his cynicism ripened like a fine old
wine, heads to 1913 Mexico for one last stab at his chosen way of
life. Riding with him are a veritable who's who of scuzzy character
actors: Strother Martin, L.Q. Jones, Warren Oates and Ernest
Borgnine. One face you won't see: Lee Marvin. The star was
originally interested in playing the Holden role but opted instead
to make the mega-flop ``Paint Your Wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Major Dundee'' (1965)
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick always wanted to disown ``Spartacus.'' Peckinpah
felt the same way about ``Major Dundee.'' Too bad, because even in
its truncated form, it's a richly compelling post-Civil War western
whose themes _ racial bigotry and obsession with duty _ echo John
Ford's ``The Searchers.'' Charlton Heston plays the title role _ a
Yankee officer ordered to lead a ragtag coalition of soldiers,
volunteers, renegades and Confederate prisoners (among them, a very
colorful Richard Harris) in pursuit of a bloodthirsty Apache chief.
By the time the film reached theaters, it was 44 minutes shorter
than Peckinpah's original cut. James Coburn, who was also in the
cast, recalls Peckinpah shaking with rage after a screening.
Coburn's then-wife tried to comfort the filmmaker, saying, ``It's
only a movie.'' Replied Peckinpah, ``It's my (expletive) life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride the High Country'' (1962)
</P>
<P>
   An elegy for the passing of the West, this low-profile yet
poetic tribute stars Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott. The aging
stars are cast as aging former lawmen. Once famous as quick-draw
town tamers, they've been reduced to riding guard on a shipment of
gold. But they still have the stuff for one last good fight. Though
it was more a critical than a commercial success, the film helped
Peckinpah make the transition from television (he created the
popular series ``The Rifleman'') to movies. One ironic note: In the
cast is a actor who would make his name back on the small screen _
James Drury, a.k.a., ``The Virginian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ballad of
</P>
<P>
   Cable Hogue'' (1970)
</P>
<P>
   Made immediately after ``The Wild Bunch,'' this is almost the
anti-``Wild Bunch'' _ lyrical, rambling, sweet-natured, idealistic
(though still full of blood, guts, etc.). It is also, Peckinpah
always insisted, his personal favorite of all his films. It's the
story of a prospector (Jason Robards) who's betrayed by his
partners (Peckinpah regulars, L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin) and
left in the desert to die. Instead, he finds water and builds a
thriving business on the stagecoach line.
</P>
<P>
   The making of this film has generated almost as many stories as
such legendary productions as ``Titanic'' and ``Apocalypse Now.''
There were imported hookers, blown-up Gila monsters, 36 people
fired and more. But to bring this all back around to ``The Hi-Lo
Country,'' keep an eye out for the guy riding shotgun for
stagecoach driver, Slim Pickens. He's none other than Max Evans _
the same Max Evans who wrote ``The Hi-Lo
</P>
<P>
   Country.''

   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's music scene can boast another national success. This
local power pop trio, featuring former members of Floyd's Funk
Revival, has a minor radio hit with ``Freak of the Week,'' a snappy
sing-along about teen alienation. The group's debut album for
Elektra offers much more of the same. The first track, ``You're So
Yesterday,'' adroitly introduces the band's schtick: Like
subsequent tunes, it's an unabashed new wave throwback that borrows
heavily from such skinny-tie era phenoms as the Producers and the
Romantics. Too bad the production overall is so generic. It's as if
the major label powers that be sought to temper the group's
retro-kitsch tendencies with big bland dollops of modern
alterna-rock, a la one-hit-won-ders such as Harvey Danger.

   Silkk the Shocker's featured rap on Mya's recent Top 5 R&AMP;B
single ``Movin' On'' made him the high-profile man he is in
hip-hop. Before that, the Shocker was the barely noticed, less than
impressive sidekick whose chopped-off deliveries seemed as layered
and technically tweaked as Janet Jackson's. (But hey, if rap mogul
Master P is your brother _ and he has his artists involved on your
record _ you, too, can make a good rap album.) Silkk's ``thank
you'' is having Mya appear on the somewhat romantic ``Somebody Like
Me.'' It's the first of this boastful effort's many winning
collaborations (``You Know What We Bout'' with Jay-Z, ``All Because
of You'' with Mia X), all of which cloak Silkk's still-rough solo
abilities.

</P>
<P>
   Once part of Brooklyn's highly touted M-BASE collective (the
1980s breeding ground for such current jazz stars as Cassandra
Wilson and Geri Allen), this sharp-thinking alto saxophonist has
been making strides in recent years. Now that his middling efforts
to fuse jazz and hip-hop are a memory, he sounds twice as vital
simply fronting a fired-up quartet. Never fear: Osby can't do
without an edgy concept. In this case, it's a live club session
recorded direct to two-channel DAT and packaged like a fake
bootleg. As conceits go, it's pretty weak: A great percentage of
small-label jazz albums are made this way without any pretense. But
Osby makes his point, and the album's immediacy is exciting, as is
the sizzle and swoop in the saxophonist's versions of Monk,
Ellington, Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins tunes _ and the lyrical
responsiveness of young pianist Jason Moran, clearly a guy to keep
an eye on.

<P>
   ``Kurt and Courtney'' (unrated) _ Kurt Cobain's widow,
rocker-actress Courtney Love, gets a drubbing in this documentary.
Director Nick Broomfield's (``Heidi Fleiss Hollywood Madame'') film
is an unbalanced attempt to investigate rumors that Love was
involved in her husband's death. In interviewing people who knew
the couple, Broomfield never meets a person he doesn't like . . .
so long as that person hates Courtney. Grade: C

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cube'' (R) _ A neat little brain tease of a movie. Mixing
Jean-Paul Sartre, Rod Serling and a touch of slasher-movie mayhem,
it sets us down in the middle of a vast maze of virtually identical
cubicles. Trapped inside is a cross-section of characters culled
from any given disaster flick. None of them knows how they got
inside this giant Rubik's Cube, and they certainly don't know how
to get out. That doesn't stop them from trying. Grade: B -
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Whatever'' (R) _ A painfully earnest, overlong look at a
teen girl's rites of passage. Writer-director Susan Skoog tells the
story of Anna (newcomer Liza Weil), a New Jersey girl who, upon
graduating from high school, decides to cut loose a little. Skoog
fills the movie with party scenes, driving home the point of the
kids' aimless drinking and drugging. Grade: C -

   ``Rush Hour'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   You forgive this action-comedy for being slick and prepackaged
because of its two not-so-secret weapons: Jackie Chan and Chris
Tucker. In this latest recycling of buddy-flick cliches, Chan plays
a Hong Kong cop who comes to Los Angeles to find an ambassador's
kidnapped daughter. Tucker is the local cop who becomes his
unlikely, unwilling partner.
</P>
<P>
   Director Brett Ratner comes a long way from his last project
with Tucker (the lame ``Money Talks''). He knows how to showcase
his stars' talents (Chan's kicks and chops, Tucker's comic motor
mouth) without letting either one take over the show.

 &UR; LOOKING OVER JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   BY IRA BERKOW
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ONE day I found myself on a boat wending its way up the
Bosporus, which not only divides a city -- Istanbul -- but splits
two continents as well. The guide for this morning tour for two was
a young Turk who was doing his job by the numbers. At one point,
leaning over the rail -- it was the Asian side, not the European
side, if memory serves -- he asked what I do for a living in
America. I told him. He came alive. ``Have you ever met Michael
Jordan?'' he asked. I said that I have, that in my line of work
he's rather difficult to avoid. The guide said, ``Oh my God!''
</P>
<P>
   On a safari in Africa, friends of mine saw children come out of
huts without running water or electricity wearing Michael Jordan
No. 23 basketball jerseys. In Paris, in beret, Jordan is hounded.
When he retired on Jan. 13, the front page of a Chinese newspaper
read: ``Flying Man Jordan Coming Back Down to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   I was once in the Jerusalem home of a Nazi hunter for the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. On his bookshelf, among his tomes of pursuit,
were ``The Jordan Rules'' and ``Rare Air,'' two excellent books on
the life and times of one Michael Jeffrey Jordan. He will have to
make room for another book. ``Playing for Keeps'' doesn't have the
bite of Sam Smith's ``Jordan Rules'' or the glories of Walter Iooss
Jr.'s photographs in ``Rare Air'' (not that it should, since it's
not a picture book). What David Halberstam delivers -- and what the
reader has come to expect from Halberstam -- is insight, balance,
analysis, an assemblage of pertinent anecdotes and the kind of
digging for information you would get from, say, Schliemann's band
of archeologists, hip-high and burrowing deeper into Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam provides a sense of the impact Jordan has had here
and abroad -- he was not only the consummate hoopster but a
pitchman like few others. He was a high-wire act, the cavalry and
Phineas T. Barnum on the stump all rolled into one. He could dazzle
with his aeronautics, pull out a basketball game that appeared
hopelessly lost or sell a pair of sneakers with a smile as genuine
and appealing as rosy dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Michael Factor'' meant a variety of things: he could
elevate a struggling shoe company, Nike, to head-spinning heights;
he could lead a team to six championships in the 1990's; he could
make the difference of nearly nine million more television viewers
during the National Basketball Association finals. And, as
Halberstam says, citing a Forbes magazine estimate, Jordan's
persona ``helped generate $10 billion in revenues for the game, its
broadcasters and for his varying corporate partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam quotes some tough-minded folks who exult over Jordan.
Harry Edwards is a black sociologist at the University of
California, Berkeley. ``Wary that the self-evident achievements of
black athletes cast an imposing shadow over many black youths and
pull them away from careers in other fields,'' Halberstam writes,
Edwards ``nonetheless talked about Jordan representing the highest
level of human achievement, on the order of Gandhi, Einstein or
Michelangelo. If, he added, he were in charge of introducing an
alien being 'to the epitome of human potential, creativity,
perseverance and spirit, I would introduce that alien life to
Michael Jordan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the novelist-lawyer Scott Turow follows that with: ``Michael
Jordan plays basketball better than anyone else in the world does
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam's achievement, however, is that he skillfully skirts
hagiography and writes as credible reporter. He tempers the
exuberance. He quotes Tex Winter, the wise old assistant coach of
the Bulls: ``I think Michael's a great, great player, but I'm not
an idolater.'' Halberstam continues: ``The two men had their own
running debate on what constituted good basketball. 'There's no I
in the word team,' Winter would tell him. 'There is in the word
win,' Jordan would answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Jordan's credit, he matured and learned that Winter was
onto something, though it took Jordan seven seasons before he fully
trusted his teammates -- the ``supporting cast,'' as he has
referred to them -- enough to help make them better, and finally
gain a championship. Jordan's winning and crafty personality, his
triumphant play, creative commercials, a canny N.B.A. marketing
strategy and reception worldwide as a crossover superstar, on the
heels of Muhammad Ali, produced this rara avis.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, as drawn by Halberstam, is generous, loyal, thoughtful
but flawed. He can be meanspirited (see his almost cruel riding of
the Bulls' general manager, Jerry Krause). He can be hardheaded (as
in his draft ideas and his resistance to some trades, like that of
the bruising forward Charles Oakley to the Knicks for the bruising
center Bill Cartwright, which Jordan later grudgingly acknowledged
led to the Bulls'
</P>
<P>
   first three championships). And Jordan's ``competitive rage''
borders on the manic, whether he's playing golf and cards for high
stakes or making bets with teammates about whose suitcase will come
off the airport baggage conveyor first (Jordan bribes an attendant
so he can win the wager).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan can also be so protective of his
Nike-Gatorade-Coke-McDonald's-Wheaties-Hanes-etc.
corporate-sponsoring image -- he is, Halberstam underscores, no
Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali or Paul Robeson in the civil rights
arena -- that he would not even support Harvey Gantt, an early
civil rights leader, when he was running for a Senate seat in
Jordan's home state of North Carolina against Jesse Helms, called
by Halberstam ``the nemesis of Carolina blacks (among many
others).'' Republicans buy sneakers, too, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, journalist-cum-social historian, writes that he was
interested not only in the obvious question of what made Jordan so
great an athlete but also in the phenomenon of how a young black
man from the backwaters of Wilmington, N.C., rose to such
improbable prominence. ``Playing for Keeps'' illuminates the many
dramatic changes in sport, society, broadcasting and commerce
during Jordan's time on the national stage, and delineates those
who influenced and assisted him -- from his parents to the North
Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith to the monastic Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The faults in ``Playing for Keeps'' include an occasional excess
of information regarding peripheral aspects of Jordan's life and
lapses in which the language is less than carefully or thriftily
wrought. One oversight occurs when Halberstam suggests that Jordan
is an incarnation of the transformation in sports hype that allows
players today to be promoted above team. He neglects to mention
that Babe Ruth and Red Grange were there decades before, as was the
famous Madison Square Garden marquee, ``Geo Mikan vs. Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Halberstam over all has succeeded in lending perspective to
the world Michael Jordan both made and inherited, as well as in
portraying Michael Jordan the man and not the icon, guiding us, in
effect, beyond the Bosporus.

 &UR; I CAN'T GO ON, ALAN. I'LL GO ON.
</P>
<P>
   BY ROBERT BRUSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THE American director Alan Schneider first met the Irish
playwright Samuel Beckett in 1955, after being hired to direct the
United States premiere of ``Waiting for Godot'' in Miami. Schneider
had come to Beckett's Paris apartment bursting with preproduction
questions, especially regarding the identity of the title
character. To Schneider's initial query, ``Who is Godot?,'' the
laconic playwright famously replied, ``If I knew, I would have said
so in the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, Schneider was to devote most of his career to
realizing Beckett's stated intentions in his plays. But despite his
fidelity to every letter of Beckett's text, and despite the
participation of such popular clowns as Bert Lahr and Tom Ewell,
the Miami production of ``Waiting for Godot'' was a resounding
flop. Baffled by the metaphysical reverberations of a work that had
been billed as ``the laugh riot of two continents,'' a third of the
audience left at intermission. Others lined up at the box office
not to purchase tickets but to ask for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett assumed complete responsibility for the fiasco,
consoling Schneider with a blend of modesty and stoicism that was
to inspire the director's lifelong devotion. ``Success and failure
on the public level never mattered much to me,'' Beckett wrote;
``in fact I feel much more at home with the latter, having breathed
deep of its vivifying air all my writing life.'' From this moment
on, Schneider developed an intense infatuation with Beckett,
amounting to hero worship, and Beckett responded with almost
paternal affection. They soon became faithful pen pals, exchanging
about 500 letters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beckett was extremely protective of his private
correspondence (``I do not want any of my letters to anyone to be
published anywhere,'' he warned Schneider), most of these letters
have now been collected in ``No Author Better Served.'' It has been
edited with a useful introduction and great textual care (if
occasionally incomplete and slipshod footnotes) by the Irish
scholar Maurice Harmon, who respects Beckett's demand for privacy
by deleting any material about his personal life. Harmon's title
encapsulates Beckett's reaction to the punctilious way Schneider
had directed ``Happy Days'' (Beckett, once again ignoring sour
notices, wrote, ``I've the feeling no author was ever better
served''). It was Schneider's reverence for Beckett and his
promotion of the plays in the United States that earned him the
playwright's enduring gratitude and trust (``Thank you again, dear
Alan,'' he writes repeatedly, ``for all you do for my work''). In
return for his devotion, Schneider was rewarded with five Beckett
premieres in this country and went on to stage a total of six
productions of ``Godot,'' six versions of ``Krapp's Last Tape,''
five productions of ``Rockaby'' and two of ``Endgame.'' (Although
Schneider also directed plays by Edward Albee, Harold Pinter, Joe
Orton and Edward Bond, he always seemed to be preoccupied with
Beckett -- that is, when he wasn't staging one of his innumerable
revivals of Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town.'')
</P>
<P>
   Beckett saw none of Schneider's work on the American stage. He
came to this country only once, to watch his protege direct Buster
Keaton in ``Film,'' Beckett's short movie. Nevertheless, at least
in the early days of their relationship, he tried to control
production from a distance. In his very first letter to Schneider,
Beckett warns that although he is not averse to a director's
``changing an odd word here and there or making an odd cut,'' he
demands ``the opportunity of protesting or approving.'' In time,
however, Beckett began to grant Schneider more latitude in
interpreting his plays. Within a few years, he was replying to
Schneider's questions with ``Do it the way you like, Alan, do it
any way you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than take advantage of this freedom, Schneider sought
Beckett's advice on every detail of his productions, even regarding
the exact curve of a painted drop for ``Happy Days'' (``because you
are so far away and this will be the premiere and we all want to do
what you want''). He asked the playwright's permission before
putting sequins on Billie Whitelaw's dress in ``Rockaby,'' before
letting his actors close their eyes for a moment in ``Play.''
Schneider even submitted all his articles and publicity material in
advance of publication for Beckett's approval. He betrayed
Beckett's trust only once (and despised himself for it), when, in
order to placate his producers, he dropped the stipulated da capo
stage direction in the New York production of ``Play'' without
informing the playwright. Having been told of Beckett's hurt
feelings, Schneider wrote (in his autobiographical work,
``Entrances''), ``Why Sam continued to have faith in me after that
I will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's letters often reveal not only his uninterrupted faith
in Schneider but a charming modesty, an engaging self-deprecation.
``I . . . was still three-quarters asleep,'' he writes, ``i.e.
about a quarter more than usual,'' adding, ``I'll take what's left
of my head in my shaky hands and have another go.'' Sometimes
Beckett's self-effacement almost becomes that of a Japanese
diplomat, as when he thanks Schneider for his ``great warmth of
attachment for my dismal person and devotion to my grisly work.''
Gradually, this humility begins to accumulate layers of impatience
with himself and his ``muckheap of a mind.'' Worrying over
Schneider's use of some of his nontheatrical material for the
stage, he writes: ``For me they are abortions. But I suppose what
is not? More or less.'' Elsewhere: ``Forgive this poor scrawl.
Nothing in my head but wordless confusion.'' And elsewhere:
``Struggling with impossible prose. English. With loathing. To
think writing was once pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BECKETT-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: once pleasure.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In return, Schneider, often using gloomy phrases from Beckett's
plays, sends his friend his despairing reflections on the state of
the American theater, American culture and American politics (their
letters cover the period of the Vietnam War). Resolutely
apolitical, Beckett remains sympathetic, though somewhat remote
from Schneider's concerns. He is nevertheless capable of expressing
considerable outrage and contempt, especially regarding the press
and its uncomprehending attitude toward his plays -- ``good bad or
indifferent,'' he complains about his notices, ``they get me down
-- and wondering what possesses these people to be writing about
the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   He is continually exchanging anecdotes with Schneider about
``the jackals,'' the critics, who are ``always nipping you,''
``these bastards of journalists'' who are perpetually
misunderstanding his work, and such birdbrains as ``the Lord
Chamberpot'' who are always trying to censor it. Confessing to
``mental weariness,'' he allows a tone of morbid despair, a longing
for withdrawal, to enter his correspondence. He also begins to grow
increasingly cranky and crotchety. What this hitherto unfailingly
courteous man construes as ``an offensive letter'' from Hume Cronyn
(performing alongside his wife, Jessica Tandy, in an evening of
Beckett) ``discourages me from writing to his wife, to compliment
her.'' As time goes by, even his letters to Schneider become
somewhat clipped and perfunctory. ``Forgive my long silence,'' he
writes. ``No excuse. Just going silent.''
</P>
<P>
   These are also the years when Beckett begins to grow
considerably less flexible about revisionist interpretations of his
work and when Schneider starts to function as something of a secret
agent and self-appointed tattletale. Schneider was perfectly aware
that creative collaborators have an impact on the intentions of a
playwright. In ``Entrances,'' he writes that even Beckett was
``gradually discovering that all actors have imaginations and get
ideas that might seriously affect or even distort the intentions of
an author.'' Nevertheless, he feels compelled to alert Beckett
about a production of ``Endgame'' by the Andre Gregory troupe,
which was ``inclined to use text for own purposes,'' later
reporting, in a long letter, on how ``the production takes such
liberties with your text . . . and with your directions,'' calling
it a ``self-indulgent travesty, determined to be 'different' for
the sake of being 'different.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he would have liked to spare Beckett's feelings in
the matter, Schneider insists that ``the main thing is to protect
the play and you. But how, except to keep it from going on in the
first place?'' But by that time he has got Beckett incensed enough
to consider lawsuits (``My work is not holy writ but this
production sounds truly revolting &AMP; damaging to the play'').
Beckett allowed the show to go on but vowed to stop any attempt to
tour it.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider also feels compelled to caution Beckett about giving
Gordon Davidson of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles rights to
all the plays. He calls another Off Broadway Beckett producer an
``operator,'' not to be trusted. He worries aloud to his
correspondent about ``people climbing on the Sam Beckett
bandwagon.'' Later, after grousing to Beckett about Andrei Serban's
celebrated production of ``The Cherry Orchard'' (``strikes me a bit
like the mustache Dali painted onto Mona Lisa''), he goes to the
Public Theater to spy on Serban's staging of ``Happy Days'' with
Irene Worth, which he grudgingly concedes to be ``more or less
scrupulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider rightly felt a bit vulnerable about making adverse
judgments on other directors and productions ``because there is an
entire cabal of avant-garde critics who feel that I have mesmerized
you into some sort of permanent possession of your works'' and were
``determined to wrest you away from me.'' One of these critics had
been speaking of the need ``to break Alan Schneider's hammerjack on
staging Beckett,'' and it is possible that Schneider may have
sometimes represented himself as the only American painstaking
enough to stage Beckett's plays. For
</P>
<P>
   all his considerable qualities, Schneider was not above the
petty jealousies and competitive backbiting of the theater, and for
all his growing reputation, he was vulnerable to feelings of
persecution. As his friend Edward Albee wrote in an otherwise
friendly preface to ``Entrances,'' ``Even in so horrid a place as
the American theater, the number of people who betrayed Alan is
staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely Schneider has to bear some of the responsibility for
Beckett's growing rigidity about preserving every comma and
parenthesis of his prose. ``I must confess,'' he writes with
typical flattery, ``you are practically the only author whose stage
directions seem so right and so much a part of what you are
writing.'' It is not long before Beckett is refusing permission for
an all-female ``Endgame'' and steaming over ``a scandalous parody
of 'Godot' at the Young Vic. Try to persuade myself I'm past
caring.'' He even refused Ingmar Bergman permission to film
``Waiting for Godot'' because he didn't want the play to be
``Bergmanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Schneider's death in 1984, my own company, the
American Repertory Theater, got into hot water with Beckett when
the director JoAnne Akalaitis set a production of ``Endgame'' in an
abandoned subway station and commissioned a brief overture for it
from Philip Glass. Beckett protested that his play had been
``musicalized,'' objected to the casting of two black actors as
Hamm and Nagg and, quoting his set descriptions, wrote in a program
note that ``any production of 'Endgame' which ignores my stage
directions is completely unacceptable to me.'' (Though he never saw
the production, he added that ``anybody who cares for the work
couldn't fail to be disgusted by this.'') The furor unleashed by
this production, and the unsuccessful efforts of Beckett and his
agents to close it down, eventually made him put a codicil in his
will insisting on control of future productions beyond the grave,
on pain of legal action. Recently, a theater in Washington was
threatened with court action by the Beckett estate after reports
that its black cast members had introduced some hip-hop
interpolations into a production of ``Waiting for Godot.'' Only
through the intercession of Beckett's nephew Edward was the
production permitted to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   There is much debate about the degree of freedom that
playwrights should grant directors in subsequent performances of
their plays. Few will dispute the fact that early performances of a
play deserve the most exacting and faithful attention available.
That is why Alan Schneider was such an ideal director for Beckett
premieres and why he truly deserved the playwright's gratitude.
``No Author Better Served'' not only chronicles the almost
symbiotic relationship between a great writer and a faithful
disciple but adds invaluable epistolary material to the Beckett
canon. Schneider's death ended the relationship, but even his last
moment on earth was spent in homage to Beckett. Schneider was
struck down by a motorcycle in London, having crossed a street to
mail another letter to his friend.

   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THOUGH Rubik's Cubes are no longer a national obsession, those
colorful puzzles may keep coming to mind as you're reading Sharon
Dilworth's second short-story collection, ``Women Drinking
Benedictine.'' Her fiction is just as intricate: whenever one
person moves, another is dislodged, and the pattern of the
narrative grows more elaborate with each turn. But while someone
struggling with a Rubik's Cube tries to twist everything back into
alignment, Dilworth delights in doing the opposite. Characters
initially arranged along familiar axes -- husband and wife, mother
and daughter, boyfriend and girlfriend -- soon find themselves on
unfamiliar ground.
</P>
<P>
   In ``We're in Meadville,'' for example, a restless boyfriend is
given the task of finding his replacement. Dubious but dutiful,
Pete chauffeurs his soon-to-be ex to a series of bars. Why put up
with such a demand? Small-town life, he decides: ``It's like some
sort of drug got into his system, clouding his better judgment and
making him do all kinds of things he wouldn't normally do.'' Many
of Dilworth's characters seem to have swallowed the same drug, and
the collection's best stories are those in which it proves the most
potent.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Martin, the heroine of ``Leather Goods,'' is a case in
point. A lackadaisical saleswoman in a leather boutique, she passes
her days quietly -- until a man arrives with a proposal of
marriage. He needs a wife to gain his inheritance from his mother,
and Winnie agrees to help out. Admonished by the man to ``act like
a wife from Las Vegas'' (where they supposedly got hitched), Winnie
is initially at a loss. But then she thinks: ``Hell, Las Vegas.
They drank like fish in Las Vegas. And she was from Vegas. She
should drink.'' Which she does, matching the mother Scotch for
Scotch until the son becomes fed up with them both.
</P>
<P>
   The same sense of humor that pervades ``Leather Goods'' flashes
throughout the collection. The title story opens with broad, black
comedy: the narrator's sister is methodically trying to get rid of
her husband, Randy. She is ``going about it slowly, not because she
was afraid of being caught, but because she loved Randy too much to
use rat poison or to blow him away with the 30-caliber rifle he's
got hidden between the washer and the dryer.'' But nothing works,
and although Dilworth continues to pile on the incongruities, she
deftly moves the reader from comedy to darker, more desperate
emotions. At the end, an act that earlier in the story might have
felt foolish and funny -- two people skittering across a frozen
lake, balanced on a single bicycle -- somehow becomes poignant,
even brave.
</P>
<P>
   DILWORTH takes a similar turn in her final story, ``Awaken With
My Mother's Dreams,'' which begins with the narrator's aged mother
attempting to kayak over a 50-foot waterfall. The story sparkles as
Dilworth shuttles back and forth in time, taking the measure of the
mother and her three daughters, trying to account for the ill-fated
voyage and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Both this story and ``Women Drinking Benedictine'' finish
strongly and stand out for doing so. In the collection's other
stories, however, Dilworth has a tendency to linger past the
natural finishing point -- an unexpected element of laxity amid
otherwise confident, meticulous craftsmanship. Then again, her
meticulousness -- not including a word more than necessary --
sometimes gets the best of her, or, rather, her characters. She is
occasionally too sparing with her details and observations. In both
``Women Drinking Benedictine'' and ``Awaken With My Mother's
Dreams,'' the story is filtered through complex but relatively
unexplored narrators. This hands-off approach allows Dilworth's
readers admirable latitude in exercising their own judgments, but
her characters are so beguiling it feels stingy of Dilworth not to
lavish more attention on them -- especially after she's lavished so
much on her readers.

   BY DAVID COWARD

</P>
<P>
   Two weeks in the salons of 18th-century Paris convinced Edward
Gibbon that more talk worth remembering was to be heard there than
in ``two or three winters in London.'' After many seasons of
eavesdropping on the public conversation of France's
mid-20th-century intellectuals, Tony Judt delivered no such ringing
endorsement in ``Past Imperfect'' (1992). There he diagnosed
collective moral anesthesia, an infatuation with ideas at the
expense of reality, which led to a very Gallic brand of tunnel
vision. Cocooned in ideology and committed to reading the runes of
history, which alone can judge right and wrong, the best French
brains between the 1920's and the 70's exercised intellect without
responsibility. Judt rehearses his case at the start of ``The
Burden of Responsibility'' as a prelude to a stirring defense of
people excommunicated by the popes of Saint-Germain-des-Pres.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, the progressive defenders of Dreyfus looked to
rights-of-man principles traceable to the French Revolution:
justice, tolerance and individual freedom. Yet from World War I
onward, the revolution ceased to look like a solution and became
the problem. Between the wars, it was at the heart of an
acrimonious political debate waged largely in books, newspapers and
magazines. It was remembered differently, selectively, parochially.
The left was divided; the French Communist Party, refusing to
collaborate with the bourgeois Third Republic, began its long
allegiance to Moscow. The right was wary of any move to meddle with
France's institutions. Radicals and Socialists realized that
attempts to reform the system led to an upsurge of nearfeudal
corporatism, while conservatives and reactionaries regarded
compromise as an opening to wild-eyed Jacobinism. To both it was
clear that the democratic Third Republic had failed, and both were
tempted by authoritarianism. The right looked to 1793 and defended
France by turning xenophobic, anti-Semitic, ultranationalist and
antirepublican. The left fell in love with revolution -- not civil
war but some form of convulsive relief from a bankrupt political
system.
</P>
<P>
   War, defeat, resistance, liberation and the purge that followed
redrew the ideological map of France. According to the
``resistentialist'' myth, the right had collaborated en masse with
Vichy and the Germans and were disqualified from offering a view on
anything. The left, resisters to a man, occupied the moral high
ground and set the intellectual agenda. Few had read Marx, not many
were Communist Party members, but the political and philosophical
debate was dominated by historical Stalinism. Brave Russia,
fighting the new American world order, was continuing the struggle
staged by France (with a nudge from its allies) against the Nazis.
Struck by amnesia about the recent past, immune to the facts of the
present and fascinated by the prospect of violent but nonspecific
revolution, French intellectuals surrendered to a thrilling
ideology. Capitalism was a bourgeois system; Communism was an
ethical idea.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was not free and open. Counter-propositions could be
further countered according to the rules of intellectual
engagement. But dissent -- contesting the terms of a two-sided
debate -- met with denunciation, as though the real enemy were
liberalism. Intellectuals had taken sides for two generations: for
or against Dreyfus, freedom or fascism, collaboration or
resistance, Communism or capitalism, East or West in the cold war
and, in the 1950's, decolonization or empire, all variants of Us
versus Them. The terms of the permanent argument about where France
and the world should go next were set by not just binary but
competing views of the past that polarized attitudes and left the
center empty. Few even considered the possibility that there were
alternatives to the stark choice between left and right,
republicanism and authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Judt's account of what he calls ``The Misjudgment of Paris''
provides a sobering antidote to the glamour of high-profile French
intellectuals who exported the Left Bank to the world. His
sympathies go to those who rejected the grim postwar orthodoxies,
refused to think by numbers and never became rhinoceroses. Some
were foreigners -- Koestler, Silone, Milosz -- and did not find a
welcome in Paris. But there were home-grown examples too, like
Georges Bernanos, Marcel Ayme or the buccaneering Hussards, who
stood for flair and freedom against Socialist Realism and assorted
tyrannies. For Judt, three stand out: Leon Blum (1872-1950), the
moral conscience of French Socialism; Albert Camus (1913-60), a man
handicapped by honesty and a sense of justice; and Raymond Aron
(1905-83), who was sidelined for believing it possible to behave
coherently without making partisan commitments, an attitude
anathema to Sartre's supporters and opponents alike, who committed
themselves for commitment's sake.
</P>
<P>
   All three were outsiders, though in different ways. Blum and
Aron were French Jews, and Camus never stopped feeling Algerian.
Blum had exercised political power, and Aron was a Parisian
mandarin condemned to the periphery of the debate, while Camus
became a renegade for transposing political choices into a moral
key. Their outsiderliness is less significant to Judt than the
common positions they adopted from different directions. Nonaligned
and independent, they opposed both fascism and totalitarianism, and
against the closed society they defended order and authority under
law, justice, conscience and humanizing values. They had the
courage to stand up to their own side and, at considerable cost,
shoulder the burden of truth.
</P>
<P>
   To Auden's man in the street, an intellectual was ``a man who's
untrue to his wife.'' For Judt, most French intellectuals were
untrue to much more. ``The Burden of Responsibility'' is a less
provocative book than ``Past Imperfect,'' in the way novels about
wicked people are more exciting than those about good people. Or is
it because what Judt's three stood for has now been absorbed into
our post-Communist, liberal culture? We might think so were it not
for the fact that the word ``liberal'' has dumped ``values'' and
got into bed with ``market.'' Anyone who regrets the absence, in
intellectual discourse, of ``honor,'' ``spirit,'' ``conscience''
and their ilk, will find in Judt a great deal of talk worth
remembering.

 &UR; ENDANGERED SPECIES
</P>
<P>
   BY MICHAEL GORRA
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many of the men at work in the ``famous Plunkettsburg
Mill'' seem to be missing a piece of themselves -- an ear or a
couple of fingers or sometimes even a foot? What, exactly, gets
made ``in that bastion of industrial democracy?'' Why won't the
townspeople help the stranger among them, an archeologist -- and
our narrator -- known only by the courtesy title of professor?
Might the clue to these mysteries lie in the ``not entirely
pleasant savor of autumn leaves or damp earth'' that flavors the
local beer, called Indian Ring?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions raised by ``In the Black Mill,'' the
last story in ``Werewolves in Their Youth,'' and if I describe it
as much the most successful story in Michael Chabon's second
collection, I must also say that Chabon doesn't officially claim to
have written it at all. The name on its first page belongs instead
to one August Van Zorn, a pulp horror writer who figured as a model
of literary endeavor in Chabon's 1995 novel ``Wonder Boys'': an
English professor and eventual suicide who writes at night ``in a
bentwood rocking chair . . . a bottle of bourbon on the table
before him.'' And although aficionados will doubtless find fault,
``In the Black Mill'' seems to me a letter-perfect pastiche of that
particular kind of midcentury magazine fiction. It stops just sort
of parody, raising one's hair and not one's eyebrows, even as it
also seems to cast a loving wink at the whole ``Weird Tales'' world
of writers like H. P. Lovecraft.
</P>
<P>
   To call this the book's best story is to suggest that Chabon
seems strongest when most self-conscious, when he displays his
control of literary convention and his interest in genre. But the
genre he most often chooses is not, alas, horror or crime or
science fiction -- those things we call genre fiction -- but that
of the mainstream American short story, with its small moments of
epiphany and emotional resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Werewolves in Their Youth'' includes a story set at a
graduation party and another at a bris. A third happens at an
11-year-old's first baseball practice, and a fourth, ``House
Hunting,'' involves, well, house hunting -- a young couple's tour
of a place that's as ``all wrong for them'' as they seem to be for
each other. Such tight and circumscribed situations, so sharply
limited in time as well as place! They are -- or were -- the coffee
spoons by which we measure out our lives, and it's precisely
because they're so standard-issue that the esthetic of such stories
demands they be ripe with the possibility of change.
</P>
<P>
   So in reading ``Green's Book'' or ``The Harris Fetko Story,''
you know from the start that Green -- or, as it may be, Fetko --
will come to some kind of accommodation with his troubled past, a
moment of illumination in which, however briefly, ``everything's
fine.'' Chabon's endings almost always swell into lyricism and his
first sentences read as though, with a change of proper names and
pronouns, you might find them in a book by John Cheever: ``One
afternoon toward the middle of April, Kohn's lawyer, her patience
exhausted, called and said she was giving him one last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the stories' small changes imply a changed fictional
world as well, and at times Chabon does indeed offer something more
reckless than the old-fashioned structure with which his stories
would seem most comfortable. ``House Hunting'' features a drunken
real-estate agent showing what used to be his own house, a place
that his ex has put on the market; as he walks through its rooms,
he keeps on pocketing things, ``a box of nails, a Lufkin tape
measure. . . . and a package of deodorizing shoe inserts.''
Meanwhile the young couple, Daniel and Christy Diamond, tremble on
the brink of discovery: while the real-estate agent goes after the
silver, they're learning, in an upstairs bedroom, that they like
their sex rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son of the Wolfman'' seems equally twisted and baroque. After
five years of fertility treatments, Cara Glanzman has been unable
to conceive; ``this unbroken chain of menses had been a source of
sorrow, dissension, tempest and recrimination'' in her marriage.
Then she is raped, becomes pregnant and decides against an
abortion. Yet Chabon concentrates not on her but on her husband,
Richard, who now finds himself lost: ``His conversation, never
expansive, dwindled to the curtness of a spaghetti western hero. .
. . One Saturday his best friend found him weeping in a men's
room.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be grim, but Chabon plays it as a kind of bitter
comedy in which Richard finds himself unwillingly drawn toward the
delivery room. Both these stories have a mordancy that reminded me
of the Coen brothers' movies ``Fargo'' and ``Raising Arizona.'' And
both stories fail because in their last pages Chabon decides to
tuck in his shirt and dress this material in the literary
equivalent of a blazer and tie. Richard does indeed show up for the
birth, and when ``with a soft slurping sound the entire child came
squirting out'' he catches it; afterward, the family has its
picture taken. Daniel, in ``House Hunting,'' comes to a sudden
understanding of the nature of marriage (``at once a container for
the madness between men and women and a fragile hedge against it'')
and realizes that this ``all wrong'' house is now ``perfect.'' Both
stories make nice: the mainstream short story's generic need for
resolution imposes a wry conclusion that seems both formally and
emotionally buttoned down. But a story like ``House Hunting'' isn't
really nice at all. Its premise and its comfortable ending
contradict each other, and while with some writers those mismatched
socks might be intentional, I don't think they are here.
</P>
<P>
   What's most alive in this book is the witty and resonant prose
that has always been Chabon's strength, a prose in which sharp
observation shades into metaphor: ``Inside Harris Fetko the
frontier between petulance and rage was generally left unguarded,
and he crossed it now without slowing down.'' Yet such prose does
have its risks, and Chabon seems incapable of resisting a clever
simile. In ``That Was Me,'' a drunk awakens to the pop of an
opening beer can ``like a dog at the sound of a can opener grinding
away on its evening Alpo,'' and in ``House Hunting,'' Daniel and
Christy agree with their real-estate man ``at once, like people
trapped in an empty bus station with a fanatical pamphleteer.''
Those sentences aren't so much clever as simply overwritten, and
Chabon's determined liveliness is a world away from the sense of
manic desperation that makes the work of a writer like Lorrie Moore
so rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Werewolves in Their Youth'' does have its successes. In
addition to ``In the Black Mill,'' I particularly like a story
called ``Mrs. Box,'' in which ``Eddie Zwang, a bankrupt optometrist
. . . the hatch of his car filled with $20,000 worth of stolen
optical equipment,'' decides to pay a sentimental visit to his
ex-wife's grandmother -- who has, it turns out, both a great deal
of jewelry and not a shred of short-term memory. Chabon does well
with fecklessness, and he ends the story at just the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to see these stories as an advance on his
earlier work. Chabon's first novel, ``The Mysteries of
Pittsburgh,'' published in 1988, made him, at 24, one of the
country's most promising writers. ``Promising'' is still the word
I'd choose, but after 10 years and four books that adjective has to
seem a disappointment.Drawing (John Nickle)

 &UR; MA NON TROPPO
</P>
<P>
   BY JONATHAN KEATES
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Italians have never really been happy with the novel as a
literary form. Some might say, more harshly, that they have seldom
altogether seen the point of the exercise. The traditional genesis
of a modern fictional mode in Italy happens in 1825 with Alessandro
Manzoni's ``I Promessi Sposi,'' a work admired for style almost
more than for content and, despite allusions to contemporary
politics, resolutely historical in setting and atmosphere. From
then on, the genre becomes a playground for dilettantism, technical
experiment and symbolist fantasy. A writer like Italo Calvino,
whose influence on modern Italian letters has been disastrous, is
thus not so much a dazzling anomaly as the inevitable result of a
novel-writing tradition without its equivalents of Dickens, Balzac
or Dostoyevsky and not (apart from a few writers like Silone and
Bassani) especially interested in the moral conflicts at the core
of everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Even such notable exceptions as Alberto Moravia, inexorably
placing his characters against a background of Mussolini's rise and
fall or the postwar economic reconstruction, are now firmly
pigeonholed as realists, hence culturally passe like their
contemporaries among the directors of Italy's most exciting movie
epoch, Visconti, De Sica and Rossellini. In a nation obsessed with
novelty, fiction often seems reduced to a sequence of ideas whose
time has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, however, this restless awareness of the novel as
something to be continually dismantled and reassembled has
encouraged several arresting talents among more recent Italian
writers. Paolo Maurensig is one of these -- remarkable for, among
other things, having entered the literary arena in his 50's with
his first novel, ``The Luneburg Variation,'' which is based on his
passion for chess. From an equally consuming love of music comes
his second novel, ``Canone Inverso,'' whose translation by Jenny
McPhee reveals a greater sensitivity than most to the specialized
world of musicianship, antique instruments and performance style
that furnishes one of the book's significant dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative structure of ``Canone Inverso'' corresponds,
however vaguely, to the formal outline suggested by the title. Just
as in music an inverse canon feeds the player or listener with
ideas that are simultaneously pared away by its reversal, so the
story is steadily turned inside out, producing a solution of sorts
-- though one that leaves us feeling distinctly uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   The first of Maurensig's two, three or even four narrators
(since the ``I'' is handed on, during the book's opening pages,
with the ease of a relay-race baton) is the purchaser of a rare
17th-century violin, the work of the admired Tyrolean Jakob
Stainer, at a London auction. All the buyer knows of the
instrument's origin is that it has previously belonged to a
psychiatric institute in Vienna. The violin has excited the
curiosity of a man who follows its new owner back to his hotel and
reveals that he possesses more information about its provenance,
adding enigmatically that the story is ``one that I wish to get to
the end of.''
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from the stranger's account is a classic case of
reality arriving just in time to supply the imaginative demands of
art. For the tale he once wished to write, invoking music as its
central theme, is given to him ready-made by an itinerant fiddler
named Jeno Varga, encountered in a Viennese cafe. The crucial
detail on which the narrative hangs is the fact that the wanderer's
violin is also a Stainer -- bearing, like its auctioned
counterpart, a head in place of the usual scroll, a head whose
mouth is open in what seems like a perpetual cry of pain.
</P>
<P>
   That cry reverberates through the novel as an account of Varga's
career unfolds against the economically sketched but unshakably
precise backdrop of a Central European life in music during the
1930's. At a conservatory somewhere in the Danube Valley, he makes
art his religion with the help of Kuno Blau, an enchanting if
somewhat capricious fellow pupil. A summer at Kuno's family castle
ought to be idyllic, but instead is fraught with menance. Kuno's
grandmother, the deranged Baroness, associates Jeno with a
mysterious relative whose body has been stolen from its freshly dug
grave. Kuno himself unaccountably kills a favorite hunting dog and
later, during a disastrous rehearsal with a visiting composer,
succumbs to a potentially fatal fit of teeth-gnashing rage.
Separated from his friend, Jeno dreams that he too is part of the
family and unlocks the door of a certain room Kuno has carefully
avoided showing him in order to test the truth underlying his
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely from a formal aspect that ``Canone Inverso'' is
intended as a verbal essay in musical style. Maurensig follows the
relationship of any proficient composer to his audience by
regularly thwarting the reader's expectations about the kind of
novel this might become. A detective story in the making turns
rapidly into an account of adolescent rites of passage, followed by
something foreshadowing a drama of vampirism and spectral
possession before reaching its close via a case history of
schizophrenia. We return to the home key, there is material for a
cadenza, followed by an obvious coda, but the resolution, it should
be stressed, is apparent rather than confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Maurensig's influences are those of northern rather
than southern Europe. The haunted violin theme, the sentimental
friendship of two boys and the interlocking narratives recall
German Romantic writers like E. T. A. Hoffmann and Joseph von
Eichendorff, just as echoes of Isak Dinesen resound in Jeno's visit
to the castle. Yet not everything meshes quite as it should in a
work that makes such a patent appeal to our awareness of a literary
inheritance. Jeno's sporadic interest in the fortunes of a concert
violinist named Sophie Hirschbaum, clumsily handled in terms of its
integration with the dominant plot, becomes a tiresome distraction,
and a supper-table debate on immortality seems calculated simply to
add a ballast of portentousness to an already darkening story line.
</P>
<P>
   The mournful beauty of this sparely proportioned, soberly
recounted story owes much to the sense Maurensig subtly imparts
that Jeno's loneliness is a species of infection communicating
itself to every other character in the book. Drawing on the
artistic techniques of both the 18th and the 19th centuries, he
pronounces a gloomy verdict on the various types of human
alienation created by the 20th.

</P>
<P>
   Philip II, contemporaries were fond of saying, ruled over the
greatest empire that ever was. In fact, the Roman Empire at its
height occupied far more inhabited space. But he certainly ruled
over the most extensive empire, and -- with the conquest of the
Philippines in 1565 -- the first truly global one. When he died in
1598 he was the most powerful monarch in the Western world. But he
left behind a badly weakened conglomerate of states, divided
religiously and culturally, economically unstable and, at least in
Europe, in retreat. His successors, Philip III and Philip IV, would
be able to do little as Spain steadily lost ground to its old rival
France and the rising new commercial powers of England and the
Netherlands. Like all those who sought to control what Edmund Burke
called ``extensive and detached empire,'' Philip faced a finally
intractable problem of how to keep together regions that were
distant from Spain and from one another and whose sense of
attachment to their King could be tenuous at times. As the Roman
historian Livy famously remarked, every empire had been built up
one piece at a time, but it had to be held together as a whole. In
the days before modern information technology and modern weaponry,
however, holding it together as a whole had, as the Romans
themselves discovered, generally proved to be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Parker has already written extensively about Philip.
His new book is not so much a biography, although it covers much of
Philip's life in painstaking detail, as a consideration of the
question: Did Philip II have a ``grand strategy'' for holding his
empire together, and if so what was it? Parker does not really
provide an answer, although the book ends by assuming that he did,
and that, although in general it was not exactly a failure, it
could have been better. On his death, Philip had lost a part of
what both he, like his father Charles V before him, regarded as the
jewel in their crown: the Netherlands. True, he was able to hold on
to most of what is now modern Belgium and Luxembourg, but only at
crippling expense. The war against the Dutch, one of his advisers
lamented, was a ``voracious monster which gobbles up the troops and
treasure of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a new state in Holland -- Protestant and
republican -- was also a crushing ideological blow. He had added
Portugal, and with Portugal all the Portuguese settlements
overseas, and the Philippines, and consolidated his hold over large
areas of Central and South America. However, it was clear that
Portugal could not be maintained for long, while English and Dutch
privateers preyed constantly on Portuguese and Spanish shipping in
the East and West Indies. England -- against which in 1588 he had
sent the greatest fleet ever assembled -- was a lot stronger at the
end of his reign than at the beginning. The Protestant Reformation,
the source of most of his difficulties, had divided Europe
permanently in two and unleashed confessional wars that would not
cease until well into the following century.
</P>
<P>
   Philip's overextended domains presented many problems that were
to afflict subsequent imperial rulers. Like his great rival, the
Ottoman Sultan, and such later imperial rulers as Stalin and Hitler
(all of whom Parker compares him with) Philip had constantly to
shift attention from one front to another. In the north he had the
Dutch rebels, England and the French Protestants to contend with,
in the south and east the Turks, and potential dissidents
everywhere. Yet, as he himself once wrote, ``one cannot deal
effectively with more than one thing at a time.'' His financial
resources were greater than those of any other European ruler. Yet
the costs of incessant warfare were so high that the monarchy was
frequently bankrupt, and in March 1588 Philip was even driven to
sell his wife's jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Philip's greatest problem, however, was himself. Called by those
who admired him ``the prudent King,'' at best an ambiguous
compliment, he insisted on handling even the smallest detail of his
vastly complex administration himself. When one minister
apologized, saying, ``I am sorry to fatigue your Majesty with such
trifling matters,'' he replied, ``They do not fatigue me, they
delight me!'' He was obsessed not only with matters of state, but
details of etiquette, nuances of grammar, building plans and titles
used at court. He worked excessive hours and generated more paper
than any monarch before or since. As he grew older he complained
increasingly of the strain. In February 1587 he took to his bed
with arthritis, brought on, he believed, by overwork, and did not
emerge until July. In the meantime Sir Francis Drake sacked the
city of Cadiz.
</P>
<P>
   Philip's personalization of power was accompanied by a belief
that only he should be fully informed on every detail of any
situation. He was deeply distrustful of even his most intimate
associates, many of whom were close members of his own family, and
inevitably he did everything with painstaking slowness. In a world
in which news traveled slowly and uncertainly this could be
disastrous. In his long central chapters on the Armada, Parker
shows how delay and distrust were perhaps the key factors in one of
Philip's most humiliating defeats. The English had the weather on
their side. They had superior ships and better guns. But if it had
not been for Philip's ``prudence'' they might still have been
invaded in 1588.
</P>
<P>
   Parker makes frequent comparisons between Philip's apparent
strategies and those employed by modern commanders to show that
despite the great differences separating the 16th from the 20th
century, problems of international warfare remain largely similar
in structure. This is a history that moves backward from the
strategic concerns of today; that gives it an edge and an immediacy
few other books on Philip have achieved. It also insists that human
actions are the outcome not, as so many historians have insisted,
of long-term economic or social forces, but of acts of will. Philip
was as constrained as any ruler by economics (which he barely
understood), by the social world into which he had been born, by
climate and geography and, perhaps most of all, by his religious
beliefs. But his actions, and the ``grand strategy,'' not to
mention the many lesser strategies, he pursued throughout his long
reign were ultimately the outcome of his own decisions. To
understand those we have to understand the man. Parker's highly
detailed but also immensely readable book has come far closer to
that than any previous account of the most enigmatic of Spanish
kings.

 &UR; THE DEVIL'S MIRACLE MAN
</P>
<P>
   BY WALTER REICH
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nazi Germany defaced our century's moral landscape with a chasm
so grotesque that it still won't close. Mangled at its bottom lie
the remains of millions of human beings, victims of the most
fiercely focused genocide the world has ever known. And mangled
there as well is the confidence the world once had in the
possibility of human progress.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that a landscape so violated refuses to heal. And
small wonder, too, that we still search for keys to unlock the
riddle of the Nazi horror. How could the most cultured nation on
earth become the most barbaric? How could it have organized the
murder of Europe's Jews? And how could so many of its citizens have
participated in that murder, or stood by as it was carried out in
their name?
</P>
<P>
   The search for those keys helps explain our insatiable hunger
for histories of the Nazi era. And it helps explain, no less, our
insatiable hunger for biographies -- over a hundred so far -- of
the Nazi leader.
</P>
<P>
   But how well can such studies answer questions that are, in the
end, not only historical and biographical but also philosophical
and human? In particular, how well can they address not only the
fact of killing, and not only the how of it, but also, at both the
social and individual levels, the why? This is, for many at the end
of this most vicious of centuries, the central question about the
Nazi era, driving much of the desire to consume ever more new works
on the subject. To be sure, even without the Holocaust, Nazi
Germany would deserve the closest possible scrutiny. Its rise and
its brutal expansionist war, which itself killed many millions,
require continuing study. But its unique genocidal enterprise
renders the need to understand that era, and its consequences,
especially compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Kershaw, a professor of history at the University of
Sheffield in England, has been studying Nazi Germany for many
years, first as a historian and now as the author of a full-scale
biography. ``Hitler'' covers the period from the man's birth in
1889 to the order he gave German troops to remilitarize the
Rhineland in 1936. During this period, Hitler moved from aimless
anonymity to the dictatorship of a nation that embraced his
leadership. In this, the first of a projected two-volume work,
Kershaw paints a large and rich portrait of both that movement and
that embrace. What can we learn from this portrait? And how close
does it get us to answering the philosophical and human questions
about Nazism's consequences that are, for many, the most pressing
questions of all?
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw has little interest in psychobiography. He doesn't dwell
on the psychological theories, particularly the psychosexual ones,
that have been offered by previous biographers to explain Hitler's
personality and anti-Semitic ideology. To be sure, Kershaw cites
those theories; but he concludes, rightly, that in the main they
are based on conjecture and inadequate information.
</P>
<P>
   The personality characteristics that Hitler would display as a
dictator were already evident in his early years. He was
consistently single-minded, relentless, ruthless, inflexible,
deeply egotistical, megalomaniacal, histrionic, unpredictable,
long-winded and ready to gamble everything on a daring act. He
refused to reverse decisions once he made them. His tirades of
hate, so effective in public speeches during his years in Munich
after World War I, were evident during his early years in Vienna.
Those who knew him in Austria, in his late teens and early 20's,
described the sudden and temporary enthusiasms, wild fantasies and
outbursts of rage that would play important roles during his years
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw's detailed descriptions of Hitler's early life, as well
as the descriptions of the milieu in which he developed, especially
the anti-Semitism of Vienna, help us understand the racist
ideologue that Hitler became. And his careful parsing of those
early years cuts away many of the myths, often propagated by Hitler
himself, about the origins of his most deeply held convictions.
Kershaw suspects, for example, that the famous episode Hitler
described in ``Mein Kampf'' that he claimed opened his eyes to
``the Jewish Question'' -- his encounter in Vienna, after he
arrived there in 1908, with a Jew wearing a black caftan, which
supposedly led him to the conclusion that Jews ``were not Germans
of a special religion, but a people in themselves,'' different from
the rest of humanity -- was probably contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Not contrived was the profound effect on Hitler of Germany's
humiliation and defeat in World War I. It was Hitler's experience
in that war, and in the revolutionary period that followed it, that
transformed him from a failed artist and social dropout, a
``nobody,'' into someone with a cause, a sense of discipline and
belonging, and ultimately, in Munich, a peerless propagandist and
beer hall agitator who finally discovered his powers as a speaker.
Through simplicity and repetition, and his focus on a betrayed
Fatherland, he was able to mobilize the emotions of ever larger
crowds. After 1919, he identified the figure of the Jew as lying
behind all the misfortunes that had befallen Germany. Jews had to
be removed. At that time, he probably meant expulsion. But the
language, read now, is chilling. ``Don't think that you can combat
racial tuberculosis,'' he said in 1920, ``without seeing to it that
the people is freed from the causative organ of racial
tuberculosis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kershaw's central biographical aims have to do less with
personality, early experiences and even ideology than with the
nature and development of Hitler's power. ``What has continued in
the writing of the book to interest me more than the strange
character of the man who held Germany's fate in his hands between
1933 and 1945,'' he says, ``is the question of how Hitler was
possible: not just how this initially most unlikely pretender to
high state office could gain power; but how he was able to extend
that power until it became absolute, until field marshals were
prepared to obey without question the orders of a former corporal,
until highly skilled 'professionals' and clever minds in all walks
of life were ready to pay uncritical obeisance to an autodidact
whose only indisputable talent was one for stirring up the base
emotions of the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HITLER-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of the masses.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw rejects the idea that Hitler was a simple political
opportunist, or a demonic figure who was the sole cause of Nazi
Germany's actions, or merely an agent of historical forces, or a
madman. He describes Hitler, as have others before him, as an
``unperson,'' someone who had very little personal life or history
beyond his life as a public figure. Kershaw's is, he says, a
biography of Hitler's power -- of how Hitler became and acted as
the Fuhrer and of how he was given the power to act that way by his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a power that was almost derailed at numerous times, but
was saved by a variety of people and circumstances. Hitler's
appointment to the chancellorship in 1933 was at least as much a
result of the political miscalculations of others as it was of
Hitler's own actions. Earlier in his career, had Hitler received a
more severe jail sentence than he did after his beer hall putsch in
1923, his fortunes, and the world's, would almost surely have been
different. And had the Depression not occurred, German democracy
might have had more support than it did from the German people. But
Hitler was hardly a passive factor in German history. He deftly
exploited the circumstances in Germany that suited his talents and
ideology. He played to the general fear of Bolshevism, resentments
about national humiliation, widespread anti-Semitism, the desire
for a new and better society and the search for national
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw successfully illuminates the strange and at times
ecstatic dance in which Hitler and Germany engaged as his power
grew. He was certainly the single most important human element in
the development of Nazism. Without him there would have been no
Holocaust. And, as Kershaw argues, without Hitler there probably
would not have been a general European war by the end of the
1930's. But German society made a welcoming place for him, and it
joined him, in crucial ways, in building the Nazi enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw's masterly analysis of German responses to Hitler makes
evident how deeply intertwined and mutually reinforcing the man and
his audience were. On hearing Hitler speak in Hamburg in 1932, one
schoolteacher extolled him as ``the helper, savior, the redeemer
from overgreat distress.'' Hitler knew of his salvational impact on
many Germans -- and came to believe it. A few months after the
German march into the Rhineland in 1936, Hitler addressed Nazi
Party functionaries with messianic allusions: ``How deeply we feel
once more in this hour the miracle that has brought us together!
Once you heard the voice of a man, and it spoke to your hearts; it
awakened you, and you followed that voice.'' And, two days later,
he said: ``That you have found me . . . among so many millions is
the miracle of our time! And that I have found you, that is
Germany's fortune!'' It is this utter acceptance by Hitler of the
adulation of others that Kershaw considers the Fuhrer's hubris --
the overweening arrogance that, in life as in myth, courts
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this volume, we understand how Hitler could have
become so identified with Germany, and it with him. Kershaw is able
to clarify, perhaps better than any biographer who preceded him,
what made Hitler's dictatorial power possible. But does an
understanding of this identification and this power, and of
Hitler's personality and development, provide the keys for
understanding the military and genocidal calamity they produced?
</P>
<P>
   It's surely premature to ask that question. After all, we don't
yet have the second volume of Kershaw's biography, which will cover
the unfolding of that calamity. But in order to understand what
Nazism wrought, especially the Holocaust, we'll have to understand
something more than what we've learned from Kershaw so far. We'll
have to understand how the power that Hitler amassed, and the
society that Germany became, together produced a genocide so
ferocious that it disfigured the image of humanity itself. To
understand this will require more than history and biography as
they are usually written. It will require a perspective that is
deeply informed by philosophy, psychology, accounts of personal
experience, even literature. It will require insights not only into
how Germans carried out the Nazi genocidal agenda but also why.
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw has brought us, successfully, to the edge of the Nazi
chasm. He now has to provide us with the lenses we'll need to peer
directly into its bloody maw and begin to comprehend humanity's
most wild and terrifying acts. One looks forward to his second
volume with urgent expectation.

   And Other Stories.

 &UR; TRANS-ATLANTIC FLIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   BY A. O. SCOTT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The publication of ``Heavy Water,'' a gathering of nine stories,
most of them published in this decade, nearly half in The New
Yorker, provides a good opportunity to state plainly what has been
apparent for some time: Martin Amis is the best American writer
England has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know, there is the matter of his long career as a
journalist and book reviewer for publications like The Spectator
and The Observer, his passion for darts and the fact that his
father, Kingsley, was perhaps the least American writer England has
ever produced. But these are accidents of birth. Heredity is a
hopelessly European concept; America is a land of self-invention,
where identity is less a birthright than a consumer choice.
Literary descent, in any case, is not paternal but avuncular and
fraternal, and young Martin's literary uncles and elder brothers
have been, overwhelmingly, Yanks: John Updike, Norman Mailer,
Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, Vladimir Nabokov and Saul Bellow.
Bellow may be the only living writer Amis has permitted himself to
admire without qualification. He is the subject of the first and
last essays in ``The Moronic Inferno,'' Amis's 1986 collection of
meditations on his spiritual home, as well as the source of the
book's title. He also earns an extended appreciation in ``Visiting
Mrs. Nabokov,'' a volume of literary journalism Amis published in
1993. And Bellow's sensibility is the one Amis has most
successfully absorbed as he has grown from precocious youth to
precocious middle age. Like Bellow, he combines sophistication and
vulgarity so skillfully that it's hard to tell which is which. Like
Bellow, he is at once a snob and a democrat, a voracious brain and
a churning gut, a seminar-room grandee and a barroom brawler. Like
Bellow's, his contempt for his most vivid characters -- Keith
Talent, John Self, Richard Tull -- looks like the highest form of
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``When success happens to an English writer,'' Amis once wrote
in a profile of Kurt Vonnegut, another cherished uncle, ``he
acquires a new typewriter. When success happens to an American
writer, he acquires a new life. The transformation is more or less
inexorable.'' A few years ago, as if to prove that this axiom
applied to him, Amis dumped his first wife and his longtime agent
and had his teeth fixed. British literary opinion erupted in a
chorus of sniffy disapproval audible even on this side of the
Atlantic. But in America, where the outcry garnered a fair amount
of press, there's no such thing as bad publicity. The outrage of
his erstwhile countrymen, Amis told Time magazine, ``contained a
strong element of old-fashioned anti-Americanism. I had an American
agent, an American dentist and an American girlfriend.'' He also
has a particularly American kind of ambition. I don't just mean his
appetite for money, success, information and their correlatives --
summers in the Hamptons, perfect teeth, enormous advances. I mean
his literary ambition, his taste for scale, scope and importance.
Amis has rarely been content to reflect the way we live now; he has
to tell us what it's all about. And so he has occasionally fallen
prey to some of the vices that afflict our most talented writers --
gigantism, obscurantism and pomposity. He nearly buried the satire
and suspense of ``London Fields'' in dense meditations on
epistemological indeterminacy and nuclear apocalypse. Not content
to deliver the definitive study of literary envy in an age of
postliterate celebrity, he festooned ``The Information'' with
cryptic ruminations on . . . something. (``Beware the man at the
call box, with the suitcase: this man is you. The planesaw whines,
whining for its planesaw mummy. And then there is the information,
which is nothing, and comes at night.'') And ``Night Train,'' last
year's cosmological police procedural, unfolded in a large American
city that owed less to Bellow's Chicago than to the fever dreams of
Parisian intellectuals who imagine American life to be either
spaghetti western or film noir.
</P>
<P>
   But Amis has compensated for these faults with his reckless
bravado and his terrifying cleverness, both of which are abundantly
evident in ``Heavy Water.'' Some of the most interesting stories
seem to have been written on a dare, or as entries in a contest to
see who could get the best results from the worst ideas. Amis is an
old hand at this game, having played it with triumphant virtuosity
in ``Time's Arrow,'' a novel about the Holocaust that progresses
backward in time, narrated by a homunculus living in the
protagonist's brain. Why did Amis do it? Because he could.
``Straight Fiction,'' ``Career Move'' and ``The Janitor on Mars''
inspire the same puzzled question, and the same amazed answer. In
these stories, Amis applies his comic timing, his perfect pitch and
his curatorial eye to some of the burning issues of our time: What
if heterosexual people were an oppressed minority and homosexuality
was the cultural and sexual norm? (``In the Castro, it seemed,
everyone was straight. The whole community. They had straight
greengrocers, straight bank tellers, straight mailmen. They even
had straight cops.'') What if screenwriting were the occupation of
scruffy losers, and poets swam through seas of money, glamour and
celebrity? ('' 'I always thought of ``Sonnet'' as an art poem,'
said Joe. 'But sonnets are so hot now I've started thinking more
commercially.' ``) What if we discovered a robot on Mars who knew
how and when the world would end? (``Among the countless trillions
of type-y worlds so far catalogued, none, I can confidently
divulge, presents a picture of such agonizing retardation as Mother
Earth.'')
</P>
<P>
   It can be objected that these stories are little more than
five-finger exercises -- this description surely applies to ``Let
Me Count the Times,'' which tells of a married businessman's
descent into compulsive onanism. Some readers may find this kind of
schoolboyish showing off a bit unseemly in a man who will turn 50
this year. But brazen insouciance, and the defiance not only of
literary convention but of plain common sense, are the hallmarks of
Amis's mature style. The two earliest stories in ``Heavy Water'' --
``Denton's Death,'' first published in 1976, and the title story,
published in 1978 and revised two years ago -- seem callow in
comparison with the more recent ones, partly because of their
earnest cultivation of literary seriousness. They read like pale,
blurry imitations of the work of Amis's friend Ian McEwan of the
same period. But whereas McEwan's tales of intimate terror unfold
with nightmarish clarity, Amis strains to cultivate an air of
mystery and menace and ends up in a clammy fog of pretentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-AMIS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: pretentiousness.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the more flamboyantly Amis pretends, the truer his vision
seems. The three strongest stories here are brilliant contrivances
and masterpieces of realism all at once. Two of them -- ``The
Coincidence of the Arts'' and ``State of England'' -- are worthy of
Bellow. ``Coincidence'' recycles a detail from one of the Bellow
profiles in ``The Moronic Inferno'' -- a sign that advertises art
supplies ``for the artist in everyone,'' which here inspires a long
riff on the esthetic profligacy of late-20th-century New York City:
</P>
<P>
   ``But everyone was already an artist. The coffee-shop waiters
and waitresses were, of course, actors and actresses; and the
people they served were all librettists and scenarists, harpists,
pointillists, ceramicists, caricaturists, contrapuntalists. . . .
The AC installers were all installationists. The construction
workers were all constructivists.'' The story's attitudes and
situations are recognizably Bellovian: sexual double-dealing,
social climbing, racial anxiety and the seething stew of violence
and opportunity that defines American cities. Without spoiling too
much: A slightly unhinged chess hustler is convinced he's a
literary genius, and presses an enormous manuscript on the hero, a
louche English aristocrat named Sir Rodney Peel, who, ``after many
soggy years of artistic and sexual failure, in London, SW3 . . .
was now savoring their opposites, in New York.'' To complicate
matters, Rodney's greatest sexual success is with the would-be
novelist's wife, who turns out to be, of all things, English.
</P>
<P>
   ``State of England'' inverts this joke, presenting a suburban
London that might as well be -- Chicago. The state of England is
that it's become a classless, multicultural society obsessed with
sports, children, cell phones and the profit motive: ``Now that
prejudice was gone everyone could relax and concentrate on money,''
observes Mal, a thug with a heart of gold in the throes of an
Updikean midlife crisis. For all its comic exaggeration and
idiomatic playfulness, ``State of England'' is a surprisingly
poignant variation on some of the characteristic themes of modern
American fiction: the estrangement of fathers from sons, the empty
anomie of affluence and the stubborn refusal of grown men to behave
like adults.
</P>
<P>
   The most extraordinary story in the collection -- the most
outrageous piece of gimmickry and the most touching evocation of
reality -- is the last one, ``What Happened to Me on My Holiday.''
The tale, at heart a fairly conventional treatment of a boy's
coming of age through his understanding of loss, is told in a
highly stylized phonetic rendering of American adolescent diction:
``As I zed, we wend do my dad's a liddle earlier than blanned, this
year, journeying down vram the Gabe do Lang Island.'' This is one
of the easier passages: the experience as a whole is something like
fighting your way through Chaucer only to discover you're reading
``The Catcher in the Rye.'' But the oddest thing is that the
narrator (who internal evidence suggests is Amis's own son) is
British. He says ``holiday'' instead of ``vacation,'' ``chuck''
instead of ``throw,''
</P>
<P>
   ``loads'' instead of ``lots'' and uses ``journey'' as a verb. He
admits as much: ``I go do zgool in London and my bronunziation is
English -- glear, even vaindly Agzonian, the zame as my dad's.''
But the boy has adopted his peculiar mode of speech in order to
short-circuit this hereditary clarity: ``There is thiz zdrange
resizdanze,'' he observes. What he means is that the hard facts of
life and death frustrate even -- or especially -- the cleverest
attempts to make sense of them. This is something Amis knows well:
it's a point he has devised ever more extravagantly clever ways of
making.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American English (along with American culture,
American fast food and American capitalism) is establishing
dominion over the globe, ``What Happened to Me on My Holiday''
reinvents it as a strange, barbarous dialect. And the core of
``Heavy Water'' -- the short fiction Amis has published in American
magazines in the 1990's -- envisions the moronic inferno of
American global dominance as a divine comedy: crude, protean and
full of possibility. We should be glad he's one of us.

   The Life and Work of an American Composer, 1867-1944.

 &UR; GIRL INTERRUPTED AT HER MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   BY LAWSON TAITTE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BY the time she was a year old, Amy Marcy Cheney could hum 40
tunes accurately in the key in which she first heard them. At 2,
she improvised alto parts to lullabies her mother sang. Finally
permitted to approach her mother's piano when she was 4, Amy
immediately played her favorite tunes, aptly harmonized, picked out
bass accompaniments to any melody and also made up original pieces
in her head, without recourse to a keyboard. One, ``Mamma's
Waltz,'' survives. Its 180 measures exhibit a reasonably
sophisticated structure and some piquant harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   Simmering just below the surface of Adrienne Fried Block's
consistently interesting biography of America's first notable
female composer is an unanswerable but profoundly disquieting
question: If this prodigiously gifted person had had the nurture
and the opportunities to explore that Mozart had, might she have
accomplished as much?
</P>
<P>
   Although she works hard at giving a balanced portrait, Block, a
co-director of the Project for the Study of Women in Music at the
City University of New York, looks askance at the upbringing of the
composer known in her lifetime as Mrs. H. H. A. Beach. Victorian
theories of child rearing -- especially as applied to little girls
-- limited Amy's contact with the larger world. Today we would say
she was home schooled: her mother, who was her principal teacher
for most of her childhood, valued her musical talent and encouraged
it within limits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cheneys were a respectable family. They weren't about to
rear a professional pianist, a traveling virtuoso. The restrictions
placed on the prodigy had their positive side. In seeking what they
considered a normal life for their daughter, Amy's parents kept her
from being exploited in the destructive way that Beethoven was, for
instance. And it wasn't as if her talent went unrecognized. After
the Cheneys moved from small-town New Hampshire to Boston -- then
still the country's musical mecca -- the young artist was feted.
Perhaps Amy's socialization was to a large extent limited by the
mores of the day, but this thoroughbred wasn't groomed to pull a
domestic hack. Though she lived to be 77, she never cooked a meal
in her life.
</P>
<P>
   One fateful decision may have had its consequences. After Amy's
potential as a composer had been fully recognized, her parents
sought expert advice on how her gift should be honed. They were
told that it would be best if she learned composition on her own.
The largest question this book raises is what might have happened
if Amy had had guidance from someone more experienced, as Beethoven
had from Haydn or Schubert from Salieri.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, her chief mentor was her husband. At 18, Amy
married a widowed surgeon older than her father. Henry Beach, a
poet and amateur musician, created a studio for his wife on the
second floor of his fashionable Boston house. Although she was
warmly greeted by the public as a piano virtuoso, she apparently
agreed to limit her schedule to a single annual recital -- plus
performances of her own music. As a composer, the young woman was
best known for her songs and short piano pieces. Her husband
immediately encouraged her to attempt a masterwork, a Mass for
soloists, chorus and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Block's ambivalence about the Beach marriage stems from Amy's
virtual abandonment of public performance. No doubt she felt some
frustration over missed opportunities. But this period, when she
was something of a prisoner of Victorian convention and her
husband's solicitous encouragement, produced her only major
orchestral works: the ``Gaelic'' Symphony and the Piano Concerto,
which became her calling card all over the world when she resumed
her performing career after her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Beach's adult life divides neatly into three phases. During
her marriage she established a national reputation and joined the
coterie of Boston composers, generally regarded as America's
finest. Given her youth and the resistance even many of the finest
musical minds of the day had to the idea of a woman composer, this
was an enormous achievement. After Henry's death, when she was
still in her early 40's, she revived her piano career with extended
American tours and long stays in Europe, especially Germany --
interrupted only by World War I. Mostly favorable German reviews
boosted her credibility at home. The main pocket of resistance to
her music in the United States was New York -- then as now filled
with critics suspicious of upstarts from the provinces. During the
war, Beach interrupted her travels once more to care for a dying
cousin and then an aunt, who were by that time her closest
relatives. She lived mostly in New Hampshire again, adored by the
local children and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   When she resumed her musical life in full force, the world was a
different place. She resisted modernism, although she co-opted some
of its techniques. Still the dean of American women composers, she
performed mostly for women's musical clubs. She continued to write
songs and piano works prolifically. She moved to New York, where
she composed regularly for services at St. Bartholemew's Episcopal
Church. The musicians there became pillars of the informal
``family'' she gathered around herself. But, then, musicians all
over the country called her Aunt Amy at her own request.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her gregarious nature, the only time she could
concentrate on large-scale pieces (chamber music plus a chamber
opera, ``Cabildo'') was an annual month at the MacDowell Colony.
That artists' refuge did what Henry Beach had done; it freed her up
by tying her down. It would appear, then, that her growth as a
composer was limited not so much by her upbringing as by her own --
admittedly winning -- personality.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BEACH-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: winning -- personality.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's just one question we might wish Block's biography
addressed in more detail. There are others: In the personal realm,
Henry Beach comes into focus only as his wife's patron and mentor.
We want urgently to know how Amy felt about him as a man. We also
want to know more about her changing religious convictions, since
sacred music loomed so large in her later work.
</P>
<P>
   Block gives us several virtuoso chapters about larger topics
like Boston's self-image as the Athens of America and the World's
Columbian Exposition in Chicago. But she doesn't put Beach into a
wider context of world music. How does her late-Romantic
conservatism compare, for instance, to that of Sir Edward Elgar,
who was a decade older, or to that of Rachmaninoff, a few years
younger? Like Beach, they too absorbed what interested them from
the high modern style in the 1920's and 30's, and disdained the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a fascinating and useful book, and Block has for
the most part chosen wisely what to do and what not to do. She
describes all of Beach's major works in some detail, taking
advantage of the new technologies for reproducing musical type to
offer us bountiful samples of the scores. She rightly declines to
pronounce too definitively on the worth of any particular piece --
or of Amy Beach's work as a whole. If interest in Beach's music
continues to grow as rapidly as it has in the last few years, there
will be time and opportunity to assess it, and Block's study will
be a valuable aid in making a sound assessment possible.

 YOUNG AMERICA
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Flowering of Democracy in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   By Edward L. Widmer.

 &UR; O DEMOCRACY!
</P>
<P>
   BY GARRY WILLS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830's and 1840's, there was a Young Italy movement led
by Giuseppe Mazzini, a Young England movement led by Benjamin
Disraeli, a Young Ireland movement led by Daniel O'Connell and a
Young America movement led by -- John L. O'Sullivan? This
O'Sullivan is not entirely obscure. He invented the term ``Manifest
Destiny'' as a warrant for the country's westward expansion. Edward
L. Widmer argues that O'Sullivan has been underestimated, and so
has his movement. But he can praise Young America only by
distinguishing two phases of it -- Young America I, which was
democratic, and Young America II, which was imperial. YA I was an
effort, led by New Yorkers, to break away from the standards of New
and Old England, to give voice to a new generation. The principal
organ of the group was O'Sullivan's United States Magazine and
Democratic Review, more manageably known as the Democratic Review,
which published the works of rising authors, from Longfellow in the
North to Poe in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Widmer concentrates on three authors in particular -- Hawthorne,
Whitman and Melville -- arguing that their connection with the
magazine made them part of YA I, even though they dismissed or
mocked the poses of YA II. This connection, he believes, made even
Hawthorne an honorary New Yorker in his rebellion against Old and
New England. Perhaps. But Widmer fails to note that O'Sullivan
wooed Hawthorne to the journal by promising that it would be
``designed to be of the highest rank of magazine literature, taking
the ton of the first class in England for model.'' Hardly a
barbaric yawp of Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, the purported Anglophobe, sought the post of consul
in Liverpool, and was given a warm send-off from New England
friends like Longfellow and Emerson. O'Sullivan and Hawthorne were
certainly friends, in part no doubt because Hawthorne needed the
outlet for the two dozen stories he published in the Democratic
Review. But one wonders how well Widmer understands the friendship.
He takes the word of Hawthorne's son that the two men began their
relationship in 1837, when, among other things, Hawthorne went to
Washington to challenge O'Sullivan to a duel over a lady's honor.
Hawthorne's modern biographer Edwin Haviland Miller notes that his
subject did not go to Washington until 1853, when he was seeking a
patronage job from his old schoolmate President Franklin Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Widmer claims that the writings of YA I disprove the current
view that Jacksonian Democrats were not so progressive as once
believed. He admits that O'Sullivan's writers were not concerned
with the plight of blacks or Native Americans. (How could they be,
when their idol, Andrew Jackson, was a slaveholder and an Indian
remover?) But he quotes a rhetoric of newness, youth and democracy
that must have been favored by the Democratic Party, since Martin
Van Buren helped finance the start-up of the Democratic Review from
his 1836 Presidential campaign. Still, O'Sullivan thought that Van
Buren, once in the White House, reneged on his pledges to the
youngsters while continuing to support the status-quotidian
Washington Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Did YA I have any effect on national policy? Widmer himself
admits that ``the radicalism espoused by O'Sullivan, Duyckinck . .
. and their friends did not translate into real political
radicalism of any moment.'' But he asserts that O'Sullivan affected
politics, if not policy, by helping win the New York vote for James
Polk in 1844; and then YA II, also under O'Sullivan, did help
promote the Manifest Destiny mystique Widmer disapproves of. This
was no longer New York speaking, but the slave South and
expansionist West. Stephen Douglas now took up the banner of Young
America, which made Lincoln treat the term with withering scorn.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Americans had their greatest personal success when
some of them were sent abroad as part of Pierce's diplomatic team
after the 1852 election. This was less the result of O'Sullivan's
ideological clout than of Hawthorne's boyhood friendship with the
man for whom he wrote a campaign biography, and Hawthorne's help
did not imply an agreement with the goals of YA II. The
O'Sullivanites abroad were mostly a disaster, trying to resurrect
the revolutionary slogans of 1848 in a Europe recovering from that
spasm.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, the Young America movement seems to collapse back
into the person of O'Sullivan, who was too eccentric to represent
any single ideology. A self-proclaimed aristocrat, a
self-proclaimed revolutionary, a collector of geniuses, a cheater
of geniuses, he led a New York group yet was an ardent supporter of
the Confederacy. The loudest-buzzing bee in his bonnet was Cuba,
which he worked for years to wrest from Spain. With his friend
Evert Duyckinck, the book publisher, he brought new writers to
public attention. But does all this add up to a new and influential
politics? YA I's ideology, such as it was, seems just another
trumpeting of that recurring temptation, American exceptionalism.
Melville gave it a voice in ``White-Jacket'' (1850): ``And we
Americans are the peculiar, chosen people -- the Israel of our
time. . . . God has predestinated, mankind expects, great things
from our race. . . . The rest of the nations must soon be at our
rear.''
</P>
<P>
   Widmer says that his aim was to rescue O'Sullivan from the view
that his only claim to attention is contained in the phrase
``Manifest Destiny.'' Yet that is his most solid if baneful legacy.
The author, who is a White House speechwriter, says he was taken
with the phrase ``Young America'' during the 60's, when he was
exhilarated with the notion of a generational politics. Though he
mentions John F. Kennedy's appeal to youth, he does not explore the
real resemblances between Young America and the New Frontier. The
former frothed up slogans about youth and progress, diverted some
serious writers into a rhetoric they later winced at, yearned for a
power it either recoiled from or used for dreadful purposes. One of
its best-known feats as a group was a strenuous climb up Monument
Mountain in Massachusetts, resembling the publicized touch football
at Hyannis Port. Camelot, too, had its writers and professors
congratulating one another on their youth, its dreamy rhetoric, its
descent into an invasion of Cuba, its imperial call to ``bear any
burden'' in Vietnam. Young America becomes dangerous only when
destiny becomes manifest.

   HOW THE MIND WORKS
</P>
<P>
   By Steven Pinker. Norton, $17.
</P>
<P>
   A psychology professor argues that the mind is not a blank slate
at birth, but comes with specialized modules shaped by natural
selection for communication, perception and everyday tasks. In 1997
our reviewer, Mark Ridley, called this ``witty popular science that
you enjoy reading for the writing as well as for the science.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MIRROR
</P>
<P>
   By Lynn Freed. Ballantine, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious heroine of this stylized historical novel leaves
England after World War I for a new life in South Africa, where she
is hired as a housekeeper by a wealthy Jewish family. After an
affair with the elderly head of the household results in a baby
daughter, she struggles to maintain her independence and control
her romantic destiny against imposing odds. ``Like so many of the
best books, 'The Mirror' makes us laugh while packing, finally, a
punch in which life's sadness prevails over its consolatory moments
of humor,'' Brooke Allen wrote in the Book Review in 1997.

   THE ORDEAL OF INTEGRATION:
</P>
<P>
   Progress and Resentment in America's ``Racial'' Crisis
</P>
<P>
   By Orlando Patterson. Civitas/Counterpoint, $15.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have made remarkable gains over the last 40 years, an
African-American sociologist maintains, but extremists on both the
right and left who deny those gains are impeding further progress.
In 1997 our reviewer, James Q. Wilson, called this provocative
analysis ``defiant, even angry, often right and sometimes wrong.''
Originally published in 1955, Notes of a Native Son, by James
Baldwin (Beacon, $13), is a collection of essays on such disparate
subjects as protest novels, the movie ``Carmen Jones'' and the
death of the author's father. ``Few American writers handle words
more effectively in the essay form than James Baldwin,'' Langston
Hughes wrote here in 1955. Soul on Ice, by Eldridge Cleaver (Delta,
$11.95), is the searing 1960's prison memoir of the former Black
Panther, who died last year at the age of 62. In it, he lashes out
at what he calls a sick country while recounting his own troubles
with the law, which began at 18 with a conviction for marijuana
possession. In 1968 in the Book Review, Charlayne Hunter called
this a ``highly readable and often witty'' book ``about the
imprisonment of men's souls by society.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PRITCHETT CENTURY
</P>
<P>
   By V. S. Pritchett. Modern Library, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Sawdon Pritchett (1900-97) -- novelist, critic, travel
writer and all-round man of letters -- found plenty to write about,
from the Victorian class system to Salman Rushdie. The result is
``a rich anthology'' by ``one of the most versatile and
consistently satisfying writers of the century,'' Alfred Kazin
wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   FACE OF A HERO
</P>
<P>
   By Louis Falstein. Steerforth, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This 1950 autobiographical novel by an aerial gunner during
World War II revolves around the 10-man crew of a B-24 based in
Italy, and the flak and fear they encountered on harrowing bombing
runs to Vienna, Munich and the Po Valley, among other places. In
his review in these pages, Herbert F. West called the story ``both
exciting and important.'' A Walk in the Sun, by Harry Brown
(University of Nebraska, $12), is the grunt-level tale of a platoon
forced to regroup and carry out its mission after losing its
leaders during the Allied landings at Salerno, Italy. '' 'A Walk in
the Sun' is one of the most honest books to come out of this war,''
Harvey Breit wrote here in 1944. ``It is a small novel possessing
dramatic tension'' and ``poetic and realistic speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU SOMEBODY?
</P>
<P>
   The Accidental Memoir of a Dublin Woman
</P>
<P>
   By Nuala O'Faolain. Owl/Holt, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   This candid, dignified account by a columnist for The Irish
Times features the booze, religious repression, guilt and other
mainstays of the modern Irish narrative, but steers clear of its
sentimentality and affectations. ``O'Faolain brings a spiky,
independent intelligence that vanquishes cliche,'' Zoe Heller wrote
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   SNAKE
</P>
<P>
   By Kate Jennings. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This lean novel, set in postwar Australia, is about a mismatched
couple living on a remote farm whose marriage is doomed from Day 1:
She's desperately unhappy and restless, while he's disappointed and
tormented by her shifting moods. '' 'Snake' is clearly the work of
a powerful imagination,'' Carol Shields wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   PUSHKIN HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   By Andrei Bitov. Translated by Susan Brownsberger. Dalkey
Archive, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   This complex Russian novel recounts the life, loves and drunken
death of its upper-class hero during and after Stalin's reign. In
1988 our reviewer, Frank Kermode, admired the book's ``fiery
intelligence,'' adding that ``the author this work most vividly
recalls when at its eloquent and weird best is Dostoyevsky.''
</P>
<P>
   WAITING FOR THE BARBARIANS
</P>
<P>
   By Lewis H. Lapham. Verso, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of Harper's Magazine, in 25 cranky essays that are
nonpartisan in their vitriol, portrays an America where the art of
investing has overtaken the art of governing. Last year our
reviewer, Johanna Berkman, said ``these dour yet witty ruminations
spare no one and nothing.''

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993, Yoko Tawada won the Akutagawa Prize, one of Japan's
highest literary awards, for the title story in THE BRIDEGROOM WAS
A DOG (Kodansha, $19). Here a schoolteacher's retelling of a randy
fairy tale -- involving a young princess promised in marriage to a
dog -- makes her a favorite subject of local gossip. Yet the tale
takes on an unsettling reality when a doglike mystery man quietly
but firmly seduces the teacher, even taking over her housework and
cooking. His aura of mystery dissipates, however, when she learns
that her accomplished lover is on the lam from a wife and a job,
and is carrying on a homosexual affair with the father of one of
her students. In ``Missing Heels,'' a poor mail-order bride,
spiritual sister to Kafka's K., travels by train to an unfamiliar
city, where she moves into the eerie house of her new husband and
finds only circumstantial evidence of his existence: a morning cup
of tea, her daily cash allowance on the night stand, the sounds of
quickly disappearing footsteps. She begins to imagine her husband
as a hideous old man or, more hopefully, a shy, orphaned young heir
-- until her curiosity drives her to break into his locked room and
she finds a reality much stranger than her imaginings. In the last
of this trio of stories, ``The Gotthard Railway,'' it is the
journey rather than the destination that matters when a quirkily
philosophical woman takes a surreal railroad trip through a Swiss
mountain tunnel. As translated by Margaret Mitsutani, Tawada's
slender accounts of alienation achieve a remarkable potency. Each
one sustains a masterly balance between the tenuous but meaningful
connections of dreams and the direct, earthy storytelling of folk
tales. _ MICHAEL PORTER

   IN THE POND
</P>
<P>
   By Ha Jin.
</P>
<P>
   Zoland, $20.
</P>
<P>
   Ha Jin's first novel, ``In the Pond,'' picks up where the short
stories in his recent collection, ``Under the Red Flag,'' left off
-- the dreary Chinese village of Dismount Fort. The author, who
immigrated to the United States from China in 1985, is adept at
evoking the sheer misery of this place, where most of the workers
live in cramped, primitive quarters and look longingly at Workers'
Park, the modern apartment compound reserved for favored employees
of the local fertilizer factory. Shao Bin, a self-made scholar, has
had enough of his downtrodden life, so when his application to live
in Workers' Park is turned down, he begins a war against his
superiors. But what he originally envisions as a battle of the
intellect -- waged through satirical cartoons and witty letters of
complaint -- rapidly disintegrates into a carnival of abuse. Though
art and politics obviously figure in the action, ``In the Pond'' is
first and foremost a comedy -- naughty, lusty, raucously
entertaining. And Ha Jin's language echoes working-class Chinese at
its rough, bawdy best. Unlike Shao Bin, who fancies himself an
elevated man of letters, Ha Jin allows no such pretense into his
novel. ``In the Pond'' is a small tale about small people, and we
delight in the characters' foolishness, as long as there is nothing
crucial at stake. But the screwball plot turns out to have a chilly
center. As soon as he is promised a promotion, Shao Bin cheerfully
puts his grievances behind him. His stubbornness -- not his virtue
-- is what allows him to triumph. _ MEI CHIN

   BRING US THE OLD PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   By Marisa Kantor Stark.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee House Press, $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   In fiction as in life, a worthwhile story is no guarantee of
lively storytelling, just as a distinct voice isn't always
accompanied by enthralling experiences. Regrettably, Marisa Kantor
Stark's first novel demonstrates these unhappy truths. Its central
character, Maime Schatz, is a 92-year-old widow, languishing in a
nursing home, who recalls her Jewish upbringing in Poland, the
atrocities of World War II, her marriage and emigration to America
and the life she led here. The story does extract pathos from
present trivialities that suggest larger, crueler historical
truths. As Maime remarks, ``You shouldn't think it's all of me you
see here.'' Yet despite her vast store of memories, Maime soon
proves tiresome, nattering on in her flat, slightly broken English.
Even some of Maime's recollections seem canned: the weekly Sabbath
preparations during childhood, hiding in the root cellar during the
Nazi occupation and making good as an immigrant in Newark. Her
eperiences compel sympathy -- but that doesn't mean you want to
listen to her for over 200 pages. _ DAVID GALEF

   RARA AVIS
</P>
<P>
   By Jacqueline Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Books &AMP; Company/Turtle Point, $24.50.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual Soraida, as foul-mouthed in English as she is in
Spanish, is the most brilliant conversationalist in Jacqueline
Weld's debut novel, which is set in the 1950's in a town called
Aguas Calientes in an unnamed South American country. Soraida is a
blue and green parrot, and the much-cosseted pet of the Romandia
family. ``Rara Avis'' tells the story of her owners, an eccentric
collection of aristocratic ne'er-do-wells who, on one overheated
day, are summoned to be tried for crimes against the state --
namely, inciting Soraida to recite ``seditious prattle.'' The
action is seen through the eyes of Lita, a daughter of the family,
as she looks back over the years to her 7-year-old self. Yet
despite this lively scenario, her descriptions of the family circle
seem more like a laundry list of dysfunction. Among the cast are
Lita's wild sister, her promiscuous uncle, her charming but
incapable father, her emotionally disturbed mother and a
superstitious maid. When this apparently apolitical clan is placed
under group arrest, their real crime is just being themselves, a
family of dreamers. Though Weld's evocation of hellish heat and
dictatorial politics is clearly etched in this magic realist
nightmare, it is difficult to find anyone here who is likable
enough to care about -- even Soraida. _ MARTHA E. STONE

   SHIMMER
</P>
<P>
   By Sarah Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   Bard/Avon, $23.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is 1950. A whole new decade. Time is running forward, but
morality is running back.'' Such is the observation of one of the
numerous figures marginalized by McCarthy-era ethics in Sarah
Schulman's latest novel. For the three main characters, caught up
in the politics of the so-called Red Scare in New York, morality is
their very undoing. Sylvia Golubowsky, a Jewish lesbian from
Brooklyn, is fired from her newspaper job after the gay bar she
frequents is raided. Austin Van Cleeve, a venal gossip columnist,
feeds names of suspected Communists to the authorities. Meanwhile,
a black playwright named Cal Byfield dreams of integrating Broadway
and seduces a white society woman to finance his production. These
three may seem like one-dimensional figures from a government
propaganda film, but in Schulman's sardonic narrative they are
fully realized and witty individuals. Schulman's concerns range
from blacklisting and anti-Semitism to homophobia, class warfare
and racism. ``Shimmer'' closes with a triptych of unhappy endings
and is told in sometimes awkward flashbacks from 1996. At times,
its attempts to illuminate today's politics through those of an
earlier era can be tenuous. Ultimately, however, this flaw is
redeemed by Schulman's talent, by her lushly drawn characters and
the seamlessly rendered world they inhabit. _ ERICA SANDERS

   NEVERMORE
</P>
<P>
   By Harold Schechter.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Books, $23.
</P>
<P>
   Although all book critics risk offending authors whose work they
trash, few find themselves in the dangerous position in which Edgar
Allan Poe has been placed by Harold Schechter. ``Nevermore''
imagines an afternoon in Baltimore in 1834 when Poe, having
recently savaged the autobiography of Davy Crockett, is confronted
by the enraged frontiersman himself, ready to offer an alternate
esthetic viewpoint in a duel. Fortunately for reviewers everywhere,
before the offended writer is able to vent his fury, thus
establishing a regrettable trend, the unlikely pair is called upon
to help solve a murder, which soon becomes a whole series of
murders. Schechter's entertaining premise is supported by rich
period atmospherics and a plot that keeps the finger of suspicion
wandering until the very end. Told in the first person by Poe
himself and filled with references to his as yet unwritten stories
and poems, the novel unfortunately suffers from overwrought prose.
While capturing its narrator's ornate tone, it lacks his sharpness.
Frequently gasping in terror or fainting in shock, Poe comes across
as something of a self-absorbed fop. Though Davy Crockett is
painted with broad strokes, he seems the more interesting (and
genuine) of the two; perhaps his version of events would have been
more entertaining. _ JAMES POLK

 BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackson Pollock (1912-56), who had little native talent for art
and none for words, revolutionized painting and provoked more words
about his work, and himself, than he probably spoke in his
lifetime. His celebrated ``drip paintings'' -- executed on the
floor, in a series of dancelike movements that became almost as
famous as the canvases themselves through Hans Namuth's photographs
-- have been interpreted as everything from sublimely lyrical works
of art to violent assaults on the whole tradition of painting;
certainly they influenced any number of ``subversive'' artists --
sculptors and performance artists as well as painters -- who came
after him. And Pollock's life, filled as it was with emotional
turmoil that ended with his death in a drunken car crash, has been
variously depicted as the apotheosis of romantic suffering and a
cautionary tale about the dangers of fame in an age of mass media.
All these contradictory theories about the man and his work are
scrupulously explored and evaluated in JACKSON POLLOCK (Museum of
Modern Art/Abrams, $75). Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of painting
and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, and Pepe Karmel, an
adjunct assistant curator, have also made an original contribution
to Pollock scholarship by analyzing the techniques he used to
produce the poured paintings -- techniques that were much more
varied and complex than once was thought. Ironically, as Varnedoe
acknowledges, the beautiful reproductions of these paintings, which
are the centerpiece of the book, can only remind us how much their
extraordinary power depends on their physical presence. The sense
of explosive energy, the feeling that these strangely rhapsodic
objects were never exactly made but simply are, gets lost in
reproduction. So, far from being abstract, they may be the most
concrete paintings ever made. _ EVELYN TOYNTON

   The One-Volume Definitive Edition.
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Holroyd.
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $45.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Shaw is so vast a subject that none will envy the ultimate
biographer,'' The Times of London wrote on the 90th birthday of
George Bernard Shaw. Indeed, Michael Holroyd required more than 15
years to research and write the four volumes of his biography. In
abridging this to one volume, Holroyd emphasizes Shaw (1856-1950)
the literary man; what seems like each of Shaw's 50 dramatic works
is summarized and commented upon, along with his novels, prefaces
and pamphlets. Holroyd proposes that Shaw's penchant for paradox
(``Shadow boxing . . . was the essence of Shavianism'') was a
consequence of his emotionally barren upbringing (``In the lost
childhood . . . the philosophy of G.B.S. was conceived''). Readers
of Holroyd's previous biographies of Lytton Strachey and Augustus
John will recognize his characteristic strengths and weaknesses:
the meticulous scholarship, the scrupulous chronological
accounting, the relentless forward march of the prose, the facile
Freudianizing, the willingness to make mountains of his subjects'
molehills and the odd inability to convey personality. In
particular, Shaw's wit gets lost between dates and exegesis; what
is most present here is a somewhat un-Shavian scribbler. _ MICHAEL

<P>
   Schirmer, $30.

<P>
   The baritone Sherrill Milnes, an opera singer for more than
three decades, takes a light approach to the serious business of
singing opera. In his memoir, ``American Aria,'' he writes of
relaxed moments on stage -- like the time during a performance of
Verdi's ``Forza del Destino'' when he was about to stab the
soprano, Leontyne Price, and she whispered to him, ``You sound like
a million bucks.'' Milnes, a farmer's son from Downers Grove, Ill.,
writes about memories of a childhood milking cows and working the
fields, of his three marriages and his three children, of various
singing jobs, of doing voice-overs for commercials before he became
a major singer. His humor fades when he tells of a throat ailment
in the 1980's, which nearly ended his career, and his painful
dismissal, after 32 years, from the Metropolitan Opera. Still, he
points out, his story has a happy ending -- unlike the Verdi
operas. _ PEGGY CONSTANTINE

   A ROSE FOR MRS. MINIVER
</P>
<P>
   The Life of Greer Garson.
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Troyan.
</P>
<P>
   University Press of Kentucky, $25.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greer Garson once called herself ``The little girl
least likely to succeed,'' her single-minded pursuit of stardom
earned her, while she was still a beginner on the London stage, the
nickname Ca-Reer Garson, Michael Troyan writes in his highly
detailed biography, ``A Rose for Mrs. Miniver.'' Contrary to
Hollywood legend, Troyan writes, Garson was born in London in 1904,
not Ireland in 1908. A relative late-comer to acting because of ill
health in childhood, Garson nonetheless came close in 1939 to
turning down the part that made her an overnight star: the
vivacious young wife in the now classic film ``Goodbye, Mr.
Chips.'' Similarly, two years later, she had to be persuaded to
accept the role with which she remains most closely identified (and
which won her an Academy Award), that of the staunchly patriotic
``Mrs. Miniver.'' Garson feared that the script, which made her the
mother of a grown son, would cause her to seem too matronly. As if
to buck that perception, she began a clandestine affair with
Richard Ney, the actor 14 years her junior who played her son, and
eventually married him. It was her second marriage and, like her
short-lived first one, ended in divorce. Only with her third
marriage, to a Texas millionaire, Buddy Fogelson, in 1949, did she
find enduring compatibility; they remained together until his death
in 1987. Although her box office power declined throughout the
1950s, and her last film was released in 1967, Garson appeared
frequently on television into the 1980s; she died in 1996. Troyan's
narrative is jumpy and lacks insight, but film buffs will enjoy
learning the inside story behind Garson's many memorable
performances, including ``Pride and Prejudice,'' ``Random Harvest''
and ``That Forsyte Woman.'' _ DIANE COLE

   Editors' Note: The fifth and sixth volumes in a series of
collected reporting from The Times's weekly science section are now
available from Lyons Press as THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF INSECTS and
THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF GENETICS ($25 each). Both edited by
Nicholas Wade, they deal with recent discoveries and developments
about the pyramid of creepy crawlies underlying the bees and
butterflies everybody loves, and the microscopic arrangements of
chemicals that make bugs and humans at least superficially
different. The insect volume contains an entire section on the
rituals of insect courtship (often much more disappointing, for one
party, than the worst of human marriages), examines the structural
principles of insect wings and the organization of spider webs, and
anoints the scarab beetle as the earth's indispensable recycler of
animal waste. Reports on the amazing performances of life's genetic
materials include exploration of the future of gene therapy, the
possible applicability of genetics to life extension, a look at of
the architecture of DNA itself and the original report on the first
known successful cloning of an adult mammal, the case of the lamb
known as Dolly -- published, it may be frightening or exhilarating
to observe, just two years ago next month.

 WHAT OUR MOTHERS DIDN'T TELL US

<P>
   Why Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman.

<P>

 &UR; WHEN HAVING IT ALL IS NOT ENOUGH
</P>
<P>
   BY ELIZABETH GLEICK
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   First, the good news: ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us: Why
Happiness Eludes the Modern Woman'' is very short, so Mom, you did
all right. Now for the not-so-good news. Danielle Crittenden, a
conservative commentator and founder of The Women's Quarterly,
announces early on in this provocative book that many women are
unhappy because ``pretending that we are the same as men -- with
similar needs and desires -- has only led many of us to find out,
brutally, how different we really are.'' She believes that when it
comes to negotiating the balance between love, family and work,
``feminism has failed women.''
</P>
<P>
   For many women in their 20s and 30s -- the group Crittenden, who
was born in 1963, is primarily addressing -- to admit that there is
any truth to the above statement amounts to heresy. Feminism, after
all, does not seem to have failed the author, a married mother of
two who is building her own career based on the subject, any more
than it has failed me, also born in 1963, or any of my accomplished
peers, many of whom attended formerly all-male universities, work
in what were once bastions of male power and have had the fun, and
yes, the heartbreak, of more sexual partners than our mothers even
dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a book whose subtitle holds out the promise of
happiness, and whose contents offer a convenient villain, is
tantalizing, and Crittenden correctly homes in on some nagging
questions. Why are so many of these very same accomplished women
single and/or childless, not necessarily by choice? Why does
combining work and motherhood continue to be so treacherous? Why is
there so much divorce?
</P>
<P>
   But the author would like to have things both ways. In brief
anecdotal chapters she repeatedly insists that she is not
advocating ``going back,'' and yet writes statements like this:
``For all the scorn that has been leveled against the marriages of
the 1950's, those of us who are too young to have experienced them
can only read about them with a kind of awe and -- dare I say it?
-- wistfulness.'' We do? As we leave little Jake at the day care
center, we may feel the impossibility of ``having it all''; as we
look for a suitable spouse we may long for a modern equivalent of
those ``loyal, responsible, hardworking dads'' of yesteryear. But
abstaining from premarital sex, returning to the days of brief
courtships and ``good enough'' marriages, or having children young
and hoping the career, if there is to be one, will sort itself out
later -- all of which Crittenden advocates in this book -- seem
less than realistic given the social fluidity and economic
transformations of the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   For the book's greatest flaw is that Crittenden virtually
ignores the most significant change to have hit Americans in recent
decades: the changing nature of work itself. She argues that
feminism has created a Catch-22: many women work because, deep
down, they fear the prospect of finding themselves divorced and
having to fend for themselves and their children, but their very
insistence on such independence dooms both their chances of finding
a mate and their marriages, which should be nurturing partnerships
rather than constant negotiations. ``It may be that in order for
modern women to have the marriages we want, we will have to stop
being so preoccupied about our identities, and instead develop an
appreciation for the mutual, if differing, contributions we make to
marriage as men and women,'' she writes -- meaning, he:
breadwinner, she: mommy.
</P>
<P>
   But surely another reason many women work today even if they
would rather stay at home is that no one, male or female, can
depend on a job for life any longer. Leave the breadwinning to one
partner, and what happens if he loses his job? The world of work
today, just like the modern marriage, is one of constant flux. And
while it is hard to disagree with the author's suggestion that
government, employers and peers should make it easier for women not
to work when they are raising children, the fact remains that most
employers seek not older, seasoned workers, but younger, cheaper
ones with fewer strings -- like families -- attached.
</P>
<P>
   There is much else that Crittenden glosses over. The chapter on
aging, for instance, does not explain how marrying younger and
delaying one's career can mitigate problems caused by the declining
sexual attractiveness and social power of older women -- a subject
the author harps on throughout the book. And what of the happiness
of the modern man?
</P>
<P>
   Though it might make for a less catchy book title, perhaps the
problem is not feminism but the relatively recent notion that
``happiness'' is within our grasp, that we can all have everything
we want, when we want it, without making sacrifices. This is a
point not only our mothers, but our fathers, too, would probably
like to make -- without necessarily advocating a return to their
way of life.

 &UR; THE STIFLED LIFE
</P>
<P>
   BY CLAIRE MESSUD
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The title of Anita Brookner's latest lament for the unlived life
is drawn from the final words of a shipping forecast heard on the
radio; but it also refers to the premature decline of the two
middle-aged women at the center of the novel, Beatrice and Miriam
Sharpe. ``This was not maturity so much as anticlimax,'' observes
Beatrice, the elder of the two sisters. ``She had not been warned
about this, but had to accept its reality, rather earlier than she
had anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatrice, a disappointed romantic, is a pianist whose career as
an accompanist comes to an unexpected end and who subsequently
finds herself drifting through her days, hovering between shame and
relieved resignation. She ``now embraced vacancy as a state to
which she had always been condemned.'' In the course of the novel,
she succumbs to a series of mild strokes that lead, indirectly, to
her sudden death. Meanwhile, her sister, Miriam, whose routines as
a translator of French novels are disrupted first by a decorous
love affair and then by her sister's illness, is less ready to
relinquish the thrill of experience, and although she suffers not
only the loss of Beatrice but also that of a new friend named Tom
Rivers, she is granted a modicum of hope, in the form of courage.
Miriam is, above all, courageous: from the first, we are told that
``if life were dull, as she had never expected it to be, she had
always been stoical in the face of dullness.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookner is, of course, the unrivaled mistress of the stifled
life. Her novels are almost unbearable in their unflinching
examination of isolation and disappointment; their elegant phrases
and circumlocutory analyses, superficially obfuscatory, ultimately
serve only to heighten the hideous bleakness of her characters'
lives. Miriam and Beatrice, like so many of Brookner's creations,
are willfully hermitic. Beatrice has never found love because,
unwilling to sacrifice her romantic ideals -- based on novels that
her sister deplores -- she has waited in vain for Prince Charming
to alight upon her doorstep. Miriam, after a brief, late marriage
made in the spirit of compromise (``She put in train certain plans
of her own,'' Brookner writes of Miriam's choice of husband,
``searching out the candidate least likely to disappoint her''), is
single again, beetling her way between her apartment and the London
Library. She encounters Simon Haggard, the married man who becomes
her lover, only because he is Beatrice's new agent; and she meets
Tom Rivers, improbably, on a gloomy solo walk to Regent's Park on
Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharpe sisters' confinement initially seems like passivity.
Of Miriam's career, we are told that ``normally she was on quiet
terms of acquiescence with the work she was employed to do,
peacefully translating contemporary novels of no particular merit
into English. It was not work she had actively sought; rather it
had sought her.'' The Sharpes' lives of brisk walks and quiet teas
would appear to have fallen upon them in much the same manner; but
when the idea of socializing is mooted, Beatrice says with a sigh,
``Don't you get tired of making an effort?''
</P>
<P>
   Like George Bland in Brookner's novel ``A Private View,'' or
Dorothea May in ``Visitors,'' Miriam and Beatrice are ultimately
torn between an idealized hankering for connection and, far more
powerfully, an almost greedy complacency about their unruffled
existence. Just as George Bland fantasizes about marriage to the
much younger intruder, Katy Gibb, or as Dorothea May imagines
taking off to travel the world, so too does Beatrice trifle with
the idea of a marriage of convenience to Max Gruber, her retired
agent, and an old age in Monaco. But Brookner's characters act only
in their dreams; like Chekhov's three sisters, who never make it to
Moscow, Beatrice and Miriam are ultimately consigned to be stoical
in the face of dullness, to embrace vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   This inaction is not a result of passivity; nor is it, as
Brookner would sometimes imply, a question of unyielding
authenticity. It is a deliberate choice: Miriam and Beatrice
despise women like their friend Suzanne, who ``had exchanged her
briefcase for marriage to a man she had met through a dating
agency, and was now the matriarch of his house, complete with
complement of three grown-up children and her husband's
mother-in-law by his first wife, and who apparently had no regrets,
and a new hearty tolerant laugh to go with her situation.''
</P>
<P>
   INSOFAR as this isolation is a choice, it is a human failing,
one that Brookner's protagonists, almost without exception, share,
and one that brutally circumscribes her fiction. Brookner, in her
repeated tracing of this trajectory of negation, seems smugly to
condone it, and in so doing deprives her characters of tragedy.
Early in this novel, as Miriam and Beatrice embark on another night
at home, Brookner notes that ``somewhere people were drinking,
dining, entertaining each other, on an ordinary weekday evening,
released from work, eager for pleasure. Only in the flat was life
becalmed, and somehow it was right . . . that it should be so.''
</P>
<P>
   The supposed rightness of this deadened life is morally
outrageous; but it is also recognizable, and humanly true. The
ghastly power of Brookner's novels arises from their trenchant
accuracy, and in this regard ``Falling Slowly'' is a further
testament to its author's gifts. As a stylist, Brookner has been
compared to Austen and James; but both those authors turned their
pens to the robust inscription of life, whereas Brookner creates
hymns only to its muffling and extinction. Her fiction -- in this
latest novel no less than in the others -- is cautionary, and in
its perverse acceptance of emptiness it exhorts us, as urgently as
did E. M. Forster, to ``only connect!''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 16, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

<HEADLINE>
CLINTON AFFAIR BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN PUBLIC DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The quality of public debate in this Clinton
thing _ or, more to the point, the lack of quality debate _ is
driving me nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because so many people call me to denounce one side
or the other. Like the guy who called the other day:
</P>
<P>
   He said he was a liberal. He wanted to know why nobody,
including me, has been writing about the racist activities of
Clinton enemies like Bob Barr, that sour-faced congressman from
Georgia, and Trent Lott, the courtly Mississippian who leads the
Republicans in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deeply troubling to me,'' my caller said, ``that people
like Trent Lott and Bob Barr _ who are avowed racists and members
of this white Citizens Council _ that this kind of information
concerning two of the most powerful people in our government today
is not played up by the media, that they try to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not quite accurate. The New York Times in
particular has carried several stories about these guys addressing
racist groups back home. Both Barr and Lott said they had had no
idea that the groups to which they had spoken had been racist
organizations. I guess they figured that members of the audience
just hadn't bothered to change out of their Casper the Ghost
costumes from Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   I did tell my caller, though, that there's enough of this stuff
going around in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start talking about Southern politicians,'' I said,
``the water gets pretty deep. I want to read you the contents of a
letter that I just happen to have in my possession. It's dated
April 8, 1946. It was addressed to Samuel Green of Atlanta, the
Imperial Wizard of the Klan at that time. The author was a guy
named Bob Byrd. The letter says:
</P>
<P>
   `I am a former kleagle of the Ku Klux Klan in Raleigh County and
the adjoining counties of the state ... The Klan is needed today as
never before and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West
Virginia ... It is necessary that the order be promoted immediately
and in every state of the Union ... Will you please inform me of
the possibilities of rebuilding the Klan in West Virginia?''
</P>
<P>
   This letter first surfaced when Bob Byrd was a Democratic member
of Congress. The governor of West Virginia at the time, a guy with
the unlikely name of Okey Patteson, immediately asked Byrd to
resign from office. Byrd told him to drop dead. He ran for
re-election, urging voters to ignore this diversion by the
Republicans from the real issues at hand _ communism, the decay of
moral life in America and the degeneration of religious life. Byrd
won, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   What was interesting about that letter, I informed my caller, is
that the man who wrote it is now 81 years old and the former
majority leader of the Senate. Robert C. Byrd is the Senate's
parliamentarian, its dean and one of its most respected members. In
short, he's one of the government's most powerful men. He's also
pushing to have the impeachment trial ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' my caller said, ``why don't the major news
organizations jump on this stuff and make it known?''
</P>
<P>
   Because, ultimately, that's not what this dispute in Washington
is about. It's not about Lott and Barr pandering to racists in
states where racists may still have a voting bloc. It's not about
Byrd's Klan activities 53 years ago. It's not about Rep. Henry
Hyde's adultery a quarter century ago. It's not about whether
Thomas Jefferson had a love affair with a slave.
</P>
<P>
   It's about whether perjury and obstruction are reason enough to
toss out a president, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is simply smoke.
</P>

FOCUS ON WORK, NOT ON FRUSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The next time work is driving you crazy, Richard
Carlson suggests you try a little emotional decaf. Imagine how
you'd do your job if you didn't drink coffee, then how you'd do it
if you drank 50 cups of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are criticized or running a few minutes late or
are harried, they flip out,'' said Carlson, a resident of Martinez,
Calif., whose latest book, ``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff at Work,''
encourages people to stop dwelling on the negative elements that
make up a relatively small part of their day.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Carlson said that workers handle big projects
well, but often overreact to things that are relatively
unimportant. Suppose you had 20 responsibilities at work and 19
went well, he said. ``The other one is the one you talk about at
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Carlson offers dozens of suggestions for getting
more simplicity and enjoyment out of work. Among them are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid being a slave to the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was once in the office of a manager when the phone rang,''
Carlson writes. ``Immediately, he bellowed, `That darn phone never
stops ringing.' He then proceeded to pick it up and engage in a
15-minute conversation while I waited. When he finally hung up, he
looked exhausted and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apologized as the phone rang once again. He later confessed
that he was having a great deal of trouble completing his tasks
because of the volume of calls he was responding to. At some point
I asked him, `Have you ever considered having a certain period of
time when you simply don't answer the phone?'
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me with a puzzled look on his face and said, `As a
matter of fact, no.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Use voice mail effectively.
</P>
<P>
   People whose time is tight are often better off leaving detailed
messages. Carlson says that having conversations is still crucial,
but they frequently take at least 10 minutes because of small talk
and distractions; the main item can be accomplished in a couple of
minutes through voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accept that someone will always be mad at you.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are spread so thin that sometimes you will not do things
as well or as thoroughly as others would like you to, Carlson says.
Try to do the best you can, of course, but understand that
sometimes things will go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finish your tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson says that often people will be 99 percent done with a
project, then stop for a while. That adds stress because they can't
remove the item from their mental to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that when he has something that might involve a
confrontation or hurt feelings, he takes care of that immediately
rather than waiting until later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way I avoid all the stress that would have been
inevitable had I waited,'' he writes. ``But even more than that, I
find that I'm usually more effective in dealing with the situation
because I'm fresher and more alert.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a life.
</P>
<P>
   People who get burned out are often those who have nothing other
than work, Carlson says. Problems on the job get magnified, and the
people have nothing else to ease the stress.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Carlson said he is not implying that work is
wonderful for everyone or downplaying the major sources of stress
that people can face, such as layoffs and pay cuts. On the other
hand, he said people often overdramatize deadlines and take
criticism too personally, taking the negative parts of work and
giving them far more importance than the positive ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to lighten up,'' he said. ``It's shocking to me how
easy it is to make incremental changes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carlson has come across many people who are stressed out by
their commute, for example, but never think about how they could
make it more fun by reading or listening to books on tape. Others
are bothered by things that are a predictable part of the job, such
as contractors complaining about building permits or government
workers griping about bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about beating up yourself over things you have
absolutely no control over,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   One important thing he has learned is to take breaks, which
people often overlook because they feel so busy. Carlson said
whatever time is lost on a break is usually more than made up for
through increased energy and better health. ``People who don't take
their breaks burn out quicker and get sick more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Another habit people often get into, he said, is to maximize
stress by mentally reliving bad experiences at work for days or
weeks, or convincing themselves in advance that they're going to
have a tough day, week or month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're really doing is rehearsing unhappiness,'' Carlson
said. ``You just don't notice it.''

VALENTINE'S DAY VS. THE LOVE OF MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As soon as tinsel and elf tracks were carted
away, hearts of all denominations, designs and dimensions exploded
from store windows.
</P>
<P>
   While I was still throwing out soggy bows and crushed wrapping
paper, a force was loosed on the land. It shouted, ``Wake up, you
dunderhead _ it's Valentine's Day!''
</P>
<P>
   In January? Where did I get the foolish notion that Valentine's
Day was Feb. 14? I also used to believe that this was a holiday
that had a lot to do with telling the person you love that you
truly, dearly do love them.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it with a sonnet. Some said it with flowers, champagne
and candy. Certainly no one that I knew said it with a heart-shaped
toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the day of love, Valentine's Day, has evolved into
``Valentine's Day _ Only 37 Shopping Days Left!''
</P>
<P>
   I never actually thought of heart ties, towels and ashtrays as
romantic. But someone must. Or why else would they sprout from
every aisle in the supermarket? Anatomically correct heart candy
dishes also make lovely gifts (which you can easily fill with
specially produced Valentine's Day red and white M&AMP;M's).
Heart-shaped soap dishes send the message that cleanliness breeds
love.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are squooshy heart ``novelties'' that snicker when
you squeeze them (cleverly communicating to your love that she
better watch her back).
</P>
<P>
   Heart-shaped bells are nice. You can use them to chime out the
12 days of Valentine's, a merry chant for this festive time of
year. Or you can purchase tinny little cards that sing.
</P>
<P>
   Romance? You bet. And what can say it better than heart-shaped
boxes filled with dog food? Of course, we shouldn't overlook the
greeting cards. Not to get mushy, but I know I want to send
valentines to all of my business contacts, service professionals
and teachers. I also don't want to forget those people who have
been just like a mother, father, sister, brother, cousin, pal or
foot doctor to me.
</P>
<P>
   For a special treat, packaged red and white foods are nice (for
the health conscious, rutabagas and tofu are especially intimate).
Then there are all the romantic hideaways offering unique holiday
packages, like the hotel and billiards weekend or the romantic
``singles'' intensive aerobics-alternative medicine and plastic
surgery Valentine's Fiesta _ each room furnished with heart-shaped
bed, hot tub and Di-gels).
</P>
<P>
   So don't wait until the last minute. The stores are chock-full
of merchandise right now. You know you don't want to get stuck
(again) in those crowds on Valentine's Day Eve, desperately
searching for the ``perfect'' gift.
</P>
<P>
   How do I love thee? Let me count the sales.
</P>

IT WOULDN'T BE A SUPER BOWL WITHOUT WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for WINGS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be possible to have a Super Bowl party without wings _
specifically Buffalo wings _ but do you really want to?
</P>
<P>
   Spicy, not quite fiery, messy wings. Finger-lickin' food. Served
with celery and blue cheese. And beer.
</P>
<P>
   This half-century-old dish is as synonymous with sports on TV as
singing frogs and Clydesdales charging through the snow.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no good reason why this sticky, need-a-Wet-Nap dish
has become a Super Bowl staple, but there is no arguing with
reality: Wings are us.
</P>
<P>
   Wings are served at almost every bar and public house in the
Northeast, and most pizza places worth their pepperoni have added
wings to their menu in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The good news about wings is that there's no reason to make them
yourself. They are as inexpensive as pizza and every bit as
accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Why spend hours marinating the part of the chicken people threw
away _ until Buffalo, N.Y., made it a bar-stool delicacy _ when you
can zip over to your favorite supermarket or pub _ even KFC sells a
wing _ and pick up a few dozen? All you have to do is keep them
warm until the guests arrive.

GIBBS ISN'T TALKATIVE, BUT KNOWS HIS LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It is not easy to hide in a nearly empty 80,000-seat
stadium, but Alex Gibbs was doing his best Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Media Day was in full swing at Pro Player Stadium, site of
Sunday's Super Bowl, and Gibbs wanted no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one day a year I do this, and only because I have
to,'' said Gibbs, the offensive line coach of the Denver Broncos,
who is considered by his peers the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   About half the Denver players were on the field being
interviewed. The rest, and most of the coaches, were clustered in
the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, the man who wants to be alone and never interviewed, sat
in the middle of the pack, wearing dark glasses, with the brim of a
baseball cap pulled down over his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for a purpose,'' he said when a cluster of writers
finally located him. ``I was hoping you wouldn't find me. And as
soon as you guys leave, I'm going off in a corner and you won't
find me again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe that none of this does any good. I tell my
players that. If you run your mouth off all the time, trying to
give you guys something to write about, then sooner or later, I
would say the wrong thing or the players would say the wrong thing,
and we'd have a problem we shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs is a terrific coach. His offensive line is the best in the
league. His fellow coaches like and respect him. Around the NFL, he
is admired despite his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes Alex such a great coach,'' said veteran
Bronco guard Mark Schlereth, ``is that he is paranoid and he makes
all of us paranoid. He makes us afraid to fail. We fear failure. He
is always pushing us to be the best players possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a teacher,'' said Pro Bowl center Tom Nalen, who has
thrived under Gibbs. ``He works very hard at what he does. He pays
great attention to even the smallest detail. When we go into a
game, we know we are fully prepared and we should be able to deal
with everything that is going to come our way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is a motivator,'' said guard David Diaz-Infante. ``He is
a very competitive guy and he makes us all very competitive. He
teaches us everything about the game. He even makes us learn what
the pass coverage of the other team is going to be. Generally,
offensive linemen don't learn those kinds of things. But Alex is
always teaching, giving us every possible edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, 57, is a native of North Carolina. He played football and
got a degree at Davidson. Then he got his master's in European
history at North Carolina and a doctorate in education while
coaching at Auburn. He is bright, feisty, and interesting. Even
though he doesn't like to talk, he is worth listening to when he
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached under Woody Hayes when I was at Ohio State on his
staff, and he was the greatest teaching coach I have ever been
around,'' said Gibbs. ``He knew how to teach and made me want to
teach. People don't realize that in 26 years at Ohio State, Woody
also taught freshman English and not one kid ever failed his course
because he was that great a teacher. He could make those kids
learn, and want to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached with Bobby Bowden (at Florida State), and what I
learned from him was how to get the best out of your players
without getting them to play tight. Bobby is a master at this. He
can have his kids go into big games and still feel loose enough to
go out and play their best.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Vince Dooley (at Georgia), the thing I got from him was
how he was a stickler for detail, how organized and efficient he
was. Then I coached with Pat Dye (at Auburn) and I liked the way he
could get his players to play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' added Gibbs, a slight smile coming to his face, ``I'm a
thief. I'm the biggest thief there is. Everything I do in coaching,
I stole from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want from a player is to want to be good, to love what
he is doing. I don't give a damn about draft choices. Don't bring
me any high draft choices. The guys I'm coaching right now are a
third, a fifth, a seventh, and five free agents. And this is a very
good group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like guys who have come out of the World League. I like to
coach guys who have been cut somewhere else. Let someone try
coaching them when they are just starting to learn what being in
this league is all about. Then when I get them, I'll take them from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I keep track of guys I think are going to be cut
from some other team that could help us out. I always have three or
four of those guys I'm looking at. When it happens, we pick them up
and try to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said he would never want to be a head coach. That is just
not him. He thinks he has the perfect job, coaching under Mike
Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He trusts me and I trust him,'' said Gibbs. ``We have a great
relationship. I could never get up in front of the press each day
and do the things with the media a head coach has to do. That's
just not me. I don't want to be on television. I don't want to be
in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to fish. I love to read. I can't do that during the
season. But when it is all over, that's what I'll do until we come
back and we start to prepare for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and his linemen stick together. They believe in each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them all of us have to work together to get down to the
last small detail on what we have to do to win,'' said Gibbs.
``None of us would want to be responsible for a mistake that cost
us the game. That is the fear factor. Individually, they do not
want to be the guy that makes mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs says one of his greatest moments in football came when the
Broncos upset the Packers in last year's Super Bowl, and did so on
behind a running game that dominated Green Bay in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good feeling,'' he said. ``I was very happy. And I
was proud of my players. They did what they had to do and gave a
great performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex knows how to motivate us for the big game,'' said
Diaz-Infante. ``He always tells us, `I'm with you guys _ win or
tie.' ''

CALICHMAN BRINGS MORE THAN SKILL TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution are not making major
personnel changes, despite three successive losing seasons. They
are, however, attempting to change the chemistry of the team this
year.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Dan Calichman fits in. Calichman was captain of
the Los Angeles Galaxy, one of Major League Soccer's most
successful teams, before being traded to the Revolution this month.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman, 30, is expected to help give the team direction and
leadership on and off the field. He also will have to prove that he
has recovered from a broken leg, which caused him to miss most of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England wouldn't have brought me here if they didn't think
I could play,'' Calichman said after the team's first preseason
workout Tuesday. ``Everyone is excited to be doing something, and
I'm excited to get going and see how good this team can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman brings confidence and credibility to the central
defense, but he also sets an example for forthrightness and honesty
off the field. In fact, Calichman was considered too blunt for
Galaxy management, which made him available soon after he made
comments that were considered unsupportive of coach Octavio
Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left LA on good terms with the players, but not with the
coaching staff,'' Calichman said. ``Now that I've had time to
consider what I said before, I realize they had decisions to make
and that's part of coaching. But do I agree with what they did? No,
I don't agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm so happy that I ended up in Boston. Before the league
started, I thought I would be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman contended that the Galaxy were proficient enough to
win with or without Zambrano. In fact, an excellent foundation had
been set by Lothar Osiander, who guided the Galaxy to the 1996 MLS
Cup final at Foxboro Stadium. The Galaxy continued to be successful
under Zambrano, who added Welton from the Revolution and several
young players, before falling to 1998 MLS Cup champion Chicago in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask Lothar, it's a player's game,'' Calichman said.
``The coach plays a big part in that by choosing the players. After
that, it's a matter of respect between the coach and players, and
if that breaks down, you are going to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In LA, they did a good job in the first draft of picking
players who would get along together. We enjoyed each other's
company off the field, and if you are not doing that, you are not
going to enjoy each other's company on the field. It's building
respect off the field, too. You can't hide what happens off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Revolution's troubles have been most apparent.
Players have often failed to blend. And the most credible leaders,
the very players who could help solve personality clashes, have
been discarded. So the Revolution have actually regressed on the
field while setting attendance standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organizations seems great,'' Calichman said. ``There is a
warm feeling here that new players didn't used to get when they
came to LA.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Revolution captain Mike Burns officially became a holdout while
continuing to train with the Edinburgh-based club Hearts of
Midlothian. ``I hope the league looks at the solution very quickly,
because many players are looking to go outside the league,''
Revolution coach Walter Zenga said. ``Soccer can't improve here if
the best players are going away. My personal opinion is that I hope
Mike comes here. If not, life goes on.''

LAW TO WORK OUT WITH TRACK COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Ty Law won't be taking part in Johnny
Parker's conditioning program. He'll go to St. Louis for the second
straight year to take part in legendary track coach Bob Kersee's
conditioning program with hopes, he said, of ``expanding my role.''
</P>
<P>
   Law, who first will head to the Super Bowl to receive the NFL
Alumni Association Award as the top cornerback in the league, said,
``I'd like the opportunity to run back some punts and kicks next
year, and I'd also like to be used as a receiver if we run into a
situation like we did this year where we have guys hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Law, who also was named the top defensive back by the NFL
Players Association Tuesday, said he ran his ideas by Pete Carroll
and current special teams coach Dante Scarnecchia Tuesday before
leaving for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to put a bug in their ear before I left,'' said
Law. ``This isn't something I'm just kidding about. I want to do
it. I know people will bring up Jason Sehorn (the Giant cornerback
who was injured on a kick return and missed the entire season), but
I want a chance to help us win in more than one way.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for what he hopes is his multidimensional role, Law
must do even more conditioning than he did a year ago. Law, who
will play in the Pro Bowl in Honolulu Feb. 7, said he'll begin
training with Kersee in March, two months earlier than last year.
There's no question that Law's track work helped him turn a corner
in his career this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the most of my opportunities,'' said Law, whose nine
interceptions led the NFL. ``Before training camp I went in to see
Pete and I asked him if I could cover the best receiver. I had
tried to do it before. I asked Coach (Bill) Parcells when he was
here and he didn't think I quite had the experience to do it at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because I had more balls thrown my way I got noticed.
I also probably gave up more balls than I had in other years. But I
think people around the league _ the players and the coaches _
began to recognize what I could do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he's not asking for an expanded role out of
selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can do a good job for our team and make some plays
for our team. I feel that I break a game open if I get the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's contract may be renegotiated, though his agents have yet
to hear from the Patriots in regards to an extension. As it stands,
he can become an unrestricted free agent following next season, and
should become one of the highest-paid Patriots when all is said and
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to spend my career here,'' said Law. ``I love New
England. I enjoy the fans and the coaching staff and the team. I
think we're capable of great things if we all put our mind to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Parker has a great program, and those who don't take
advantage of it, like me, and go do their own thing should devote
themselves to it,'' said Law. ``I think we as athletes have to be
responsible for ourselves and we have to come to training camp in
the best possible shape so we excel as athletes and strive to be
better. If everyone did that, we'd be unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have some pride in yourself. Everyone should take
their job seriously, and I hope that players who didn't give it
their best last offseason will give it more of an effort this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Patriots don't let him return kicks and catch passes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll just continue to be the best corner I can be,'' he
said. ``Sometimes you have to wait for things. I had to wait for my
chance to cover the best receiver and I finally proved that I could
do it effectively. Now, I have to prove that I can do some other
things.''

FIVE YEARS LATER, DUQUETTE STILL ON THE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dan Duquette &UR;  &LR; is marking his fifth anniversary as
general manager of the Red Sox. Congratulatory cards, letters,
e-mails, and bouquets are welcome on Yawkey Way, in lieu of the
usual brickbats, wisecracks, and snide comic strips.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was acclaimed as one of the best and brightest of
baseball's top young executives when he was hired at age 35 by Red
Sox CEO John Harrington. But the Greek chorus of unqualified
support has largely been reduced to a single voice, albeit the one
most important to Duquette's continued employment in Boston: The
boss remains his biggest fan. That makes it a lot easier to
overlook such indignities as recently being named second runner-up
in Jerk of the Year voting by the comic strip, ``Tank McNamara.''
</P>
<P>
   At 40, the native of Dalton, Mass. ranks as one of the biggest
newsmakers in his home state: The names of Ted Kennedy, Mayor
Menino, and the former Amherst College first baseman have appeared
in Globe newspaper stories more than 2,000 times apiece in the last
five years. A remarkable number, given Duquette's reluctance to
give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Not so startling, given the combustible nature of what Duquette
once termed his ``dream'' job. As Boston oracle Clark Booth
recently reminded Duquette at the Boston baseball writers' dinner,
Duquette and his predecessors are all ``skewered on the gridiron of
public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, originally given a five-year deal to leave his former
employer, the Montreal Expos, had another three years tacked on
last March by Harrington, who saluted Duquette for engineering a
Sox ``renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   That was even before the Red Sox won 92 games in 1998, claimed
the American League wild-card spot, and won their first postseason
game in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Duquette's five years on the job, the Sox have been in the
playoffs twice, winning the American League East in 1995. Their
won-lost record of 395-350 is the fourth-best in the league in that
span, eclipsed only by the Yankees, Indians, and Orioles, all of
whom have outspent the Sox in that time. The record also is an
improvement from the six games over .500 the Sox went in the last
five years of Lou Gorman's tenure (1989-93).
</P>
<P>
   But what Harrington calls a renaissance has been obscured by the
exodus of the team's most prominent players, Roger Clemens and Mo
Vaughn. The Red Sox dropped to fourth place the first year after
Clemens left, and the void left by Vaughn in the middle of the
lineup has similar dire forecasts in the offing for '99.
</P>
<P>
   Change has been a hallmark of Duquette's tenure with the Sox.
John Valentin is the only starter from the team Duquette inherited
in 1994. Since Duquette became GM, 159 players have appeared in at
least one game for the Sox, a list that includes instantly
forgettable names such as Toby Borland, Brent Knackert, and Greg
Pirkl, and such misbegotten gambles as Shane Mack, Steve Avery, and
Robinson Checo. But it also includes such prescient pickups as Bret
Saberhagen, Tim Wakefield, and Troy O'Leary, none of whom were in
demand when Duquette signed them.
</P>
<P>
   Three managers have served under Duquette _ Butch Hobson, Kevin
Kennedy, and Jimy Williams. The latter initially seemed like a
consolation prize after Duquette's failed pursuit of such
high-profile names as Jim Leyland and Whitey Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Sox won the AL East, they had three pitching
coaches in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Duquette fired his farm director, Bob Schaefer,
even though he has repeatedly hailed the improvement of the minor
leagues as one of his most notable achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Of Duquette's promises, three stand out:
</P>
<P>
   --He said the team would be a perennial playoff contender. That
vow would look more viable if Vaughn were back to complement ace
pitcher Pedro Martinez, franchise player Nomar Garciaparra, and
closer Tom Gordon, statistically the best reliever in the American
League. Even manager Williams termed Vaughn ``impossible'' to
replace. With Vaughn gone, few people foresee the Red Sox closing
the 22-game gap that existed between them and the World
Series-winning Yankees last fall. And no Sox GM will be deemed a
true success until World Series rings are handed out at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   --He said he would make the team younger. The team Duquette
inherited in 1994 had 16 players 30 years or older. The team that
goes to camp next month has 15 players 30 or older. Martinez is the
only pitcher in the starting rotation under 30. Garciaparra is the
only infielder under 30, rookie Trot Nixon the only starting
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   --He said the team would develop its own talent, relying on an
upgraded scouting staff, international imports, and an improved
farm system. So far, Garciaparra remains the only homegrown product
to have made a significant impact. Pitcher Brian Rose went down
with an injury last spring, and Nixon, a holdover from the Gorman
regime, is penciled in as a starter this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette has traded numerous pitching prospects (Carl Pavano,
Matt Kinney, Tony Armas Jr., Jay Yennaco), with few foreseeable
breakthrough prospects close to the major leagues. There are a
number of position players _ third baseman Wilton Veras, catcher
Steve Lomasney, third baseman Cole Liniak, outfielder Dernell
Stenson, and second baseman Donnie Sadler _ who could develop into
big leaguers, but for now, an ``incomplete'' may be the fairest
grade that can be given Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on Duquette often focuses on style over substance.
There were the ludicrous claims made by Mike Gimbel, the Bronx
water meter-reader who doubled as Duquette's statistical
consultant, that only reinforced Duquette's image as a rotisserie
GM. There was the ill-fated attempt by Duquette to do a PR makeover
with the help of the bumbling John Flynn. There was Duquette's
WBZ-TV ``barbecue interview,'' in which he assured Bob Lobel that
he would never let Vaughn leave the way Clemens did. There was the
sniping from the anti-Duke faction led by Clemens and Jose Canseco,
and the no-Sox clauses in the contracts of Marquis Grissom and
David Justice, whose agent did not mask his contempt for the Sox
GM.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the four-year, $26 million deal given to Jose
Offerman, and Duquette's insistence that Offerman would replace
Vaughn's on-base percentage. That deal raises questions about both
Duquette's style and substance.
</P>
<P>
   But while those subjects have been regular grist for Duquette
bashers, on Yawkey Way, they have only stiffened the backbone of
the CEO. ``Dan Duquette is going to be our general manager for a
long, long time,'' Harrington said in an interview three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The meter is now at five years and running, with no end in
sight.

BROWN IS NO DINOSAUR WITH RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When the fans in Boston last saw Dee Brown, he was
knocking down 3-pointers against the Mavericks at a record clip.
Soon thereafter, he was gone, exiled, or so it seemed, to a city
that takes its curling as seriously as its basketball, to a team
that won 16 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   He still wears No. 7, but the familiar Reeboks have been
replaced by Adidases. He's now one of many veterans on an
intriguing roster, not one of the holdovers from a previous,
disgraced regime. He feels an excitement that he hasn't felt in
some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt this way since I got drafted,'' he said before
Tuesday night's 106-88 exhibition loss to the Celtics. ``When I got
traded, I was just happy to have a chance to play again. But also
because someone wanted me. Toronto wanted me. A team wants you
here, and to be a part of what they're trying to do, instead of
being a leftover.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't go well for Brown last season. He was originally
pumped to play for Rick Pitino but soon found out that he was not
in the coach's plans. Pitino wanted to go with youth, and Brown, on
that team, was an AARP candidate. He played hard enough and well
enough to be renamed team captain, but that mattered little when
the bell rang.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has no hard feelings, and you almost believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick's attitude is all basketball all the time,'' Brown said.
``He lives and breathes it. Some players and coaches are like that.
Some aren't. I enjoy it and I come to work and I play it, but
that's that. I leave it there. I can't take it home with me. I
caught myself doing that a lot, and it got me frustrated. That
wasn't me. You play the game as hard as you can and then you go
home and relax and come back the next day and work on your
mistakes. How much more simple can you get?''
</P>
<P>
   When he left, a small part of the Celtics' history went with
him. There is no one remaining from the halcyon days of the Big
Three (except broadcaster Cedric Maxwell) or from the days when
playoffs were automatic. It actually meant something to him to wear
the green and be the captain. He never developed as many thought he
would _ remember his sensational performance as a rookie against
the Pistons in Game 6 of their playoff series in 1991? _ and his
last three years in Boston were not without complaint or
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He demanded to be traded when he saw through the fraudulence
that permeated the last year of M.L. Carr's regime. He took a lot
of heat for that, from the public, from Larry Bird, but no one else
was as forthcoming. It cost him his captaincy, some playing time,
and some support. But he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``M.L. was taking a bullet for the ball club,'' he said. ``After
a while, you saw it. It wasn't said. It wasn't spoken. But you look
back at what happened and what it came down to, and that's what it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year wasn't much better. Pitino told reporters that Brown
was deathly ill from the flu when he was anything but. There was a
report that Pitino threw him out of practice. He became a
seldom-used sub and saw his Boston career come to an end one night
in Sacramento when he and Chauncey Billups were held out of a game
after the trade to Toronto had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Did he regret that it came down the way it did in Boston?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick wanted younger players,'' he said. ``It wasn't that I
wasn't performing. I came in great shape. I performed on the court
when I got on the court. I did everything to be named captain. I
feel I did my job on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through stretches where I didn't play, and you
understand that. It was frustrating, but Rick isn't the shy type.
He told me he was going to play the young guys and that I didn't
have a role on the team. I just kept practicing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night Brown got his first glimpse at his former team
since being traded 11 months ago. He still tries to keep in touch
with Pervis Ellison (``I guess I won't be seeing him this year,
huh?'') and Dana Barros (``He was in great shape last year, too'').
He noted with amusement that Travis Knight must be feeling better
these days: ``He gets the big pay raise that he wasn't going to get
in LA. Then, after a year, he gets to go back there. How happy is
he?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Raptors game wasn't that special; he'll feel
differently Friday when he returns to the FleetCenter for the first
time since the trade and even more so for the Feb. 5 season opener
when the games actually mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I played there, I had that big game (against
Dallas),'' he said. ``So going back there would mean something if
the old guys were still there. It would have been different if I
had been with Pitino a long time, like seven or eight years. But I
was only there four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, Dee, it was four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a long time,'' he said.

A STICKING POINT WITH TUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ 3-12? Jessie's been there (rookie, strike-interrupted
season). 3-13? Oh, sure Jessie's been there _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   5-11? Uh-huh. Put him down for two of those. 6-10? Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Jessie Tuggle persevered. He just kept whacking
ballcarriers and pass receivers and making Pro Bowls and
maintaining his dignity through four head coaches and one interim
head coach, and not once did he complain about his lot in life.
There were frustrations and disappointments, but Tuggle figured
those things were a part of life and that if he kept working and
treating the game with respect, his day would come. He had the
temerity to think that even an Atlanta Falcons lifer would see
Retribution Day.
</P>
<P>
   Which he has. When the Falcons take the field in Super Bowl
XXXIII Sunday, Tuggle will be at his familiar inside linebacker
spot, daring Terrell Davis to come his way. After 12 seasons
playing for one of the more anonymous franchises in the entire NFL,
he will be playing in the Big Game, and the very best part is that
he will be doing it in what he feels is the ``right'' uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had not gone through all those experiences, all those ups
and downs in Atlanta, I would not have the joy and satisfaction I
have now,'' he explains. ``I have now been from the bottom to the
top in this organization. Nothing could be sweeter than the feeling
I have now _ except winning the Super Bowl itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being in the NFL was a reward in itself for this guy. He
came out of Valdosta State and he was, as you might suspect,
undrafted. He was regarded as a nice Division 2 player who was too
small to make it as a linebacker in the NFL. That was five Pro
Bowls ago. Once again, the heights, weights, and 40 times were
nothing when measured against a man's pure ability to play the
game, mixed in with his heart. This was the first season in his
12-year career he didn't lead his team in tackles, and he missed by
only seven (114 to Cornelius Bennett's 121). And guess who led all
Atlanta tacklers in the NFC Championship Game against Minnesota
with 13.
</P>
<P>
   One more stat: Jessie Tuggle is the leading active tackler in
the entire league.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a relatively well-kept secret, which is what playing
for a blah franchise will do for a guy. More people probably heard
of Jessie Tuggle one day this past season than in his entire
career. That was the day he walked out to midfield for an overtime
coin flip carrying a sign that said ``heads'' on one side and
``tails'' on the other, a joking reference to the Thanksgiving Day
officiating fiasco. ``Amazing how the whole country reacted to
that,'' smiles Tuggle. ``That was Dan's idea.''
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Coach Reeves had no sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   On every Super Bowl team, there is one guy for whom the
experience really does mean more than it does for the others, and
on the Falcons, that man is 33-year-old Jessie Tuggle. How, for
example, could rookie return specialist Tim Dwight understand what
this means to a Jessie Tuggle, when all he knows is 14-2, a playoff
conquest of the Vikings, full houses, and constant public
adulation?
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle knows what it's like to be the best player on a bad team.
Tuggle knows what it's like to lose by combined scores of 76-3 and
68-7 back to back in the same season. And Tuggle knows what it's
like to see some very talented players come to Atlanta, take a look
at the situation, and start counting the seconds until they can get
the heck out of there. (Does the name ``Deion'' ring a bell?)
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Tuggle saw value in being a Falcon. He was a
Georgia native. He had grown up rooting for the team. He thought it
was his solemn duty to do whatever he could to make the Falcons a
winner and not worry about running off somewhere for a few extra
bucks and perhaps even get himself a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of guys who felt they could never win a
championship here,'' says Tuggle. ``I wonder what they're thinking
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The ring. It matters. It matters a lot. But a ring for its own
sake never appealed to this man. He wanted a Falcons ring. This
thought process is, frankly, a bit old-fashioned. It is something
that no longer exists in other sports. An NBA player or a major
league baseball player will come to a team and, after two or three
years, start talking about ``being with a winner.'' The idea of
sticking around and building that winner doesn't occur to them.
This thinking has even crept into football.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we win, I will appreciate it more because I will have
been here for the long duration,'' Tuggle points out. ``This new
generation, a lot of them don't understand. They're raised to think
in terms of getting what the want right now. They don't want to
work for it. They're not prepared to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle doesn't want to be portrayed as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only here 12 years,'' he says. ``We've had better players
than me in this organization who were around even longer. Mike Kenn
played 17 years. Jeff Van Note played 18. They appreciate what this
means to me. I've heard from a lot of guys who are happy for us and
proud of what this means to the city and the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In no way is Jessie Tuggle afflicted with the happy-to-be-here
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to win,'' he asserts. ``I'm not just here to be a
part of it. I have a hunger that burns. I want that ring. I'm
excited to be here, sure, but I am prepared to do whatever it takes
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons win, there will be a lot of happy players. Jessie
Tuggle truly believes he will be the happiest of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' he smiles. ``It's gonna be sweet.''

DEALING WITH BULLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about every company has one:
</P>
<P>
   The manager who disparages the ``girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The rainmaker whose profit-making genius endears him or her to
the president even though the rainmaker is a boor.
</P>
<P>
   The politically astute charmer who picks a powerless target to
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The solidly entrenched employee who maligns or belittles
co-workers, spreads rumors, or takes credit for colleagues' ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who churn rumors and spread gossip,
people who tell tales (almost always untrue) about workers and
peers they dislike or mistrust,'' says John Challenger, president
of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm.
``They are often super confident and attractive people who engage
in subtle and not-so-subtle character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   People churners are workplace bullies who wreak havoc on morale,
but are rarely fired because they are valuable to a company's
bottom line, say experts. Instead, the bullying boss or co-worker
tends to drive talented staff away.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of job insecurity, wage stagnation, and layoffs,
bullying has become a serious workplace problem _ one that has
prompted new research on the psychological and physical toll of
emotional brow-beating and has spawned Web sites specifically aimed
at helping victims of such abuse.
</P>
<P>
   One example: San Francisco writer Daniel Levine. His Web site
(www.disgruntled.com) includes a chat room, a collection of monthly
articles, and first-person stories by targets of workplace
bullying. Levine's new book, ``Disgruntled: The Darker Side of the
World of Work,'' (1998, Penguin-Putnam, $12), is a compilation of
stories gleaned from the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study, the International Labour Organization noted
that psychological aggression and bullying were the most frequently
reported complaints among US employees. Meanwhile, social
psychologist Loraleigh Keashly, director of dispute resolution at
Wayne State University, reports in a new study of 147 health care
workers that 82 percent have experienced some form of aggression
from co-workers or supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many workers never report it and tend to internalize their
anger. As a result, a once loyal employee no longer gives one
hundred percent of his time. In more extreme cases, a worker may
steal information, vandalize company property, sabotage projects,
or explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is very subtle,'' says Gary Namie, coauthor of the
book, ``Bullyproof Yourself at Work: Personal Strategies to
Recognize &AMP; Stop the Hurt from Harassment,'' ($13.95, DoubleDoc
Press, Benicia, Calif.). ``These people can be extremely cruel.
There are bosses, for example, who punish by giving lousy work
assignments. We know of a supervisor at a southwestern university
who assigned the staffers she did not like to unairconditioned
areas, where the temperatures were more than 100 degrees in the
middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Most bullies thrive divide and conquer, in which the aggressor
quietly and carefully aligns a team of people against one person he
or she has singled out. ``He or she actually says, `You don't want
to be on that person's side because he's going down the tubes,' ''
says Namie.
</P>
<P>
   Not all bullies are bosses. Consider, for example, the cliquish
co-workers who deliberately ignore a member of their unit; the
employee who whispers or giggles at the approach of a colleague;
and the ``friend'' who collects highly personal information and
then launches a smear campaign. Remember Linda Tripp?
</P>
<P>
   David Yamada, an associate professor of law at Suffolk
University who is researching the legal protections available to
targets of workplace bullies, says the most obvious involve
discrimination laws that protect people from bias or harassment on
the basis of sex and race. While more and more employees are filing
hostile-work-environment lawsuits, the jury is still out on their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rhonda Manthe, 31, filed a complaint with the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination after a series of
run-ins with her boss at the Marlborough, Mass. division of
Miami-based Ryder System Inc. She alleged that she was bullied and
discriminated against. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Manthe claimed the situation worsened when she returned to work
after a maternity leave. ``He told me and other people that my
hours would be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and then he
changed them twice. He voided my fone card, and changed the locks
in the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I worked 2 1/2 weeks,'' she says, ``I was told I'd have
to work five weeks without pay because he felt I'd taken too much
maternity leave. I checked the records and found out that I had
not. I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Yancey, Ryder's equal employment opportunity officer,
disputes Manthe's story. ``She made some allegations, and we
investigated them, but we did not find them to be true,'' says
Yancey, who noted that the company offered to transfer Manthe to
another unit in Marlborough, but the former company manager
refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not corroborate any of her allegations, and since she
refused a position in the area, we decided to offer her four weeks'
severance pay. We mailed the severance agreement to her, but she
has not responded.''
</P>
<P>
   With such discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits rising,
many US employers are relying on coaches to rehabilitate executive
bullies. Psychologist David Francis, founder of EAP Systems Inc. in
Woburn, Mass., uses videotapes, role playing, and counseling to
turn problem executives into sociable human beings. The cost?
$12,000 for a six-month session.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Francis notes that success is often tied to
company support. ``For coaching to work, someone in the company,
someone at a very high level, must perceive that the individual has
a problem,'' he says. ``And usually, with bullies, that problem is
turnover.''

<P>
   David Borenstein had everything ChannelWave wanted: personality,
passion, and solid programming skills. It didn't matter that he was
just 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein, chasing a job tip, got an interview last summer at
Cambridge Internet, a software company. Impressed, ChannelWave
quickly obtained permission from the Massachusetts Department of
Labor to hire the West Newton youth for a $20-an-hour job _ and
gave him flexible hours, too.
</P>
<P>
   So much for flipping burgers or bagging groceries. A small but
growing number of talented high school students are landing summer
jobs and internships at fast-growing companies that cannot find
enough adults to fill skilled technical and creative positions.
Some kids are even being courted for full-time jobs right out of
high school, despite concerns that such offers may discourage some
from attending college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know where your next innovation is going to come
from,'' said Bob Cohen, spokesman for the Information Technology
Association in Arlington, Va. ``Innovation could be walking around
in Nike shoes somewhere with his pants drooping around his rear
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important for competitive reasons to get that talent,
and get it now, that companies are looking at these young people as
alternative sources of employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuelling the trend: the labor shortage and increased demand for
workers proficient in Web site development, networking, software
design, interactive CD-ROM development, and computer animation,
experts say. Add to that the fact that many of the nation's
colleges can't keep pace with technological changes, and it's clear
why more companies are looking to younger minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now seeing companies actually going into high schools
to hire talented teens for the summer or to train them to take
permanent, full-time jobs when they graduate,'' said John A.
Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an
international outplacement firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is just moving too quickly for the educational
system and society to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by the 11,000-member Information Technology
Association estimated there were 346,000 high-tech job vacancies in
the United States, but not enough computer programmers, systems
analysts, and computer scientists to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   While only a handful of the nation's computer programmers,
scientists, and systems analysts are aged 16 to 19, the numbers are
rising. The number of teen computer specialists _ including
scientists, system analysts and programmers _ increased to 22,000
in 1998. That was up from zero systems analysts and scientists, and
only 4,000 programmers in 1994, according to the US Department of
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Renard C. Dennis was 17 when he landed a job at Electronic Data
Systems Inc. in Maryland, which paid $23,000 to $28,000 to start.
Now 19, Dennis is a full-time computer and electronics student at
North Carolina Agricultural &AMP; Technical University in Greensboro,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, EDS not only encouraged Dennis to pursue his degree,
it also offered him an internship every summer until he graduates.
``Renard did some Web designs for us that we are using now,'' said
Ron Parham, an electronics engineer who worked with Dennis. ``We
saw him as an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 17-year-old high school student, Joseph Cheng was hired by
a chemical consulting firm in upstate New York to do computer
networking for $10 per hour. By the summer after his first year of
college, Cheng was earning $25 per hour at the same company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started receiving offers back in high school,'' said Cheng,
now 20 and majoring in the management of information technology at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``They definitely made
it clear then that if college was not for me, they would offer me a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein's boss, Ron Schmelzer, was 17 when US Robotics in
Skokie, Ill., recruited him to test one of its computer networking
products the summer after he graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzer, the 24-year-old co-founder of ChannelWave, hadn't
planned on recruiting a teenager. But after Borenstein requested an
interview, Schmelzer decided to give him a try. He hired Borenstein
to do a short-term project after the teen passed a logic test that
had stumped older candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology changes so quickly that it's almost a full-time job
keeping up, but the only people who really have the time to play
with new technology are people in high school,'' Schmelzer said.
``So, the people doing the work are getting increasingly younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at school, Borenstein is being wooed with offers of
part-time and weekend jobs. He isn't accepting. ``I tell them, `No.
I'm sorry, but I have a life,' '' said Borenstein, whose hobbies
include wrestling and monitoring a Web site he created for
academics called Quoteland.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the push to hire such young workers poses
problems. They worry that the lure of a steady paycheck may
discourage high school students from pursuing college.
</P>
<P>
   ``College is the bridge that moves children from their families
out into the world,'' said Challenger, the outplacement executive.
``It has always been a safe, emotional incubator. What concerns me
is that now we are seeing companies encouraging kids to go straight
into the world of work from high school. Is that good? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it that way,'' countered Cohen, the trade group
official. ``Kids are working at Dunkin' Donuts when they are 17 or
18 years old. Why not have companies aggressively promote the
hiring of teenagers? Why not give them a chance to flip code and
not hamburgers, and prepare themselves for the future?''
</P>
<P>
   More companies around the country are starting to agree.
</P>
<P>
   In California, senior art students at Rowland Heights High
School in Los Angeles County are being recruited by studios Walt
Disney Co., Warner Bros., and DreamWorks SKG at starting salaries
of $40,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students come in as freshmen and sophomores and they take
cartooning, animation, and drawing because that is what the film
industry wants: people who can draw,'' explained Becky Godein, a
teacher at the high school's celebrated computer animation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their junior and senior year, the students enter the
regional occupational program and they take a required two-hour
interactive course taught each week by Warner Bros.,'' she
continued. ``Then, for two weekends at the end of May, recruiters
from the different companies come to the school to look at the
students' work and to hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Called the Acme Virtual Training Program, the course was created
by David Master, a Warner Bros. animator and a former teacher at
Rowland Heights high. ``When I taught at Rowland, my class was a
dumping ground,'' recalled Master. ``All the tough kids were in my
class. Some were in gangs. Now, some of those same people are doing
great. Some went to college. Others have six-figure salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Master maintains that the program is hardly ``a farm team for
Warner Bros. . . . There has never been any contractual agreement
that says these kids must go to Warner Bros. when they finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cardon of Los Angeles was 15 when she enrolled in the
regional occupational art program Master created at Rowland. Today,
Cardon, 21, is a full-time animator at DreamWorks Feature
Animation, where average weekly salaries range from $1,300 to
$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were concerned when I started working right out of
high school,'' she said. ``My father never had the chance to go to
college, and he wanted me to have that chance. But I felt certain
about my future. This is what I've always wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., meanwhile, a group of students at Ballou
High School were placed at local firms after completing an intense
training program that helped them become proficient with
cutting-edge computer software. Starting salaries ranged from
$23,000 to $28,000, with annual $10,000 increases tied to
additional training and the successful completion of regular
computer certification exams.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 53 companies are collaborating with the Washington,
D.C., training program, D.C. Link and Learn, that trained and
placed the students. ``Companies are not necessarily doing this
because it is the thing to do,'' said Archie Prelough, the founder
of D.C. Link.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is US companies are realizing that they cannot
afford not to tap this talent,'' he added. ``They know our colleges
aren't keeping pace and our high schools are not producing the
young minds companies need. So, the motto today is, ``If you can't
find them, grow them.''

FEVER HEATS UP FOR INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took nine months of negotiations, but Brookstone Inc., the
New Hampshire-based retailer of unusual tools and household
widgets, has won control of a coveted Internet address.
</P>
<P>
   The price for www.brookstone.com was an unspecified amount of
free on-line advertising, which Brookstone will provide the
golf-course management company that held rights to that address as
part of its operations at a Georgia country club.
</P>
<P>
   No value was set for the promotional messages. But whatever it
turns out to be, said Jonathan Linden, a Brookstone lawyer, ``it's
not $3.3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Compaq Computer Corp. acknowledges it paid last year
for www.altavista.com, the address World Wide Web surfers type into
their browsers to gain access to Compaq's highly rated AltaVista
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet fever grips Wall Street, on-line addresses _ such as
amazon.com and etrade.com _ are taking on economic lives of their
own, fueling a subindustry whose players include companies with
expertise in brand-name development, Internet providers who see
opportunities knocking, litigators versed in trademark law _ and a
new breed of cybersavvy speculators.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, who detractors refer to as ``cybersquatters'' or
``cyberpirates,'' hoard, buy, sell, and rent Web addresses with
potential to fetch a high price as a brand name or, perhaps, be
held for ransom. Prices for these addresses _ known formally as
domain names _ usually aren't publicized, but the Internet world
buzzes frequently with reports of deals done at $10,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's buyout of altavista.com, from AltaVista Technologies of
Carlsbad, Calif., which owned it long before the search engine was
introduced, is considered a record. But others of note include the
purchase of tv.com for $15,000 by CNET and the $150,000 paid by a
trade show producer for www.business.com.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of all these undertakings are two core facts,
according to Thomas Barrett, general manager of Namestake.com, a
Boston company that researches Internet-name usage.
</P>
<P>
   One is that, while domain names aren't necessarily in short
supply _ any combination up to 22 letters or numbers is valid _
those most likely to stand up as brand names are going fast.
</P>
<P>
   And as electronic commerce grows, Barrett says, ``branding on
the Web becomes more important than branding in the analog world _
indeed, companies that normally would not have worried about
trademarks in the analog world now worry about it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The second is the cash-flow potential reflected by the more than
1.9 million domain names issued so far in the United States _ names
such as boston.com, aol.com, or lycos.com _ by Network Solutions
Inc. of Herndon, Va., whose federal contract to register domain
names is being phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Just keeping those registrations active, at $35 a year, will
generate $67 million this year _ a base business on which Network
Solutions, which is publicly traded and has seen its share price
soar recently, is building for a future that could bring major
changes in the way domain names are issued.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year old, Namestake.com operates an automated,
on-line search service that can deliver, also on line, detailed
reports about what names are already gone in a multitude of
categories _ not just .com, .net, or .org, the ``big three'' of the
hierarchy available to the public in the United States _ but 247
others designated for use abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Some Namestake searches are free, including name-by-name reports
on US site registrations. These are also available on line and
without charge at the Network Solutions's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But Namestake's strength is the reports it does for a fee on
usage of brand names and their clones, drawn from foreign
domain-name databases and from trademark data maintained by its
parent, Thomson &AMP; Thomson Inc. of Quincy, Mass., an intellectual
property research firm and a subsidiary of Thomson Financial
Services.
</P>
<P>
   A sample search for use of the name Harvard in Internet domain
names turned up 54 US registrations, including names, addresses,
and phone numbers. Only 15 were related to the university. Nineteen
others were turned up abroad, including public relations companies
in Germany and France _ but with fewer details than the US files
produced. The posted price for that search was $200.
</P>
<P>
   For no extra charge, Namestake also reported Harvard was being
used in 485 trademark registrations around the world, 239 of them
in Europe and 33 in Canada. For an added fee, it would give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett says Namestake.com, which began operating last August,
records about 40,000 site visits weekly. Many come from the 72
partners Thomson &AMP; Thomson has signed up to carry Web-page links to
steer customers to Namestake. Network Solutions is one; dozens of
others are Internet service providers, or ``hosting'' companies
that maintain server computers where domain-name holders can rent
space to hold their Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not selling advertising and we don't plan to,'' Barrett
said. He declined to disclose Namestake's revenues to date,
although an on-line trademark research service Thomson &AMP; Thomson
began in 1997 took in $2.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Namestake users include corporate chief executives and small
businesses. Barrett believes many are looking not for open domain
names but trademark infringements, which Namestake software finds
by seeking out both exact matches and names that resemble key words
that users type in.
</P>
<P>
   Another sample search found dozens of plays on Yahoo, a
trademark for a popular Internet search engine _ including Ya-Hoo,
Y-a-h-o-o _ and one that Yahoo Inc. is contesting, YaHooka, which
bills itself as ``the guide to marijuana on the Internet'' but
asserts that it ``is in no way affiliated with Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the lawyers come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trademarks are valuable properties and to the extent that
domain names are another place to slap your trademark, they have
additional value,'' says Diane Thilly Cabell, a lawyer with
Fausett, Gaeta &AMP; Lund in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases in which domain names containing trademarks are
put into use, Cabell said, ``cybersquatters and name grabbers have
been kicked out whenever a trademark owner has taken them to court,
as having no reasonable right to use those names.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop speculators, who argue that unless a name
is put into use, there is no infringement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, six days before Exxon Corp. and Mobil Oil Corp.
announced merger plans last Dec. 1, and continuing for a week
afterward, five speculators _ one each from Japan, South Korea,
Singapore, Canada, and the United States, according to records _
laid claim to 11 Internet addresses that joined the names of the
two oil-industry giants. Among them: exxonmobil.com,
mobilexxon.com, exxon-mobil.net, exxon-mobil.org, and, in a subtle
variation, exxon--mobil.org _ with two hyphens.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. VanEtten, of Abbottsford, British Columbia, said Exxon and
Mobil lawyers sent letters via Federal Express demanding he give up
the four names that he registered.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said his reply was brief. ``If they
are interested, they can offer me a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Etten, a freelance computer consultant, said he holds other
domain names incorporating business names. He calls them
investments, and said he began collecting them after meeting a
Toronto speculator who claimed to have been offered $500,000 for
the domain name ElvisPresley.com _ but who refused to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Van Etten says he hasn't sold any of his names, either.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach, though, is to squirrel away domain names and
then rent out the use of them.
</P>
<P>
   MailBank.com Inc., based in Vancouver, British Columbia, but
incorporated in Nevada, says it has more than 12,000 domain names
registered in the United States with endings of .com, .net, and
.org.
</P>
<P>
   Many are family names, including Smith and Jones. Others are
related to jobs or personal traits, including economist.net,
bulldozer.com, realestatemarket.com, genealogist.net, and
oddballs.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Sumpton, the company's president and a cofounder, said
customers can rent e-mail addresses at domains of their choice for
$5 a year, plus monthly charges for the e-mail service. If they
want a subdomain _ www.john.smith.net is an example _ they can rent
that, too, at a higher fee. MailBank.com also designs and stores
Web pages for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   With startup costs of $1.2 million and registration renewal fees
alone of $420,000 a year, the three-year-old company is only now
starting to make money, he said. A few domains have no subscribers
at all. The largest, smith.net, has fewer than 500.
</P>
<P>
   Sumpton shrugs off charges of being a ``cybersquatter,'' and
says he has so far resisted demands by McDonald's Corp. to stop
using Web names containing TheMcDonalds, McLamb, and McMaster.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, MailBank.com did lose a suit brought by
Avery Dennison Corp., the office supplies manufacturer, over use of
avery.net. ``They had avery.com and they wanted everything,''
Sumpton said. The ruling is under appeal.

<P>
   The handbooks have all the subtlety of television ads for
personal injury lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Every elite university in the nation violates federal law, they
warn. Trustees, you may be personally responsible for a costly
lawsuit. Students, your rights may have been _ and probably were _
breached.
</P>
<P>
   They go on to offer help: how to find a lawyer, how to file a
freedom of information act. They list the documents needed to win
the court case, and prod, ``Be tenacious,'' and always ``Appeal,
appeal, appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won initial battles in the courts and referendums in
California and Washington, groups trying to overturn affirmative
action are now trying to enlist new foot soldiers among college
trustees and spurned college applicants.
</P>
<P>
   With a campaign announced this week, a coalition of affirmative
action opponents sent out handbooks to 300 college trustees
warning, in tones ranging from avuncular to vaguely threatening,
that trustees can be held personally liable if they fail to probe
the activities and comments of college admissions officers to make
sure that acceptance decisions are not based on race. In ads placed
in 15 college newspapers, the coalition offered students their own
handbook outlining how to sue if a college rejection letter was
based on considerations of race. In most cases, the handbook says,
it was.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors, who led the court case that banned affirmative
action at public universities in Texas and are now challenging the
policies of the University of Michigan, hope their appeal will
prompt nervous colleges and universities to abolish programs
ranging from race-based scholarships to summer camps for
disadvantaged minority students. Ultimately, they vow, it will
eliminate the need to finance any additional suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, trustees and students have been told that the
university complies with federal law, but the truth is, it probably
doesn't,'' said Terence Pell, the senior counsel for the Center for
Individual Rights, which along with the privately funded Pope
Institute for the Future of Higher Education, is sponsoring the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road we may get more clients, but that isn't our goal
here. These are really clear violations, and when trustees and
students wade into this, we're not going to have to file any more
lawsuits, because there'll be such a wide range of people
questioning it, that it's not going to be viable for schools to
have these policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the campaign, Pell said, prompted ``a couple
hundred'' calls requesting handbooks or more information. He
predicted thousands of potential litigants among college students
rejected by elite public universities, who could sue for being
forced to pay higher tuitions at private schools. The campaign,
however, targets both public and private schools, all among the top
two tiers in national rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The handbooks, essentially self-help books on how to start a
lawsuit, prompted immediate concern among college administrators
and in admissions offices that have already seen an increase in
suits or threats to sue from students who say they were rejected
because they are white.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officers rushed to defend their policies, saying that
the Center for Individual Rights consistently interprets admissions
decisions too simplistically. In reality, they said, race is but
one factor in an admissions decision, alongside factors like how
fast a student runs, how well she plays the cello, how many
languages he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I have seen of the approach from organizations like
the Center for Individual Rights, their whole perception of how
admissions decisions should be made seems to be pretty
one-dimensional, based on tests and GPAs,'' said Rick Kast,
associate counsel for the University of Virginia, one of the 15
schools targeted in the campaign announced Tuesday. ``That's not
the philosophy used here, or at many schools. Schools look at a
wide array of criteria, they make individual decisions to select a
group who can bring a lot to the institution. We certainly don't
think we're doing anything in the way we conduct admissions
decisions that is unlawful or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   College admissions officers say students who sue tend to be
those who are truly unqualified, with unrealistic expectations
about their prospects for admission.
</P>
<P>
   The handbook for students, however, encourages them to see
admissions decisions as fundamentally unfair. ``The lingering
presence of racial preferences makes the application process all
the more difficult, and the decisions all the more arbitrary,'' it
says. By putting information in the hands of people who can change
the policies _ students, through lawsuits, and trustees, through
challenges to administrators _ the handbook says that decisions can
become more fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision that has guided schools in seeking a diverse
student body, the 1978 Bakke case, the Supreme Court said schools
could use race as one factor in seeking diversity. But the
campaign's supporters argue that the court set up so many
conditions on how schools could use race, that no school can abide
by that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign and the 48-page handbooks heat up the most recent
debates on affirmative action by turning arguments used by
supporters to the advantage of opponents. In particular, opponents
cite last year's ``The Shape of the River'' by Derek Bok and
William Bowen, which details the wide impact of affirmative action
policies on college campuses over the past three decades. But while
Bok and Bowen argue that affirmative action is a good thing,
creating colleges that train students to live and work in a diverse
world, Pell said the book merely acknowledges that most schools are
using race to make admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a shift in the national debate, where people like
Bowen and Bok take the tack that, yes that racial preferences play
a much wider role than ever before admitted, but that's a good
thing, because it boosts minority enrollment,'' Pell said. ``But if
that's the rationale, it's illegal.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ At the end of a day that she denied was, but
surely felt like, the launch of the 2000 campaign, Tipper Gore
called Washington to tell her husband she was having so much fun in
New Hampshire that she was going to stay a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president protested the schedule change and argued that
it wasn't in the game plan. The exchange went on briefly until Al
Gore realized that, as usual, the joke was on him. With a great
belly laugh, Mrs. Gore reassured her husband she would be home to
make dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Home is where her heart is, but New Hampshire is where the first
presidential primary will be. All joking aside, Tipper Gore, the
wife of a soon-to-be presidential candidate, is suiting up for a
starring role in a campaign for the White House that can use, as
much as anything, an all-American family portrait.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Gore is known mostly as the animated wife beside
her wooden husband and the not-as-cerebral counterweight to his
chronic wonkishness. But to voters fed up with X-rated politicians
and suspicious of ambitious spouses, Tipper Gore is being polished
and put forward as a loyal partner in a love-story marriage, a
conscientious parent who puts children before career, and a quiet,
compassionate champion of lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for the first family to be like the Gores, a
family that exemplifies what America is all about, a couple that
genuinely exudes affection and has raised four beautiful kids,''
said Lou D'Allesandro, a Democratic state senator who greeted Gore
at the Manchester, N.H., airport on her recent day trip to the
state. ``I hope they give Tipper as much exposure as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the whirlwind swing across New Hampshire for ``Team Tipper''
was any example, that is exactly what Gore strategists plan.
Despite frigid temperatures and a blizzard that made for a
hazardous motorcade, Mrs. Gore held a town meeting in Nashua on
child nutrition, gave a speech in Lebanon on ending the stigma of
mental illness, schmoozed in Concord with Democratic lawmakers, and
added an unscheduled meet-and-greet with diners at the Merrimack
Restaurant in Manchester, an obligatory stop for any serious
candidate coming through the state.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has been there at least three times in his career, but
no politician had ever taken pictures of the restaurant staff until
the impulsive Mrs. Gore, once a photojournalist and still never far
from a point-and-shoot camera, paid her first visit. ``Does she
want my autograph, too?'' a delighted waitress wondered.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the day's only little act of kindness by Mrs. Gore,
who seems to have a natural gift for making human connections,
whether it was giving a child with stage fright a reassuring hug,
buying carry-out chicken for her Secret Service agents, or
insisting that New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen skip a
reception to ``go home to your children'' _ which she did _ before
the weather got any worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even the erudite psychiatrists and professors at the
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center were unusually interested in the
weekly departmental lecture delivered by Gore, who has degrees in
psychology from Boston University and Vanderbilt, but has never
practiced in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we've finally solved our attendance problem,''
quipped Dr. Peter Silberfarb, chairman of the school's psychiatry
department, who called Gore ``a real advocate for people with
mental illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who even after two decades as a political spouse seems
slightly insecure on the stump, said she enjoyed the day. ``I just
liked the spirit, I liked the people and being able to talk to them
about things they cared about,'' she said in an interview. ``And I
certainly liked giving money to the state!''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's wife has a small persona, compared with the
so-called Big Three: the president, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Al
Gore. But a new chief of staff and the White House focus on the
2000 campaign are making sure that Mrs. Gore gets media-attracting
assignments _ her humanitarian mission to hurricane-ravaged Central
America in November was one _ and her share of political goodies to
pass out.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, for example, she announced that the state
would receive almost $900,000 from Washington to help low-income
people insulate their homes. At Dartmouth, she unveiled plans for a
spring White House Conference on Mental Illness, which she will
have a big role in designing and hosting. In the next week, Gore
will address the US Conference of Mayors in Washington, and promote
jazz in the schools and youth fitness at events in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised her profile a little bit,'' said Audrey Haynes,
the former director of the women's policy office in the White House
and now Mrs. Gore's chief of staff. Haynes said that while Gore is
speaking out more on issues such as abortion rights and pay equity,
which are important to Democratic liberals, she wants to ``stay
focused on the issues she has been focused on for many years,''
including mental health, homelessness, and physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say that the trick for Gore will be striking
the right political balance for 2000: Having substance and causes
without projecting any ambitions to be co-president, being smart
without being threatening, and promoting the party's feminist
agenda while being the poster-parent for family values.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to the first lady, they say, but given the way Mrs.
Clinton has at times polarized public opinion, it probably helps
that Tipper Gore isn't a lawyer and doesn't have a career.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says she counts Mrs. Clinton as a personal friend, a
``terrific'' person, and a first lady who has ``done a remarkable
job and carried out her role with grace and dignity.'' But every
first lady is unique, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any first lady is going to be different, and everyone who
fulfills the role in the future, no matter who it is, hopefully
will bring the essence of who they are and what they care about to
the role,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Gore was branded as a prude and worse
for leading a campaign to protect children from lewd and violent
lyrics in pop music. The group she founded, the Parents' Music
Resource Center, prompted congressional hearings (then-Senator Gore
of Tennessee was on the committee) and succeeded in getting the
recording industry to voluntarily put warning labels on their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nobody is singling out Tipper Gore, author of ``Raising
PG Kids in an X-Rated Society,'' as an enemy of the culture. Susan
Bianchi-Sand, head of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, a feminist umbrella group, said that, if anything,
liberals ``have probably come closer to where she is on the issues,
rather than her moving toward us.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, Mrs. Gore might be the consummate role model, a
mother and family woman who is also a progressive thinker,''
Bianchi-Sand said. ``She puts those two pieces of her life together
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the police escort, the Secret Service detail, the
chartered plane, an accommodating White House staff, and a very
nice piece of public housing, Gore suggests that she is just a
normal person who still prefers attending a high-school football
game to a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to remind people that in this age of celebrity, we are
pretty much ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and
doing the very best that we can,'' Gore said. ``I think we deal
with the same kind of issues that the majority of American families
deal with, balancing work roles and family obligations, taking care
of aging parents, as well as kids in school and young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue she won't discuss is the impeachment and Senate trial
of President Clinton. She said she has ``never, not once'' thought
about what she would do if the Senate removed the president from
office, propelling the Gores into the White House. ``My plate is
quite full'' without considering that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what the Gore strategists fear most is having the White
House sex scandal hang over the vice president's campaign. The
response is to spotlight both the Gores' enduring, high-school
sweetheart romance (the vice president recently said he and Tipper
might have been the inspiration for the book ``Love Story,'' a
suggestion author Erich Segal quashed) and their children: Karenna,
25; Kristin, 21; Sarah, 20; and Albert III, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who is known to have a wicked sense of humor,
sometimes does poke fun at the image of being a perfect
stand-by-your-man political wife. She apologized to a group of New
Hampshsire Democrats for skipping a visit last fall because she had
injured her leg in a jogging accident. The vice president had come
in her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would fill in for me,'' Mrs. Gore dead-panned. ``He
is a very supportive spouse.''

ON CAMPUS, FRUSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Even the sun streaming through floor-to-ceiling campus
windows couldn't mask the disappointment on Nathan Johnson's face.
</P>
<P>
   He's disillusioned by the president, to be sure. He's equally
unhappy with Congress. But what irks him most is the unrelenting
opposition of the American people to impeachment. The polls, he
said, have just got to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country was founded on good moral standards and it seems
like we've completely gone against that,'' said Johnson, 27. ``The
trial should already be over. It should be done. But our system
doesn't work anymore, whether it's O.J. Simpson or Bill Clinton on
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's lack of faith in the system echoed across the campus
at Phoenix College, a two-year commuter school whose 12,000 day and
evening students represent more than 100 countries. Whether, like
Johnson, they were among the third of Americans who favor Clinton's
resignation or removal, or among the majority who want him to
remain in office, the students agreed that almost everyone in
Washington has behaved badly, from the president to the independent
prosecutor to the men and women elected to represent them in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Poplin, the college's head baseball coach and Johnson's
companion for a quick lunch in the cafeteria Tuesday, also wants to
see Clinton go. He said he has held that opinion almost from the
start of the scandal, and that he bases his view more on
revelations that the president had sexual relations with a White
House intern than on disclosures that he tried to cover it up with
a lie. The lie, Poplin said, ``just doubles it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Poplin said he doesn't need to hear from Monica Lewinsky
or any other witness to know what must be done. Clinton must be
treated just as a school superintendent or business executive
caught in the same situation would be. He doesn't understand how
anyone in Congress could feel otherwise. The only question that
should remain, Poplin said, is how Clinton should be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we not heard it all already?'' he said. ``What was all of
what we just went through then? How many times do we need to hear
that he let this lady do what she did? The sex is fact. Now what's
the penalty?''
</P>
<P>
   The length of the impeachment proceedings, and the fact that no
one yet knows when or how they might end, appeared to annoy almost
everyone grabbing a salad or sandwich in the college cafeteria.
Many of them work full-time while attending classes in the shadow
of Phoenix's gleaming downtown. They said they want to get on with
their studies, and for Congress to get on with the business of
running the country.
</P>
<P>
   Table after table of students, some still teenagers, others in
their early fifties, opposed closing any part of the Senate trial
to the public, as happened on Monday and again Tuesday night. That,
they feared, could only mean more grandstanding leading to more
delays and more unnecessary debate over an issue that the American
people appear to already have settled for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As Jose Irizarry, a 25-year-old liberal arts major put it,
``This is already an ordeal for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Added his friend, Gabriel Sayegh, 26, who is studying business
and criminal law, ``But we don't care what other countries think.
We're stronger than they are and this is our business. Not that his
personal life is our business. I mean, anyone can understand why he
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Irizarry and Sayegh said they want to see Clinton finish
out his second term, and then retire with the dignity they feel he
deserves. Ending the impeachment trial now would help him do that,
they added.
</P>
<P>
   And Aleksandra Stokic, a Bosnian who credits the Clinton
administration with helping her relocate to Arizona, said she wants
a quick resolution, preferably in the president's favor but a
resolution regardless. One thing she said she learned during the
war in her homeland is that time does not inevitably lead to a more
reasonable resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be for impeachment, if it hadn't started this way,
with an investigation into his personal life, because he did lie,''
said Stokic, a 21-year-old who hopes to become a fashion designer
and a US citizen. ``I don't like him as a person. But he doesn't
deserve to go through this. The American people don't deserve to go
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   But her friend, nursing major Jose Antonio Garcia, insisted that
a just outcome can come only from seeing the process through to the
finish. Although he voted for Clinton, Garcia favors a vote to
remove Clinton from office. The law, he said, is the law, no matter
who breaks it. An example must be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now Congress is stuck; they don't know which way to
go,'' said Garcia, 29. ``Well, they should go for it all the way to
the end, even if it makes people mad. And if it goes all the way,
they should have witnesses, all the things that go with a regular
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garcia said he wasn't sure that what has occurred on the
House and Senate floors so far has given him more confidence in
Congress. Investigating a president's extramarital escapades makes
him squeemish, he said. It could also mean more interference in
people's private lives in the future, which he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it gives me more or less faith in

government. Big Brother is always watching now. I mean if this can
happen to the president . . . .''

CALIFORNIANS TUNE OUT POLITICS, WITH THE MEDIA'S HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Californians know how to compartmentalize,
especially when dealing with politics. In the world's
seventh-largest economy, outdoor distractions abound. While their
cousins east of the Sierra freeze and shiver, residents of the
Golden State golf and swim. Even skiing is a short ride from
temperate climes.
</P>
<P>
   Since politics is an indoor sport, its aficionados are few.
Politics ranks in California's priorities somewhere between soccer
and ceramics. Now comes documentation that television shares _ or
steers _ the state's low level of interest in Washington and,
especially, in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Southern California examined 8,664 hours of local news during the
1998 California governor's contest for the open seat Governor Pete
Wilson left because of term limits. With Democrats hoping to return
to power after 16 years, the contest resonated with drama even if
the contestants, Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren,
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all local news, 0.31 percent focused on the governor's
race,'' said Marty Kaplan of USC. Total coverage during the
campaign in the state's biggest media markets amounted to 26 hours,
57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The study was patterned after a survey by Mary Ellen Leary on
coverage of the 1974 gubernatorial race, to which television
devoted 1.8 percent of its news. Leary wrote that this total was
``eroding the democratic process'' and ``demoralizing the hopes
that television can enhance the process of leadership selection in
this country.'' Kaplan said at a conference here that ``a sixfold
decrease from a generation ago'' raises questions about the
``entire media ecology.''
</P>
<P>
   This university town was named after Bishop George Berkeley, the
Irish philosopher who asked a famous question about a tree falling
in a forest. Does it make a sound if no one can hear it? A partial
answer may have come from Mark DiCamillo, director of the statewide
Field Poll, who said that voter turnout in November, 41 percent of
those eligible, equaled Califoria's all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   USC unveiled its study at a weekend conference on the 1998
contest sponsored by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the
University of California at Berkeley, an election autopsy patterned
after post-presidential gatherings at Harvard's Institute of
Politics featuring handlers, consultants, and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Television reporters were understandably upset at the USC study.
``This study does a disservice,'' said David Wright of KRON-TV,
noting that ``candidates did not make themselves available . . . We
offered free air time for mini-debates and they blew us off.'' All
true, as was the argument of Randy Shandobil of KTVU-TV, who asked
whether a content analysis of newspapers would show the same trend.
Probably, since television learns its bad habits from print.
Graphics and demographics have bewitched newspapers for decades, as
hard news yields to lifestyle sagas and late-breaking recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Wright and Shandobil do solid work for San Francisco stations
and the USC study shows that Bay Area coverage was twice as
intensive as that in Los Angeles, 0.51 percent to 0.26 percent. The
difference between television news in San Francisco and a similar
product in L.A. approximates the difference in quality between
``Masterpiece Theatre'' and ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The California governor's race cost $500 million, most of it
going to television stations who ignored it. This is called
capitalism at work. Since 1974, according to Daniel Webster, news
director of KPIX-TV in San Francisco, ``deregulation'' allowed
television stations to become ``commodities,'' which led to
``cutbacks in public-affairs programming.''
</P>
<P>
   The public airwaves now seldom even pay lip service to the
public interest. The ratings race is as relentless and as edifying
as the staple of TV news in Los Angeles, a random police chase on
the freeway.

 &HT;    It's time to put on a Falcons Feast
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No sooner did the Falcons earn the right to fly south
to Miami, than the calls started pouring in. From Boulder to
Roanoke, folks wanted to know: What do Atlantans eat at Super Bowl
parties?
</P>
<P>
   Uh . . . well . . . um. Party mix and pizza? Beer and nachos?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the big game may have been of passing interest to
football fans here in years gone by. But since we were always
watching teams from other cities, it was hardly worth creative
culinary efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But this year is different. Very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I guess you guys don't know how to handle this Super Bowl
thing,'' quipped Marty Meitus, food editor of the Denver Rocky
Mountain News when we asked her what folks there serve at game
parties. ``Basically, people dye everything blue and orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I suppose we could do with a red velvet cake and black
frosting. Or add some red and black licorice to the candy bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But we know that some folks compare the Atlanta Falcons in the
Super Bowl to you-know-where freezing over. So this event demands
much more from us than mere chips and dip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Atlantans will have no problem soaring to the
occasion. In fact, in no more time than it takes Morten Andersen to
send the pigskin sailing through the goal posts, we came up with
the ideal dish to honor our tenacious team.
</P>
<P>
   We call it Dirty Bird Rice With Falcon Wings.
</P>
<P>
   It's our version of dirty rice, bolstered with sausage and
ground turkey and spiked with the team colors _ red peppers and
black olives _ flanked by chicken wings seasoned with red hot sauce
and blackened seasoning mix.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons fan John Cobb of Roswell was thinking along the same
lines. For the championship game against Minnesota, he created the
Dirty Bird Po' Boy Sandwich, which he'll serve again for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe: Prepare Zatarain dirty rice mix with some browned
pork sausage and ground round steak, warm up some spicy
heat-and-eat chicken tenders and stuff all this into sub rolls
slathered with remoulade sauce mixed with mayo. Then ``dance and
flap yo' wings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a party for the Super Bowl. But this year
we're thinking of having friends over,'' said Cobb. ``It's going to
be a real social event in this town this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with area caterers, nearly everyone mentioned chicken
wings, and a few were already planning menus with dirty rice.
Several shared Super Bowl ideas we hadn't thought of, like Randy
Adler of the Preferred Caterer Inc. He renamed one of his favorite
end-zone starters Southern Cheering Cheese, a mixture of gorgonzola
and cream cheese with seasonings and toasted pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hamm of Lowcountry Barbecue suggested regionalizing
classic baked beans by adding pulled pork to the mixture. And
Patrick Cuccaro of Affairs to Remember offers the Dirty Birds Over
Denver sandwich featuring a pork loin rubbed with Rocky Mountain
coffee ``ground to a pulp,'' the fate he's confident the Broncos
will meet.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find those recipes and other crowd-pleasers inside.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. In the event there's a Denver fan in town somewhere, Meitus
graciously sent us a recipe for an orange and blueberry fruit tart.
In return we sent the Rocky Mountain News (and share again with
you) an Atlanta classic _ Coca-Cola cake.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it may be the only taste of sweet success the folks
in Denver get Sunday.

CELLUCCI'S SLASH-AND-FORGET WELFARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Governor Cellucci has announced a sweeping program to maintain
poverty in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say it like that. What he said was that he wants to
slash 11,000 mothers from welfare. Formerly, mothers with children
between 2 and 5 years old could be on welfare. Cellucci wants all
such women to now work at least 30 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposal maintains for him a central place at the
fair, where politicians line up and fire the baseball to hit the
bulls-eye that plunges welfare recipients into the tank. From
Republicans like Cellucci to Republicrats like President Clinton,
they keep pretending that the soaked person in the tank really
enjoys being the butt of the midway.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton's Health and Human Services Department
proudly announced that the nation has slashed 44 percent of welfare
recipients from the rolls, from 14.3 million in 1994 to 8 million
today. HHS Secretary Donna Shalala has said, ``The whole point of
this is to eliminate poverty in the United States, not just to get
people off welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence to prove this is so. Several studies,
including those compiled by the Children's Defense Fund, the Tufts
University Center on Hunger and Poverty, and the Center for Budget
and Policy Priorities are discovering that at best, 29 percent or
so of recent welfare recipients have jobs that pay above the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   That means 7 out of 10 former recipients do not have jobs that
lift them out of poverty. Worse, half of welfare recipients have
jobs that pay less than 75 percent of the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Cellucci has so far maintained the
slash-and-forget policies of his predecessor, William Weld. Since
1995, the state has cut the welfare rolls from 102,993 to 58,961.
Up to now, the state has little clue how many of the people who
have been dropped have escaped poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the state said 37 percent of former recipients
left welfare for higher earnings, the same percentage as before
``reform.'' Another snapshot study said 50 percent of former
recipients reported higher earnings.
</P>
<P>
   None of that says if they left poverty, a critical question
since welfare payments average only $3.26 an hour. In any event,
the state did not know the whereabouts of the other 63 percent. If
a significant number of people left poverty, surely by now the
state would have told welfare advocates to eat crow.
</P>
<P>
   The state says it will have new data soon. If it can prove that
the vast majority of recipients are rising out of poverty, fine.
But there is nothing yet to suggest that Cellucci is doing anything
except rendering the poor invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The state, after all, has some of the nation's highest living
costs, so high that 220,000 workers left in the 1990s, according to
a recent report by the Teresa and H. John Heinz Foundation and the
Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is so expensive here that the report concluded that 1 in
7 state residents were actually in poverty in 1995 compared to the
official figure of 1 in 9. The poverty level has surely risen since
then, since the official 1997 poverty rate rose to 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In another survey released this week, the Urban Institute found
that low-income families in Massachusetts, even during the current
economic boom _ indeed have harder lives here than in other parts
of the nation with higher levels of unemployment and higher
indicators of family stress.
</P>
<P>
   The Heinz/MassINC report said that the state has many workers
``running in place'' and the bottom 10 percent of income earners
seeing a decline in real earnings. Nor is the state working very
hard for the working poor. For example, Cellucci wants to add $56
million to day care, but no one knows what this means since the
waiting list for subsidized day care is already 17,000 children
long.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to suggest that ending welfare ends poverty.
You can see that Cellucci understands this by the way his aides
talk about the proposed cuts. ``If you can't find a paying job,
we'll put you into a community service slot,'' one welfare official
said. ``No matter what, you're going to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They already say ``if'' because they know there are not enough
jobs to lift recipients out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Heinz/MassINC study frets that unless the state is better
able to track the people who are trying to rise out of poverty,
politicians could be ``flying blind as the national and state
economies enter the choppy waters of an economic downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has chosen to cover his eyes, forcing welfare
recipients into minimum-wage work instead of creating incentives
for training and education for jobs that pay above the poverty
level and without a coherent strategy on the day care, housing, and
health costs that pull workers back into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of punishment mark Cellucci as a visionless
governor whose turn at the most popular of political sideshows
resulted not in hitting the bulls-eye, but crunched welfare
recipients in the skull before dunking them into the tank.

   To help us savor our revenge, Patrick Cuccaro of Affairs to
Remember devised this hearty sandwich with the Broncos in mind.
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Rocky Mountain (or other) coffee, freshly ground
to a pulp
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh sage, minced beyond recognition (like we'll
do the Broncos)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons fresh garlic, finely minced (visualize a Bronco fan

and turn to coat thoroughly with the seasonings, patting them on
with your hand if necessary. Cover the bowl with plastic and
refrigerate for 4 to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Roast for
about 25 minutes per pound until fully cooked (170 degrees internal

Remove the roast from the oven and let stand about 20 minutes. Cut
into slices, put on your favorite bread with interesting condiments

Atlanta winner, Coca-Cola Cake.

   Rocky Mountain News food editor Marty Meitus shared this recipe,
which turns up at Broncos parties. Switch the orange and blue

</P>
<P>
   Lemon-custard filling:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   4 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice

with a fork; stir in small amount of hot sugar mixture. Slowly pour
yolk mixture back into sugar mixture in pan, stirring rapidly to
prevent lumping. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens

through sieve.) Remove saucepan from heat. Stir lemon zest and
lemon juice into custard. Cover custard and refrigerate until very
cold, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   For pastry: In medium bowl, combine flour, coconut, sugar and
yolk. Cut in butter until well-blended. Press dough onto bottom and
up sides of 10-inch removable-bottom tart pan. Prick tart shell
with fork all over. Line shell with foil; bake 10 minutes. Remove
foil. Prick again. Bake 10 to 15 minutes longer, until golden. Cool
completely. In small bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat heavy
cream until stiff peaks form. With rubber spatula or whisk, fold
cream into custard. Spoon into tart shell. Decorate with fruit.

JEFFREY STEINGARTEN: VOGUE'S WITTY, OBSESSIVE FOOD CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES--BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeffrey Steingarten sets down his cigar and unwraps
marrow bones with meticulous care. The cuffs of his navy blazer
never brush the counter. The bones are about to be a second
appetizer before he heads out for lunch (where he eventually orders
a third). He'll share the meaty marrow with Henry, the yellow
Labrador retriever owned by his assistant, Kathryn Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten first slips Henry's treat into the microwave, then
grills it on the restaurant range in the kitchen of his Union
Square loft. A butcher has sawed the bones lengthwise into 6-inch
pieces so they resemble skinny bowls and, when browned, the
incredibly rich marrow lifts out easily with a fork. Steingarten
saw this presentation at Michael Jordan's The Steak House N.Y.C. in
Grand Central Station. He hasn't stopped talking about it. In Paris
recently, he raved about it to all his friends. ``They changed
their pot au feu,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten, 55, enjoys being an information purveyor who finds
the single best you-name-it _ in this case, a terrific way to cut
and cook marrow bones. His monthly food column, seen by an
estimated 9 million people, has run in Vogue since 1989.
Interspersed between photographs of the thinnest, most beautiful
models in New York in some of the most expensive outfits
imaginable, Steingarten goes on at length about his weight and
body-mass index, about his fear of becoming obese, about diet pills
and his love of fatty foods, and about dishes in which pasta,
cream, butter, mushrooms, and foie gras all converge in the same
incredible mouthful (January Vogue). For that pleasure, he had to
comb Paris restaurants, sort through a mountain of historical
recipes _ all columns are researched like dissertations _ and
interview dozens of chefs. The reward, he says, is that he's ``read
the most in gynecologists' offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes about ketchup, macaroni, French baguettes, and
American wedding cakes, no single subject particularly interesting.
But Steingarten captivates the reader. He's funny in the ironic,
clever way of British humor, self-deprecating, revealing about his
interesting life, deeply self-analytical, wildly opinionated,
obsessive about research, and a masterful storyteller. A collection
of columns, ``The Man Who Ate Everything'' (Vintage), came out in
paperback last November and recently landed on the New York Times
Bestseller List.
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten is gleeful about The List. He mentions it twice.
``It comes out a week in advance,'' he reports. ``I'm tied for
15.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later he tells me, ``I've climbed to 14.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Food flies in &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten's dining table is covered with food brought back
from recent travels. He attended a conference on ``slow food'' in
Italy, then spent a couple of weeks in San Diego to see his wife,
Caron Smith. A year ago, she took a job as deputy director and
Asian curator of the San Diego Museum of Art, so the two have a
bicoastal marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Packages of macaroni twice the length of common spaghetti are
stacked on one side of the table. The first recipe in France for
Italian macaroni, he explains, was published in 1550. ``One of the
things the French did was to turn it into an object of fantasy and
fill it with foie gras and truffles.''
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten operates a little like a culinary jukebox. You press
the button and he starts talking. He interrupts himself to explain
that years ago a writer could toss out a tidbit about food history
and sound important. Now, he says, ``you actually have to know
something.'' He jumps from television to macaroni, then back to San
Diego, about which he has nothing nice to say. He calls it a city
deprived of good food.
</P>
<P>
   A box has just arrived from Bay Village Baking Co. of Point
Reyes Station in California. It contains two large crusty loaves
shipped overnight. ``Paula Wolfert and Alice Waters told me about
this bakery.'' Wolfert, the cookbook author, lives in San Francisco
and has a country house in Sonoma. Waters owns Chez Panisse
restaurant in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   As Steingarten cuts into a loaf, he explains that the bakery has
a wood oven and uses ``beautiful organic flour.'' The bread, he
says, ``has beautiful hole structure.'' He would like it to be less
sour, ``but this is as good as anything I've tasted of its kind.''
</P>
<P>
   He has packages of Italian Gertosio chocolate made with
gianduia, a chocolate hazelnut paste, which comes in a classic
triangular shape. ``A rough hazelnut taste,'' he says. He used to
buy another hazelnut chocolate that he was sure were the best
around _ until he found these.
</P>
<P>
   There are caramels made by Le Roux of Quiberon, a town on the
Brittany coast. ``They're very famous because they use salted
butter,'' he explains. He presses several of these into my hand to
try later because now we have to go to the Szechuan peppercorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Szechuan to find out what the food is like. The
basic taste was peppercorns.'' He opens a bag of peppercorns from
Dazu. ``Take two on your tongue,'' he instructs. ``They're not hot.
Look, I'll do it, too, so you know it won't kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a few seconds for the metallic taste to come out. Then
the tongue starts to tingle and becomes prickly, and pretty soon it
feels numb here and there. I throw them out.
</P>
<P>
   He has an antidote. He pulls from the refrigerator a marinating
quail, made from a dish he saw demonstrated on the Food Channel by
Ming Tsai, the owner-chef of Wellesley's Blue Ginger restaurant.
Steingarten says he was intrigued with the recipe, which contains
Szechuan peppercorns, the Indonesian pepper paste sambal, molasses,
garlic, oil, and red wine. He slips a quail under the grill. When
he tastes it, it needs salt.

   LIVING-ROOMS (Undated) _ Let us consider the dwindling
circumstances of the American living room, once so commodious and
central to the domestic universe that Tom Wolfe, writing in acid
admiration in ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' in 1987, described it as
``this gloriously stuffed little planet.'' Yet during a recent
visit to the Mt. Kisco model home, not one person in a steady
stream of visitors stepped across the threshold into the living
room. Instead, they made a beeline straight back to the
double-height family room, a congenial open space adjacent to the
kitchen, where they chatted amiably on Dumbo-sized couches or
gathered about its unlit fireplace as if it were a 51-inch
television screen. By Julie V. Iovine.

   MANHATTAN-RENT (New York) _ In Manhattan these days, finding the
rental apartment you want is only the beginning. Prospective
renters can find themselves in a bidding war _ for a rental _ and
by the time the dust settles, agreeing to pay hundreds of dollars a
month more than the asking price and putting up one month's rent
and three months' security in advance. And finding themselves
required to produce the extraordinary financial credentials that
made them acceptable candidates to pay a high rent. By Tracie
Rozhon.

<P>
   LENS-CREDIT-CARD (Undated) _ The LensCard, currently marketed by
Chase Manhattan, is a credit card designed with a flat, one-inch
window that magnifies three and a half times _ enough power to
enlarge a line on a restaurant bill from a blur to legibility. By
Phlip Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   SPRING-FEVER (New York) _ Spring fever can begin in strange
ways. It hit me hard last week, when a friend brought over a bunch
of Swiss chard purchased at an expensive natural-foods store. The
leaves were a deep plush green, with vermilion veins coursing
through them like rivers bursting with life. And in my memory at
least (alas, we ate the evidence), they were not crinkled and
glossy like most Swiss chard, but smooth, almost as if crossed with
a collard green. As we chopped the leaves and sauteed them with
garlic, the sensual pleasures of spring on the farm rushed into my
Red Hook kitchen. By Anne Raver.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN-LOFT (New York) _ Two years ago, when Arnold Lehman
left Baltimore to become the director of the Brooklyn Museum of
Art, he and his wife, Pamela, knew exactly what kind of home they
wanted. In Brooklyn, they found what they wanted: a
3,000-square-foot floor-through loft on a high floor in what was a
1920's Gothic Revival office building. It's two blocks from the
Boro Hall subway stop and 10 minutes by car or subway from the
museum. And light? It pours in through 30 windows. By Elaine Louie.

<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup light or dark raisins
</P>
<P>
   Fruit filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 20-ounce can crushed pineapple, packed in juice
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups grated unsweetened coconut
</P>
<P>
   For the cake: Grease two 9-inch round layer cake pans. Line with
wax paper and grease the paper. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sift flour, baking powder and salt in a medium mixing bowl. In a
small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy.
Beat in egg yolks and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture alternately
with milk until blended. Fold in beaten egg whites. Spoon 2/3 of
batter into one cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   Stir nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and raisins into remaining batter
and spoon into second cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 35 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes
out clean. Cool layers in pans on wire racks 10 minutes. Loosen
around edges with a knife. Turn out onto racks. Peel off wax paper.
Cool layers completely, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   For the fruit filling: Into a 2-cup measure, drain pineapple
juice (about 1 1/3 cups). Add water to make 2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Mix cornstarch and 2 cups sugar in a medium saucepan. Stir in
the 2 cups pineapple liquid and pineapple. Cook slowly, stirring
constantly, until mixture thickens and boils 1 minute. Remove from
heat. Stir in lemon rind, lemon juice and coconut. Chill
thoroughly, about 2 hours. Makes 4 cups.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Split each layer in two through the middle to form
four thin layers. Place one raisin layer, cut side up, on a serving
plate. Top with about 1 cup filling. Cover with a plain layer. Top
with another cup filling. Repeat with remaining layers, using 1 cup
filling between each and the remainder on top of cake, spooning
back on top any that drips.

   Requests
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shirley Smith of Atlanta wants to know if anyone has the
recipe for chocolate bars that were sold at the bakery in the
former Davison's department store downtown. They were hard and
chewy, like a cookie, with icing on top.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Weegie Hoffman (e-mail) wants a basic recipe for Oriental lo

 &HT;    Denver name of the game as microbrewery mecca
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All of us in Atlanta think this is one Super Bowl
that's just peachy. But it would be even better if it were being
played in Denver, not just against it.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's one of the good-image cities (despite its frequent bad
air and high incidence of skin cancer). It's got the mountains,
after all. Folks are physically active out there, jogging and
cycling when they're not skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mile High City is also one of the meccas of microbrewing,
right up there with Seattle and Portland, Ore. ``When you go into a
bar in Denver, you're not likely to find Budweiser on tap. It's all
microbrewed beer there,'' says Matt Patterson of Atlanta's
Sweetwater Brewing Co., a Denver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been to Denver, you know what he means. They love
craft beer in Colorado, and especially in Denver and nearby places
like Fort Collins and Boulder, home of the Association of Brewers.
It's no accident that the Super Bowl of Brewing _ the Great
American Beer Festival _ is held each October in downtown Denver, a
20-minute walk from where the Broncos play.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from Mile High Stadium, in the hip LoDo (for lower
downtown) section, an old warehouse district made fashionable by
shops, restaurants and pubs, Wynkoop's sells more beer than any
brewpub in the world, a big, laid-back place with an atmosphere of
uncontrived congeniality.
</P>
<P>
   If it were a beer competition and not a football game, the
</P>
<P>
   oddsmakers wouldn't give us much chance _ and they're not giving
us good odds as it is.
</P>
<P>
   And yet and yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta may be an upstart in craft brewing, but it's an upstart
that's begun to make a name for itself. At the Great American Beer
Festival last fall, two Atlanta beers won gold medals _ the
Scottish Ale brewed by Kurt Harrison of John Harvard's in Buckhead
and the Sweet Magnolia Brown ale brewed by Clay Gentry of Rock
Bottom, also in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   That's as many golds as Denver won, with almost three times as
many breweries and two more brewpubs. (OK, so Denver
</P>
<P>
   breweries also won four silver medals.)
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me if I sound like a provincial. But some of the best
beers in Atlanta _ the hoppy ales, for example, from Percy's Fish
House, Max Lager's and U.S. Border Brewery and Cantina, or the
elegant lagers from Phoenix Brewing Co. _ match anything in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   And Denver has no place like Taco Mac in Sandy Springs and
Snellville, with more than 120 beers on draft, most of them micros
(and, coming soon, the new Taco Mac in Cumming with 200) But
there's still a difference, and it's in attitude. You can go into
an Atlanta brewpub and see people swigging Bud Light or Corona from
a longneck. It's an amazing sight, and one you'd never see in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just much more into beer out there,'' Patterson says.
With a population of just under 4 million, Colorado supports more
than 100 breweries, a good number of them in metropolitan Denver.
Georgia, with a population of 7.6 million, can't count more than 20
breweries, and most of those are in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Denver,'' Patterson says, ``people are more interested in
trying new things. You can brew just about anything in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Little more than two years ago, Patterson, Fredrick Bensch and
Kevin McNerney left jobs at Denver breweries to try their fortunes
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's the last frontier in craft brewing,'' Bensch,
Sweetwater's head brewer, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The future could be ours. People had given up on the Falcons,
too, and look where they are.
</P>
<P>
   _They love craft beer in Colorado, and especially in Denver and

 &HT;    Medieval cookery is mouthwatering for scholars, more
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We who surf the endless highways and byways of the Internet
looking for culinary inspiration know there is a surprise around
every corner and ongoing delight at the infinite variety of what
the Web has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we think we pretty much know what's out there, we can
click onto something completely new and different.
</P>
<P>
   Recently by happenstance we came across the fascinating world of
Renaissance, medieval and ancient cookery. We soon learned that
this subject has a loyal following of scholarly souls, serious
researchers, food historians, dedicated foodies, chefs and the
plain curious.
</P>
<P>
   Check out http://www.execpc.com/(tilde)clisto/clisto12.html, and
you will be transported to a medieval dining hall complete with
stone walls, suits of armor, burning torches and even medieval
music to listen to while you feast on the contents. Did you ever
wonder what the Crusaders ate when they weren't sacking and
looting? It was pretty darn good _ if there's any factual merit to
the contents of a section called ``Crusader Food From 1099-1250''
and a recipe for lamb, fava beans and artichokes. There is also a
wonderfully readable short history of the Crusader period in Jeru-
</P>
<P>
   salem at that time and how the invaders combined and adapted
their cooking with that of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Another great place to visit is
http://www.labs.net/dmccormick/huen.htm, ``A Boke of Gode Cookery''
(A Book of Good Cookery). Here you will find documented medieval
recipes that have been adapted for modern use. A quick perusal will
dispel the idea that medieval folks had a primitive cuisine one
step ahead of the Neanderthals. You will find that they used much
of the same ingredients we do to concoct savory sauces, fabulous
roasts, stews, stuffings, marinades for meats, exotic confections
and a host of other delicacies that would enhance any 20th-century
table.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the sites we visited, while fascinating, would
have no use in a modern kitchen. For instance, one recipe begins
with ``start with one thousand eggs.'' And you might have trouble
locating a popular staple _ hedgehog _ at your local supermarket.
But there are many more sites that convert the ancient recipe text
to understandable and highly tempting possibilities.

<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 30 minutes Cooking time: 40-55 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Medieval folks apparently loved tarts, as tart recipes abound on
medieval cooking sites. This savory-sweet one, which comes from a
collection of recipes written around 1390, was specially prepared
on ``Ember Days,'' which were sets of three fasting days
(Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays) that occurred four times a year
when meat was forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup parsley
</P>
<P>
   6 large eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound havarti cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Muenster cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup currants
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon ground
</P>
<P>
   cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried sage
</P>
<P>
   1 deep dish 9-inch pie
</P>

   crust, or 2 regular
</P>
<P>
   size crusts
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place onions in a medium saucepan with enough water to cover.
Boil about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   As onions cool, chop parsley. Place in a large mixing bowl. Chop
onions and add to bowl. Add eggs, butter, cheese, sugar, currants,
ginger, cinnamon and sage. Mix well. Pour into pie crust and bake
50-55 minutes in deep-dish crust or 40-45 minutes in regular
crusts. Tart is done when the top is brown and a knife inserted in
the center comes out clean. _ From

THE FALCONS DON'T BEHAVE LIKE A CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The head coach is fresh off quadruple bypass surgery. To
alleviate his stress, he performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on
a feud that had been perfectly willing to die of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback decided he'd rather spend a morning
with ``Regis and Kathie Lee'' than in the hospital where his wife
was delivering their third child. One of the starting receivers
announced to the world that he used to have a drinking problem, but
he's much better now. One of the starting cornerbacks guaranteed a
victory against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, going to the Super Bowl is causing the Atlanta Falcons
to have a collective nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have never been in this position, so a little
performance anxiety is understandable. At a time like this, a
logical place for the Falcons to turn for guidance would be
somebody who knows what to expect. And as luck would have it, the
Falcons have a man who has been in eight Super Bowls (three as a
head coach, three as an assistant, two as a player).
</P>
<P>
   Did anybody say anything about it being good Falcons?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves has been around enough to know the minefields that
await any Super Bowl participant willing to say anything more
provocative than ``We're facing a fine team.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves knows there is a time and a place to share his innermost
bitter feelings about co-workers he parted ways with more than six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reeves couldn't help himself. As if to prove that
football coaches have no idea what to do with free time, Reeves
went around last week slinging mud at Broncos owner Pat Bowlen,
head coach Mike Shanahan and, to a lesser extent, quarterback John
Elway. Reeves spoke of betrayal, ``a lot of hurt that won't ever go
away,'' and how he could never bring himself to have dinner with
them.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Reeves was finished, he had a stoked a feud with his
former team that made the Hatfields and the McCoys look like
``Dharma and Greg.'' Any attempts to try and take it back upon
arriving in Miami were futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for opening those wounds last week,'' Reeves said,
``because I don't think anything is accomplished by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the Super Bowl, being a Falcon means having to say
you're sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a franchise that has never strung together consecutive
winning seasons. The Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb, had a lifetime batting
average of .366 playing a sport where the failures of hitters far
outnumber the successes. The Falcons entered the 1998 season with
an all-time winning percentage of .384.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment Rankin M. Smith purchased the expansion
Falcons for $8.5 million in 1965, the franchise has been more
cursed than the idiot in the left lane who drives 10 mph under the
speed limit. Threats to move the team to Jacksonville in the 1980s
brought to life the bumper sticker: ``Go Falcons! And take the
Braves with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith died last year, one day after his 71st birthday, hours
before the Falcons fell to 1-7 in their first season under Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Smith didn't live to see the Falcons in a Super
Bowl was the coaches in his employ. Norb Hecker set the standard
that prevailed for the better part of three decades, squeezing four
victories out of the Falcons in the first 31 games of their
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   One Falcons coach was in the habit of leaving tickets for dead
Elvis. Not that Jerry Glanville was a laughing matter by Falcons
standards. Glanville is No. 3 on the Falcons' coaching victory list
(28-38), behind Leeman Bennett (47-44) and Norm Van Brocklin
(37-49-3). Leave it to the Falcons to have the distinction of
employing the coach with the worst NFL career winning percentage of
anybody with at least 60 games on the resume. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Campbell went 6-19 from 1974-76, but the Falcons brought
him back in 1987. Campbell proved it wasn't a fluke by going 11-32
the second time around. He left the year before the Falcons set a
modern-day record for fewest points allowed in a 14-game season
(129). Even that wasn't enough to give the 1977 Falcons a winning
season.
</P>
<P>
   Humility rarely strays more than a play away from the Falcons.
Late in the 1972 finale, Dave Hampton was basking in the glow of
becoming the first Falcon to rush for 1,000 yards. Hampton got
thrown for a 6-yard loss on his next carry, dropping him to 994. He
gained one yard on his next carry and didn't see the ball again.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons once did the good deed of trading away quarterback
Jeff George, only to trade for him four years later. The Falcons
were only in the market for a quarterback because Glanville shipped
off Brett Favre two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't forget the saga of former Falcons receiver Andre
Rison, whose romance with rapper Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes became too
hot to handle. Lopes _ whose trademark was to wear a packaged
condom attached to her glasses _ set fire to his mansion, burning
it to the ground. She pleaded guilty to arson.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Falcons don't know what to do with prosperity. No
wonder the coach began exhuming old feuds. No wonder cornerback Ray
Buchanan went on national television to guarantee victory, and
quarterback Chris Chandler decided the impending birth of his third
daughter was the time to make the talk-show rounds. No wonder
receiver Terance Mathis began talking about a drinking problem that
resulted in some death-defying driving.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, a former New York Jet, assures everybody, ``I'm very
under control. I can have a beer here and then.'' Yes, everything
is fine. Except that Mathis hit the ground in Miami fuming because
Reeves let the Pro Bowlers and 10-year veterans deplane first. And
the fact that the defending champions are favored against a
franchise that has never been to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like people are talking like we have already lost
the game, and that bothers me a lot,'' Mathis said. ``Stuff like
that really gets under my skin.''

<SLUG> BC-FOOD-CRITIC-2ND </SLUG>
   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... needs salt.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Recipes should never, ever say `to taste,' '' he declares.
``There's a certain minimum amount universally accepted by
everyone.'' He reaches for his favorite salt from the Camargue in
the south of France. ``It's $40 worth of pretentious pink fleur de
sel,'' he explains. ``I use the word `pretentious' to cover up the
fact that I'm being pretentious.''
</P>
<P>
   The salt is gone. His assistant left it the evening before at
the television station that tapes Steingarten's cable show, about
to be carried by Time Warner. On the show he makes things like mini
BLT hors d'oeuvres in little canape cups, which sound awful but
taste wonderful, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten scolds Brandt about the salt, but he doesn't seem
earnest and she in turn isn't miffed. Alas, one perfect ingredient
belongs to a cameraman somewhere in Brooklyn. Steingarten picks up
his cigar, relights it, throws on a navy blue Armani overcoat and
celadon scarf, and heads out for lunch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Retelling grand schemes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Pearl Oyster Bar in Greenwich Village, which consists of one
long marble bar, a bar rail with stools, and a couple of tables,
Steingarten settles down to crisp fried oysters, set in their
shells on pillows of tartar sauce made with Hellmann's mayonnaise,
and lobster salad tucked into a Pepperidge Farm hot dog roll
sauteed in butter on the griddle. ``Lobster rolls are only eaten in
New York and Boston,'' he says. ``Do you realize how privileged we
are?''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperidge Farm hot dog rolls are one of Steingarten's taste
anomalies. While he seems perfectly comfortable in the company of
foie gras and exquisite hazelnut chocolates, he also loves junk. In
``The Man,'' he writes about his quest to figure out why Heinz
makes such good ketchup, and he decides to compare it to all other
ketchups by dipping McDonald's french fries into each one.
</P>
<P>
   Now the subject is lobster. He recently met Jasper White, whose
book ``Lobster at Home'' he really likes. White, he explains, won't
sell as many books as he should because he's not on television.
``Books that people talk about are on television.'' Then ensues a
discourse on the shortcomings of running a restaurant and keeping a
TV show fresh.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Steingarten as a television persona: He's
professorial, he digresses _ although it's all fascinating and
intelligent _ and he often hesitates as he speaks. His wit lies in
his grand schemes and the retelling _ like the trip to France last
year to judge the annual baguette competition, Grand Prix de la
Baguette de la Ville de Paris (July Vogue).
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to attend the competition, he writes. ``And then
the most preposterous error occurred. Instead of appointing the
usual jury of 15 extremely distinguished experts and `personnalites
remarquables,' the mayor of Paris appointed 14 of them and one of
me!''
</P>
<P>
   They tasted 32 baguettes, all of which met the technical
requirements of length and weight. They ate so much bread, he
writes, that ``I would never have thought it possible to reach
satiety eating the greatest baguettes in all of Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner would receive over $3,000. It turned out to be
someone who had entered the contest for the highest honor among
Parisian bakers _ and didn't include a name. ``He had thumbed his
nose at the contest, at the mayor, and at us, his anointed
judges,'' he writes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
An ordinary bio &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten is no stranger to pranks. He and his pals at Harvard
College ('65) once filled a vacuum cleaner with flour and sprayed
it all over a dorm room, creating the eerie effect of an old, dusty
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody understands pranks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Outside some hilarious moments in college, he says, ``my bio
isn't too interesting. I was born in Manhattan. My parents moved to
the suburbs for the school system. It wasn't as if I ever learned
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a writer on The Harvard Lampoon. ``Many of us wanted to
be writers. So you tried to get a job at The New Yorker. My parents
wanted me to go to law school. The first year was the best
education I ever had. They by and large terrorized you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard Law School ('68), he was hired by Barney Frank to
be an assistant to Mayor Kevin White. ``Kevin was the first modern
mayor of Boston.'' Steingarten went on to do research on poverty
law and legal services for the poor. Eventually he went into law
practice in Manhattan with some classmates and worked with Mort
Zuckerman on the Atlantic Monthly sale.
</P>
<P>
   He met the British journalist Anna Wintour, now editor of Vogue,
about 20 years ago at her first job in America. ``She was style
editor of Viva.'' Steingarten speaks about her in superlatives.
``Outdoor fashion photography became her hallmark,'' he says, ``and
she covered design no one ever heard of.'' He finds her captivating
and incredibly beautiful. ``I am motivated by the desire to amuse
Anna,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And she him, apparently. At the publishing party for ``The Man
Who Ate Everything,'' held at Le Cirque 2000, guests found
themselves tromping over freshly spilled autumn leaves, it was
reported in The New Yorker's Talk of the Town. Wintour ordered them
because she dislikes Le Cirque's carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He revels in this sort of glamour _ and in being known. As
Steingarten is leaving Pearl Oyster Bar, owner Rebecca Clark
introduces herself and tells him how much she likes his book. He
seems surprised and genuinely pleased. A few minutes later, around
the corner at Murray's Cheese, he buys Le Pavin, a cheese from the
Auvergne, and the owner pays him a grand compliment about ``The
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Steingarten flushes and for a moment can hardly utter his
thanks. Outside, hailing a cab, he turns around and says quietly,
``That's nice to hear. No man is a hero to his own valet.''

 &HT;    NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA BREAKS THE CULTURAL ICE IN CHINA
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (e) Entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ American Conductor Leonard Slatkin finally cracked the
cultural ice with an undemonstrative Chinese audience as the
National Symphony Orchestra closed the first concert of its Asian
tour Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   To end its debut performance in China, the NSO trumpeted out
``The Stars and Stripes Forever,'' and Slatkin faced the crowd to
conduct an estimated 7,000 concert-goers in the finer points of
clapping to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   In a front and center seat in the Great Hall of the People was
China's President Jiang Zemin, a fan of the orchestra and of
Slatkin since he saw them perform on the White House lawn during
his American visit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a special concert for the orchestra. They sort of
felt like they'd been invited personally by Jiang Zemin,'' said
Edward Fowler, chairman emeritus of the NSO board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   And it was special.
</P>
<P>
   Not many concert programs carry messages from the American
president, who presented greetings and the sentiment that ``music
is a universal language that helps us cross all borders and
boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   China's Jiang may have scored a feat of international
one-ups-manship, by suggesting in his program note that the NSO
debut in China marked the 20th anniversary this month of the
establishment of U.S.-China diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Printing of the glossy program itself had been disrupted until
the last minute Wednesday so Jiang could have his page of comments
added, once he discovered that Clinton had his photo and words in
it, according to a member of the U.S.-China liaison team.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic importance of this visit will be carried nationwide
later over Chinese television, a late addition made possible by
sponsorship from the Coca-Cola Co. of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The concert was special, too, because its venue was the Great
Hall of the People, the symbolic melding point of China's
government and its people, and the place where the most outstanding
cultural and political events transpire.
</P>
<P>
   It is a monster of a space that technically isn't even open at
the moment, since it is undergoing renovation for the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the Peoples' Republic of China in
October. As of Tuesday, its concert hall was sitting deep in the
dirt of a major face-lift.
</P>
<P>
   But the wishes of a national president can move mountains in
China, and certainly can eliminate hillocks of dust.
</P>
<P>
   When the NSO arrived for a practice earlier Wednesday, the
musicians had to wait for one final blast from the steam machines
that were attempting to tame the construction residue. By Wednesday
night, the only remnants of the work in progress were grimy
deposits in corners and crevices, and an unusual scent reminiscent
of sewer pipes.
</P>
<P>
   At a pre-concert reception hosted by U.S. Ambassador James
Sasser, conductor Slatkin was too diplomatic to mention the loose
ends of renovation work. He did express some awe at the notion of
filling the Great Hall of the People with music.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's 10,000 seats, and that's about 7,500 seats
more than we usually play for,'' he said in an interview. ``And the
concert itself in a big hall is amplified, so the important thing
is to get a proper balance for the instruments on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The program included ``extremes in terms of loud versus soft,''
he said, and some off-stage effects that all had to be worked into
that balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   But it did sound fine Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also had been warned to expect an unresponsive
audience, and drew only a very tepid reaction to the American music
in the first half of the program that included Leonard Bernstein's
Symphonic Dances from West Side Story.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd definitely warmed by the time Slatkin lowered his
baton on the centerpiece Berlioz ``Symphonic Fantastique'' and
followed up with encores including Dvorak's ``Slavonic Dance'' and
the finale ``The Stars and Stripes Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The NSO plays a second concert here on Thursday, then goes on to
perform in Hong Kong, Shanghai and five cities in Japan.

THE NATURE OF THE BREAST; NATHAN LANE'S OLD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breasts are the cover topic in the February Esquire, singled out
for some high-minded philosophical reassessment (and begging for _
but not getting _ much tacky wordplay herein). Lips, not breasts,
might have provided a more surprising and timely gauge of
self-sculpture and ``falsie culture'' in the 1990s, as celebrities
like Meg Ryan and Melanie Griffith continue to inflate their mouths
to Donald Duck-like proportions to keep their careers on the rise.
I bet you could use lips to link the salacious details of the
Clinton affair and our national taste for loose-lipped tell-alls
with entertainment puzzles such as the one involving the
preternaturally pouty Calista Flockhart and Steven Spielberg's
E.T., who, shall we say, have never been seen in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   But, for obvious reasons, not least of all being able to put
Pamela Anderson on the cover in her underwear, Esquire opted for
the more familiar curves of the female torso. The breasts package
includes four pages of Anderson cleavage photos, a think piece by
Mim Udovitch, and first-person companion pieces in which a man
obsesses and then a woman obsesses on the subject. Udovich's
musings on the symbolic importance of breasts are smart, amusing,
and sometimes a little muddy, as she examines the impetus behind
small-breasted eras like the 1960s (remember Twiggy?) and our
current affection for implants, as augmentation surgery has
increased 275 percent in the last five years. These days, women who
enlarge their breasts _ even with the help of explants like the
Wonderbra and Curves _ may be quite open about their choice, which
is an empowered choice. ``This is a culture in which seeming to
reveal something appealing, even if it's obviously false, is
preferable to revealing something ugly, even if it's obviously
true,'' she wisely observes.
</P>
<P>
   The February Esquire also introduces a new bimonthly books
column by local critic Sven Birkerts, called The Page. In his first
go, Birkerts writes with intelligence and feeling about Martin Amis
on the occasion of a new collection of stories, and ``the riling,
the agitating, the ion-interfering that Amis unfailingly
instigates.''

   The New Yorker for Feb. 1 has an article that will appeal to
aficionados of police movies and TV shows like ``NYPD Blue.''
Called ``Inside Dope,'' it's written by a New York cop
pseudonymously named Marcus Laffey who spends days and nights
trying to bust drug pushers and users. In engaging prose, Laffey
recalls crouching on tar rooftops for hours, watching the street
choreography of crack and smack deals: ``Sometimes you feel like
the man on the catwalks over the casino floor, scanning the tables
for the sharps and card counters, looking out for luck that's too
good to be true. Other times, you feel as if you were watching a
nature program, some National Geographic special on the felony
ecology of the streets.'' Laffey also reads the body language of
addicts and sellers, which is subtle and yet obvious to the trained
eye. ``The addict on a `mission walk' moves with double-quick
footsteps, leaning forward, as if against a strong wind, so as not
to waste an extra second of his already wasted life. A player, on
the other hand, has a self-contained watchfulness, a false repose,
like a cat sunning itself on a windowsill, eyes half-closed but
ready to pounce.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news in The Advocate for Feb. 2 is the coming out of Nathan
Lane, which somehow doesn't much seem like news. The actor known by
most for his work in ``The Birdcage'' says he thought about doing
it sooner, but decided not to partly because ``there is that notion
that if you play a gay character and you're gay, you're not really
acting, no matter how far that character may be from your own
character.'' He also says he was not ready to be looked to as a
spokesperson _ ``My dating history alone would disqualify me.'' The
turning point for Lane came after the Matthew Shepard murder: ``It
was like somebody slapped me awake. At this point it's selfish not
to do whatever you can. . . . If I do this story and say I'm a gay
person it might make it easier for somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   About his failed sitcom, ``Encore! Encore!,'' Lane says he
initially envisioned a gay series but gave up the idea when his
business partners wanted him to play a womanizing opera star. His
new name for the show: ``No More! No More!''

SUPER BOWL -- THE GRADUATE PROGRAM

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (itals)The vertical route by the receiver tells the nickel to
keep an outside alignment and maintain a good vertical cushion on
the receiver. Upon commitment to the post route by the receiver,
the nickel will also commit to the route by staying over the top

</P>
<P>
   _ A ``defensive coordinator,'' quoted in American Football
Quarterly magazine
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember when watching the Super Bowl didn't require a glossary
of football jargon? Back when the game was easy to understand? When
the man/mammoth Fuzzy Thurston would pull off the line, with Green
Bay fullback Jim Taylor following behind for maybe 5 or 6 yards,
play after play? The Packers' Paul Hornung and the Colts' Lenny
Moore faking _ not ``juking'' _ out defensemen for double-digit
gains? The Jets' fullback/locomotive Matt Snell up the middle for 3
yards and a cloud of dust?
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me, but when did football Go Intellectual on us?
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, football talk sounds like the Cahiers du Cinema gang
praising the films of Jerry Lewis. You can't understand a word
they're saying, but you're reasonably sure it's eyewash. I don't
remember Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi nattering on about
``press corners'' and ``possession wideouts.'' Did Broadway Joe
Namath spend the night before Super Bowl III reviewing the
``nickel'' and ``dime'' defensive ``packages'' the Baltimore Colts
would be showing him the next day? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   The modern professional football team combines the worst
features of a Fortune 100 corporate bureaucracy and an Ivy League
comparative literature department: hypertrophic organization and
linguistic obfuscation. Why does it take 10 men wearing headphones
in a sky booth to call a play? Why do they bother faxing Polaroids
of every defensive formation to those oxen in uniform? I mean,
these are fellows _ worthy fellows, to be sure _ who majored in
communication arts at the University of Nebraska. Their next job is
going to be moving pianos. Maybe. According to a new book, ``Pros
and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL,'' there's a
one-in-five chance their next job may be a bank heist, a rape, a
drug deal, or some other serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   Where did it all go wrong? The adipose John Madden, former coach
of the Oakland Raiders, must shoulder some of the blame. Once
Madden started scrawling X's and O's across the television screen,
helmetheads like Frank Gifford and Howie Long could barely contain
their adulation. And then there's Bill Walsh, the Albert Einstein
of the ``West Coast offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Walsh; the Stanford connection; the patina of intellectual
legitimacy . . . Let me explain the West Coast offense to you. If
you send five receivers downfield, it's hard for four defensive
backs to cover them. Especially when two of the receivers are
setting illegal picks. What insight! What genius! Why hasn't Walsh
been awarded the Nobel Prize?!
</P>
<P>
   My favorite West Coast coach was Tom Flores, John Madden's
successor at the Raiders. A few days before the Raiders annihilated
the Washington Redskins in 1984's Super Bowl XVIII, one of these
nouveau sports journalistes asked Flores how he and his steamroller
offense _ quarterback Jim Plunkett and halfback Marcus Allen, for
starters _ would react to Redskins coach Joe Gibbs's arty defensive
``schemes.'' ``We're not going to take what the defense gives us,''
Flores replied. ``We're going to take what we want.'' This was the
same Super Bowl in which the Raiders' not particularly bookish
defensive end Lyle Alzado predicted: ``I'm gonna take off (Redskins
quarterback) Joe Theismann's head.'' He nearly did. Raiders 38,
Redskins 9.
</P>
<P>
   I watched the NFL Conference Championships with a bunch of happy
drunks, who knew more about the teams' prospects than all the
blow-dried analysts the networks could muster. The Atlanta
Falcons-Minnesota Vikings game had the potential for an upset, they
told me. Forget the New York Jets against Denver. ``(Broncos back)
Terrell Davis is going to run all over the Jets,'' one couchman
predicted. And Davis did just that.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday, I'll be back on the couch, one hand plunged in the
Doritos bag, the other hand buried in the pretzels. I'm betting on
the Broncos, straight up. I think Davis will run all over this
opponent, too. The Broncos won't be taking what Atlanta gives them;
they'll be taking what they want.

CHARLIE TROTTER'S SINGULAR VISION, SENSATIONAL TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Charlie Trotter blew into town the other night. At
10:45 p.m. last Thursday, the chef extraordinaire, who has molded
his Chicago restaurant into a mecca of exquisite food and
meticulous service, was working hard at La Bettola in the South
End. Surrounded by chef Rene Michelena and his staff, plus five
cooks from Chicago, in the closet-sized kitchen of the small
restaurant, Trotter glanced up with a smile and kept plating
chestnut soup with pickled Brussels sprouts, roasted and seared
foie gras, and beautiful divers scallops gilded with black truffle
shavings, yellowfoot chanterelles, and basil oil for the packed
house.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short stay _ less than 20 hours minus a few for
sleeping. But Trotter, arguably the prize of Boston Cooks! week,
came for Michelena, who had worked for him for three years. And as
long as Trotter was here, celebrity status notwithstanding, he was
here to work _ using 3 pounds of truffles in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody Allen said 90 percent of success is showing up,''
Trotter says as we huddle in an overheated basement office at La
Bettola after the orders have slowed a little. He's talking about
his reluctance to leave his Chicago restaurant even briefly, but it
applies to his role as a visiting chef, too. ``I just keep showing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a modest self-assessment, a clue, but hardly the whole
picture. For Trotter, whose round boyish face belies the intensity
in his dark eyes, is a man with a singular vision. When one eats at
Charlie Trotter's, one enters into that vision. Trotter opened his
restaurant 12 years ago, at age 27, and almost immediately offered
a tasting menu, where the chef presents many small courses of his
choice. After three years, Trotter felt confident enough to change
over completely. Now diners choose among a six-course grand tasting
menu, a vegetable menu, a red wine menu, and the mind-blowing
15-course kitchen table menu, putting themselves into Trotter's
hands for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The January dishes _ as fanciful and intricate as anything
created in the United States today _ include a ragout of squab,
rabbit saddle, and lamb tongue with caramelized cauliflower and
black truffle emulsion; aged Parmesan and sage polenta with
yellowfoot and black oyster mushrooms and Vaucluse black truffles;
steamed rouget with warm geoduck salad; spice-crusted whole roasted
pigeon with fingerling potatoes; and a ``flavor study served in
sorbet,'' which includes white bean, mango, and Turkish coffee. And
that's just a sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Although it sounds overwhelming, Trotter insists that diners
should never feel they've overindulged. His food is ornate _ all
layers and textures and tiny components _ but butter and heavy
cream are minimal. It's an essence he's pursuing. The tasting menu
is ``a way to try more food,'' Trotter says, and ``after three
bitefuls, it's sort of redundant.'' Diners put their trust in him,
he says, and 40 percent don't even ask to look at a menu. The
trust, though, ``is a bestowal of responsibility. We don't take
that lightly,'' he says solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   In a service-oriented business, Trotter might seem to take
amazing risks. His prices are steep _ $100 to $150 a person, not
including wine _ yet reservations must be made six to 14 weeks
ahead. He banned smoking after the third year in business, even
though Chicago allows restaurant smoking sections, because he
believes it interferes with tasting the food. He no longer serves
hard liquor because ``it's not part of what we do.'' And in perhaps
the most startling instance, he's begun to turn away diners.
``We're pushing down,'' Trotter says, from a high of 200 a night to
the current 140.
</P>
<P>
   There's a flip side to this, what Trotter believes he must do to
``earn the right'' to do what he wants. The best ingredients
contribute to the cuisine, from the kitchen staff of 20 to the
vegetables that were in the ground that morning in California to
the fish from Japan. Constant refurbishing _ including new carpets,
meticulous cleaning, more climate-controlled wine cellars, and
improved valet service _ is slanted to ``making things better for
the customer,'' Trotter says. Last year, he says with a slight
smile, was the year of service and he redeclared it this year.
``Whenever a guest looks up, there has to be a pair of eyes ready
to meet them,'' he says. ``We need to be ready to anticipate every
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter talks about being a restaurateur with the same
concentration he uses in his approach to food: ``It's about
pursuing excellence,'' he explains. He reminisces about his first
jobs, when he'd arrive four hours before the starting time. Then he
tells about a negative service experience he had in Boston. ``My
wife and I arrived in a taxi at a hot new restaurant,'' he says.
When they got out, Trotter noticed a young valet leaning against a
car reading a paperback. Trotter asked him why he hadn't opened the
taxi door and greeted them. ``I'm just parking cars,'' the valet
replied. ``You're representing this restaurant,'' Trotter fumed. If
the valet didn't have pride in what he was doing, how could he be
satisfied with himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to sleep at night if things aren't right.''
</P>
<P>
   All this takes money, Trotter acknowledges, and Charlie
Trotter's ``spends more than we make.'' So like many other chefs,
he's become an entrepreneur. His televison show ``Kitchen
Sessions'' is airing on PBS; he has authored six cookbooks; his
dessert sauces are in stores; he's working on a line of essential
flavoring oils; his high-end cutlery is in development and expected
to come out later this year. Also, he does public speaking on
motivating workplace teams.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Evanston, Ill., Trotter earned a political science
degree from the University of Wisconsin before training as a chef.
He credits his father with providing support and inspiration to
follow his own course. ``Food was not a big deal in my family,'' he
says, adding that he always loved to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Trotter lives with his wife, Lynn, and 7-year-old son, Dylan
Thomas, less than a mile from his restaurant. Although he frets
that he doesn't have enough time to read the literature he loves,
he has taken up running with his characteristic intensity _
marathons, of course. Training for a March race in Hawaii, he ran
through the snowiest days of the recent Chicago blizzard. ``The New
York Times blue plastic bags work great for keeping your shoes
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, it all comes back to food. ``The restaurant
gives everything its validity and its worth,'' Trotter says about
his various enterprises. ``Even more than cooking, I eat,'' he says
of the constant tasting he does each night with his cooks. His
cuisine is getting more minimalist, stripping away nonessentials to
emphasize the purity of flavor. ``It's such a transient thing, so
of the moment,'' Trotter muses of taste. ``That's the beauty of
it.''

TRAINING MINISTERS HOW TO ENERGIZE CHURCHES

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Christendom has collapsed,'' declares Robert C. Neville, a
professor and dean at Boston University's School of Theology. Many
Christians _ as has been well documented _ have abandoned churches
over the past 30 years, Neville notes.
</P>
<P>
   America's spiritual forefathers, the mainline Christian
churches, face an especially bleak future unless they're willing to
find creative ways of preaching the Gospel, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not going to happen, Neville adds, until the nation's
seminaries and theology schools start preparing a new breed of
preachers, better prepared to tackle the challenges facing many
churches _ a growing immigrant population, the weakening hold of
organized religion on younger generatons, and a growing
responsibility to tend to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   At BU, which was founded by New England Methodists 160 years
ago, the Theology School is charting a new course that Neville
hopes will become a model of how to produce clergy capable of
leading congregatons in the 21st century. To help in that effort,
the school recently was awarded a $1.49 million grant from the
Lilly Endowment to revamp its training program for ministers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough for ministers-in-training, Neville says, to be
well-versed in the Bible, Christian theology, and religious
history. Clergy need to be grounded in the wide range of external
forces that play a role in the life of a congregation, from the
pressures of parenting to the stresses of teenage life to the
challenges of the work world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the church is to continue to fulfill its role of advancing
the Christian Gospel, it must be done with a solid understanding of
the cultural, social, economic, and political context of modern
society,'' Neville said. ``We need to consider altered
institutions, if not entirely new ones, if we are to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment has awarded $53.4 million
to 45 theological schools across the country in an ambitious effort
to overhaul what many religious scholars believe has become an
outdated system for teaching church leaders of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few issues are more important to Christian churches than the
quality of pastoral leadership,'' said Craig Dykstra, the Lilly
Endowment's vice president for religion. ``If there are to be
people of real ability ministering in congregations and parishes in
the decades to come, a very aggressive effort needs to be
undertaken now to draw even more highly qualified candidates to the
ministry and to educate them more appropriately for their
ministries.''
</P>
<P>
   BU School of Theology will use part of the grant to start _ in
partnership with the regional United Methodist district _ two
churches in the next two years to serve as ``living laboratories''
on what future congregations should look like if they are to be
successful. In 10 years, BU hopes to have started 10 churches aimed
at both urban and surburban worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   Neville said that's particularly important in New England, where
many mainline Protestant churches dotting the landscape are
entrenched, and where it can be difficult to change traditions.
``Protestantism in New England has not been active in starting new
churches because it's been around so long and it's preoccupied with
maintaining the churches we already have,'' Neville said.
</P>
<P>
   To energize Christian churches struggling to attract members,
the next generation of clergy need to articulate a clear link
between the church and the world outside, Neville said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because churches are warm and accepting and provide
community for people who wouldn't otherwise have a communty is not
enough to have a meaningful role to play in the contemporary
world,'' says Neville, acknowledging that his views have ruffled
some feathers among some clergy.
</P>
<P>
   But Neville adamantly believes churches have to do a better job
of persuading people that mainline Christianity is still a relevant
source of spiritual and moral sustenance in American society.
</P>
<P>
   While America is experiencing a spiritual revival, many people
are seeking answers to fundamental questions about life outside
mainstream Christian churches, Neville said, primarily because too
many churches are stuck in old ways of doing things _ singing
traditional hymns, saying traditional prayers, and offering staid
sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many churches who don't have anything very clear
to say about the great political and moral issues of the day, and
who don't know why it would be worthwhile for people to become
religious,'' Neville said. ``Unless Christianity is able tell
people in an intelligent way why it's good to be a Christian, many
mainline churches are going to die.''

PATRIOT GAMES IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Two-and-a-half years from now, these could be
pretty pricey seats, overlooking the 50-yard line eight stories
above street level, waiting for the Patriots' first kickoff in
their spanking new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But looking out the window Monday, from Art Marquardt's
conference room at the Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation's
headquarters, all I could see was snowflakes dusting the river
basin where Robert Kraft's Patriots plan to wage pigskin battle
with all NFL comers.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt has 550 employees, a business that generates $300
million in annual revenue, and a city and statewide political
establishment that just wants him and his gas plant and office
building to get the hell out of the way. He is the gas company's
quarterback, fading back on Ground Zero, and he is being blitzed
from every direction. Denizens of the Nutmeg State, from Governor
John Rowland on down to the lowliest peanut vendor and neighborhood
wiseguy who thinks he's going to get a job parking cars for eight
NFL games per season, want the Patriots to become the focal point
for a resurgent city that is willing to pay plenty for psychic
urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The State House crowd in Boston thinks the Connecticut pols must
have undergone a collective lobotomy. Otherwise, why give Kraft the
most lucrative stadium deal since the Caesars took a long lease on
the Coliseum? Connecticut's stadium pushers say the numbers will
work for them as well as the Krafts. Let's hope so. But what no one
pinned down as the governor thrust the Patriots' deal down the
Legislature's gaping maw was this: Where does the gas company go,
and who pays for that?
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt picked his words carefully in an interview Monday,
trying to unload the rhetorical ball before any of the pass rushers
got to him. He has to live and do business here, and he doesn't
want to be the fall guy if Kraft's cushy deal with the state
government comes unhinged. ``If it falls apart,'' Marquardt says in
measured tone, ``we won't be the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   That is important, because he is the guy who says he just wants
``our company to be made whole'' when he gets evicted. And he is
happy to hear that, an hour before, a key player named Arthur
Anderson was also of the opinion that the gas company's relocation
expenses will not be a deal-breaker for the Patriots' move. This is
important because Anderson is Rowland's go-to guy to revitalize
downtown Hartford. Over lunch with Hartford Mayor Mike Peters,
Trinity College officials and yours truly, Anderson flatly
predicted ``the gas company piece will get done.''
</P>
<P>
   A real estate developer and a make-it-happen type with a flair
for numbers, Anderson is sparring not-so-gingerly with Marquardt
over who pays how much to jack the gas company out of its perch on
the 50-yard line. Arthur No. 1 (Marquardt) figures his moving and
relocation costs at roughly $70-to-$80 million. Arthur No. 2
(Anderson) figures them a lot less than that, the business of
selling steam and cold water not being what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   But 75 downtown office buildings house people who depend on
steam and chilled water, which is part of CNG's business. ``You've
got a business here which was fundamentally designed not to be
moved,'' says its boss.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt admits ``the replacement cost of that business is more
than what you'd invest in that business today.'' Me: ``Howzzat?''
Marquardt: ``To replace that capacity would cost more than you'd
recover today.'' Oh. I quote this exchange to illustrate why I
never contemplated applying to Harvard Business School. Business
baffles me.
</P>
<P>
   But until I talked with Hartford civic leaders, and met ``Mayor
Mike,'' as the feisty former firefighter is known to most voters, I
harbored doubts that the Patriots deal would be consummated. I've
seen the Patriots fumble off as well as on the gridiron for three
decades. I'm conditioned to the toxic political vapors of Boston's
development bazaar. No way would the political process in Beantown
do backflips for a privately owned sports franchise, unless it is
the 81-home game Red Hose.
</P>
<P>
   But here the downtown crowd, big institutional players, and the
politicians desperately want something big and new and exciting to
happen. Peters charts the Insurance Capital's health by what his
own house is worth, doubling when times are flush, crashing when
layoffs wipe out middle-class jobs without which the city decays.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more going on here than just the Patriots; that
will fill another column. But this stadium deal could never happen
this way in Beantown. There's a Feb. 5 deadline for the state's
stadium deal to become binding. CNG wants the energy business at of
the expansive new Adriaen's Landing. Rowland is the man with the
whistle in this contest. He stuffed into the Kraft bill power for
the state to condemn the gas company property. It can be hijacked,
if need be, for football.
</P>
<P>
   Football is bigger than gas, or steam; what's heat when you can
have entertainment? This town made its decision: Let the games
begin.

</P>
<P>
   BAXTER-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ There she goes, again. Monica
Lewinsky and her entourage decamped from Washington on Wednesday,
her business with the House impeachment managers finished for the
time being. Soon enough, Lewinsky is likely to be talking to the
Senate, and eventually to Barbara Walters. But she arrived and
departed from this visit without dispelling the air of mystery that
has transformed her from a California girl to a national enigma.
Except to those authorized to question her, she remained silent,
lips closed in a faint half-smile, Mona Lisa with a logo on her
cap. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED TUESDAY.

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ If the U.S. government is running a
surplus, how come the national debt is still going up? Overall
federal borrowing surged by $113 billion last year despite
celebrations over a ``$70 billion surplus.'' That's because the
excess revenues came into the Social Security trust fund, whose
cash was then borrowed to finance the rest of the government
operations. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   MEDICARE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday

   STATE-SPEECH _ AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush outlines his
specific plans for what may be his last legislative session in a
State of the State speech that might not be aimed outside Texas'
borders but certainly will be heard outside the state. Don't look
for any big policy surprises; this will be more about putting
details to his campaign promises on education, taxes and
compassionate government. With reaction, color and comparison to
his 1997 speech. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

   ATLANTA-CRIMESTATS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta police investigators
violated FBI crime reporting procedures and distorted the city's
crime statistics by routinely dismissing incidents as false or
baseless even though there was ample evidence that a crime had
occurred, according to former detectives and a study of a random
sampling of crime reports. The procedure, known as ``unfounding,''
took at least 5,400 reported crimes off the books in 1996, 7.2
percent of all crimes reported in the city that year. (Martz/Lewis,

   BLACKMEN-MENTORS _ The 100 Black Men of America have launched a

   SUPERCOKE _ Everyone always focuses on the advertising that runs

even Denver _ so it doesn't play favorites. And running commercials
isn't the only way to market. Coke is flexing its Super Bowl
sponsorship by issuing commemorative bottles in Atlanta, Denver and
Miami and through a variety of events in Miami, including the NFL
Experience interactive park. (Gramig, Atlanta

   SUPERCOKE _ Everyone always focuses on the advertising that runs
during the Super Bowl, so why isn't mega-marketer Coca-Cola running
spots during this year's game _ especially when its hometown team
is playing? The reason is that Coke has thousands of hometowns _
even Denver _ so it doesn't play favorites. And running commercials
isn't the only way to market. Coke is flexing its Super Bowl
sponsorship by issuing commemorative bottles in Atlanta, Denver and
Miami and through a variety of events in Miami, including the NFL
Experience interactive park. (Gramig, Atlanta

STUDY SUGGESTS PARKINSON'S ISN'T INHERITED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wading into more decades of debate, researchers
studying twins said Wednesday they found that the most common form
of Parkinson's disease is not inherited, but is probably triggered
by something in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, people like actor Michael J. Fox, who
developed Parkinson's in his 30s, may have a separate form of the
disease that is, in fact, genetic. In those rare instances in which
one twin got the disease before age 50, the other twin also
developed it, according to the study published Wednesday in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical director for the National Parkinson Foundation
Inc. was skeptical that the results prove much that isn't already
known. As it stands, doctors fail to find a family history of the
disease in 85 percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that this proves that Parkinson's is
environmental. The fact is, I don't know what causes it,'' said Dr.
Abraham N. Lieberman of the National Parkinson Foundation, a
private research center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's disease usually strikes the elderly, starting with
tremors and eventually leading to loss of muscle control. More than
1 million Americans have it, making it the second most common brain
ailment after Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Using a database of more than 19,000 twins who served in World
War II, researchers at the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale,
Calif., found that the disease most often occurred in only one
twin, whether or not the pair were identical or fraternal.
Identical twins share the same genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For individuals getting the disease over the age of 50, this
disease does not appear to be inherited. There was absolutely no
evidence for a genetic link at all,'' said J. William Langston,
senior author of the study and president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over its cause has persisted since Parkinson's was
first described in 1817. Some anecdotal reports found that it ran
in families. Within the last two years, researchers have found
three families _ one in Japan and two in the United States _ in
which an inherited genetic mutation led to Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   However, the mutation was different for all three families, and
Lieberman said fewer than 1 percent of cases have such strong
family links.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other studies have shown connections between
Parkinson's and living in rural areas and drinking well water,
suggesting a potential link to pesticide exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Some intriguing evidence came from an outbreak of the disease
among heroin addicts in the San Francisco area in 1982. The
outbreak was traced to a batch of the drug tainted with the
chemical NPTP, which is toxic to brain cells. Other chemicals in
the same class as NPTP are sometimes found in herbicides, according
to Langston, who helped track down the cause of the sudden
Parkinson's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of studies out now that have given us hints of
risk factors,'' Langston said. ``There are hints of some type of
chemical in the environment, but what it is, I think the answer is,
`We don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting the twin database, the next phase of the study will
look for information about environmental exposures that could lead
scientists to zero in on specific potential culprits, Langston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Hubble, a leading Parkinson's researcher at Ohio State
University, said she found the study's results convincing on the
issue of whether the disease has a clear genetic link. However, she
said, it remains to be seen whether subtle genetic factors in
combination with the environment could put some people at higher
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be like heart disease, where it is not one gene, but
a host of risk factors that culminate in the clinical state,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble is one of the lead investigators on a five-year study
just being launched that will examine 400 families with two or more
siblings with Parkinson's, looking for both genetic and environment
aspects of the disease.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of a genetic link in the small number of
early-onset patients also raises the possibility that Parkinson's
is two or more diseases with the same symptoms, Langston said.
Doctors already know that patients respond very differently to drug
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Variations also have been noticed in the brain tissue of
deceased patients. Typical Parkinson's patients have lost brain
cells in a small area at the base of the brain while other brain
cells contain pink deposits that appear to be cellular debris.
</P>
<P>
   But in patients who develop the disease before age 50, the pink
deposits usually aren't found, Langston said.

AS DOCTORS DEBATE CIRCUMCISION, MANY PARENTS STARTING TO QUESTION
PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens every day in the United States _ almost 3,500 times,
or every 25 seconds, in fact. A baby boy is circumcised, in a
routine but elective surgery that is almost always covered by
health insurance. It's a quick and generally safe procedure when
performed by an experienced doctor, and it's a traditionally
accepted part of our culture. But is it a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   Circumcision, the most common surgery performed in this country,
is the focus of increasing controversy, as more and more parents
and medical experts are calling the surgery medically unnecessary
and even cruel. The American Academy of Pediatrics, recognizing the
controversy, is debating a new position statement on the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the procedure say circumcision _ the cutting away
of the fold of skin known as the ``foreskin'' that normally covers
the tip of the penis at birth _ decreases the risk of urinary tract
infections, sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, and cancer
of the penis. And, they say, there is a significant
social//cultural reason for it: Boys should look like their
fathers, and most of the fathers in this country today are
circumcised.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents call it sexual mutilation and decry the idea of
cutting off a normal, healthy, functioning body part without the
patient's consent and without anesthesia, as is often the case.
They say it causes trauma to the baby and reduces sensitivity and
sexual pleasure when he is older.
</P>
<P>
   Several organized groups oppose the traditional surgery,
including separate organizations of doctors, nurses and attorneys,
each called For the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circumcised men don't know what they are missing,'' says
Ronald Goldman, executive director of the Circumcision Resource
Center in Boston and author of ``Circumcision: The Hidden Trauma''
and ``Questioning Circumcision, a Jewish Perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ph.D psychologist, Goldman says no one knows the long-term
social and psychological consequences of baby boys being subjected
to such early trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of those opposed to circumcision, Goldman traces his
aversion to hearing the cries of a baby when he witnessed a ritual
circumcision about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't understand the long-term effects, we need to call
for a moratorium until they can be determined,'' he says. ``Cutting
off part of one's genitals is a radical act.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance covers newborn circumcision, Goldman says, only
because it is customary and people expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marketing thing. Young families are looking for health
care plans that cover everything they might need, and the insurance
companies don't want them to choose another plan just because they
don't offer it with maternity care. I have had a large HMO
acknowledge to me that they cover it for marketing reasons _ not
because of any medical benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics is expected to release a new
position statement on the surgery this spring. Since making the
statement in 1971 that ``there are no valid medical indications for
circumcision in the neonatal period,'' the AAP has modified its
position several times. In 1975, the baby doctors decided ``there
is no ``absolute'' medical indication for routine circumcision of
the newborn,'' a statement that was reiterated by the AAP and the
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the jointly
published ``Guidelines to Perinatal Care,'' published in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the last time the AAP policy was revised, the academy's
task force on circumcision wrote: ``Newborn circumcision has
potential medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages
and risks.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the doctors concluded that properly performed
newborn circumcision prevents abnormal constriction of the foreskin
and inflammation of the glans and urethra and has been shown to
decrease cancer of the penis, a rare malignancy among U.S. men.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society said last week,
however, that there is a difference of opinion within that
organization as to whether or not the cancer risk is too rare to
quantify or worry about. She confirmed that the connection has been
mentioned in several ACS publications, but said that the
organization has no official position on it.
</P>
<P>
   Fatalities caused by circumcision accidents may approximate the
mortality rate from penile cancer, some ACS officials note. They
say perpetuating the belief that circumcision prevents cancer is
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   For many, though, the decision of whether or not to circumcize
is based not so much on the relative medical risks and benefits,
but on social and cultural factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no medical reason to do a circumcision or not to do a
circumcision,'' says Dr. Audrey Rogers, a Fort Worth pediatrician
who performs several of the surgeries each week. ``There may be a
very slight increase in urinary tract infections or cancer of the
penis in males who are not circumcised, but it's not significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says that there are some ``nice things'' about
circumcision: It's a whole lot easier to keep the area clean, and
parents don't have to worry about accidentally pulling back the
foreskin and tearing it while the baby is in diapers. But her
position on the matter is simple: If the father is circumcised, the
baby needs to be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to look the same,'' says Rogers, who has just
finished a term as chief of pediatrics at Harris Methodist Fort
Worth. ``Little boys look up to their daddies. They want to be like
them and look like them. If the father is not circumcised, I
recommend against it for the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers estimates that as many as 90 percent of the boys seen in
the large pediatric practice she shares with her husband and
father-in-law are circumcised.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage is higher than the national average, but, say
some Fort Worth nurses, fairly typical of Tarrant County. Today,
60.2 percent of all baby boys born in this country are circumcised.
In the South, including Texas, the incidence rises to 63.6 percent.
In Tarrant County, nurses estimate, the number falls in the 80 to
90 percent range. The dramatic decrease in circumcisions is seen
primarily in the West; there, the figure drops to a low of 36.3
percent in 1996, the last year for which statistics are available,
according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In Tarrant County, obstetricians traditionally have performed
most of the newborn circumcisions. In the past several years, there
has been a shift toward pediatricians performing the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says pediatricians, in general, are more likely to
anesthetize the area before performing surgery, but a 1993 study
published in ``Pediatrics,'' the journal of the American Academy of
Pediatrics, found that fewer than 20 percent of physicians
performing circumcisions used any form of anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   This, say critics, is a real cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Fayre Milos, founder of the National Organization of
Circumcision Information Resource Centers, says she was in nursing
school when she witnessed her first circumcision in 1979, and she's
still suffering post-traumatic shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been almost 20 years, and I can still hear that baby
screaming. I have never heard a sound like that come out of a
baby's mouth,'' she says. ``I started to cry, and the doctor looked
into my face and said there is no medical reason for us doing
this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Milos, who already had three circumcised sons at the time,
it was the start of a crusade. She has now helped organize 70
circumcision resource centers in 14 countries and has headed five
international medical meetings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is education. I think if parents are truly informed,
if they really know what is happening to their baby boys, they will
put a stop to it,'' she says. ``I think if I were ever present at
another circumcision, I would throw myself across the baby to stop
it _ no matter what it meant would happen to me.''

DOWN IN FRONT! THIS PAGEANT IS THE HEIGHT OF GLAMOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In the beginning, there were six who would be queen.
Six of poise and grace and 38-inch inseams. Six who dared wear
heels and dance with short men. Six who no longer slouched but
reveled in their statuesque-ity.
</P>
<P>
   But only one would take home the title of Miss Tall Dallas 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights before the 34th annual pageant, they gather for a
final rehearsal in the Champagne Ballroom of the Sheraton
Brookhollow: the gray-carpeted stage; the sound guy, Chip; the
pageant coordinator and former Miss Tall Dallas 1991, Pam Riggs,
pointing with both index fingers to her cheeks _ ``Smile!'' The
contestants eat Oreos and suck down tropical drinks from the lobby
bar.
</P>
<P>
   This ain't Miss America, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked one atop another, the six entrants would hit 36 1/2
feet, approximately 3 stories. Individually, each tops 5 foot 10,
the minimum height requirement for female members of Tall Texans of
Dallas, which sponsors this pageant as well as a farcical annual
contest for the men (who have to be at least 6 feet 2 inches.)
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, none of the Miss Tall Dallas hopefuls aspires to
beauty queendom. They have tossed their hats into the ring for
various other reasons: to boost self-confidence, to try something
new, to make some friends, and to act, if chosen, as the club's
liaison to the vertically challenged world. Miss Tall Dallas' only
official duty is to represent the city at the Miss Tall
International pageant over July Fourth weekend, in Pittsburgh this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Our contestants include: Dreanna Squire, 5-foot-11, a soccer mom
possessing hidden comic talents; former New Yorker Linda Kingsley,
6 feet 2 inches, following through on a New Year's resolution to
perform in public; Julie Krueger, 6-foot-5, who enjoys kick-boxing
and has never played basketball, so don't ask (Julie, who topped 6
feet at age 11, remembers her father arguing with an amusement-park
ticket agent who refused to let Julie in on a child's admission
rate).
</P>
<P>
   There's Vera Gajewsky, a 6-foot redhead of Russian descent who
says that long limbs improved her violin playing; Kristina Newburn,
5-foot-11, an outgoing J.C. Penney employee concerned about the
effect of gravity on people her size; and Sarah Tuttle, 6 feet 2
inches, a fresh-faced Minnesotan who discovered Tall Texans through
a ``Geraldo'' show titled ``Tall Women and the Short Men Who Love
Them.'' (''I usually get instant respect, especially at work,''
Sarah says during a break. ``People assume I'm mean.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, ladies, listen up,'' Pam says, explaining the logistics of
the evening-gown competition (because they have trouble finding
clothes to fit, four contestants have sewn their own dresses).
During each woman's stroll up the catwalk, the emcee will read her
statement, including answers to ``Why I want to be Miss Tall
Dallas'' and ``What are the advantages and disadvantages of being
tall?''
</P>
<P>
   (Sample disadvantages: Being dubbed Big Mama on Campus in high
school, Linda says; dancing with short men who ``bury their head
where the sun don't shine,'' Sarah says.)
</P>
<P>
   Dreanna leads off skit practice with a vaudevillian stand-up
routine: ``If, for the first part of your life, you thought `Down
in front' was your name, you might be tall. If you're on vacation
in Japan and people start pointing and screaming, `Godzilla!', you
might be tall. If it takes more than one razor to shave your legs,
you might be tall ...''
</P>
<P>
   Linda's sketch is a riff on the ``Saturday Night Live'' segment
``Coffee Talk With Linda Richman,'' except Linda calls hers
``Tequila Talk With Linda Kingsley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to `Tequila Talk With Linda Kingsley.' We're gonna do
a little tequila, have a little talk. No big woop.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda gets verklempt over LeAnn Rimes' singing voice (''like
buttah'') and asks the audience to talk amongst themselves.
``Here's a topic: bluebonnets. They're not exactly blue and they
don't look like bonnets. Discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG NIGHT ...: One hundred and fifty Tall Texans are
finishing their chocolate mousse when the ballroom lights dim and
the pageant commences. After emcees Betsy (6 feet) and Ellen
(6-foot-10) introduce the first skit, the microphones die, and
someone whispers that it's the ``short guy's'' fault (Chip, the
sound man, is a lowly 6 feet 1 1/2 inches.).
</P>
<P>
   Ellen, a former UT basketball player, kills time by telling a
story about standing in line for a ride at an amusement park and
getting yelled at because some employee thought she was standing on
the rail. (Ellen is also on a first-name basis with Charles Barkley
and Joe Klein, who introduced himself to her at a bar in Phoenix.)
</P>
<P>
   The skits are over in a blink. Chip cues up Kenny G, and the
contestants take the stage one at a time in their gowns and then
again for the Q&AMP;A portion: ``What would you do with $2,000?'' or
``If you could invite three people, dead or alive, to dinner, who
would it be?'' or ``If you worked in a condom factory, how would
you describe your job to friends and family?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, on this January eve, Linda wins Miss Congeniality,
Julie is first runner-up, and Kristina, whose skit spoofed her job
as a quality-control specialist at J.C. Penney, is crowned Miss
Tall Dallas 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way!'' and ``Are you sure?'' are among Kristina's first
words as she dabs tears from her eyes. Friends and relatives gather
round, the DJ plays ``Celebrate,'' and the new queen prepares for
her first royal act:
</P>
<P>
   ``To get on the dance floor and shake my booty.''

THE BACKSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ Tex Cushion was dependable in making his rounds
with his dog sled. He had to be. The winter caretakers holed up at
lakeside lodges in the 1930s depended on him for their provisions _
and hence their survival.
</P>
<P>
   Cushion predated television and call waiting. Were he to visit
the Tamarack Lodge Resort today, he'd probably feel right at home.
</P>
<P>
   This is alternative Mammoth.
</P>
<P>
   It sits on the back side of the mountain where the downhill
skiers congregate. To get there, you have to turn off Route 203 _
the thoroughfare that services Mammoth Mountain Ski Area _ and
wander far from the condo ghetto and nondescript motels of Mammoth
Lakes' main village.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Mary Road meanders 4 miles to the Tamarack, where they turn
back the clock. Really turn it back. Nearly to the era in which the
lodge was built, 1924.
</P>
<P>
   You're persuaded of this the instant you step into the lobby,
which is done entirely in knotty pine paneling, has trout trophies
mounted on the walls and features a stone fireplace seemingly big
enough to accommodate a Volkswagen in the fire box.
</P>
<P>
   On the lunch menu is beef-and-bean chili and clam chowder. Also
hot cider and mulled wine, the spices of which permeate the room.
</P>
<P>
   But what really strikes you is the sight of a boy of about 9
playing checkers with his dad over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   There is no TV here. Not in this lobby. Not in any of the 25
cabins that dot the forested slope on the eastern shores of Twin
Lakes. Not in any of the 10 guest rooms (five of which don't have
private baths) on the second floor of the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people turn right around and walk out when they find
out,'' said general manager Courtney McGrale. ``Parents say, `So
far, my kids are OK with it, but I don't know how long it's going
to last.' Then they find that their kids are outside building a
snowman, or inside playing chess.''
</P>
<P>
   This place is popular precisely because it maintains its
tradition as a rustic mountain retreat, rather than trying to be
the amenity-laden resort that is so common to the modern ski area.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, as the fireplace blazed nearby, Lacy
Shacter and Scott Palmer of Santa Barbara sat back on one the
lobby's comfortable couches and savored the serenity. ``It's so
peaceful,'' said Shacter. ``We thought we were on the wrong road
coming out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature contributes to the effect.
</P>
<P>
   The lakes basin, tucked behind and slightly east of the downhill
runs of Mammoth Mountain, sits at an altitude of about 8,800 feet
and gathers snow like a bowl. It would be pointless to keep the
roads open to lakes Mary, George, Horseshoe and Mamie, so Lake Mary
Road ends here at the lodge. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Then the snow on all of those closed roads is carefully groomed
for cross-country skiing, a sport as unhurried as the lodge itself.
A network of tracks on the grounds enables you to ski nearly to the
base of your cabin's porch steps. These cabin trails connect to a
greater web of snow-covered roads in the lakes area.
</P>
<P>
   Wander off in any direction, stop for a moment, and hear ...
absolute stillness. When you encounter other skiers, they'll
undoubtedly smile through blue lips, wave and say hello. Same with
the occasional snowshoers who tromp along the edge of the track.
</P>
<P>
   Also, every other person out here seems to be about 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Louis Villiot, supervisor of the cross-country ski center
adjacent to the lodge, smiles and nods when this is pointed out to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very safe environment where you don't have a chance of
a collision,'' he said. ``You don't have that freeway _ no, that
Paris-street driving _ where you have to be first, you have to be
first. ... You can move at your own pace. You don't feel like
you're always in someone's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamarack's proprietors have noticed a trend in the last few
years. Skiers who have crested the peak of middle age have begun to
gravitate away from the pace of the downhill sport and embraced the
gentle rhythms (and low physical risk) of cross-country skiing,
which is kind of a hybrid of hiking and crossing a polished
hardwood floor in cotton socks.
</P>
<P>
   The lakes area is interlaced with 25 miles of cross-country
trails, most of which fall into the easy or moderate categories
(based on steepness of the terrain). The trails loop around five
lakes in the area, from Mary and George to the south and Horseshoe
to the west. When snow coverage permits, a particularly challenging
black-diamond run stretches from Twin Lakes 4.24 kilometers (just
over 2{ miles) to a point southeast of Lake Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Trail passes are required _ they range in cost from $7 to $15
daily for an adult, depending on what time of day you start _ and
equipment may be rented for $15 per day. Guests at the Tamarack
Lodge receive discounts on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   If cross-country skiers find that their teen-agers are more
disposed to racing downhill on a snowboard or skis, well, a free
shuttle runs hourly to the intersection of Lake Mary Road and
Minaret Road, offering a link to the ski shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The tranquil pace of life at the Tamarack Lodge is a distinct
lure for vacationers seeking a mountain retreat, even though it
means putting up with the numerous quirks of the place.
</P>
<P>
   The cabins, built in the 1940s and '50s, are in particularly
heavy demand, according to McGrale, but guests might be wise to
specify in advance that they want a renovated one. Or at least one
that isn't ticketed for demolition. There's a fine line between
rustic and rundown.
</P>
<P>
   When a recent arctic front hit Mammoth, pushing the overnight
low to minus 7 degrees, the smelly gas wall heater in Cabin 16
failed in its bid to keep up _ perhaps because someone had
installed the room thermostat about 10 inches away from the heater.
Meanwhile, an exterior amber light intended to guide cabin-dwellers
through the dark woods appeared to have been aimed, stalag-like,
directly at a window above the head of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as McGrale talked of extensive renovation plans in
the wake of Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's purchase of the Tamarack
last May, she revealed that Cabin 16 is ticketed for demolition and
reconstruction. (The bulldozer can't get here soon enough.)
</P>
<P>
   A peek at a renovated unit of similar size, Cabin 33, presented
a stark contrast. It featured a wood-burning stove, double-paned
windows and sealed cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in none of the cabins will you find a microwave oven, or
even a drip coffee maker.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of walking through the snow to get to your room
is not appealing, there is always a room in the lodge itself. But
be warned: Insulation wasn't a common ingredient in such
construction in the '20s. A conversation in the adjoining room is
so distinct that you nearly wheel around to see if you were the one
who was addressed. And if you're assigned to Room 1, don't plan on
getting any sleep until the restaurant below has emptied of both
patrons and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Potential sources of annoyance? Then this place probably isn't
for you. Repeat guests prefer to think of these traits as charming
quirks. And there are plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   _ A desk clerk was asked what number a family member should call
to reach a particular cabin; the clerk wrote the number out on a
piece of paper _ and got everything right but the prefix for the
region. Later, a caller from far-off Mammoth Lakes reported an
utter inability to get through the lodge switchboard to a room in
the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   _ When that sub-zero chill hit recently, pipes broke in the
lodge, forcing the closure of the restaurant and leaving some rooms
without running water. How can a mountain resort that has been
hosting guests for 74 years not be prepared for below-freezing
weather?
</P>
<P>
   _ Even when all the pipes are intact, if you secure a room
without bath in the main lodge you'll find the following sign in
the men's communal bathroom: ``If the shower is occupied, please do
not flush the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Traveler advisory: Beer and wine are available, but the place
has no full bar. So if you're inclined toward Baileys and coffee or
a snifter of Courvoisier as you sit in one of the two rocking
chairs that front the fireplace opening, you'll have to pack a
flask.
</P>
<P>
   The food service, meanwhile, doesn't seem to know what it wants
to be. That lunchtime chili (which is nothing special) is served in
paper bowls, accompanied by plastic spoons. The steaming cider is
ladled up in paper cups, when an earthenware mug would seem so much
more civilized.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner, however, the shift of gears nearly induces whiplash.
The tiny restaurant (10 tables, 42 seats) is the pride of Mammoth,
with an eclectic menu, an impressive wine list and real plates.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Fredric Pierrel, who hails from Vosges, France, said, ``I
use a lot of game and a lot of mushrooms. That is related a little
bit to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to find rabbit, elk or frog legs on the menu,
along with caviar from Russia, lamb from Australia and fresh
seafood from various oceans.
</P>
<P>
   In light of all those signs warning of elk crossings on the
drive up Highway 395, the appropriate selection seemed to be
peppered elk medallions in blueberry-juniper berry sauce _ relax,
it's raised on ranches, like sheep, in New Zealand. Because of the
leanness of the meat, Pierrel insists on serving it medium rare,
and it can literally be cut with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Pierrel says he also takes pride in accenting each plate with
six or seven vegetables _ and not always the conventional ones.
Shelve your aversion to turnips and beets until he can serve you
his interpretations of fresh ones.
</P>
<P>
   Families or travelers on a budget might want to pick up some
groceries in town and plan on cooking once or twice in the
well-appointed kitchens in the cabins. Dinner in the lodge might
border on a splurge, at least for so backwoods a setting: For two
people, a shared appetizer, salad, entree and one glass of wine
each will range between $66 and $96 before tax and tip.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamarack Lodge Resort definitely has its eccentricities, and
its managers, in the face of Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's
stewardship, hope to preserve its unique qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there will probably be a hot tub of some sort going in soon
to soothe all those tortured ski muscles. Construction is planned
for 20 new cabins (some of them on the sites of current dilapidated
ones), while other units are set for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   But TV? No chance. Not as long as there are checkers and chess
and puzzles and conversation to be had.
</P>
<P>
   One desk clerk told of a visit a few weeks back of Jerry Dunphy,
the KCAL (Channel 9) news anchor. Impeachment and war were in the
air, not to mention the imminent prospect of a freeway chase or a
bikini photo shoot, and Dunphy ``couldn't believe we didn't have
TV,'' the clerk said. ``He was none too happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this place is not for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   It likes being that way. &QL;

   Mammoth Lakes lies in the eastern Sierra Nevada more than 300
miles north of Los Angeles, best accessed by Routes 5, 14 and 395.
To reach the Tamarack Lodge Resort, exit 395 on Route 203 into
Mammoth Lakes, then fork left onto Lake Mary Road just past the
main village. Tamarack Lodge is a couple of miles down Lake Mary
Road at Twin Lakes. You can't miss it _ in winter, the road closes
at the lodge. &QL; 
BOOKINGS: Reservations for both lodging and dining may be made at
(800) 237-6879 or (760) 934-2442. The lodge restaurant is small and
popular, so it's a good idea to make reservations in advance of
your trip. &QL; 
COSTS: Tamarack Lodge Resort has 25 cabins, ranging in price from
$90 on a weeknight for an unrenovated studio (sleeping two people
comfortably) to $220 for a three-bedroom, two-bath unit that
accommodates 11. In the lodge, rates range from $55 for a room with
shared bath to $100 for room with private bath. Rates are
considerably higher on weekends and holidays; the three-bedroom
cabin, for example, rents for $360 on a holiday weekend.
Cross-country skis are available for rental at a trailer adjacent
to the lodge. A complete outfitting (skis, boots, poles) rents for
$15 per adult for a full day, and a daily trail pass (required for
use of the groomed roads) is another $15. There are discounts
aplenty _ for lodge guests, seniors and youths, also on rentals
late in the day. The Tamarack offers package deals that include
lodging, breakfast, equipment rental, trail pass and group ski
lesson. &QL;

SNOWBOARDERS WELCOME AT MAMMOTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ As the overseer of safety issues on Mammoth
Mountain, Bill Anderson stays on the alert for this sight: A
snowboarder sitting smack in the middle of a downhill run, just
taking a break, adjusting a boot or contemplating the next
mayhem-defying feat.
</P>
<P>
   A common occurrence?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stop 15 times on one run down the mountain,'' Anderson
said. `` `You've got to get off to the side','' he'll say to each
one.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion in popularity of snowboarding, a delicate
balance is being maintained. Tradition-steeped skiers share the
mountain with this new wave of downhill enthusiasts, many of whom
are young, straight out of the skateboard parks and, well,
exuberant in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth, unlike some upscale resorts in the West, hasn't
regarded snowboarding as a necessary evil but instead has openly
embraced it. The result is about a 70-30 ratio of skiers to
snowboarders, according to a resort spokeswoman. And not a single
run on the mountain is designated for exclusive use by one or the
other.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, a respectful cohabitation is being maintained,
however grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snowboarders are considered to be a little more reckless
on the slopes,'' Noah Huffman, 22, of Agoura Hills said recently as
he lugged his snowboard toward a lift line. ``Each accuses the
other of getting in their way. But I haven't seen too much
conflict. You just try not to cut anybody off.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most critical issue in the interaction of the two
groups is a simple learning curve, according to Pam Rake, who works
with Anderson on health and safety matters. ``It's just the age
group,'' she said of the snowboarders. ``These kids are 16-17
(years old). They haven't learned the etiquette of the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Which causes some traditionalists to grumble. ``A lot of people
I know just don't like snowboarders,'' said Robbie Price, a
downhill skier from northern Ontario, Canada, who now lives in
Claremont. ``But it's not the snowboarding, it's the kids. You feel
the friction sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But kids are kids. Sometimes you get somebody smoking a
cigarette, and they just toss it out on the snow. Or they like to
be wild, a little more adventurous.''
</P>
<P>
   When snowboarding first came into vogue some 10 years ago, it
was segregated from the Mammoth ski crowd, limited to some runs on
June Mountain. Mammoth opened its lifts to the snowboarders in
1989-90 and has increasingly accommodated the daredevils ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Joani Saari of the resort's marketing department accompanied a
visitor on a gondola ride up the mountain recently and indicated an
area below. It is a terrain park, with bumps and jumps and takeoff
ramps. The place was crawling with snowboarders, even at 8 a.m. _
an absurdly early hour for most teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids will get in there and stay all day,'' Saari said.
``When I was growing up (in Mammoth), they used to have signs with
big X's wherever there was a jump (warning skiers to stay away).
Now we build them, trying to create places where they can get
air.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``For families, most of the kids are into
snowboarding. Snowboarding is the cool thing, and skiing is kind of
passe. We'd be cutting our own throats if we discouraged it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarding is fairly beginner-friendly. One day of instruction
and you're likely to be ready for intermediate runs, whereas
skiing, like golf, can take a bit longer to master.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result, snowboarding is also piquing the interest
of some traditionalists who are dabbling in the sport as a
complement to their downhill skiing.
</P>
<P>
   They discover immediately an explanation for the harrowing
near-misses that can occur when snowboarders are in the area: blind
spots. Because of the skateboard stance that snowboarding requires,
anyone flying down the mountain can't always see what is
approaching from behind, especially when a sharp backside turn is
being made. (Are side-view mirrors the answer?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing around you, the vision is limited,'' said Huffman, who
abandoned skiing for snowboarding about a year ago. ``You've got to
keep your eyes open more and look around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth officials are looking closely, too _ at statistics.
``Because of the perception that we're having more collisions and
snowboarders are causing problems, we've kept figures on
collisions,'' said Rake. ``They haven't changed (since snowboarders
were permitted on the mountain). Actually, they've gone down 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it is just the perception, the image. The
snowboard makes noise; you can hear it coming. The kids have baggy
pants and that rebel image. But we tell the kids that this is a
family area and that we expect them to conform when they're on the
hill.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many tellings it requires.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning at the base of the Goldrush Express lift, a
snowboarder was about 100 feet past a giant orange sign that said,
``Slow,'' but he shot over to a small promontory next to the
just-opened Mill Cafe. Up the back slope he roared and off the
6-foot drop, landing just a few feet from the edge of the dining
patio.
</P>
<P>
   The snowboarder glanced around anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   He was fortunate that Bill Anderson wasn't patrolling that part
of the mountain at the moment. &QL;

CALIFORNIA SEEKS TEXAS-STYLE RELATIONS WITH MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis, preparing for a trip to
Mexico City next week, said California lost out economically
because his predecessor neglected Mexico during his eight years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   But while former Gov. Pete Wilson had a rocky relationship with
Mexico and bashed illegal immigrants in 1994 campaign ads,
California's trade relationship with its southern neighbor was
growing to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, hopes to develop the same warm relationship
that Mexico shares with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican.
Davis has said that California probably lost 20 percent of its
potential investment from Mexico because other states, particularly
Texas, have better trading relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, however, paint a more positive picture.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, California has seen faster growth than
Texas in nearly every trading market to Mexico _ in such areas as
computers, agriculture, electronics and light manufacturing _
according to statistics from the U.S. Commerce Department and the
Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
   California exports to Mexico support about 126,000 jobs in the
state, according to state Trade and Commerce Agency officials, with
20 percent of the new jobs coming in 1996, when trade jumped from
$9 billion to $12.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas always has sold more goods to Mexico than any
other state, trade from California to Mexico increased 84.5 percent
between 1992 and 1997 _ the central years of Wilson's
administration. In Texas, the growth was 65.4 percent during the
same period, trade figures show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kicked Texas' butt,'' said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the
former governor, who by law was barred from running for a third
term in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   California's $110 billion export market also sells significantly
more goods than Texas to Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom and
every other country except Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's macho description of the state's rivalry with Texas
might better be described like this: Mexican officials privately
disparaged Wilson for ignoring their country politically and for
supporting the statewide initiative that cut services to illegal
immigrants. When it comes to trade, though, one thing is certain:
Business is business, whether it's with Texas or California.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view of Susan Corrales-Diaz, president and chief
executive of Systems Integrated of San Diego, which is working with
officials in Mexico City and a Mexican partner company to install
$1 million in switching controls for the city's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Corrales-Diaz said she had never been in a business meeting in
which Wilson's rocky relationship with Mexico was discussed or used
as a negotiating tool. The major political items that come up
regularly, she said, are the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which is a federal issue, and currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to do the deal and work with the customer,''
Corrales-Diaz said. ``There may be things that Governor Davis sees
at a bureaucratic level that a business person is never going to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' first foreign trip, a month after his inauguration, will
take him to Mexico City and the industrial state of Monterrey. He
is scheduled to meet with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and
with top university officials Tuesday to discuss education,
cultural ties and trade.
</P>
<P>
   For the Davis administration, the point is to do better.
California sold about $12 billion in goods to Mexico in 1997,
compared with $31 billion from Texas the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Davis) visited Mexico about a year and a half ago, it
was made clear to him that California could do better if there was
a stronger relationship,'' said Michael Bustamante, the governor's
spokesman. ``In order to effectuate change from a positive
standpoint in terms of trade ... there has to be a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zuccato, a trade associate with the California Office of
Export Development, agreed: ``Due to the fact that the Mexican
government owns and operates some of the largest industries in
Mexico, they are also some of the largest prospective clients for
California companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson traveled to Mexico to meet with other border governors at
their annual conferences only three times. His relationship with
Mexico was so damaged that he had to meet with the Mexican
ambassador in secret during an April 1998 exchange. Wilson's hard
views on immigration were widely reported in the Mexican news
media.
</P>
<P>
   One Texas official said factors other than the personalities of
Wilson and Bush play into trade with Mexico. Branner Stewart,
research manager for the Texas Department of Economic Development,
said a good relationship between a governor and Mexico ``may result
in increased trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Stewart said, ``I think a larger part of Texas' success
in exporting to Mexico is our very, very strong cultural, historic
and economic relationship that goes back literally centuries.''

NEW RADAR GIVES THE POLICE EYES TO THE REAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRENDAN LYONS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York State Police have a warning for
those drivers who speed in heavy traffic or keep the pedal down
when they think a trooper is looking the other way: Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   A faster, more accurate radar is being installed in patrol cars
statewide that virtually puts eyes in the backs of troopers' heads.
Called Stalker, the radar includes sensors placed on the front and
rear of patrol cars, enabling troopers to detect speeds of cars
that are behind them, or even traveling in the other direction, the
State Police said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it takes drivers about 1.5 seconds to realize their
radar detector is flashing and pull their foot off the gas,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
   That's too long if the Stalker is watching, said Sgt. Terence
McDonnell, supervisor of the State Police speed enforcement
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time, chances are the radar's already got you,''
McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The radar is operated by a cordless remote control that is the
same size as most television remote controls. It is geared toward
catching what McDonnell calls ``professional speeders.'' Those are
drivers who constantly cruise at high speeds, often tailgating,
weaving in and out of traffic and flashing their lights at drivers
blocking their lane, even if those drivers are also speeding.
</P>
<P>
   These drivers have a tendency to speed even when they see a
State Police car, particularly if the patrol car is making a U-turn
with the radar facing the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``The trooper can select to measure the speed of
someone coming up behind them,'' said McDonnell, who develops radar
training programs for troopers. Even if the patrol car is moving,
it can clock speeders in practically any lane, driving in any
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The radar uses a narrow detection beam _ about 9 degrees _ and
operates on frequencies that cannot be detected by most radar
detectors. But if radar detectors are regularly picking up on a
Stalker unit, McDonnell said the units can be reprogrammed to
operate on a different frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Radar detectors are legal in New York, except in trucks with
gross weights of more than 10,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Stalker also has valuable features troopers can select with
the hand-held remote control.
</P>
<P>
   The radar can be programmed to gauge the speed of a
tractor-trailer and at the same time, on a different readout
screen, tell a trooper the speed of a motorcycle whizzing past the
side of the truck. Most older units would only lock in on the speed
of the large truck _ which enabled many speeders to escape getting
a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Stalker is made by Applied Concepts Inc. of Plano, Texas,
and costs about $3,000 per unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an investment in saving lives,'' McDonnell said.

BOOK DETAILS TEXAS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As William Jefferson Clinton faced impeachment by the House of
Representatives and a subsequent trial by the Senate, there was the
obvious comparison with the case of President Andrew Johnson more
than 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During debates in the House and Senate, there have also been
references to the impeachments and removal from office of some
federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the classic _ and most dramatic _ impeachment trials
happened right here in Texas in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you just know that the mother of all impeachments would
have taken place in the Lone Star State?
</P>
<P>
   Historian and writer Bruce Rutherford, in his 1983 book ``The
Impeachment of Jim Ferguson,'' gives a blow-by-blow account of the
colorful and complex Texas governor who clashed with many people,
including regents of the University of Texas, the speaker of the
state House of Representatives and, eventually, the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford tells how Ferguson, president and part owner of the
Temple State Bank, had been accused of misusing state money in a
lot of ways, including depositing large amounts in his bank without
the state getting interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who believed that UT had become an elitist university,
vetoed an entire appropriations bill for the school, pressured the
university president to fire certain professors and lambasted
fraternities there.
</P>
<P>
   He also rigged the selection of Abilene as the site of a new
state college and even gave a $500 ``loan'' to Speaker F.O. Fuller,
a loan that was supposedly not to be repaid, and which Fuller would
save as evidence that the governor was trying to buy his influence.
</P>
<P>
   The lines were drawn with all the intrigue of a Texas western: a
powerful speaker vs. a powerful governor; money changing hands;
student demonstrations; and a case that would pit two of the
state's top lawyers _ including one from Fort Worth _ against each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1917, Fuller persuaded the governor to call a special
session of the Legislature, ostensibly to consider only the vetoed
UT appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   However, on opening day, Fuller read 13 charges against
Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, according to Rutherford's book, was in the gallery
when the charges were read, and he would eventually testify.
</P>
<P>
   Former legislator M.M. Crane was counsel for the House and Fort
Worth's W. A. Hanger, a former state senator, represented the
governor. Over the next couple of weeks, the two attorneys were at
their best, examining and cross-examining numerous witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the House passed 21 articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During the two days when formal articles were drawn up, the
governor issued 21 pardons. At the same time, a race riot broke out
in Houston involving black Army troops temporarily stationed there.
A number of people died or were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, sitting as the High Court of Impeachment, heard
testimony for about three weeks before passing 10 of the articles
and rejecting 11.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate debated the final judgment, which included
removing Ferguson from office and barring him from holding any
other state office, the governor was writing out a formal
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson would remain an intriguing figure in Texas politics and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting and recording songs in penitentiaries throughout
the South, he would discover the great black folk singer known as
Leadbelly and publish a book of Negro folk songs,'' Rutherford says
in the book.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920 he ran for president ``on his own one-man American Party
ticket'' and would run against the KKK's leader for the U.S. Senate
in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, when the courts stopped his campaign for governor, he
announced that his wife, Miriam Amanda Ferguson, would carry his
platform against the No. 1 candidate, who had been endorsed by the
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, two years earlier, the KKK boasted 5 million members
nationwide and in Texas had ``elected a senator and gained control
of the city government of Dallas, Fort Worth, and Wichita Falls;
elsewhere, it elected governors in Georgia and Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Ferguson easily won election; Jim Ferguson had beaten the
Klan and gotten back at some old enemies, and a Texas legend was
born _ the saga of ``Ma and Pa'' Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great story. So, when you've tired of that political mess
in Washington and want to read a terrific tale about a real
impeachment trial, pick up Rutherford's book.

MAYBE MY ILK CAN GROW SMARTLY, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A spokesman for an outfit called the American Planning
Association says I'm full of baloney when it comes to that hot new
planning phenomenon called ``smart growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Soule, the association's policy director, replied to
my recent column on smart growth with a lengthy e-mail touting the
wonders of ``growing smart'' and challenging ``Mr. Thompson and his
ilk'' to join the smart-growth movement.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever somebody starts talking about your ``ilk,'' you can
rest assured that you have offended them severely. The definition
of ``ilk'' is innocent enough _ ``of the same sort or class'' _ but
in actual usage, it is a synonym for ``all the morons who agree
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going any further, I should mention that when I wrote the
column that offended the APA, I was unaware that I had any ilk on
the issue of smart growth. In fact, I didn't expect to find any
agreement at all with my negative view of this popular new planning
concept that is suddenly being raised as the main argument against
development in communities all across America.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want that new highway cutting through your town? Fight it
by saying it violates smart growth. Hate the idea of another
shopping mall in your neighborhood? March down to City Hall and
proclaim that a mall is not a smart way for a community to grow.
Loathe apartment complexes, office buildings, strip centers and
housing developments? Smart growth says thumbs down on all of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration proposed spending billions of
taxpayer dollars to promote smart-growth initiatives in local
communities, I suggested that the bureaucracy-loving liberals in
Washington had discovered a new way to expand the federal
government and pander to anti-development interest groups such as
far-left environmentalists who view economic growth as a plot to
destroy the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The smart-growth crowd was off to a fast start in promoting the
concept as the answer to problems ranging from air pollution to
urban sprawl. But no sooner did my column hit the street than I
started hearing from pro-growth folks who were concerned about the
strict limitations being placed on economic development by
anti-growth forces operating under the umbrella of smart growth.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for the American Planning Association and Jeffrey
Soule. If Soule hadn't blasted me and my ilk, I might have thought
that I'd accidentally come down on the right side of an issue for a
change _ which would have played havoc with my hard-earned
reputation as an uninformed numbskull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently at a loss for ideological foes,'' Soule writes,
``columnist Bill Thompson wants to take the bipartisan, balanced
idea of smart growth and make it walk and talk like a monster
thrown together by `liberals' to terrorize Americans everywhere.
Although he tries to pre-empt criticism by cloaking himself in the
mantle of `reasonableness,' nothing about his argument against
smart growth is founded in reason.''
</P>
<P>
   I hate to interrupt a critic who's on a roll, but I feel
compelled to report that I have ideological foes galore and that
these foes include liberals and conservatives, since neither group
can figure out which side I'm on. Also, I resent the suggestion
that I would resort to reasonableness as a debating tactic.
Longtime readers can verify that reason is a weapon to which I
rarely resort.
</P>
<P>
   Soule concludes:
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Planning Association, a private organization
devoted to helping people shape their own communities through good
planning practice, has developed `Growing Smart,' a thorough and
reasonable approach to creating a better future for every American
community. We are working with developers, mayors, town
supervisors, county officials and many others .... Let's spend our
effort on making our communities better instead of trying to create
bogeymen where none exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Mr. Thompson and his ilk will join us.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't speak for my ilk. But Soule can count me out.

EVER-AFTERLIFE: VIVID EGYPTIAN FAIENCE PIECES RETAIN POWER TO
CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Faience is a French word for an Italian city
that is used to describe a kind of ceramic that is older than the
pyramids and just as typically Egyptian. Then again, the Egyptian
word for faience _ pronounced ``fie-ahns'' or ``fay-ahns'' _ is
``tjehnet,'' meaning ``that which is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you with us? If not, imagine gleaming blue amulets and mossy
green cosmetics dishes, funerary figures inset with vivid yellows
and reds, and all sorts of other intimate components of the life
and afterlife of Egypt's ruling and social elite.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Now that you're visualizing faience and pronouncing faience,
you can understand the essence of the Kimbell Art Museum's exhibit
of more than 200 lovely faience objects from the world's major
collections of Egyptian art. The Kimbell's new show admittedly will
be overshadowed by its impending ``Matisse and Picasso''
installation, which opens next week, but it's a charmer. And it's
free.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Gifts of the Nile: Ancient Egyptian Faience,'' the
exhibition features loans from places such as the Louvre, the
British Museum and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was
organized by the museum of the Rhode Island School of Design and,
perhaps for that reason, is a show that will appeal to anyone who
loves beauty.
</P>
<P>
   A form of paste glass, faience is primarily made of sand and
water and typically acquires a bluish-green color after it is
fired. It was originally used as a relatively inexpensive
substitute for lapis lazuli. But associations between faience and
such important life forces as rebirth, fertility and life-giving
light give it its own significance and, as such, made it an
important element in burial preparation. Faience objects date back
to predynastic times (roughly 3000 B.C.) and remained a staple of
Egyptian artifact-making into the period of Roman rule.
</P>
<P>
   But enough on history and technology. We are talking about
irresistible artifacts. A grid of tiny, turquoise-hued tiles
reminds us that entire rooms might be thus decorated. A quartet of
cunning hippos brings to mind that famous reproduction from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's catalog. A full figure of the god
Thoth _ exquisitely realized and no more than 6 inches tall _ is as
sensuous a study of male form as anything the Greeks produced. A
mummy mask, while far from naturalistic, is so animated you feel as
if you're looking into the eyes of a living person.
</P>
<P>
   The show is accompanied by occasional free lectures presented at
12:30 p.m. on selected Saturdays in the museum auditorium through
early April.

FOR $94,000 SHE STAYS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who understands bureaucracies should know that the way to
get a cushy job isn't to make yourself desirable but to make
yourself undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, while we're suffering through a national crisis over
alleged favors to Lewinsky, the one person who clearly has enjoyed
a big payoff--at taxpayer expense--is Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was a secretary at the White House, a holdover from the
Bush administration. When she began to look like trouble, she was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the Pentagon is no surprise. Although
conservatives who inveigh against overpaid, do-nothing federal
bureaucrats probably have in mind the Department of Health and
Human Services, if your urgent need is a government job in general,
rather than anything in particular that job might accomplish,
apparently the Pentagon is your best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a military force of one and a half million people, the
Defense Department employs about 800,000 civilians. Linda Tripp is
one of them, holding the position of public affairs specialist with
a civil service ranking of GS-15, Step 6. That puts the 49-year-old
high-school grad at the top of the Pentagon's middle management
ranks. Like all GS employees, she just received an
across-the-board-pay increase. Tripp's raise, including a
``locality'' adjustment for working in the Washington, D.C., area,
was 3.68 percent, bringing her salary to $94,098 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For which she does ...? Since March 1998, nothing. Although she
has supposedly been working at home, she was stripped of her
duties--but not her pay or her title--shortly after the scandal
broke. Tripp has characterized this as a politically motivated
``demotion.'' It will strike many as a demotion devoutly to be
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's title at the Pentagon was confidential
assistant to the assistant secretary for public affairs. Her job
was writing press releases, for which she was paid $33,000. Note
that Lewinsky got this job as a payoff for being undesirable to a
presidential aide, not for being desirable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Tripp is the public affairs specialist for a program
called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference, an arguably
worthwhile annual propaganda effort that takes 60 civilian ``public
opinion leaders'' on a weeklong tour of military operations. Tripp
had primary responsibility for the paperwork involved in the
selection process, for making travel and hotel arrangements, as
well as for other logistic odds and ends such as the week's
kick-off banquet. According to the New York Times, before Tripp
took the job, this position was part-time.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for more detail, the person now doing Tripp's job
used the word ``coordinating'' a lot, but that was about it. There
is, it turns out, no official description of the job. Writing one
is among the tasks Tripp is being paid to perform now.
</P>
<P>
   But there are official descriptions of other GS-15 public
affairs specialist positions. For instance, the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights is currently looking for someone to ``assist in the
reviews and analysis of numerous requests for speeches; to develop,
clear, release, and distribute a wide range of information and data
concerning the nature and objective of the Commission's programs;
(and to) prepare press releases, fact sheets, etc. and arrange
press conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: PR grunt. Salary: $80,658 to $104,851.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get some sort of independent measure of what these
jobs are worth, I called Kelly Services, the nationwide temp
agency. Without mentioning Tripp or the Pentagon, I described her
job there to the woman at Kelly. Oh, she said, that's high-end
secretarial. How much would you have to pay somebody to do a job
like that, I asked. Oh, $18 to $25 an hour, she said. That's
$36,000 to $50,000 a year--roughly half of what Tripp is being paid
not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folks on duty in the skies over Iraq make about half
of what Linda Tripp makes. Indeed, Tripp pulls down more than all
but a handful of the U.S. military's most senior officers. She
earns more than a ballistic missile submarine commander and is on a
par with aircraft carrier skippers in the Persian Gulf and Army
generals ready to lead thousands of troops into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Bob Barr and Henry Hyde would say if Monica had got
a deal like that.

DRESS REHEARSAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No doubt about it. There was plenty of glitz and
glamour at the Golden Globe Awards. But that fashion parade was a
mere dress rehearsal for the Academy Awards on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   A date with Oscar is the ultimate gala. It's like your
quinceanera, senior prom and wedding day all rolled into one giant
photo op.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Academy Awards fashion coordinator Fred Hayman says, ``It
is a very anxious moment making an entrance onto the red carpet.
The Oscars have become so important that literally the entire world
is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching? How about scrutinizing every detail from the 'do to
the shoe?
</P>
<P>
   Look at Geena Davis. That gorgeous actress made so many fashion
faux pas on Oscar night that the fashion press hasn't seen her on
the red carpet in years. This year, Davis will be hosting the Oscar
arrival show for ABC, dressed _ it is hoped _ in something
stunningly appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   And people still talk about Cher's outrageous Bob Mackie
outfits, Elizabeth Taylor's diamonds and decolletage, and Sharon
Stone's turtleneck top from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   So, for many of Hollywood's elite women actors, the Golden
Globes is a trial run to see how their hair and gown look on TV and
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Hayman, who also watched the recent awards show, hopes the array
of colorful gowns will be a hint of what we'll see at the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see more color _ more reds, yellows, greens and
pastels,'' he said. ``Of course, black is the easiest and is very
flattering, but I think overall the clothes should be very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hall, who designs for the Halston label, says, ``The look
will be glamorous but understated for a younger, more modern star
like Gwyneth Paltrow.''
</P>
<P>
   While he didn't design Paltrow's Golden Globe ensemble (it was
by Calvin Klein), Hall's designs were seen on Halle Berry, Minnie
Driver, Christine Lahti, Tracy Pollan, Charlize Theron, Lisa Gay
Hamilton, Krista Miller and Shay Delane, so he's in the loop. And
he says bateau necklines (think of Audrey Hepburn) and racer or
T-back gowns will be winning looks at the Oscars. ``The back is the
new erogenous zone, but you won't see gowns that dip below the
waistline as we did last year,'' Hall adds.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also predicts we'll see less black and more colors, such as
pink, coral, celadon (a pale yellowish green) and aqua; fewer
totally beaded gowns; and more separates. He favors full skirts in
taffeta or satin that are slim at the hip and have a sweep at the
hemline, paired with beaded or cashmere tops. He thinks
dyed-to-match stoles in either fabric or fox will remain important
because they finish a look and also provide security for women who
are concerned about their upper arms.
</P>
<P>
   More details.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks gloves are a tad old-fashioned, small beaded bags are
hot, and Lucite (clear plastic) shoes are catching on, although he
expects most stars will wear strippy high-heeled sandals or
sling-back shoes that expose bare feet and painted toe nails.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever she wears, her hair must complement the ensemble. When
you break the rules, you end up looking like Jenna Elfman of TV's
``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' at the Golden Globes. Her hair was pulled and
gelled into umpteen little spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mistake and should serve as a lesson for the
upcoming Oscars,'' observed Frederic Fekkai, the official hair
designer for the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto with another Globe winner, Camryn Manheim of ``The
Practice.'' Says Fekkai, ``Her hair was overdone. It was too much
with all her jewels and the great gown, and the bottom line is she
is prettier than her hair made her look.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fekkai, Gwyneth Paltrow's casual, wispy 'do is the
trend-setting style of the year. He adds that you'll also see
loosely rolled French twists and a variety of jeweled hair clips
and tiaras. But not as many flowers in the hair.
</P>
<P>
   Older women, he says, probably won't go for the straight hair
and center part that's becoming popular, but he thinks they should
have hair that moves, rather than be molded into place with heavy
lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of senior sirens, Fekkai said he'd love to do Lauren
Bacall's hair for the Oscars. ``If she came to me, I'd have her
grow her hair to her shoulders, and give her a fresh take on her
original screen image, with a side part and smooth waves. And I'd
put more gold and less ash in her blond hair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blond bombshell Marilyn Monroe once asked Harry Winston's advice
in the song, ``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,'' and now it's a
Hollywood tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Stars often ask to borrow jewels for the awards shows, but
spokeswoman Carol Brodie says they're picky. They only loan to
those stars who elicit ``the spirit of Harry Winston,'' like
Gwyneth Paltrow, Calista Flockhart and Jane Seymour. In other
words, major players.
</P>
<P>
   The names change from year to year, and so do jewelry trends.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brodie, ``The trend is to jewels that offer a hint
of glint, rather than a whole lot of fabulous flash. This year we
predict stars will be wearing fewer, but larger, pieces, such as a
cocktail ring with a 5-carat, emerald-cut diamond teamed with a
necklace and a pair of diamond stud earrings. Or big earrings, a
cocktail ring and a bracelet, but no necklace. And, yes, platinum
is still hot.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also noticed that younger actors shy away from
high-profile jewels because they're afraid of making mistakes.
However, she'd like to dress Drew Barrymore. ``I see her as Jean
Harlow with wavy hair accented with diamond hair ornaments, no
earrings, but a long necklace dripping down the middle of her
back,'' says Brodie.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you wear Winston jewels or Target knock-offs, Brodie
gives the same advice: ``Don't overdo it. If you're in doubt, keep
your gown very simple and wear one important piece.'' &QL;

``this gloriously stuffed little planet.'' Yet during a recent
visit to the Mt. Kisco model home, not one person in a steady
stream of visitors stepped across the threshold into the living
room. Instead, they made a beeline straight back to the
double-height family room, a congenial open space adjacent to the
kitchen, where they chatted amiably on Dumbo-sized couches or

   SPRING-FEVER (New York) _ Spring fever can begin in strange

of Swiss chard purchased at an expensive natural-foods store. The
leaves were a deep plush green, with vermilion veins coursing
through them like rivers bursting with life. And in my memory at
least (alas, we ate the evidence), they were not crinkled and
glossy like most Swiss chard, but smooth, almost as if crossed with
a collard green. As we chopped the leaves and sauteed them with
garlic, the sensual pleasures of spring on the farm rushed into my

3,000-square-foot floor-through loft on a high floor in what was a

DENIECE WILLIAMS AN INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gazing at her three Grammy Awards,
inspirational-r&AMP;b singer Deniece Williams comes up with a phrase to
suggest what the record academy statuettes mean to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appreciation from my peers,'' she says. ``When you win, it's
the academy saying you're the best at what you do. It's
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is up for best pop-contemporary gospel album for ``This
Is My Song.'' The Woodland Hills resident has had hits over the
years with ``Too Much, Too Little, Too Late'' (with Johnny Mathis),
``Let's Hear It for the Boy'' (from the film ``Footloose''),
``Free'' and ``It's Gonna Take a Miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of Stevie Wonder's backup group Wonderlove from
1972-75, Williams has been singing inspirational material along
with love songs ever since her 1977 debut album, ``This Is Niecy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, she went to her then-label and said she wanted to
record gospel music exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed gospel could work on pop-r&AMP;b radio,'' she said.
``Because listeners to those stations come from a church
background. I had a concept in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, gospel music was played on those stations, but only
on Sundays when a gospel disc jockey would come in to host a
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door was opened by Take 6, Philip Bailey and myself,''
Williams, 47, said. ``This was before Kirk Franklin could get
airplay on straight r&AMP;b stations with gospel music. There were many
gospel singers who left the church in those days because there was
no money in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won every Grammy nod she's received in the gospel
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an honor to be mentioned,'' she said. ``When I was
told I was on the nominations list this year, I thought that was
great. It's just such a thrill.'' &QL;

FOR COBURN, `ROCKLINE' CALL-IN OASIS

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``If you think the Super Bowl is competitive, try
L.A. radio.''
</P>
<P>
   So sayeth Bob Coburn, Arrow 93's afternoon personality and host
of the station's syndicated ``Rockline'' at 8:30 p.m. Mondays and
Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockline,'' broadcast on about 250 stations around the
country, allows listeners to call the program and talk to the
featured artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly one of the only interactive radio programs on the
dial,'' said Coburn, a Calabasas resident. ``What other show can
you think of where you can pick up the phone and speak to the
artists? There aren't many.''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said his most surprising interviews include the young
rap-rocker Kid Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised how well-versed he was on the music that came
before him,'' Coburn said. ``He had the attitude that he knew he
wasn't the first guy to walk on stage to play rock music. He's
well-schooled in rock history and also very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Arrow three years ago, Coburn worked at KLOS-FM
(95.5) and at now-defunct KMET-FM in the '70s. He hosted
``Rockline'' from 1981-94, then took over again in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Out now is ``The Best of Rockline'' (Priority), a 12-track
compilation of performances by the Wallflowers, Tonic, Lenny
Kravitz and others. Proceeds are earmarked for MusiCares, which
helps members of the music community with medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE DIAL: The pledge drive at KCRW-FM (89.9) is being
held hostage by the impeachment proceedings. The public radio
station's subscriber sign-up was supposed to begin Friday, but may
have to be postponed depending on events in Washington, which are
broadcast on KCRW. ... Ex-California attorney general and recent
GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren hosts a talk show for the
Catholic Family Radio Network, airing locally at noon weekdays on
KPLS-AM (830). ... Local stations raked in more than $600 million
in ad revenue last year, making Los Angeles the most lucrative
radio market in the country. ... ``Traffic Jam'' moves to 2 p.m.
Saturdays on KRLA-AM (1110). ... KNX-AM (1070), which recently
nabbed 10 Golden Mike Awards from the Radio-TV News Association,
simulcasts ``60 Minutes II'' at 9 p.m. Thursdays. ... ``Talk to
Marty,'' featuring comic Marty Ingels, broadcasts from the Legacy
restaurant in Hollywood at 9 p.m. Saturdays on KIEV-AM (870). &QL;

   Sick of all those persistent warnings about viruses on line?
Here's one that is certified by bona fide medical doctors: the
online Flu-o-Meter, which indicates the prevalence of influenza
state by state.
</P>
<P>
   The meter, a creation of Intelihealth, uses information from the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is part of
the www.intelihealth.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When a visitor passes the cursor over each state in a map of the
United States, the meter lights up in one of four different colors
to indicate the number of flu cases in the state in question. (That
is for surfers who are Java-enabled. Another version is available
for those who aren't.)
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore oversee the
editorial content of Intelihealth, which is a collaboration between
Aetna U.S. Healthcare and the university. The site also includes
information about how to avoid the flu and who needs flu shots
(which are best to get in October).
</P>
<P>
   The site says flu kills 10,000 to 40,000 people in the United
States each year. It also discusses the symptoms and complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what people want to know if they're suffering the
symptoms they feel might be flu,'' said Dr. Jay Rosan, a family
practitioner and executive vice president of Intelihealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that really what I'm suffering from, or is it just a
virus?'' he added. ``So I can look at my state, and ask is my state
really having a flu epidemic or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Pringle, president of Intelihealth, said the site might help
with prevention. ``At least you can know that if you're going into
an area with the flu, you should be careful and wash your hands
more frequently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Information from Intelihealth, based in Blue Bell, Pa., is
distributed by more than 500 partners on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Intelihealth is an anchor tenant of America Online, which means
that it has a prominent position on one or more of AOL's primary
channels, and it is the exclusive health channel on Alta Vista.
</P>
<P>
   It also appears in Web sites of hundreds of newspapers of
various sizes, like The Washington Post and The Dodge City Post in
Kansas, Pringle said.
</P>
<P>
   The site received 150,000 hits on one day last week, Pringle
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's flu site is at
www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/flu/weekly.htm. A number of states put
flu information on the Web, including Massachusetts
(www.state.ma.us/dph/flu98-99.htm) and Virginia
(www.vdh.state.va.us/epi/flu9899.htm).
</P>
<P>
   According to the Flu-o-Meter, there have been scattered
outbreaks so far in New York, Georgia, Puerto Rico and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York State Department of Health, which does
not track individual cases of influenza, there have recently been
seven outbreaks in New York City nursing homes _ three in the Bronx
and four in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone trying to stay healthy for the rest of the flu season,
which usually lasts until March, is advised to scrub up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest, oldest method of avoiding spread of infection is
frequent hand washing, preferably with antibacterial soap from a
sanitary dispenser,'' the site says.

LET US PLAY: TINDER TO FUEL MUSICAL SPARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first kind of play is the discovery of rules and effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second kind of play is manipulation of rules and
experimentation with effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third kind of play transcends rules and effects.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a pithy bit of theory, something you would expect to hear
in an academic setting or from a computer programmer or modern
classical composer or a psychologist _ distinguished people paid to
be esoteric.
</P>
<P>
   This set of theories was, in fact, sold to me by a record store
clerk with three facial piercings and green hair. It is found on
one half of Let Us Play, a two-CD set by Coldcut, a pair of deejay
provocateurs based in England and cyberspace (www.ninjatune.net).
</P>
<P>
   One disk is music. The other is a digital toy chest filled with
computer goodies: musical instruments, sound tools, pranks, games
and manifestos. They're excellent toys, conspicuously clever and
full of twists.
</P>
<P>
   Even music videos, which are not inherently interactive, take on
a pipe-cleaner quality on CD-ROM. They can be frozen or played
backward on an ancient VCR with the standard buttons: Rewind, Fast
Forward, Play, Pause and Eject (and all the right mechanical sound
effects).
</P>
<P>
   Because everything is synthetic, it doesn't sound wrong in
reverse. It just sounds different. Some of the videos actually look
better in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The whole setup seems to announce: ``Everything you see here has
been manipulated. So you might as well manipulate it some more.''
Let Us Play is about building new things with other people's
blocks, as unselfconsciously as a 5-year-old assembles Legos.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of tools on this disk, but they're not
presented as tools. They're presented as toys because toys are
appealing and approachable, whereas tools are considered serious
and difficult. Tools are for work, and work implies the possibility
of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Toys are for play, and you can't really fail at play. You can
lose a competition. You can botch a performance. But you can't fail
at pure play.
</P>
<P>
   So there is a sound tool called My Little Funkit that allows you
to assemble grooves and samples and drum breaks from different
parts of the album. It's a rather sophisticated little machine, but
it looks like a preschool toy.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is very round and simple and iconic. The drum break
buttons have lightning bolts. The groove buttons have squiggles.
The exit button is a frowny face.
</P>
<P>
   The visual language makes it impossible to think, ``I can't do
this,'' which is what most adults think about making music, or
using new tools, or play in general.
</P>
<P>
   That's why grown-ups are bad at video games. They're afraid to
play. Kids are not. That is why they master new technology so
quickly. Complex information systems lend themselves to induction.
So do toys. When you pick up a toy, you don't have to know what all
the variables are, or how everything affects everything else. You
just mess around and learn what's useful as you need it.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Playtime, Coldcut's ``beat-based algorithmic
music generator.'' On screen, you see a mixing board with three
sets of sliders for drums, bass and samples. Each set of sliders
allows you to adjust the volume, tempo, density, variation and
randomness of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   All the variables are relative _ the position of each controller
knob affects the behavior of the others. It's chaotic and complex,
and instructions don't help. You have to play. And then it's easy.
And more important, it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   An image machine called Pic Pump does something similar with
pictures. On Coldcut's recently released remix album, ``Let Us
Replay,'' another audiovisual Cuisinart allows you to loop, scratch
and chop digital audio and video samples.
</P>
<P>
   The free demo version uses Coldcut videos for fodder. The
soon-to-be-released commercial version lets you load your own. It's
the same software the band uses for live performances.
</P>
<P>
   It's software that blurs the line between editing and
performance, just as turntables and sequencers have blurred the
line between deejays and musicians. But more radically, these tools
blur the line between people who create music and people who
consume it.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to reshuffle media, to twist it around and make it
your own and have it heard is a challenge to the power
relationships that define the entertainment industry. To the extent
that play turns those relationships upside down, play becomes
political.
</P>
<P>
   And because of Coldcut's ``near-death experiences'' with big
record companies (Ninja Tune is the record label it started after a
particularly bitter experience with Arista), the politics are
explicit. The CD-ROM manifesto is a rousing hypertext collage full
of statements like: ``Most people seem to be in a narcoleptic
zombie no-mind state most of the time, which helps Babylonian
control systems. WAKEY WAKEY! Now is the time for multimedia to
continue the revolution that sampling, sequencing technology and
the DJ started in the late 80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Down with superstars. Down with major labels. It's not enough
just to buy the shrink-wrapped software and view packaged
information until you get itchy for something new. Send something
upstream. Whatever it is, reprogram it. Everybody play.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy is rooted in the idea that everyone is
fundamentally creative. If the message of Big Media is ``Kids,
don't try this at home,'' the message of Let Us Play is: ``Kids,
please try this at home, in as many different ways as you can. You
can probably do it better than us. Just send us the URL.'' It's a
fusion of high tech and punk rock _ chaos theory in Doc Martens.
</P>
<P>
   It's extremely idealistic, but it is also highly practical.
Because even if the world really is filled with soul-dead,
complacent dolts, a couple of deejays have made a great album and
some tools they can use for their own fun and profit.
</P>
<P>
   If no one wants to play, they can take their toys and go home.
But odds are, lots of people will want to play. And that means more
amateur deejays and designers and file swapping and all the right
sorts of trouble. The revolution will not be televised. But odds
are, it will be uploaded. And it will look curiously like play
definition No. 3. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Let Us Play, CD-ROM for Mac and PC, and Let Us Replay, CD-ROM
for PC, are both packaged with plain old audio CDs for $15.99 each
and can be found in sufficiently cool record stores or at
www.othermusic.com.)

LESSONS ON THE MASTERWORKS AND THE MUNDANE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walking through a gallery, you notice a dark painting of a
Biblical scene executed with a touch of gore. Is it by Caravaggio
or Rubens? A nearby tour guide mentions the word modernist. Could
she have meant Mannerist instead? And what is the difference
between Hellenic and Hellenistic and why can't you remember?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to some of these questions can be found in the
art-history CD-ROM's now on the market. Unlike books of art
history, they allow users to learn about painting, sculpture and
architecture with a flourish of digital sound effects, film clips
and slide shows.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the infusion of action may make studying art
that much more interesting. In addition, users can often choose how
much information is presented.
</P>
<P>
   But then, volume is usually not a problem. Like a freshman
civilization course, these disks generally cover a few thousand
years of art without getting mired in details that only a
specialist would appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the collection is high quality, spans a broad
spectrum of artistic styles and is reviewed with thoughtful
commentary, the users will be in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   Though often simplified, art CD-ROMs still require some
navigation. Given the wealth of material, the design of the
programs becomes more important. Poorly designed CD-ROMs are no
better than a grammar-school filmstrip or a dry lecture delivered
in front of a slide projector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good CD-ROMs require a lot of interest on the part of the
person who is using it to be curious and to go through all of the
links,'' said Margaret Pezalla-Granlund, an educator at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. ``Ones that I haven't liked have a
feel that they started out as another project. They have limited
capabilities or they just have a talking-head expert who comes on
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important things to bear in mind before
investing in a CD-ROM is that the quality of images is often no
better than that found in art books. Paintings reproduced on screen
are not usually detailed enough to show individual brush strokes,
patches of thick paint and subtle color differences.
</P>
<P>
   But then, no one would argue that digital images are a
substitute for the real thing. Rather, scrolling through artworks
on a computer can be considered a way to learn more about art
before the next museum show opening or trip to Europe. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LOUVRE MUSEUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Learn Technologies Interactive/Voyager; $29.95; Windows 3.1 and
later, Mac 7.0 and later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Louvre Museum stands among only a handful of collections
that can boast of a broad spectrum of art history under one roof.
So a CD-ROM that focuses only on what is displayed in the Louvre, a
former royal palace, is probably just as good at explaining art
history as others that draw on artworks from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that I approached The Louvre Museum, part
of a series of CD-ROMs titled Museums of the World for Kids,
without trepidation. After all, duplicating such spectacular
artworks in digital form and making it interesting to children
seems like a difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   But visiting the Louvre via a computer screen is, in the end,
rather pleasant and surprisingly humorous, even to those who are
children in spirit only. What lightens the viewing are dozens of
audio and visual pranks.
</P>
<P>
   The image of an anonymous 16th-century French painting titled
``Gabrielle d'Estrees and One of Her Sisters,'' which shows a woman
pinching the breast of another (a symbol of pregnancy, the text
explains), is accompanied by a voice that says, ``Ouch.''
</P>
<P>
   The artworks, nearly 150 in all, were chosen to appeal to a
young audience. The designers appear to have emptied the Louvre's
closets of every painting, statue and artifact that depicts a
marauding lion, dragon or elephant (accentuated with appropriate
snarling sound effects and gory textual narratives).
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the lion's enormous paws and Milo's screaming mouth!''
the text says about a Greek statue that shows a lion gnawing on an
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   But mixed with this safari are more subtle works (and subtle
audio special effects, like classical music), including some by
artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael. Many of the pieces
are obscure but interesting, like a crown worn by Louis XV, a
17th-century cloak and various Egyptian hieroglyphics.
</P>
<P>
   Through the interactive features of the Louvre program, users
can learn the basics of art history, like the dates when works were
created. Viewers can also get up to speed on geography since it
takes just one click on an icon to show each artwork's country of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly welcome feature is a Virtual Gallery in which art
is shown alongside a man and a child to give a sense of scale. Size
is overlooked in most books. Another useful tool allows viewers to
see selected areas of art up close and to turn some pieces around.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good idea, but it would be better without limitations on
where you could apply the magnifying glass. You cannot see most of
the back of the Greek statue ``Nike of Samothrace,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample opportunity for fun. Each artwork can be turned
into a virtual jigsaw puzzle, a game of connect-the-dots or a study
in ``find the detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM also includes a few pages about the history of the
Louvre itself, from its beginnings as a castle in the 13th century
to its transformation into a museum in 1793. For some perspective
of its interior, there is a three-minute film of a sprint through
some of its corridors and stairwells. &QL;

EX-BUREAUCRAT OFFERS HELP FOR HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - She might not have been a very good bureaucrat, but
when Sharon Shore started contracting with government agencies to
find housing for the homeless mentally ill, she became an excellent
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Shore, president and chief executive officer of Housing
Operations and Management Inc., or HOM Inc., has grown her Phoenix
business to the largest of its kind in the nation, serving more
than 1,600 clients in 900 Valley households.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that it could be done better in the private
sector,'' Shore said of her move from housing bureaucrat to
business owner. ``And this was the great experiment to see if it
would work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shore is the only Arizona finalist to be honored for general
excellence in the first national Bank One/``Working Woman''
Entrepreneurial Excellence Awards. The Ohio-based bank and the New
York-based magazine recognized nominees from a region encompassing
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming
during an event Friday at the Phoenician.
</P>
<P>
   The awards competition, designed to recognize female
entrepreneurs nationwide, attracted 1,300 nominations. In selecting
Shore and other finalists for general excellence, ``Working Woman''
editors looked for companies with good financial performance,
innovation and something that would make them role models for other
women and businesses, said Jill Hamburg Coplan, associate editor of
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   National winners will be announced in Miami in April.
</P>
<P>
   Shore's company helps mentally ill people get out of shelters
and off the streets and into decent, affordable rental housing.
Working under contracts with ValueOptions, the state's provider of
services to the mentally ill, and with the city of Phoenix, HOM
verifies clients' eligibility for benefits, helps subsidize their
rent and intercedes in any landlord-tenant issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clients are placed in privately owned rental properties around
the Valley, from multifamily apartment complexes to duplexes and
single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy business. Even if only 10 percent of HOM's
clients need help on a given day, that is 90 people with whom
Shore's employees must deal on issues ranging from drug problems to
panhandling and other unacceptable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty stressful, to be quite honest with you,'' Shore
said. ``We've had a lot of sad things, we've had suicides in the
units. . . . It can be pretty grueling dealing with this population
that's coming off the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   HOM has its successes, too. Some of Shore's clients have been in
their homes for four years, a milestone since ``stability for this
population is almost unheard-of,'' she said. One client even got on
track enough to get a job and buy her own home.
</P>
<P>
   Shore believes one of the keys to her business is showing
respect and dignity to clients. Newly placed residents get
``start-up boxes'' complete with towels, cleaning supplies, an
alarm clock and other items to help them settle in.
</P>
<P>
   She brought to the business her experience running a housing
authority in Casper, Wyo., turning it from a troubled agency into
one nationally honored as ``most improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shore, the daughter and granddaughter of Wyoming
restaurateurs who taught her the value of accountability and
customer service, says she never was a good bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I was able to accomplish that was by treating that
agency as if it was a small business, and looking at the bottom
line, and realizing that there were limited resources and making
the most out of the dollars we had,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Phoenix in 1990, worked for the Scottsdale Housing
Authority and started the business in 1994, using $9,000 borrowed
from her father to rent and furnish office space, design the
necessary paperwork forms and get the industry software HOM has
since modified to become state-of-the-art, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides HOM's general excellence, Bank One and ``Working Woman''
also recognized Shore for overcoming obstacles in her personal and
business lives.
</P>
<P>
   Married at 17, she left an abusive husband after six years and
two children. She got her introduction to the welfare-assistance
arena when she went to seek child-care help so she could look for a
job. She was offered a job instead, first in the local welfare
office and then at the housing authority, where she worked her way
up despite a lack of formal education in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Businesswise, Shore said, she had to overcome being
undercapitalized at a time when HOM had landed big contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of bit the bullet _ didn't take paychecks
ourselves, put the money back into the company, bought the software
so we could be more efficient and effective, worked seven days a
week, 10, 12 hours a day easily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are smaller, non-profit agencies competing with HOM for
contracts, but Shore says private enterprise still has an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can adapt and make changes as we go along. We don't have to
go back to a board of directors or a board of commissioners and
seek approval for changes in policies or procedures. We are able to
change on the fly if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Shore says she runs the business based on three principles:
provide the best service possible, empower the employees, and give
back to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra Williamson, HOM's accounting manager, calls Shore fair,
with high expectations and a commitment to keeping employees
informed about any changes ahead. Besides offering company-paid
health insurance and three weeks of ``personal time'' the first
year, Williamson has known Shore to cut checks to help out
employees distracted by financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will pretty much give the shirt off her back,'' Williamson
said.
</P>
<P>
   HOM now has 14 employees and $7.5 million in annual sales. Shore
says it will continue to grow, if only because mentally ill clients
rarely can afford good housing on their own. A one-bedroom
apartment with utilities in Phoenix rents for an average of nearly
$700 a month, but Social Security disability payments are only $474
a month, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees the company diversifying, helping private
developers negotiate the tax-credit maze involved with such
housing. And Shore would like to replicate the business in other
parts of the country dealing with the homeless mentally ill
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in this for the money,'' she said. ``We're not going
to get rich and make millions and millions. But it's a fun
business, it's a good concept, and it's a valuable service.'' &QL;

   THE ART HISTORIAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The Reindeer Co.; $70; Windows 3.1 and later, Mac 7.0 and
later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has taken a college art-history course, The Art
Historian may seem familiar. The combination of audio explanations
and digital slide shows reminded me of many hours spent in darkened
lecture halls listening to professors who taught art with varying
degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, this set of two CD-ROMs is designed to supplement
an introductory art-history course. People who are acquainted with
art only from strolls through museums can benefit from viewing the
works, which range from Neolithic cave paintings to Andy Warhol
silk-screens, but they might require some outside guidance to
appreciate fully the material presented here.
</P>
<P>
   The program's designers have divided the history of art into 25
major periods, providing an audio lecture for each. In explaining
the origins of Impressionism, for example, the speaker talks about
a new respect that artists of that era had for landscape painting
and the desire to focus more on contemporary subjects than on
scenes from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists delighted in a world of changing fashions and modern
conveniences such as train travel,'' the voice says as works by
Monet and Renoir flash on screen.
</P>
<P>
   While these introductions do a relatively good job of explaining
the basics, they tend to use too much art-history jargon. Few
people know what terms like zoomorphic interlace mean (it means
animal patterns), and since there is only the briefest glossary,
users must stop and refer to their own dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   For more detailed information, you can browse through an art
catalog. Each art period comes with about 50 images culled from
collections around the world. The artworks are all given a few
paragraphs of historical background and analysis. The writing in
this section suffers at times, as the lectures do, from the use of
stuffy words like mechanicomorphic (mechanical-looking).
</P>
<P>
   ``The colonnade has often been compared to the maternal arms
which reach out to draw people into the Mother Church,'' the text
said, in an unusually descriptive style for this CD-ROM, of the
plaza in front of St. Peter's cathedral in Rome, designed by
Bernini, the 17th-century sculptor and architect.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers might have their own interpretations or
observations, which can be typed in a feature called Notebook, to
be saved and called upon later. To help hammer the lessons home is
an area titled Self Test, where viewers can take a simulated exam
with essay and multiple-choice questions and digital flash cards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the disks' weaknesses is the relatively thin section
devoted to art from the turn of the century to the present. It
leaves out artists like Willem de Kooning and Edward Hopper and
stops altogether in the mid-1960s, ignoring artists like Donald
Judd and Christo.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this CD-ROM set does a commendable job of
highlighting art that does not come from Europe. Unlike the other
disks reviewed here, The Art Historian devotes entire sections to
works from Africa, Asia and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
   The artworks from Oceania _ masks, wood carvings, clothing _
give a good sense of the culture across the Pacific. And the text
provides ample anthropological information while conceding that
much about these artworks is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   While many viewers will find this CD-ROM set voluminous and
generally informative, others may feel left out of the loop.
Appreciating what it offers requires some familiarity with art, or
at least the guidance of a teacher and an appetite for serious
learning. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY THROUGH ART &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Zane Publishing; $99.99; Windows 3.1 and later, Mac 7.1 and
later.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is probably enough art in History Through Art, a set of 10
CD-ROMs, to fill an equal number of museums. Just going through a
few in one sitting is enough to leave a viewer bleary-eyed. In
addition to the thousands of images, the CD-ROMs also contain reams
of information about art styles and a surprising amount of history
about the periods in which the art was produced.
</P>
<P>
   Each CD-ROM presents about 30 minutes of running commentary
about a specific era, like ancient Rome, the Middle Ages or the
Renaissance. Between occasional musical serenades, viewers get an
eyeful of paintings, sculpture and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greek imagination was not fired up by huge dimensions such
as those of the Egyptian pyramids,'' an unidentified commentator
says when talking about the temples of the Athenian Acropolis.
``Rather, the Greeks took pride in painstaking refinements and
subtleties.''
</P>
<P>
   The artworks are discussed so methodically, even to the point of
dissecting the mathematical formula governing the design of a Greek
temple, for example, that some people may wish for quicker delivery
or at least some pizazz, like a film clip.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly effective are comparisons between similar artworks
from different periods. By looking at two Crucifixions, one by an
anonymous artist in the 13th century and the other by Donatello in
1412, for example, you can see how later sculptors carved figures
with greater attention to three-dimensional space.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROMs do a commendable job of showing how the new
attention of the Renaissance to science, anatomy and perspective
was incorporated into art. For example, viewers are shown close-ups
of images of plants from a painting by Botticelli. In that artist's
hands, the plants are highly realistic; in an earlier period, they
would have probably been far more simply rendered or not included
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The disks also include thorough discussions of historical
influences. For example, viewers are shown how the figure of the
emperor became more prominent in friezes during the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of reference material, these disks overwhelm the
others. When viewers come across an unfamiliar word, they can stop
to look in a digital encyclopedia that contains hundreds of
entries.
</P>
<P>
   One minor irritation during the presentation is that some
artworks are identified by title alone. To find out the creator of
a particular work, you must click on an information icon.
</P>
<P>
   The size of History Through Art and the attention to detail can
make using it a plodding exercise at times. But these attributes
also mean that the disks can be used many times without seeming
redundant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So much depends on the proper typing of a string of
abbreviations, interrupted by an (AT). Business deals, jobs,
romantic affairs: the fates of them all can rise or fall on a
single typo.
</P>
<P>
   And so much depends as well on the person who receives the
messages intended for you, your electronic doppelganger. If your
correspondent types ``Lyn'' instead of ``Lynn,'' or ``Kelly''
instead of ``Kelley,'' what happens? Is the person who gets your
mail one of those samaritans who quickly forwards misdirected
e-mail, or are the messages instead relegated to the trash bin?
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, is the recipient of errant missives an evil twin,
sending messages intended for you on to where they can do the most
harm? The fast, faceless nature of online communication can make
for strange relationships between people who have so much in common
in the mail server's eyes (if no one else's).
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martin, who writes the ``Miss Manners'' syndicated column
and books on etiquette, has two-part advice for the gentle reader
of uninvited e-mail: ``The first part is very easy to do, and the
second is extremely difficult. The first is to send the e-mail
where it belongs, or back where it came from, and you can return it
with one keystroke. The difficult part is to pretend you didn't
read it. If you know the people, that includes not acting on the
information, or pretending you don't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Misdirected messages are easy to respond to and easy to build
relationships from, said Dr. Malcolm Parks, an Internet researcher
in the University of Washington's department of speech
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person can handle it without seeming too rude or nosy,''
Parks said, ``like, `Gee, I got this message about fishing in
Alaska, I think it was addressed to the other Mac Parks, but you
know I just got back from a trip like that.' It makes e-mail
miscommunications a more powerful social connector.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, incidentally, is no stranger to misaddressed mail. A
hundred years ago, in rural Minnesota, he said,
``Great-great-granddaddy Park got mad about getting mail for the
other Park families in the neighborhood so he tacked on an `s' to
our name.''
</P>
<P>
   The annals of misdirected mail also include people like Greg
Marcotte and Ed Marcotte, who met through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   They are not related, though Ed Marcotte sometimes tells people
they are brothers because it's simpler than the truth. They have
worked together for the past 10 years at three different companies,
and Ed got his current job partly because he never acted on
information that came across his screen that was intended for Greg
Marcotte, like stock option agreements and compensation information
from the payroll department.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Marcotte is a founder of Altiga Networks, a virtual private
networking company in Franklin, Mass., and its vice president of
marketing. He and Ed Marcotte first met at another company when a
headhunter sent e-mail to Greg that was intended for Ed, and Greg
looked up Ed in the phone book to pass it along.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg founded Altiga, he said, he had no choice but to hire
Ed as the company's principal quality assurance engineer. Who else
would be qualified to go through his e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy,'' Greg Marcotte said. ``He never did
anything with it.''
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail twin gave a moment's pause to Howard Rheingold, author
of ``The Virtual Community.'' Rheingold said he thought that the
proper thing to do if you receive e-mail intended for someone else
was to send it to that person. He found himself in such a position
with someone whose e-mail address was one letter different from his
and who was making purchases at Ebay.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you a little paranoid when you get messages that
start, `Congratulations, you have bought,' '' Rheingold said.
``It's like maybe someone's sending pizzas to your house. I
forwarded it to the other guy and never heard back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the view from someone else's In box gives insight
about the variety of work done in large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Gross worked in public relations for QVC, the online
merchant, before there was a Gross by any other first name there.
But when Linda Gross joined, the two women shared an e-mail address
for a while. Even after Linda got her own address, they still
received each other's e-mail but would forward it to the intended
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to see jokes you may not consider to be funny,''
Leslie Gross said, ``or plans for the weekend that perhaps you
didn't need to know. It's quite an invasion of privacy.'' She and
Linda Gross have never met face to face, though, in a company of
2,000 employees, Leslie is certain that Linda works within walking
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I know her,'' she said. ``I've even learned parts
of her business as a result of getting her e-mails. Gosh, if you
shared e-mail addresses for a day, it would be a good internal
buddy program.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the results of misdirected messages can be
startling, as when bad e-mail happens to good people.
</P>
<P>
   When Tim Boulay, a spokesman for Clark University in Worcester,
Mass., met Julia Holtsclaw in Germany a couple of years ago, he did
not know that she had an e-mail twin. When he got back home to New
England, he sent off a mushy note to jholtsclaw(AT)iu.edu,
reminiscing about ``walking through Stuttgart after dark,''
daydreaming about ``apple-picking in central Massachusetts.'' He
signed off with, ``Can I coerce you to fly out?''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he got an irate reply, in capital letters, from
Jholtsclaw at Indiana University, threatening to fly east for
unfriendly purposes. It turned out that Julia's cousin, Jarrod
Holtsclaw, a student at the same school, had been mistakenly wooed
on line by men. Boulay eventually got his beloved's proper e-mail
address, courted her electronically for a year and married her.
They are expecting their second child.

PEANUTS, CORN CAKE AND A GERMAN TREAT
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First order of the day is a question about roasting whole
peanuts at home.
</P>
<P>
   A reader writes: ``I tried to roast peanuts in the shell last
week. I roasted them at 300 degrees for 20 minutes and added 1/4
cup salt to the peanuts. The nuts were fine, but there was not a
trace of salty flavor. How do manufacturers manage to get salty
roasted peanuts?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the answer is one of those mysteries of food production.
According to Betsy Owens, executive director of Virginia Carolina
Peanut Promotions, this is something you should not try at home.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers use a pressure process that can't be duplicated in
the home kitchen. First the peanuts (in shell) are washed in a
detergent. Then, a supersalty water solution is forced through the
shells and nuts in a pressure chamber. Then the nuts are
dry-roasted (to get rid of any residual water) in a large hopper
much like a household clothes dryer. If you'd like more information
about peanuts, along with some recipes, find it at
www.aboutpeanuts.com.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mesa fave: Vanessa Dykstra e-mails from Colorado looking
for a Texas recipe. She'd like to try her hand at the corn cake
served at Blue Mesa restaurant in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Liz Baron says this is the most-requested recipe from the
New Mexico-themed restaurant's menu. This popular dish is really
more a pudding than a cake. Serve a scoop of it freshly steamed, as
it loses its light, fluffy consistency when reheated in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to making great corn cake is in the steaming.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE MESA'S SWEET CORN CAKE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12
</P>
<P>
   Corn husks, enough to line and cover a 3-quart steamer basket in
a double layer
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable shortening, such as Crisco
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1 cup masa harina
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   1 pound corn, fresh and cut off the cob, or frozen and thawed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Soak corn husks in hot water for 30 minutes or until pliable.
Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Place shortening and butter in mixing bowl and beat on medium
speed until mixture becomes fluffy and creamy. Add masa and mix on
low speed for about 2 minutes. Add water and mix well on medium
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Grind corn coarsely in food processor.
</P>
<P>
   In large mixing bowl, combine cornmeal, sugar, heavy cream,
baking powder and salt. Add masa mixture and ground corn and mix
well.
</P>
<P>
   To steam corn cake, line steamer basket with softened corn
husks. Fill with corn cake batter. Cover with more corn husks and a
tea towel to absorb moisture. Steam on the stove for about 2 1/2
hours. Batter should not stick to husks when corn cake is done. If
it does, it needs to steam longer.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can improvise a steamer by placing a rack on cans in a
large stock pot or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid.

   SOMETHING SLIGHTLY SWEET: A reader writes, looking for a recipe
for kugelhopf, the cake/bread popular in Germanic Europe. This
recipe recently ran in The New York Times and was written by Mimi
Sheraton, who claims to have found the perfect kugelhopf in Alsace
_ that lovely region of France that can't quite decide whether it's
French or German.
</P>
<P>
   ALSATIAN KUGELHOPF
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup warm milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 envelopes yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups flour, plus more for kneading and yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup kirsch, mirabelle or water
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup raisins _ golden, black or a combination
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 blanched almonds
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1/3 cup warm milk, 1 tablespoon sugar, salt, yeast and 2
tablespoons flour in a bowl, and mix with fork to make a paste.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in volume,
about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Warm kirsch, mirabelle or water slightly and pour over raisins
in another bowl. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In still another bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups sifted flour, the
remaining sugar, milk and eggs with yeast paste. Mix to make a
soft, elastic, slightly sticky mass, adding more flour (no more
than 1/2 cup) or milk as needed. Using wooden spoon or fingertips,
work in all but 2 tablespoons butter.
</P>
<P>
   Turn dough out onto a lightly floured counter top and knead
vigorously, lifting and slamming dough down seven or eight times,
until smooth and elastic. Strain raisins though a sieve, reserving
liquid, and work into dough along with liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Spread remaining butter generously around the sides and bottom
and into the crevices of an 8-inch kugelhopf mold, preferably
glazed earthenware. Arrange almonds in indentations in bottom of
mold. Gently shape dough into a roll 10 or 12 inches long; arrange
in a circle in mold. Tap mold down firmly on counter top so dough
settles evenly. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until dough
doubles and is level with rim of mold, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 450 degrees. Place mold on center rack and bake 10
minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees and bake 40 to 45 minutes, until
kugelhopf shrinks slightly away from sides and a slim knife or
skewer inserted in cake comes out clean and dry. Cool in mold 5
minutes, then turn out onto a rack and cool at least 4 hours before
cutting. For best flavor, do not cut for 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dust liberally with confectioners' sugar just before slicing.

 UNDATED: second child.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another case involving Cupid and the computer, Rob Van Slyke,
sponsorship coordinator for the Year 2000 Information Center in
Texas, received something along the lines of the following in his
e-mail In box from a media buyer, dated late one Friday night after
he had helped her close a deal: ``Hey, babe! Thanks for all the
help this morning. You're the best. Hugs and kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Slightly perplexed at the warmth of the tone, he shot back:
``You're welcome, Honey! It's great to feel appreciated. I look
forward to our next encounter. Hugs and kisses.'' The media buyer's
fiance's name was Rob, and she had been slightly careless when
using her address book. The fiance had been wondering why he hadn't
heard from her that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Petersen, an etiquette and protocol consultant at
Leadership Skills in Vancouver, Wash., said the proper way to
handle e-mail that had lost its way was to return it to its sender.
She advised against trying to figure out the proper recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go that far to make the assumption, even though you
could be 99 percent sure,'' she said. ``Return it to the person who
sent it because he or she needs the correct address anyway, and
you're getting involved in areas that are not your business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the peculiar, troubled relationship between two other e-mail
twins _ www.acsh.org and www.asch.org _ lies a tale of intrigue,
complete with fake e-mails sent from phony addresses to bait an
adversary, longstanding hard feelings, threats to sue and even a
duped reporter or two.
</P>
<P>
   It all started innocently enough, when Marc Asch, a former
Minnesota state legislator, started receiving e-mail intended for
the American Council on Science and Health, or ACSH, a conservative
consumer advocacy group. At first, Asch said, he forwarded the
messages to the organization, which thanked him for the courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   But one e-mail message meant for ACSH never arrived there. It
contained information about Lois Gibbs, an environmental advocate
whom Jeff Stier, associate director of ACSH, was scheduled to
debate. Seems Asch had read the e-mail and forwarded it to Ms.
Gibbs, Asch said. Then, during a radio interview, she accused ACSH
of digging up dirt on her.
</P>
<P>
   Surmising what had happened, Stier said, he set a trap, sending
a fake e-mail message that he suspected Asch would misdirect. He
hoped once Asch saw that some misdirected messages were fake, he
would stop forwarding them to others. Stier created ``prcrew,'' an
address at American Online, and ``misdirected'' an e-mail from that
address to himself at asch.org.
</P>
<P>
   The message alluded to a conference that P.R. Crew would be
running for ACSH, ``exposing the lies and deception'' behind one of
the group's adversaries, the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Stier sat back and waited. All of 30 minutes. Then the center's
press secretary called, looking for more details. Stier put her
off. Reporters called for more information. ``The day before the
alleged press conference, I said enough already,'' Stier said
recently, ``and called up all the reporters, and said there is no
press conference, I never put out such a press release, it's
obviously not credible, it's obviously coming from that group we
don't get along with. Some believed that I was playing a mean joke,
but what I was doing was counterintelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Asch offered to have his Internet service provider forward the
mail for $10 to $15 a month. He said ACSH later threatened to sue
his provider if it didn't set up a program to block mail to Asch's
account that was intended for ACSH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily my ISP is made of somewhat sterner stuff,'' he said.
``If you're getting misdirected e-mail, it's not my
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asch-ACSH confusion proves another e-mail maxim. ``Don't put
anything in it you don't want the whole world to see,'' Mrs. Martin
said. ``We all have such faith in the honor system and the sealed
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps improvements in technology will somehow make such
stories obsolete. The days of shared e-mail addresses are gone, and
the Marcottes, for two, are glad to be rid of the e-mail program
they used at one office, which would call up a suggested address
after the sender typed in only a few letters of the address.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Marcotte's name would pop up first, so he would get mail
intended for Greg Marcotte. ``Now the package we use here is
Outlook, which will ask which one you mean,'' Ed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mail packages have gotten a little better over the
years,'' Greg noted.
</P>
<P>
   But even with improvements in the technology, it will take time
for the etiquette of electronic communication to take hold, Mrs.
Martin said. ``E-mail is certainly more prone to being seen by more
people than the recipient, but in hundreds of ways it's easier to
send and write so people spend less time thinking about it,'' she
said. ``The potential for accidents, impetuous mistakes and
carelessness is enormous. It's not a private means of
communication.''

HANGING ONTO YOUTH BY SOME SIZE-5 THREADS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the end of an era. This is my swan song to youth. This
is the day that I've dreaded since my high school principal handed
me my diploma and said, ``Welcome to the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The real world stinks.
</P>
<P>
   How much more can I bear? I've given up so much already in my
efforts to be a good wife, a good mother and a productive citizen.
I've already given up short shorts and miniskirts. I've stopped
going to happy hour after work. I drive the posted speed limit
(most of the time) with my seat belt on (all of the time.) I eat
vegetables that I don't even like. And, really, with all the
advances in genetic engineering, can't they make lettuce have some
sort of flavor? Forget the speckled rose; give us Brussels sprouts
that taste like chocolate or strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the point is that I've made a lot of sacrifices in my
efforts to transform my baser pediatric nature into grown-up
material. But now a demand is being made of me that I simply cannot
accept. Not this. Not now.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with my annual clearing out of the closets.
Following the tradition of my mother, I scour the clothes vaults in
our home diligently seeking out torn, faded, outdated clothing,
which I then pass on to my youngest child. No, not really. Well,
not the badly torn stuff. The kid's gotta have some play clothes,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's pretty easy to figure out which items the
children need to part with, and as long as I do it while they're
away _ no problem. The problem comes with my husband and me. He
wants to keep that Super Fly collar, psychedelic shirt until it
comes back into style, and I want to keep my button-fly bluejeans
until they fit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen,'' he says skeptically as I remove
my jeans from the pile designated for Goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen sooner than that shirt sees the light of
day,'' I retort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't you just accept that you're not a size 5 anymore and
throw those jeans away?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is baby fat. I just had a child recently, and soon I'm
going to lose this extra weight and my feet are going to return to
their original size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your baby is 9 years old, and we're not even going to discuss
your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   He just doesn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   Those jeans are my last link to the carefree, washboard-stomach
days of my youth. If I give up the jeans, I'm admitting that I'll
never again eat pancakes at three in the morning and not get
indigestion. Worse than that even, I'll be resigning myself to
shopping only in the women's department, where they don't play
videos and all the mannequins look as if they just had a plate of
dry lettuce for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I say. ``I can't do it. I won't give up the jeans. I'm
not saying that they won't get dusty again before I can wear them,
but I promise you, I'll wear these jeans before you wear that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband disappears into the other room and comes back a
moment later carrying a fashion magazine. Inside is a young male
model dancing under a marquee that says ``The Color of Success''
and wearing a shirt that looks remarkably like my spouse's.
</P>
<P>
   I smile in defeat, and then I put my jeans back into the closet.
I don't care. I'm not giving up on those jeans _ not yet anyway.

THE DOPPELGANGER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)  (Eds: Please note the word (AT) should be replaced by the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was blessed with the kindest of cybersisters, and though I
have never met her, I have frequently imagined her. Wrongly, as it
turns out.
</P>
<P>
   My America Online address is Tinakelley(AT)ol.com, but
unfortunately, many people forget the last ``e'' that gives my
surname its symmetry and send messages to Tinakelly(AT)aol.com. The
recipient is a long-suffering woman who forwards them to me. I
thought we were siblings separated at birth by one letter.
</P>
<P>
   She has forwarded press releases about Internet commerce from
orthographically challenged public relations people, friendly notes
from old sources, even an invitation for a second date that never
happened. If she was behind in her forwarding, she would apologize.
The saint.
</P>
<P>
   Once, she forwarded a message to me that had been sent by
someone I had called for a related article; he was writing a
message to Kevin Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine. The
sender, who was thanking Kelly for a favorable blurb about a book,
is married to someone named Tina, and later explained that he put
my misspelled e-mail address in the blind-carbon-copy line, where
he had intended to put his wife's address. So it went to KevinKelly
and Tinakelly, and then to me.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I received an unfamiliar piece of e-mail, I thought it
would give me clues about my doppelganger. I thought she had an
Aunt Carrie who wrote a long, cheery missive about getting together
and decorating greeting cards with rubber stamps.
</P>
<P>
   But when I forwarded this to Tinakelly, she returned it because
she didn't know Aunt Carrie. So I notified Aunt Carrie, who sent me
a perky thank you, signing it with ``Love.''
</P>
<P>
   I have been cc'd into the e-mail exchange between Pops and his
daughter about her forthcoming wedding and her sisters' adverse
reactions and the cost of the reception hall. I sent e-mail to Pops
and the other person cc'd on the messages, explaining that I was
not who they thought. The messages keep arriving. Hope the flowers
turn out OK
</P>
<P>
   I worried that Tinakelly would become fed up with me, especially
whenever I sent out Internet queries for stories that garnered
numerous sloppy responses. I spell my e-mail address carefully
whenever I give it out, explaining about the very patient woman in
South Carolina (I had imagined her there, in a house under the
kudzu, decorating cards) who might very well be cursing my
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I sent the other Tina an e-mail message asking for an
interview and waited, with some degree of excitement. Someone named
Carrie Sevcik wrote back, saying that she was Tina's assistant at a
company named Kelly's, in Illinois, no less. Ms. Sevcik checks the
e-mail received at her boss' old e-mail accounts, ones with names
that are no longer in use.
</P>
<P>
   Tinakelly(AT)aol.com is one of those stagnant accounts. Ms.
Sevcik figured out my real identity because someone had spelled my
name correctly in the body of a message intended for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought forwarding your mail was the right thing to do,''
she wrote. She even apologized for reading the messages, then
offered to close the Tinakelly account so people would know
immediately that the mail hadn't reached me.
</P>
<P>
   But since there is already a Tinakelly2(AT)aol.com, and there
may be more Tinakellys to come, I worry that some new owner of the
name might not be the good sport that Carrie-Tina has been. I
thanked her, once again, but asked if she wouldn't mind if we stuck
together for the duration.

ABUNDANCE OF CHOICES COMPLICATES ONCE-SIMPLE ACT OF BUYING A
PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va., Mich., Ind., Calif., Wash., Texas, N.J.)   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888)
346-9867.)  
 (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's true that choice can be a curse, then curses are raining
down on consumers these days as they go to Best Buy and Circuit
City to purchase what used to be the most elementary of
instruments: a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when one telephone and one phone number
satisfied a family's communications needs. Not only are most
American households besotted with telephones, but more and more
families are living among a tangle of phone lines and a confusion
of services from phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a phone these days that doubles as a clock radio or
tells you who is calling. You can spend $9.99 on a no-frills phone:
it rings, you pick it up. Or you can spend $249.99 on a two-line
cordless speakerphone, with an intercom, that is equipped for
caller ID and has a built-in answering machine and headset jack, a
flash button for call waiting plus keys for speed dialing, mute,
hold, redial and page. The choice, as they say, is yours.
</P>
<P>
   The options may seem overwhelming and the expense daunting. But
if you plan carefully, you can purchase a setup that will mimic
many of the features of sophisticated office phones without costing
a fortune. That system will include a set of phones, with and
without cords, that are designed to work well with a host of
advanced services from the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   And as the cost of cellular phone calls falls more into line
with that of traditional phone calls _ a trend accelerated by
Wednesday's announcement by AT&AMP;T that it would offer a flat rate of
10 cents per minute for all types of calls _ home phone systems are
likely to become even more of a mix-and-match operation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the year of the cordless phone. For the first
time, sales of cordless phones outstripped those of phones with
cords, according to the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association in Arlington, Va. A survey by the Polk Co., a research
firm in Southfield, Mich., found that consumers spent 26 percent
more from June 1997 to June 1998 on cordless phones with built-in
answering machines compared with the previous year, and decreased
what they spent on phones with cords by nearly as much.
</P>
<P>
   Cordless phones use radio waves to transfer voice signals
between a handset and the phone's base. The most innovative
cordless phones in the past couple of years have been digital units
that transmit at 900 megahertz, a vast improvement in clarity,
range and security over transmissions at 43 to 49 MHz, the range
for more inexpensive analog phones, because the 900-MHz range is
less crowded.
</P>
<P>
   The 900-MHz phones are less likely to encounter interference
from baby monitors or garage-door openers. But just when people had
acquainted themselves with 900-MHz phones, a new class of cordless
phones hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   In September, with advertisements promising to let you walk ``a
country mile'' while talking on your cordless telephone, Panasonic
began selling a 2.4-gigahertz model.
</P>
<P>
   By operating at 2.4 gigahertz, a little-used part of the radio
spectrum, these phones promised still more clarity and range. Like
many 900-MHz phones, they use something called digital
spread-spectrum technology, which provides protection from
eavesdropping. Siemens has followed suit with a 2.4-gigahertz
phone, and other manufacturers are also planning 2.4-gigahertz
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Can you really go a mile _ country or otherwise _ with a
2.4-gigahertz phone? John McNenney, a national marketing manager at
Panasonic, said it was difficult to predict a phone's range.
``Range can vary depending on atmospheric conditions,'' he said.
``I've even seen people get better range in the morning than in the
afternoon.'' A ``country mile,'' McNenney said, is a figure of
speech. ``It means `down the road a piece.' It doesn't mean
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Drake, who helps her husband in his computer
consultancy in Escondido, Calif., went down her driveway a fair
piece after buying the Panasonic phone last December and reported a
noticeable improvement over her 10-year-old analog phone, which
would conk out when she stepped a room away from its base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was testing as far away as our neighbors', about 200 feet
away and through a 10-foot retaining wall,'' Ms. Drake said. ``I
decided to turn back only because I was out there wearing huge red
Tickle Me Elmo slippers and felt silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of Panasonic's competitors say Ms. Drake would have
been just as well off with a 900-MHz phone. Because the Panasonic
phone still uses 900 MHz for half its transmissions, they say, the
new phone has yet to prove that it gives users more clarity and
range than what's already out there.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, a leading manufacturer of cordless phones, has no
immediate plans to sell a 2.4-gigahertz phone. Tim Baxter, Sony's
vice president for residential telecommunications marketing, said
the company had performed informal tests on a football field, using
both a 900-MHz phone and the Panasonic 2.4-gigahertz phone.
</P>
<P>
   The signals for both phones dropped off at exactly the same
place, Baxter said. A more formal, independent test performed by
Indesign, an engineering design business in Indianapolis, came up
with similar findings. ``What gives you the range more than
anything is the power output,'' Baxter said, ``and the amount of
wattage you can put on a phone is regulated by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the business of buying a phone is not a
simple one, McNenney recommended that consumers approach the
purchase of a new phone as they would a meal off a Chinese menu,
often a process of mixing and matching. ``First think about whether
you want corded or cordless, or a combination,'' he said. ``You
have to think about what you're going to use it for.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the phones have cords or not, manufacturers are
increasingly producing telephones that are designed to work with
digital services from the phone companies. In some parts of the
country, like Texas, one in every two households has Caller ID.
Still more have call waiting. And a new service available in
several states called Call Waiting ID (or similar names) combines
the two services.
</P>
<P>
   The combined service displays the identification of a second
caller while a person is already on the phone to someone else. Some
phone companies go one step further _ they give the customer a set
of options for handling an incoming call. Southwestern Bell, for
instance, lets customers add the new caller to a conversation,
making it a three-way call, or send the caller to the phone
company's voice-messaging service.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Call Waiting ID offered by Southwestern Bell can also send
an automated announcement to the new caller that says, ``The caller
you are trying to reach is currently unavailable or not accepting
calls; please hang up and call back later,'' or, ``Please hold, the
person you are trying to reach is currently on another call and
will be with you shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of phones are now being manufactured with these services
in mind,'' said Tod Freeman, a spokesman for Sony Electronics in
Park Ridge, N.J. One of the most popular cordless phones on the
market these days is the 900-MHz Sony SPP-SS965, which has a caller
ID screen on both the base and the handset.
</P>
<P>
   The phone also has Jog Dial, a feature borrowed from cellular
phones that offers quick access to directory and caller ID
information, stored by name and number. A dial on the side of the
phone calls up the information, and a push of the dial connects the
call.
</P>
<P>
   Another new service now available from Southwestern Bell and
others is a Caller ID feature that flashes information about
incoming calls on your television. The price of the service, like
Caller ID itself, is about $7 a month, and the extra equipment to
make it work is a flat $69.
</P>
<P>
   ``That service is very popular with sports fans,'' said B.J.
Mamuzic, a marketing director for Southwestern Bell. ``That's a
screen that's always on for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell, both
owned by SBC Communications, will introduce a service called
Internet Caller ID, which will cost about $5 per month. Customers
who are on line will see on their computer screens who is trying to
get through on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this year, both companies will also introduce a service
that will allow customers to send e-mail over the phone by using a
small keyboard with a fold-out screen that plugs into the phone.
The device will sell for $160, but no price has yet been put on the
service.
</P>
<P>
   A family's phone setup is often dictated by its younger members,
and that can mean additional lines. A second line is commonplace.
If Internet use is high, third and fourth lines are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lucas, a public relations executive in Seattle, caved in
last year on the extra-line question when her 15-year-old daughter,
Julia Talley, was upsetting the rest of the family with frequent,
protracted calls. ``She got 10 calls a night from her friends to do
the debrief of the day,'' Ms. Lucas said. ``It's how they process
all their angst.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lucas was reluctant to have a second line installed. ``When
I was growing up, a second phone line was always the rich people's
MO,'' she said. ``It was a real leap in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Lucas made a deal with her daughter. ``I told
her that if she improved her math grades, we'd get her her own
line.'' The grades improved, the second line arrived last June, and
the entire family is happier. ``It's been great,'' Ms. Lucas said.
``She just goes in the room and shuts the door and as long as she
gets her work done, I don't care how long she talks.'' The second
line also serves Jordan Talley, her 17-year old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The give-and-take playing itself out across America in
households with teen-agers is not lost on the phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer our services packaged into combinations that have
proved to work for various family profiles,'' said James Smith, a
spokesman at Bell Atlantic. ``A home with teens needs additional
lines, voice mail with multiple mailboxes, distinctive ringing so
people know whom the call is for, or Call Waiting Caller ID for the
same purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said service representatives at Bell Atlantic had been
trained to guide customers through their choices, by first asking a
set of questions, then establishing a profile of a family and
recommending services accordingly. Other phone companies have
adopted similar approaches to selling residential services. ``The
telcos can't just be order takers anymore,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a place for telephones with cords. For one thing,
they are less expensive than their cordless brethren. And a phone
with a cord has more room for buttons and displays. Many of them
now have buttons corresponding to features offered by the phone
company, like Call Return or ``star 69,'' which gives you the
number of the last caller so a missed call can be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, for instance, sells telephones with cords that
support its Identa-Ring distinctive ringing service, three-way
calling and repeat call, call return, call forward and call
blocking functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've found to work really well is to sell the phone and
the service together,'' said Ms. Mamuzic, of Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Among phones with cords, a popular model is the three-line
General Electric Pro Series Speakerphone, for $99. The phone has 32
programmable buttons and an LCD readout that tells you the number
that was called last and how long the conversation lasted. The
two-line version is $49.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Lucas has resisted buying snazzy phones for
her teen-agers' rooms; they are both equipped with $10 phones from
Target. And she said her daughters had no desire for a cordless
phone because ``they don't want to talk in front of anyone but the
four walls.''

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Being painted from chin to shin with a seaweed mask or
soaking in a swirling mud bath may seem decadent to some _ maybe
even disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Disrobing so a professional masseur or masseuse can rub the
aches, pains and kinks from tense muscles may even elicit the
cliche, ``But I'm too fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing to carve out downtime for yourself _ after attending to
the kids, the boss, the unavoidable nightly need to fix dinner and
an endless honey-do list _ can seem impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Poor excuses _ every one _ for not partaking of the myriad of
pampering spa services offered in the Phoenix area. Designed to
rejuvenate the skin, relax tense muscles and reduce stress, spa
treatment can have delightful therapeutic benefits _ for both the
body and the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stress is the No. 1 reason why people go to spas and why the
day spa industry is growing,'' says Stephanie Matolyak, a
spokeswoman for Spa Finders _ an international spa travel and
reservations company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a fast-paced information-highway society. Day spas
are a rest stop along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   By definition, a ``day spa'' does not involve an overnight
visit. An investment of only a few hours and less than $100 will
buy a good deal of therapeutic R&AMP;R. Compared with other ``special
day'' activities _ a round of golf, dinner for two at a swank
restaurant, tickets to a major concert _ a stint at the spa begins
to look relatively affordable. The residual benefits of, say, a
massage and facial may last longer than a gourmet meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spa experience should be the atmosphere, the smells and
then the warm hands of the therapist who is giving you a caring
therapeutic touch,'' explained Jana Bru, co-owner of J's Day Spa in
Chandler, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things are just going to take you away. Regardless
of how tense or stressed out you are, eventually, it's going to
chill you out. Most people fall asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a spa, deciding on specific treatments and maximizing
your spa dollars need not be a hassle. Knowing in advance what you
may encounter at any given spa can also make the overall experience
more enjoyable. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Where to go
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Day spas in the Valley of the Sun are plentiful. Conveniently
situated in neighborhood strip malls, local department stores,
resort hotels and beauty salons, they offer nearly any treatment
you can imagine at prices that range from moderate to expensive. By
no means are day-spa treatments inexpensive, so shopping around can
save you some money. The price of a one-hour massage, for example,
ranges from about $50 to $85.
</P>
<P>
   Experts suggest stopping into a spa establishment before making
an appointment. Ask for a quick tour. Decide whether it is an
environment in which you could relax. Pick up a brochure _ which
will list a menu of services and prices. Don't hesitate to ask
about any treatments you don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have bad spa experiences because somebody buys
them a gift certificate to a place they are not comfortable in _ so
they feel intimidated,'' Matolyak said. ``Then they lie on the
table, and somebody is pressing too hard or doing something to them
that they don't understand _ or they don't like. They don't say
anything. They leave, and they say they will never go to a spa
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Communicate your comfort level, advises Anna Marie Prassa, owner
of the Natural Spa at Stress Busters in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are getting a body wrap and you're cold, say something.
If you are getting a massage and the therapist goes too deep or not
deep enough, say something.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
What's what
</P>
<P>
   {
</P>
<P>
   Deciding on a treatment or a package of treatments can be
overwhelming. Keep in mind that services tend to fall into five
basic categories _ massage, body treatments, hydrotherapy, facials
and nail services. Here are a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   - Health experts recommend undergoing just one heat-intensive
spa treatment per day. Folks with high blood pressure should check
with their physicians before of any heat-intensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   - A popular spa combo is to schedule a skin-smoothing body
treatment, such as an all-over salt scrub or body mud mask,
followed by a full-body massage.
</P>
<P>
   - Clients choosing these services need not disrobe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Baring it all
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A common question asked by novice spagoers is: ``Do I have to
take off all my clothing?''
</P>
<P>
   Because full-body massages and all-over body treatments include
the application of oils, muds, salts and lotions, clients typically
disrobe entirely. Leaving on undergarments or wearing a bathing
suit is not unheard-of _ nor frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely during spa treatments is a client entirely exposed.
Throughout a massage or body treatment, you'll be draped with a
towel or sheet _ discreetly covering any areas of the body not
involved in the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At the point when you need to turn over onto your back, the
therapist typically holds the sheet up, blocking his or her own
view.
</P>
<P>
   If it's important for you to have a female or a male therapist,
be sure to make this request when you schedule your appointment. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Who's watching
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is good news and there is bad news when it comes to the
official overseeing of day spas.
</P>
<P>
   By law, day spas must be licensed by the Arizona Board of
Cosmetology. So must the individuals at these establishments who
attend to your skin, hair or nails. Massage therapists do not fall
under the state's jurisdiction. Cities and counties oversee the
certification of these therapeutic muscle manipulators.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that routine inspections of day spas are not a
high priority for the state's licensing agency. With a staff of
some 17 people and more than 50,000 licensees to govern, the agency
spends the bulk of its staff time investigating and responding to
specific complaints, says Sue Sansom, executive director of the
state board.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? You need to be an inquisitive and involved spa
patron. Ask whether the person about to give you a facial or a body
scrub is a licensed aesthetician or cosmetologist. Informing that
same person of any skin allergies you have also is important.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom was quick to confirm that there are loads of wonderful
spa services being safely and sanitarily offered in the Valley. She
noted, however, that it is ``appropriate for people to ask how
(spa) implements are disinfected and cared for.''
</P>
<P>
   A loofah sponge, for example, should not be used on more than
one client. Fresh sheets should be laid out on the massage table
for each customer. Hydrotherapy tubs and facial implements should
be disinfected after every use.
</P>
<P>
   Should you have a health or safety concern with a specific spa
or one of its staff, you can file a complaint with the state board.
If it is simply a case of poor service, Sansom advises talking with
the spa's manager in an attempt to resolve the issue rather than
filing an official complaint. &QL;

   &UR; Winter Color &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a memoir of growing up in England in the 1880s, there is a
description of an early-blooming shrub with mauve and yellow
blossoms that is called chimonanthus (wintersweet). Could you tell
me if this plant is available in the United States and whether it
would do well in central Connecticut?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is and it wouldn't. Chimonanthus praecox, fragrant
wintersweet, is available in the United States, but if you want
shrubs that are colorful early in the season in Connecticut, you
will have to depend on something other than flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Wintersweet is probably the earliest blooming shrub. Its
translucent, waxy flowers, pale yellow with purplish centers, begin
opening in December or January, long before the leaves on this 8-
to 10-foot shrub emerge. But that's only in the southern sections
of United States Department of Agriculture Zone 7 _ most of Long
Island and southern New Jersey _ and warmer areas. And just to rub
it in a bit, the fragrance, very unusual in an early winter bloom,
is a delicious lemony-spice.
</P>
<P>
   Winter color is certainly possible in colder areas, but it is
found in stems, not flowers. Two groups that offer a range of
interesting forms and colors are the shrubby dogwoods and the
willows. Among the dogwoods, stem colors include chartreuse (Cornus
stolonifera Falviramea), orange (C. sanguinea Winter Beauty) and
bright red (C. stolonifera Cardinal). Willows offer an even wider
variety of stem colors, including a warm orange-red (Salix alba
Chermesina), purplish (S. purpurea) and wine-black (S.
melanostachys).
</P>
<P>
   In general, stems become less vibrant after they are three years
old, so regular removal of the oldest ones will keep the shrub
producing colorful new stems.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for wintersweet include Greer Gardens, 1280 Goodpasture
Island Road, Eugene, Ore. 97401, (541) 686-8266, catalog $3, and
Fairweather Gardens, P.O. Box 330, Greenwich, N.J. 08323, (609)
451-6261, catalog $3.

43d St., New York 10036, or by e-mail to

COMMON SPA TERMS, TREATMENTS, THERAPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE M. SPITZA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Don't sweat over the unfamiliar terminology used in
day-spa brochures or by spa personnel. Here are some of the more
common terms, treatments and therapies you will encounter: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aromatherapy: The use of scents _ primarily from essential oils
distilled from plants, flowers and herbs _ to soothe, calm,
stimulate or re-energize. Used during massages, facials, body
treatments and water therapies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ayurvedic: Treatments based on a system of folk healing from
India. A combination of herbs and oils is used in various massage,
facial and meditation treatments designed to bring the body and
mind into balance. During a Shirodhara treatment, for example, a
continuous stream of warm oil is drizzled onto the forehead, in the
area known as the third eye, for up to 30 minutes in order to
release blockages and calm the psyche.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Craniosacral work: A gentle acupressure massage focusing
primarily on the head but often reaching down into the neck and
shoulders.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Body wrap: Herbs, seaweed, mud or other nutrient-rich substances
are applied to the body, which is then wrapped in a cocoon of
plastic, warm wet linens and/or a blanket for 30 or more minutes.
As the body heats up, the skin absorbs nutrients from whatever
concoction has been applied. Eventually, the body begins to
perspire _ expelling internal impurities.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Facial: A pore-cleansing and skin-nourishing face treatment
often customized by an aesthetician for the skin needs of a given
client. Most facials include a skin analysis, a cleansing ritual, a
steam treatment to open pores, blemish extraction, an exfoliation
treatment, a light face, neck and shoulder massage, a face mask and
a moisture treatment. Commonly, a hand massage and warm-glove
moisture treatment are included. Facial techniques and products
used will vary greatly from spa to spa.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exfoliation: A treatment that removes dead skin cells, smoothes
the skin and increases circulation. Body glows, salt scrubs, loofah
rubs and body polishes are all exfoliating treatments. Typically, a
granular substance (often mineral salts mixed with essential oils)
is applied to the skin, then rubbed off with a loofah sponge or dry
brush.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hydrotherapy: This refers to a variety of water treatments,
including massages with underwater jet massage, therapeutic
showers, steam rooms and mineral baths. Treatments in high-tech
hydrotherapy tubs _ designed with upward of 50 underwater massaging
jets _ can include the use of mud, mineral salts or essential oils.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Massage: The manipulation of muscles to improve circulation,
ease muscle aches, improve flexibility and relax the body. (Toxins
are released from muscles during massage, so drinking plenty of
water after the procedure is recommended to help flush these
impurities from the body.)
</P>
<P>
   Swedish massage: Gentle manipulation of the muscles using long,
connective strokes and various oils. Ideal for relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Therapeutic massage: A combination of Swedish and deep-tissue
massage. Ideal for increasing circulation and relieving stress.
</P>
<P>
   Sports massage: An invigorating deep-tissue massage designed to
loosen and ready the muscles for exercise. Ideal for increasing
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-rock massage: Also referred to as a ``la stone'' massage.
Smooth stones are heated and used as an extension of the massage
therapist's hands to manipulate muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Maternity massage: Gentle muscle manipulation. At some spas, a
special cut-out belly pillow allows a mother-to-be to lie facedown
while having her back massaged. When the pillow is not available or
a woman is in the later stages of her pregnancy, she can lie on her
side for a back massage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mud treatments: Mineral-rich Dead Sea and Moor muds are known
for their detoxifying and exfoliating properties. Therapeutic muds
are used in facial, body-wrap and hydrotherapy treatments. &QL; 
Paraffin: A heated wax, infused with moisturizing oils, used to
rehydrate the skin. Though the entire body can be painted with
paraffin, this treatment most often is administered only to the
hands or feet. Once dipped into warm (not hot) paraffin, the hands
or feet are wrapped in plastic and cloth. This heated environment
allows the skin to better absorb moisture from the wax. Paraffin
treatments often are an extra, offered with spa manicures and
pedicures.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reflexology: An ancient Chinese technique using pressure-point
massage to restore the flow of energy throughout the body. Though
usually administered to the feet, reflexology can also be performed
on the hands and/or ears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seaweed treatments: Known for their nutrients, minerals,
vitamins and proteins, seaweed concoctions are used to nourish and
re-mineralize the skin and body. Commonly used in facial and
body-wrap treatments. &QL; 
Shiatsu: A massage technique developed in Japan in which pressure
is applied to specific points on the body to stimulate and release
blockages along the body's meridians or energy pathways.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss shower: A shower stall designed with high-powered water
jets that can be directed at various parts of the body to create an
invigorating massage. Also referred to as a Scotch shower. &QL; 
Vichy shower: A multijet shower suspended over a wet body-treatment
table. Varied water pressure and temperature are used to invigorate
the skin while rinsing away mud, seaweed, salts or oils that have
been applied to the body. &QL; 
 &QL;

 &HT;    EVEN WITH FEDERAL 'SURPLUS,' NATIONAL DEBT CONTINUES TO GROW
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. government is supposed to be running a
surplus. So why is the national debt still growing?
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton said Wednesday that ``we are in a
strong position'' to shore up Social Security and Medicare because
of expected budget surpluses for the next 15 years, the cold hard
numbers tell a different story for the present.
</P>
<P>
   For all the celebrations over the ``$70 billion surplus'' from
last year, total federal borrowing surged by $113 billion and has
continued to bump upward since.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Social Security collected far more in payroll
taxes than it spent on benefits, while the rest of the government
operated at a deficit. As in the past, the government borrowed the
Social Security surplus, $99 billion last year, to finance the rest
of the government.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1998, federal spending programs other than Social
Security ran $29 billion in the red. At the same time, federal
liabilities for unemployment and other trust funds, as well as for
credit programs such as student loans, added about $84 billion to
the overall debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a like borrowing from a retirement account to pay for
living expenses'' such as groceries, clothing, and school tuition,
said Carol Wait, president of the Committee for a Responsible
Budget, a private watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   She added that this trend will continue until early in the next
century, when the non-Social Security part of government is
expected to have a surplus as well.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the federal government has committed to repaying
Social Security when it comes time to pay retirement benefits. The
loans are formalized in special U.S. Treasury bonds that accrue
annual interest, averaging 6.98 percent as of last December.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the government continues to draw from Social
Security for current operations, the nation's debt burden will
continue to grow from its current $5.6 trillion level.
</P>
<P>
   And that has led to some lampooning of congressional leaders and
the president for making plans to carve up budget surpluses.
Dubbing the current surplus as ``Fantasy Land's New Attraction,''
budget expert Stan Collender writes in a column this week that the
public should ask ``why everyone is in such a rush to do something
with a big increase in the forecasted surplus that will not start
to take off for several more years.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget surplus excitement is premature at best, according to
Collender, who predicts that for the next three years ``they will
be so small that there will not be enough money to do much of
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He warns that giddy 15-year forecasts of $4.4 trillion
accumulated surpluses could prove wrong, just as past long-range
predictions have been drastically off. Five years ago, the
government was predicting huge deficits instead of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Wait said that the government should use the current
overpayments into Social Security to pay down the federal debt and
reduce annual interest payments. By doing that, ``you'd have a
chunk of money for paying Social Security benefits'' in the future,
she said.

SONY SURVEY ON HOW PEOPLE USE THEIR PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the things phone manufacturers want to know when
designing telephones is how people use their phones. What are their
calling habits? Which buttons and services do they really use?
</P>
<P>
   To answer these questions, Sony Electronics, a leading phone
manufacturer, recently commissioned a survey. Conducted last
November by Bruskin/Goldring Research of Edison, N.J., the survey
polled 1,000 households nationwide. Here are some of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average American household has three telephones _ one is
cordless.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women spend, on average, a little more than 40 minutes on the
phone at home each day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men spend a little less than 25 minutes on the phone at home
each day.
</P>
<P>
   _ One out of every four households has Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight out of 10 adults say they get at least three unwanted
phone calls at home every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ The favorite features, in order of preference, are: Caller ID
display, built-in answering machine, speed dialing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six percent of households subscribe to voice-mail services
offered by local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's survey has marketing value. It props up the
manufacturer's case for its newest cordless phone, a $229 unit that
combines Caller ID with call waiting, and displays information
about incoming calls on both the handset and the base.
</P>
<P>
   For those who frequently hunt for numbers, Sony's Jog Dial gives
users access on the handset to a personal telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not ask about the prices of the phones
purchased. &QL;

   &UR; The Roots Of Corruption &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I use America Online and cannot open many e-mail attachments.
I often see: ``This is not a valid WIN32 Apps.'' Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. That error message often shows up when an attachment is
damaged. The file could have been corrupted during the original
upload from the sender or when you downloaded it from AOL. Large
attachment files or ones that were only partly transferred because
of a system crash may also arrive corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   All e-mail files are simple text files that can usually travel
without a problem. Files that you can attach to your e-mail (like a
spreadsheet document or digital picture) must be encoded to comply
with e-mail protocols. As the attachment travels from computer to
computer across the Net, some file data about the encoded
attachment can accidentally be stripped or changed.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, the attachment arrives at your computer
without the necessary information to decode it and turn it back
into a picture or spreadsheet. Compressing attachments can
sometimes help them travel more safely, although some problems have
been reported by Windows AOL users who cannot open attachments
compressed by Mac AOL users. Windows users can try downloading a
freeware utility like Aladdin Expander, at www.aladdinsys.com,
which can handle Mac-generated compressed attachments as well as
Windows files.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
postal mail to Questions, Circuits, The New York Times, 229 West

HOUSE PROUD: PROMOTING LIGHT, ART AND BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md.)   (bl)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, when Arnold Lehman left Baltimore to
become the director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, he and his wife,
Pamela, knew exactly what kind of home they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be industrial, loftlike, close to subways and the
museum, filled with light _ and in Brooklyn. ``We were coming to
promote Brooklyn,'' Ms. Lehman said. ``How could we say one thing
and be somewhere else?'' _ that somewhere else being Manhattan, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   It also had to be in a neighborhood that was safe. ``Artists are
intrepid and will go anywhere,'' Lehman said. ``But major donors?
It's tough to get people to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, where Lehman was the director of the Baltimore
Museum of Art, the couple lived in a 6,000-square-foot former
firehouse so full of light that even the floors were interspersed
with glass panels. ``The home was transparent from top to bottom,
and side to side,'' Ms. Lehman said. This transparency delighted
the couple but terrified some of their friends. So in deference to
them and to add some traction to the slippery floors, the Lehmans
asked their architects, Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson,
who are based in Manhattan, to sandblast a few stripes across the
glass surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the Lehmans found what they wanted: a
3,000-square-foot floor-through loft on a high floor in a 1920s
Gothic Revival building formerly used for offices. It's two blocks
from Borough Hall and 10 minutes by car or subway from the museum.
And light? It pours in through 30 windows.
</P>
<P>
   From the kitchen, which faces northeast, Lehman pointed out the
bridges. ``There's the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and
Triborough,'' he said. ``We miss the 59th Street Bridge because of
the way Manhattan curves.''
</P>
<P>
   From a guest room, he peered west. ``Want to know what the
traffic's like on the Gowanus?'' he said. ``It's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   From Ms. Lehman's office, which looks southeast, he pointed to
the museum, and beyond that, on the rim of the horizon, there was a
thick line of white mist in blurry motion. ``That's Coney Island,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Lehmans were certain about what kind of home they
wanted, they were equally sure about whom their architects would
be: Smith-Miller and Ms. Hawkinson, for a second time around.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehmans, both 54, have been married for nearly 30 years and
have two grown sons. Although Lehman has the visible job, they are
a team. She grew up in New Haven, Conn., but was living in
Manhattan and working at the United Nations when she met Lehman,
then a graduate student in art history at Yale University, on a
blind date. ``I married a townie,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   She is an illustrious townie, a granddaughter of Ellis Gimbel, a
founder of the Gimbel Brothers stores in Manhattan and
Philadelphia. In Baltimore, she worked at the Learning Bank, an
adult-literacy center, where she helped raise $250,000 through
charity bowling benefits. ``We got corporations and people to buy
lanes,'' she explained. ``We weren't a fancy place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lehmans don't interrupt each other. Instead, they listen,
closely, filling in each other's sentences with perfect fluency.
Together, they share a vision of art, architecture and a
down-to-earth style of life. He takes a visitor's coat, she hangs
it up. He pulls a coffee cup from a cabinet, and she pours the
coffee. He delights in the visitor who brings her own toasted bialy
and bacon for breakfast. ``Let's invite her for lunch,'' he said,
``and see what she brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lehman said, ``We're very casual, very relaxed, very
informal.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also decisive. ``I like natural materials,'' Lehman
said, ``and we like a monochromatic continuity of materials _
steel, concrete, wood _ so that the furniture and art and objects
stand out. That's the key to the philosophy behind the apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And light,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And an apartment so transparent we would be able to see
through it. We wanted the rooms to have the illusion of floating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we wanted flexibility, to go from two to 100 people.''
</P>
<P>
   The loft is industrial, the space made seemingly bigger by the
80-inch windows. The architects designed the space so that it is
first a home and second a gallery _ for modern art, mainly
photographs and word art. ``Photography has an immediacy that other
works of art don't always have,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   So do the raw materials that make up the loft: Douglas fir
plywood, cold-rolled steel, stainless steel and plaster. There is
no paint.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lehmans met with the architects, Ms. Lehman had a
four-page, single-spaced wish list. At the top of it was a tricky
request. ``We wanted to open up entire walls but also to find wall
space,'' Lehman said. They also wanted three bedrooms, two of them
guest rooms for their married sons and grandson.
</P>
<P>
   The architects had the answer. ``We gave them door walls, walls
that move,'' Ms. Hawkinson said. Except for the kitchen and living
room, which flow into each other, all the rooms have sliding doors
of plywood veneer. Each door wall closes off a room and is a place
to hang art. One wall in each of the guest rooms has another duty:
it hides a Murphy bed. And for material, the architects chose
Douglas fir plywood in the B-D grade, the kind found in practically
every construction site.
</P>
<P>
   To create the illusion of rooms that float, they designed walls
that don't reach the ceiling, except in the master bedroom. There,
the architects recessed the tops and lighted them to achieve the
floating effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the loft, Italian antiques are juxtaposed with modern
art. In the bedroom, a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph, ``Thomas,''
of a man's back rippled by the reflection of a Venetian blind, is
hung near the 18th-century Italian headboard, a Baroque painting of
plump, dimpled cherubs, edged in gold paint, which belonged to Ms.
Lehman's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway, there's a 16th-century Italian walnut chest of
drawers, and on the wall above hangs Bernd and Hilla Becher's
series of photographs called ``Water Towers.'' On the chest are
industrial beaters, which look like giant whisks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the original dust,'' Lehman said, flicking away an
invisible mote. ``Cleaning them would take away from their
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he and his wife give each other art as gifts, he said
no. ``We buy together,'' he said. ``It's something you need to
agree on. You don't want to surprise someone with something with
that much presence.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a photo of Cindy Sherman as George Washington. By the
treadmill in the exercise room, where the Lehmans dutifully tread
20 minutes a day, are a pair of Robert Longo lithographs, ``Men in
the Cities: Eric and Gretchen,'' depicting a man jumping in the air
and a woman dancing. The art is a silent personal trainer. Move, it
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Lehman wants to do with the museum. ``There are
2.5 million people in Brooklyn and millions in Long Island,'' he
said. To lure them, he wants to stage exhibitions with wide appeal
and others with a specific point of view. ``It's about mixing
audiences _ young, old, teen-agers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 14, ``From Hip to Hip-Hop: Black Fashion and a Culture of
Influence'' will open, followed, on May 28, by ``Impressionists in
Winter: Effets de Neige.''
</P>
<P>
   The Impressionists show needs no explanation, but the hip-hop
one does. ``It's the evolution of black fashion,'' Lehman said,
``and the whole culture built up around rap music _ how hip-hop
clothing has gone to the mainstream, and how it's been appropriated
by Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren.'' As part of the show, the
museum invited teen-agers to photograph people in the street in
hip-hop fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Lehman introduced First Saturdays: on the first
Saturday of the month, the museum is open free from 5 to 11 p.m.
and offers not only the run of the galleries but also storytelling
and performances for families with young children. Then, from 9 to
11, there's dancing in the marble halls to a live band _ a swing
group one month, a Latin band another.
</P>
<P>
   ``A museum is not about preserving works of art,'' he said.
``It's about making a difference in people's lives.''

   (italics)Cordless phones act as small radios, sending signals
between the handset and the receiver. For many years, cordless
phones operated on frequencies around 49 megahertz in the radio
spectrum. When that part of the spectrum grew crowded,
manufacturers began making phones that send signals at 900 MHz, a
less congested frequency. Cordless phones can also be analog or
digital. The difference isn't in what part of the radio spectrum
they use _ it is in how the sound information is packaged for
transmission. Here are the cordless options:(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANALOG Analog cordless phones are what most people have at home;
they are the most basic and least expensive cordless phones on the
market. Most operate around 49 MHz, but 900-MHz analog phones are
gaining. Prices are dropping steeply. You can buy a 900-MHz analog
cordless phone for as little as $30.
</P>
<P>
   Analog phones translate sound waves into radio waves and back
again, which does not require computer chips. But they are
susceptible to electronic interference and eavesdropping from radio
scanners.
</P>
<P>
   But if you intend to use your phone 100 to 200 feet away from
the base and security is not a big concern, then a 49-MHz analog
phone should be fine, said Eldon Chuck, a product manager at
Thomson Consumer Electronics. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL Digital cordless phones convert the sound going to and
from the handset into a stream of digital signals; they are
reconverted into analog signals before they are sent down the phone
line. The additional circuitry makes digital phones more expensive.
But they are more secure than analog phones. Digital cordless
phones, which operate at 900 MHz, are not very popular because they
cost more than analog phones but offer few advantages. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL SPREAD-SPECTRUM These phones are another matter entirely
_ and the most expensive cordless phones on the market. If privacy
or long range is important to you, you should consider buying a
900-MHz digital spread-spectrum phone. Digital spread-spectrum
phones provide extra security because once the sound information is
converted into digital signals, the signals are sent over a wide
range of frequencies and jump from one frequency to another, making
eavesdropping virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   A spread-spectrum phone can cost as little as $79, but the
average price is closer to $100. The new 2.4-gigahertz phones are
all spread spectrum. Spread-spectrum phones are best for people who
live in cities. The phone's added power expands its range. &QL;

SURVEY SHOWS DISCONTENT OVER SAN FRANCISCO TRANSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eighty-two percent of people who use Municipal
Railway trains in San Francisco are dissatisfied with the service
they are getting, according to a survey conducted by the transit
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The survey confirmed the suspicions of transit managers and
watchdogs alike: Riders are still not happy with the metro trains,
and their biggest concerns are the system's delays and lack of
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   At rush hour Tuesday afternoon, that frustration was borne out
on the streets of San Francisco _ a city famous for its clanging
streetcars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting since 4:30 for a J,'' said Norma Sanchez as
she stood at a crowded Muni Metro stop at Church and Market streets
and watched an outbound train pull up at 5:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty minutes at rush hour,'' chimed in Teo Swan. ``It's like
this all the time. Look, it's a cattle car!''
</P>
<P>
   Respondents to the survey, distributed at metro stops and in
cars between Dec. 15 and 28, were asked to pick their two biggest
concerns from a list of seven choices. Seventy-one percent of the
responses dealt with the system's lack of on-time performance: 28
percent were concerned with reliability, 25 percent cited delays,
and 18 percent focused on the wait between cars.
</P>
<P>
   Another 20 percent mentioned the excessive overcrowding on the
trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to people, they say these problems are the same
thing,'' Richard Mlynarik, of the transit watchdog group Rescue
Muni, said after reviewing the survey results. ``When the train
doesn't come on time, then you're delayed, and it's also
overcrowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Four percent of the responses raised concerns about safety,
while 5 percent expressed frustrations about a lack of information
or announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Muni distributed 35,000 surveys. Nineteen percent, or 6,521,
were returned. That is almost double the ordinary response rate for
a customer survey, according to Muni. In addition, 84 percent of
those who responded added their own written comments.
</P>
<P>
   Muni spokesman P.J. Johnston would release only a few of those
comments, the most expressive of which read simply,
``AAAUUUGGGHHH!!!''
</P>
<P>
   He said the high rider response was a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical public service in this city, and it touches
most San Franciscans' lives, directly or indirectly,'' Johnston
said Tuesday, the day the results were released. ``Having a
demanding, vocal public certainly puts a certain amount of pressure
on those of us who work for the agency, but it's definitely a good
thing. Placing high demands on public entities usually leads to
better service. And those demands are by no means unreasonable.''

THE 3X CREDIT CARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime in 1995, Jack Nicholson sat down to dinner with a
friend, Alan Finkelstein. At the end of the meal, when the check
came, Nicholson took out two cards _ a credit card and a card-size
magnifying glass to read the figures on the bottom line.
Finkelstein, an inventor, saw an opportunity to combine the two,
and the Lenscard, the perfect innovation for a prosperous and
increasingly aged America, was born.
</P>
<P>
   The Lenscard, marketed by Chase Manhattan, is a credit card with
a flat, one-inch window that magnifies three-and-a-half times,
which is enough power to enlarge a line of text from a blur to
legibility. While the bank would not release specific data, Judith
Miller, a Chase spokeswoman, said that card sales were greatly
exceeding expectations in the market it was looking for:
``consumers in the 30-to-64 age range.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, 61, is scarcely alone in suffering from failing
vision. According to a study by Lighthouse International, the
vision therapy and support center in New York City, one out of
every six Americans over 45 suffers from some form of age-related
vision impairment, commonly defined as the inability to read
standard newspaper print. And as the baby-boom generation moves
through history like a frog through a snake, what might be called
over-the-counter vision aids _ powerful lamps, large readout clocks
and magnifiers of all types _ are more popular than ever, and an
increasing challenge to product designers.
</P>
<P>
   Popular, but with a boomer twist: The same generation that
brought us Viagra, Propecia and the incredible shrinking hearing
aid is also looking for ways to conceal vision loss _ remember the
line-less bifocal? _ or at least to make the middle-aged chic. In
this vain new world of the slightly sightless, a classic Sherlock
Holmes magnifying glass is as uncool as an ear trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image, catering to the affluent, is reporting solid
sales of its Mini-Fold reading glasses. The original line,
introduced in 1997, was expanded in October to meet demand.
Brookstone, its somewhat lower-tech competitor, is countering with
big-digit clocks, scales and radios and a credit-card-size tool kit
with a sneaky little magnifier.
</P>
<P>
   While products like the Lenscard focus on stealth (what, me
blind? I'm just paying the check), others take a more visible tack.
Levenger, which has long offered magnifying glasses in its
mail-order line of ``tools for serious readers,'' has introduced
the Punctuation Magnifier, designed by the French company Mapep in
a Philippe Starck-like amoeba. Karen Fortner of Levenger
acknowledges that the company has revamped its offerings to catch
the wave of the vision- but not fashion-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have something called the Bettman Magnifier, in
honor of the photographer Otto Bettman, that was an old-fashioned
wooden thing on a stand,'' Ms. Fortner said. ``The new ones are a
little funkier.'' Steve Leveen, 44, Levenger's president and a
recent initiate to glasses, said that his company sells the Rocket
eBook _ a hand-held electronic device that displays downloaded
texts _ for the same reasons: it's cool and, through a zoom
feature, it's ``a book that generates its own large print.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so enthusiastic about this trend in baby-boomer
self-medication. Dr. Michael Fischer, director of Low Vision
Services at Lighthouse International, warns that forsaking regular
eye examinations for retail solutions can be dangerous. ``There are
diseases like glaucoma that can be symptomless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical concerns may get some to submit to eye exams, but they
will not likely stem the supply of products. As more boomers enter
their 50s, will their force in the market drive the public
environment toward the standards of universal design? What will be
the next product to merge medical remediation into the flow of
everyday consumer culture?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Grossman, a political cartoonist and illustrator in New
York, suggested one such innovation. ``Someone should make a CD
package with a built-in magnifying glass,'' he said, for reading
the tiny liner notes. ``It would be the natural evolution of the
jewel box.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman has also come face to face with the challenges of aging
eyes. In efforts to find vision-enhancing gifts for a friend, he
bought her a trove of magnifying devices, including a lorgnette.
She turned up her nose at them. ``The best thing I've given her
that she refuses to use is a miner's lamp,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   With the nonchalance of Zeus and Hera leaning over the balcony
of Olympus, Chris and Vivian Tai, two prospective house buyers
visiting a model home in Mount Kisco, N.Y., peered down from a
landing and hurled a few thunderbolts at the living room below.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs it?'' said Mrs. Tai, 33, a computer programmer,
although she conceded that a living room might come in handy on
occasion _ ``so that my kids can practice the piano and they'll be
far enough away that I won't have to hear them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The living room is gasping its last breath,'' said Wayne
Foley, a builder in Great Falls, Va., and a member of the design
committee of the National Association of Home Builders. It is
shrinking in size as well as prestige: in 1978, the living room in
a typical model by Toll Brothers _ builders of upscale houses,
including the present one in Mount Kisco _ measured 20 feet by 13.4
feet. The one the Tais viewed last week had shrunk to 15 feet by 13
feet. Its decline has fed the voracious family room, which in the
70s was a youth Siberia south of the mudroom: here it is 20 feet 8
inches by 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when Country Home magazine built a show house at
the World Financial Center based on an informal reader survey, it
had no living room at all. ``It just didn't appear on anybody's
wish list,'' said Dennis Wedlick, the architect. Taking its place
were a double-height medieval ``great hall,'' which ran the length
of the house with two huge chandeliers and a cyclopean fireplace,
and a family room/kitchen ``gathering room'' at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sheehan, Country Home's editor in chief, was thrilled when
she saw no living room in the floor plans. ``I thought, `Hurray!'''
she recalled. ``There's no life, no living there. I could live
without it. In fact, I already am.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that in her own home, a Cape Codder in Ashfield,
Mass., everyone tends to congregate around a wood-burning stove in
the kitchen. ``When I pulled in a love seat, the kitchen became the
most comfortable room in the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wedlick's design for the Country Home show house attracted a
developer, Gerald Hines, who commissioned him to design similar
houses with loftlike plans and, Wedlick said, ``no rooms defined in
the traditional sense.'' The 2,800-square-foot homes will be
constructed this summer in Carbondale, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Foley in Virginia, way ahead of the curve, eliminated the living
room in his own house back in the 70s and now finds customers
telling him they don't want one, either. He said: ``For years, you
heard people saying, `My parents never used it and I'm not using
it.' And finally they're confident enough to say, `So don't give me
one.'''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to renovate, the family room is again the
winner. Kermit Baker, an economist at Harvard University's Joint
Center for Housing Studies, said, ``It just makes a lot of sense
that the family room would grow at the expense of the more formal
living room.'' He added: ``Most of the renovations in the last 10
to 15 years have been generated by baby boomers making more livable
space for their growing families. The last thing they need is more
formal space _ they need space for playing around.''
</P>
<P>
   The living room in America was a 19th-century invention,
evolving from a parlor reserved for ``at home'' receptions into a
large gracious space with a fireplace meant for the entire family
to enjoy. After World War II, parents found they needed to put some
distance between themselves and their baby-boom children. So the
``rec room'' was born, tucked away in the basement where ritual
games of Twister could be enacted without wreaking havoc on the
rest of the house. A precedent was established: the family room was
fun; the living room, its furniture frozen in Scotchguarded
perfection, was serious.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that the television set, at first a welcome
novelty in the living room, soon followed the children out. But the
most serious blow to the living room's sense of purpose came when
the family room hitched up with the kitchen to be crowned
grandiloquently by builders as the great room or gathering room.
This movement started in the 70s (the Toll Brothers were building
them even then), but it really took hold in the 80s. The
combination of television and easy access to the fridge was hard to
beat: soon, even the fireplace turned cold on the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the family also are having an impact on the shape of
the home. According to the 1990 United States Census, half the
households in America consist of married couples without children,
while one-quarter of the population live alone. Traditional
three-bedroom family home life has given way to houses for
two-career couples, empty-nesters, the remarried with children, gay
couples and the extended family with in-laws at home.
</P>
<P>
   With demographic change has come the breakdown of the need for
rooms at all, a notion of informality popularized by television
shows like ``Friends'' and ``Home Improvement,'' which hint at the
kind of open-plan living beloved by early modernists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a reconfiguration not only of the
demographics of the home but of the very notion of public and
private domains and appropriate spaces for work and leisure,'' said
Gwendolyn Wright, author of ``Building the Dream: A Social History
of Housing in America'' (Pantheon, 1981). She sees families moving
further away from artificially segregated, sex-related zones _ the
men's den, the women's parlor _ toward an open, multifunctional
space.
</P>
<P>
   Without children at home, ``the need for acoustic and visual
privacy is less compelling,'' said Terence Riley, curator of
architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. This summer,
Riley is planning to examine the impact of all the new forces
shaping the architecture of the home in his exhibition ``The
Un-Private House.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will cover everything from a loft for Wall Street
traders furnished with little more than trading screens and
television sets to a house where digital screens replace walls to
kitchens where recipes (even images of chefs) are projected on the
backsplash, to dining rooms inhabited by virtual guests _ all
places where one can be alone but always connected.
</P>
<P>
   But the brave new home, Riley said, owes a lot to the past,
namely ``the medieval hall where spaces were essentially loftlike,
in the sense that they were large and open and used for multiple
functions.'' These great halls were not even specifically domestic
in nature but were public as well, in the manner of today's
living-and-working arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the living room say that its obituary is premature.
``The `death of the living room' reminds me of the `death of the
theater' _ it's not going to happen,'' said the architect Robert
A.M. Stern. ``Where are you going to entertain the in-laws when
they come to meet you? As you climb the corporate ladder, where are
you going to bring your associates? You can't take them into the
family room, where your 9-year-old is eating dinner and playing
video games. Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Toll Brothers show house in Mount Kisco, Marcia and
Michael Cooney, both 52 and relocating from Michigan, liked the
living room, however tiny. It would be a perfect setting for their
antiques. ``Even if it's a room that will never be used, it's nice
to have for display,'' Mrs. Cooney said.
</P>
<P>
   But the living room may have a value beyond its image-conscious
displays, said Bill Stumpf, author of ``The Ice Palace That Melted
Away'' (Pantheon, 1998), a book of essays about design and society.
Stumpf he praises the living room for its civilizing influence,
calling it ``the most photogenic room, the home of the Christmas
tree, of taking family portraits, holding weddings and,
historically, funerals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But perhaps it is the designer Kitty Hawks who most adroitly
taps into the subconscious desire to hold on to the living room,
for a while at least. Asked to describe a great living room, she
recalled one in the Dakota on Central Park West that once belonged
to the glamorous Amanda and Carter Burden. ``It was when they were
impossibly young and rich and beautiful,'' she said, already
sounding dreamy. ``Their living room had pale blue glazes on the
wall and the curtains were pink silk. I remember the rug as an
Aubusson, or at least a very good Oriental. It was like they were
playing grown-up, but the gentleness of the pastel colors was so
welcoming. Mostly, I remember that the room made everyone look
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Now how many kitchens can you say that about?

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's almost comical. Here we are at the end of our daring
century _ the century that took the figure out of art, the plot out
of fiction and the tune out of music _ and do you know who the
hottest artist is?
 &HT;    Norman Rockwell.
 &HT;    The same Norman Rockwell whose name was once synonymous with bad
taste.
 &HT;    When I studied art history in college, Rockwell's illustrations
of Santas and freckled Boy Scouts, of dogs and grandmothers, were
dismissed as fluff for calendars. Professors spoke of him, if at
all, with sneering disdain.
 &HT;    Now they adore him. I was recently talking to Robert Rosenblum,
the esteemed professor of fine arts at New York University, and he
mentioned the big Rockwell exhibition opening this fall at the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta. ``When I heard about the show,''
Rosenblum said, ``I got immediately sort of jealous and thought,
Why didn't they ask me to write something for the catalogue? But
I'm right in there cheering.''
 &HT;    Rosenblum, it should be noted, isn't just your average finicky
connoisseur. He has always had impressively terrible taste. In 1989
he published a controversial book, ``Paintings in the Musie
d'Orsay,'' which retold the story of art in a new and naughty way,
mingling the masterworks of Cezanne, Manet and the usual
avant-garde masters with the work of artists such as William
Adolphe Bouguereau, a leader of the official salon who was known
for his schmaltzy female nudes.
 &HT;    I asked Rosenblum why he is drawn to bad art, and he recalled
that Francois Cachin, the former director of the Musie d'Orsay, was
once asked the same question. She replied in protest, ``Oh, but I
only like the best bad art!''
 &HT;    Bad art _ nowadays, the best and the worst of it is getting
excellent exposure. The Museum of Bad Art, which opened in 1996 in
Dedham, Mass., a suburb of Boston, is devoted to the work of Sunday
painters who specialize in stuff like Day-Glo sunsets, perky daisy
scenes and pictures of wide-eyed, fuzzy puppies.
 &HT;    The idea may be amusing, but it's also an exercise in
redundancy: Museums everywhere now show bad art _ not amateur
painting, but the best bad art, the technically skillful kind once
banished to museum basements mainly because it went against the
modernist ban on sentimentality.
 &HT;    An obvious example is the exhibition ``Victorian Fairy
Painting,'' a swarm of cutie-pies with silvery wings that recently
alighted at the Frick Collection in New York. Not long ago, fairy
painting was widely disparaged as so much slick kitsch, as was the
art of Gustave Moreau, a painter of gold-hued Symbolist fantasies
whose first-ever retrospective opens at the Art Institute of
Chicago next month.
 &HT;    Moreau, according to the tough modernist critic Clement
Greenberg, ``sank painting to an all-time low.'' He's among the
many 19th-century lightweights who have lately come into fashion,
and his revival springs from the same impulse that has turned
Rockwell, a famous square, into the height of hipness.
 &HT;    I like the vogue for bad art, which represents a welcome release
from the snobbery of the past. For much of this century, the art
that was hailed as quintessentially modern belonged to a single
category _ abstraction _ and though Picasso never went completely
abstract, his Cubism was viewed as the Big Bang that made all forms
of art life possible.
 &HT;    Abstract art was not easy to understand, and it led the American
public to think of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre
of experts whose taste and rituals seemed as mysterious as those of
Byzantine priests.
 &HT;    The vogue for bad art seeks to prove that visual rewards are not
confined to the A-list masterpieces hanging at the Museum of Modern
Art. It's a truism that taste changes, but the rampant revisionism
of the '90s isn't just a backlash against modernist taste or one
more rotation in the cycle of coolness. Rather, it marks the end of
coolness _ a premillennial yearning for the safe past, for the kind
of reassuring experience that avant-garde art aggressively
renounced.
 &HT;    You don't need to contemplate angst or alienation standing in
front of an N.C. Wyeth (the subject of an ambitious new biography),
Disney animation cels (which are bringing insane prices at auction)
or Grandma Moses, one of the countless self-taught primitives whose
resumes are now as long as those of Yale MFAs.
 &HT;    To be sure, conservative critics would agree with none of this.
They wring their hands, decry the decline of standards and
basically argue that the vogue for Rockwell and his nonelitist ilk
represents what might be called a case of Madonna envy, an attempt
among art historians to seize some of the glamour of pop culture
for their own field.
 &HT;    Recently, I tried out this theory on Karal Ann Marling, a
professor of art history and American studies at the University of
Minnesota. ``It's all too true,'' she wryly remarked. ``The push-up
brassiere is everywhere in academia.''
 &HT;    Marling, whose books include ``Graceland: Going Home With
Elvis'' (Harvard University Press, 1996) and ``Norman Rockwell''
(Harry N. Abrams, 1997), has no rivals as a champion of bad art.
 &HT;    ``It bothers me,'' she says, ``that people such as Rosenblum go
just as far as Victorian fairy painting and that's as much bad
taste as they are willing to let into their lives. What I try to
teach my students is to look not only at Leonardo, but to look at
Coke cans or the work of paint-by-number amateurs in the same
way.''
 &HT;    A plump, easily amused redhead with a chipped front tooth and
rings on every finger, Marling looks less like a professor than
someone who faithfully reads the recipes in McCall's. She's on
sabbatical this term, writing every day from 6 in the morning until
4, when ``Oprah,'' her favorite show, comes on.
 &HT;    ``I try to spend one day a week in stores,'' she says of her
life in Minneapolis, ``and that's where I hone my visual skills. I
get the same satisfaction from the Walker Art Center that I get
from the Mall of America'' _ in her opinion, one of the wonders of
the nonancient world.
 &HT;    It is easy enough to find fault with Marling's anything-goes,
shop-'til-you-drop school of esthetics. To discern equal worth in
art and pop culture is to strip art of its seriousness (and to
strip pop culture of its fun). No thinking person could hope for
such chaos. Marling might be described as a belated Pop artist, a
campus Andy Warhol. She's doing to art history what Warhol did to
painting in the early '60s, erasing the line between Elvis culture
and elite culture.
 &HT;    And yet, for all her unsettling perverseness, Marling is
providing a needed jolt to her field. In an age when
post-structuralists are burying art beneath dust balls of theory,
and when it's nearly impossible to read an article without
stumbling across a reference to the ``the reified moment of
perception,'' there is something appealing about critics who insist
simply that we look _ at everything from Hellenistic marbles to
Hallmark cards.
 &HT;    In the galleries too, looking is becoming obsolete, perhaps
because the work of hot artists seldom gives off real creative
heat. Too often, the art world seems less like a world than a tiny
club with all of 23 brand-name artists in it. Where can we go to
find the edge, to recover our lost wildness, to escape the thronged
blockbusters and the buzz of Acoustiguides?
 &HT;    By now, avant-garde art is so accepted that even Duchamp's
urinal looks classical, which helps explain why nothing seems more
outrageous than middlebrow art and the sort of pictures your
grandmother savored _ the art, in short, of 100 percent normal
Norman Rockwell.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's almost comical. Here we are at the end of our daring
century _ the century that took the figure out of art, the plot out
of fiction and the tune out of music _ and do you know who the
hottest artist is?
 &HT;    Norman Rockwell.
 &HT;    The same Norman Rockwell whose name was once synonymous with bad
taste.
 &HT;    When I studied art history in college, Rockwell's illustrations
of Santas and freckled Boy Scouts, of dogs and grandmothers, were
dismissed as fluff for calendars. Professors spoke of him, if at
all, with sneering disdain.
 &HT;    Now they adore him. I was recently talking to Robert Rosenblum,
the esteemed professor of fine arts at New York University, and he
mentioned the big Rockwell exhibition opening this fall at the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta. ``When I heard about the show,''
Rosenblum said, ``I got immediately sort of jealous and thought,
Why didn't they ask me to write something for the catalogue? But
I'm right in there cheering.''
 &HT;    Rosenblum, it should be noted, isn't just your average finicky

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The phone yanked Steve Drescher from a deep slumber early on a
mid-November Monday. He shook the weekend's cobwebs from his head
and mumbled hello. The CIA was calling.
 &HT;    ``Hi, remember me?'' said the voice on the line. ``I'm Mike. I'm
with the CIA. We're interested in you.''
 &HT;    Drescher came slowly into consciousness, wondering what the man
was talking about, and why the CIA was calling him _ a 19-year-old
sophomore at Ohio State University.
 &HT;    Then he dimly remembered dropping off a resume several weeks
earlier with an agency recruiter on Career Day, the bustling job
fair that Ohio State holds for its 48,500 students. Drescher, a
budding computer programmer, had been much more focused that day on
a job at Microsoft or Compuserve.
 &HT;    The next night, he sat under a fluorescent light in a campus
conference room, too nervous to touch his cooling pizza, listening
to Mike try to convince him and 25 other students that it would be
neat to be a spy.
 &HT;    ``I'm clueless as to what I would actually do for the CIA,''
Drescher said to me. ``The only thing I have to go on is the
movies. To me, it's 'Mission: Impossible.'''
 &HT;    The world's most famous intelligence service has kicked off the
biggest recruiting drive in its history, digging deeply into the
American landscape for a vein, a nugget, a trace of talent.
 &HT;    Never before has it been so easy to arrange an interview with
the agency: just call (800) 562-7242 (``JOBS CIA''), or log onto
www.cia.gov. Answer the want ads in The Economist, The New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal _ then come on in for a
lie-detector test!
 &HT;    A few years from now, you too could be digging up dirt in
Khartoum, skulking through the bazaars of Peshawar or poring over
documents purloined from Pyongyang.
 &HT;    George J. Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, says he
has to mount ``a very aggressive way to bring people in'' _ two or
three thousand bright young Americans in the next few years _ or
risk the slow death of American intelligence.
 &HT;    ``To do what I expect to do, to have the depth that I expect
that we need to have, you have to go recruit the best and the
brightest,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, Tenet hopes to make the clandestine service bigger than
it was at the height of the Cold War, to open more overseas
stations and bases, to mount more complex and more expensive secret
operations. And he wants the nation's sharpest talents to come to
work at CIA headquarters as intelligence analysts, information
technicians and in-house experts on everything from Afghanistan to
Zimbabwe.
 &HT;    In sum, he aims to revitalize an agency that has been mired in a
slough of despond _ terrible publicity, terrible morale, terrible
credibility.
 &HT;    ``I will not allow the CIA to become a second-rate
organization,'' Tenet told a gathering of the agency's employees
recently.
 &HT;    By most accounts, including Tenet's, the hiring blitz is the
most important internal affair on the agency's agenda for the rest
of the century. Congress will pump hundreds of millions of extra
dollars into the agency over the next few years to get new blood
flowing.
 &HT;    But success is hardly assured. With the Cold War a fading memory
and the CIA increasingly scorned as a bungling bureaucracy, who
really wants to be a spy anymore?
 &HT;    At the Ohio State job fair, the agency set up a spiffy booth
sandwiched between Chase Manhattan and a computer company. The
recruiters handed out vaguely informative pamphlets and brochures.
Fear and ignorance about the CIA were rampant, judging from
interviews with students at the fair.
 &HT;    ``People don't have a very clear idea of what they do,'' said
Tim Paradis, 22, editor of the school paper, The Lantern. ``It's a
dark government agency.'' Richelle Sherwood, 24, an Air Force
veteran who speaks Vietnamese, said, ``I don't really know a lot
about them, except they do all this secret stuff.''
 &HT;    Karl Curtis, 21, an information-systems major, was intrigued but
uninformed. ``You've heard the rumors, you've seen the movies,
you're curious about what weird things they do,'' he said. ``I
guess you'd get to know the dirty things, the cool things about the
world. And a 'top secret' clearance is a really marketable skill.''
 &HT;    Marwan Saleh, 22, wearing a brush cut and a sharp suit, stood
out. A fiercely patriotic Palestinian-American, mellifluously
fluent in Arabic, he's also a frequent visitor to the homeland, the
holder of a political-science degree _ and slated to receive an MBA
this spring in global supply and demand.
 &HT;    The CIA would fall at his feet. But he's not likely to let them.
``I'm an American Democrat,'' he said. ``I believe as an American
that it's my duty to question and help develop American policy. And
the CIA seems like it would be executing policy. And I can't blind
myself. I have my own political views.'' He moved on.
 &HT;    What's more, at the fair, even the Steak 'n' Shake recruiters
were offering salaries that pay more than most CIA entry-level
jobs. Bringing top students into the agency was no small challenge.
 &HT;    Still, the CIA's marketing push has yielded many new applicants:
the Web site and want ads draw 50,000 resumes a year. But there's a
mismatch between the people who want in and the people the agency
wants to let in. Of those who formally apply, four out of five will
never make it past an initial interview.
 &HT;    ``We are not for everybody, and everybody is not for us,'' says
Gil Medeiros, head of the CIA's newly created Recruitment Center.
``There are a fair number of resumes we have to throw away.''
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest obstacle in recruiting young Americans, he
says, is ``the lack of awareness of history'' among them. ``It is
amazing how little they know about us.'' And most of what they know
is wrong: a jumble of ``The X-Files,'' half-remembered headlines
and good old-fashioned American paranoia. And a lot of people think
the CIA is some sort of secret police force, running around the
United States killing people with high-tech guns.
 &HT;    Once upon a time in the Cold War, the agency would never have
advertised itself. It would have been unthinkable, unnecessary,
unseemly. But when the hammer and sickle came down over the
Kremlin, the veterans of the Cold War began cleaning out their
desks.
 &HT;    Over the past six years, the CIA has lost about 4,000 of its
most experienced and skilled people: about 20 percent of its spies,
analysts, scientists and technology experts. Ten years ago, the
agency was probably 10 years ahead of the public sector when it
came to computer capability. No longer.
 &HT;    The agency desperately needs, right now, hundreds of computer
wizards comfortable with the latest technology. But competing with
the likes of Microsoft and IBM is proving increasingly difficult.
 &HT;    The decline has been most significant at the CIA's directorate
of operations _ the clandestine service, the spies who serve
abroad. At least 7 percent of the spy cadre has left the agency in
each of the past six years. That adds up to about a thousand spies,
and it leaves not many more than a thousand in place. The
departures of hundreds of officers in their 30s and 40s were
especially troubling to the CIA.
 &HT;    This same instability has permeated the agency's top brass. No
director of Central Intelligence has served for more than two years
in this decade. The whirlwind has at times left the CIA
directionless, a ship in irons. And bad publicity _ traitors
within, snafus abroad _ further angered and depressed the agency.
 &HT;    ``There were tremendous internal morale problems,'' says John M.
Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence in 1995 and 1996.
``Tremendously poor morale and tremendously poor credibility.''
 &HT;    The agency used to recruit new people through an underground
network at the best universities and officers' clubs. The
talent-spotting system it had among student bodies was unique. It
existed on every major college campus in the country _ not just
Yale (where the crew coach recruited) and Princeton (where at least
one dean did the tapping), but at the University of Texas and Holy
Cross too.
 &HT;    And mandatory military service gave the agency the ability to
sign up thousands of officers who had spent time abroad in Europe
or Asia. When the draft ended 26 years ago, the CIA lost access to
a lot of people who had experience in the military, who had
actually lived overseas.
 &HT;    In those years, the agency had an aura of mystery and power
which it may never regain. Its officers were told time and time
again that they were an elite organization and it was a badge of
honor to be recruited and selected to work in CIA.
 &HT;    But most of the people milling around at the Ohio State job fair
were born after the collapse of Saigon in 1975. The Cold War ended
when they were still kids.
 &HT;    What's more, says Milt Bearden, a retired CIA veteran: ``Their
appreciation of American history is probably from Oliver Stone
movies, or a very cursory reading of history, as Americans haven't
been forced by world events to do much with history. And so how do
they recruit today?''
 &HT;    By December, the agency had received resumes from 123 Ohio State
students, interviewed 30 and conditionally offered jobs to 18. Five
or six of those students will wind up working for the agency after
passing the lie-detector tests and the other physical and
psychological screenings that are part of life at the CIA, the
recruiters say.
 &HT;    The CIA's talent-hunters hit 50 more campuses this fall. Their
campaign generated close to 100 job applications a day. In
addition, the agency is focusing attention on the children of
ethnic Americans _ combing America's cities and the suburbs,
looking for the children of immigrants and refugees, particularly
young men and women who grew up in first-generation Asian and Arab
households, and reaching out to these potential recruits through
ads in ethnic newspapers throughout the United States.
 &HT;    The languages these people speak, and their physical appearance,
could come in handy when the CIA tries to do some of its most
important work _ penetrating nations like Iraq or North Korea _
with home-grown American spies.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The phone yanked Steve Drescher from a deep slumber early on a
mid-November Monday. He shook the weekend's cobwebs from his head
and mumbled hello. The CIA was calling.
 &HT;    ``Hi, remember me?'' said the voice on the line. ``I'm Mike. I'm
with the CIA. We're interested in you.''
 &HT;    Drescher came slowly into consciousness, wondering what the man
was talking about, and why the CIA was calling him _ a 19-year-old
sophomore at Ohio State University.
 &HT;    Then he dimly remembered dropping off a resume several weeks
earlier with an agency recruiter on Career Day, the bustling job
fair that Ohio State holds for its 48,500 students. Drescher, a
budding computer programmer, had been much more focused that day on
a job at Microsoft or Compuserve.
 &HT;    The next night, he sat under a fluorescent light in a campus
conference room, too nervous to touch his cooling pizza, listening
to Mike try to convince him and 25 other students that it would be
neat to be a spy.
 &HT;    ``I'm clueless as to what I would actually do for the CIA,''
Drescher said to me. ``The only thing I have to go on is the
movies. To me, it's 'Mission: Impossible.'''
 &HT;    The world's most famous intelligence service has kicked off the
biggest recruiting drive in its history, digging deeply into the
American landscape for a vein, a nugget, a trace of talent.
 &HT;    Never before has it been so easy to arrange an interview with
the agency: just call (800) 562-7242 (``JOBS CIA''), or log onto
www.cia.gov. Answer the want ads in The Economist, The New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal _ then come on in for a
lie-detector test!
 &HT;    A few years from now, you too could be digging up dirt in
Khartoum, skulking through the bazaars of Peshawar or poring over
documents purloined from Pyongyang.
 &HT;    George J. Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, says he
has to mount ``a very aggressive way to bring people in'' _ two or
three thousand bright young Americans in the next few years _ or
risk the slow death of American intelligence.
 &HT;    ``To do what I expect to do, to have the depth that I expect
that we need to have, you have to go recruit the best and the
brightest,'' he says.
 &HT;    In fact, Tenet hopes to make the clandestine service bigger than
it was at the height of the Cold War, to open more overseas
stations and bases, to mount more complex and more expensive secret
operations. And he wants the nation's sharpest talents to come to
work at CIA headquarters as intelligence analysts, information
technicians and in-house experts on everything from Afghanistan to
Zimbabwe.
 &HT;    In sum, he aims to revitalize an agency that has been mired in a
slough of despond _ terrible publicity, terrible morale, terrible
credibility.
 &HT;    ``I will not allow the CIA to become a second-rate
organization,'' Tenet told a gathering of the agency's employees
recently.
 &HT;    By most accounts, including Tenet's, the hiring blitz is the
most important internal affair on the agency's agenda for the rest
of the century. Congress will pump hundreds of millions of extra
dollars into the agency over the next few years to get new blood
flowing.
 &HT;    But success is hardly assured. With the Cold War a fading memory
and the CIA increasingly scorned as a bungling bureaucracy, who
really wants to be a spy anymore?
 &HT;    At the Ohio State job fair, the agency set up a spiffy booth
sandwiched between Chase Manhattan and a computer company. The
recruiters handed out vaguely informative pamphlets and brochures.
Fear and ignorance about the CIA were rampant, judging from
interviews with students at the fair.
 &HT;    ``People don't have a very clear idea of what they do,'' said
Tim Paradis, 22, editor of the school paper, The Lantern. ``It's a
dark government agency.'' Richelle Sherwood, 24, an Air Force
veteran who speaks Vietnamese, said, ``I don't really know a lot
about them, except they do all this secret stuff.''
 &HT;    Karl Curtis, 21, an information-systems major, was intrigued but
uninformed. ``You've heard the rumors, you've seen the movies,
you're curious about what weird things they do,'' he said. ``I
guess you'd get to know the dirty things, the cool things about the
world. And a 'top secret' clearance is a really marketable skill.''
 &HT;    Marwan Saleh, 22, wearing a brush cut and a sharp suit, stood
out. A fiercely patriotic Palestinian-American, mellifluously
fluent in Arabic, he's also a frequent visitor to the homeland, the
holder of a political-science degree _ and slated to receive an MBA
this spring in global supply and demand.
 &HT;    The CIA would fall at his feet. But he's not likely to let them.
``I'm an American Democrat,'' he said. ``I believe as an American
that it's my duty to question and help develop American policy. And
the CIA seems like it would be executing policy. And I can't blind
myself. I have my own political views.'' He moved on.
 &HT;    What's more, at the fair, even the Steak 'n' Shake recruiters
were offering salaries that pay more than most CIA entry-level
jobs. Bringing top students into the agency was no small challenge.
 &HT;    Still, the CIA's marketing push has yielded many new applicants:
the Web site and want ads draw 50,000 resumes a year. But there's a
mismatch between the people who want in and the people the agency
wants to let in. Of those who formally apply, four out of five will
never make it past an initial interview.
 &HT;    ``We are not for everybody, and everybody is not for us,'' says
Gil Medeiros, head of the CIA's newly created Recruitment Center.
``There are a fair number of resumes we have to throw away.''
 &HT;    Perhaps the biggest obstacle in recruiting young Americans, he
says, is ``the lack of awareness of history'' among them. ``It is
amazing how little they know about us.'' And most of what they know
is wrong: a jumble of ``The X-Files,'' half-remembered headlines
and good old-fashioned American paranoia. And a lot of people think
the CIA is some sort of secret police force, running around the
United States killing people with high-tech guns.
 &HT;    Once upon a time in the Cold War, the agency would never have
advertised itself. It would have been unthinkable, unnecessary,
unseemly. But when the hammer and sickle came down over the
Kremlin, the veterans of the Cold War began cleaning out their
desks.
 &HT;    Over the past six years, the CIA has lost about 4,000 of its
most experienced and skilled people: about 20 percent of its spies,
analysts, scientists and technology experts. Ten years ago, the
agency was probably 10 years ahead of the public sector when it
came to computer capability. No longer.
 &HT;    The agency desperately needs, right now, hundreds of computer
wizards comfortable with the latest technology. But competing with
the likes of Microsoft and IBM is proving increasingly difficult.
 &HT;    The decline has been most significant at the CIA's directorate
of operations _ the clandestine service, the spies who serve
abroad. At least 7 percent of the spy cadre has left the agency in
each of the past six years. That adds up to about a thousand spies,
and it leaves not many more than a thousand in place. The
departures of hundreds of officers in their 30s and 40s were
especially troubling to the CIA.
 &HT;    This same instability has permeated the agency's top brass. No
director of Central Intelligence has served for more than two years
in this decade. The whirlwind has at times left the CIA
directionless, a ship in irons. And bad publicity _ traitors
within, snafus abroad _ further angered and depressed the agency.
 &HT;    ``There were tremendous internal morale problems,'' says John M.
Deutch, Director of Central Intelligence in 1995 and 1996.
``Tremendously poor morale and tremendously poor credibility.''
 &HT;    The agency used to recruit new people through an underground
network at the best universities and officers' clubs. The
talent-spotting system it had among student bodies was unique. It
existed on every major college campus in the country _ not just
Yale (where the crew coach recruited) and Princeton (where at least
one dean did the tapping), but at the University of Texas and Holy
Cross too.
 &HT;    And mandatory military service gave the agency the ability to
sign up thousands of officers who had spent time abroad in Europe
or Asia. When the draft ended 26 years ago, the CIA lost access to
a lot of people who had experience in the military, who had
actually lived overseas.
 &HT;    In those years, the agency had an aura of mystery and power
which it may never regain. Its officers were told time and time
again that they were an elite organization and it was a badge of
honor to be recruited and selected to work in CIA.
 &HT;    But most of the people milling around at the Ohio State job fair
were born after the collapse of Saigon in 1975. The Cold War ended
when they were still kids.
 &HT;    What's more, says Milt Bearden, a retired CIA veteran: ``Their
appreciation of American history is probably from Oliver Stone
movies, or a very cursory reading of history, as Americans haven't
been forced by world events to do much with history. And so how do
they recruit today?''
 &HT;    By December, the agency had received resumes from 123 Ohio State
students, interviewed 30 and conditionally offered jobs to 18. Five
or six of those students will wind up working for the agency after
passing the lie-detector tests and the other physical and
psychological screenings that are part of life at the CIA, the
recruiters say.
 &HT;    The CIA's talent-hunters hit 50 more campuses this fall. Their
campaign generated close to 100 job applications a day. In
addition, the agency is focusing attention on the children of
ethnic Americans _ combing America's cities and the suburbs,
looking for the children of immigrants and refugees, particularly
young men and women who grew up in first-generation Asian and Arab
households, and reaching out to these potential recruits through
ads in ethnic newspapers throughout the United States.
 &HT;    The languages these people speak, and their physical appearance,
could come in handy when the CIA tries to do some of its most
important work _ penetrating nations like Iraq or North Korea _
with home-grown American spies.

ROUNDING UP A TENDER CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ I will not join in the interminable fight
over who makes the best chicken-fried steak, and who makes brown
cardboard covered with an opaque petroleum product. There is no end
to the debate. One man's chicken-fried steak is another man's razor
strop.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason I bring up chicken-fried steak at all is because
the Stock Show is in town, and if you are going to take in the
annual exhibition of big beef, you ought to consume some.
</P>
<P>
   This is cow time in Cowtown.
</P>
<P>
   If ever you should act the part of the mythical Texan, it is
now. Until Feb. 7, the last day of the Southwestern Exhibition and
Livestock Show and Rodeo, we are permitted _ expected, even _ to
dress as goofily as we like. It is OK to wear boots with
bell-bottoms, crushed straw hats with painted T-shirts, or anything
with plastic-looking turquoise and fake silver.
</P>
<P>
   If we can tie an oversized bandanna onto any of it, all the
better.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects us to look like right-off-the-range cowboys. The
Stock Show, for many visitors, is just a chance for make-believe
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But there should be some measure of authenticity. If not the way
we look, then by all means the way we eat. Chicken-fried steak is
the national dish of Texas, and a proper way to celebrate the
gathering of a lot of cows inside our city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you have seen it written that chili is the ``state dish''
of Texas, but even those who have never been to a stock show know
chili comes in a bowl, not a dish, and though Texas has its fair
share of good chili, you can also get it in several bordering
states, to say nothing of that mess they serve in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But you just try crossing the state line and finding a good
chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few rules for legitimate chicken-fried steak.
First, you must use round steak. If someone tries to pass off a cut
of meat that doesn't look like it's been run over in both lanes of
traffic, it's not the right cut for chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the gravy goes on top of the steak, not on the bottom.
You don't float a chicken-fried steak, you drown it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you serve your steak with french fries, it is quite
acceptable to let the ketchup run into the gravy. It gives it that
patriotic look.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you pan-fry or deep-fry, at least not to
me. But, I must add, those places that pan-fry generally have the
better gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are lots of good chicken-fried steak recipes
available, although you'll probably notice very little difference
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one that has some unique qualities. It uses buttermilk
and beer. The recipe is from Grady Spears' new cookbook, ``A Cowboy
in the Kitchen, Recipes From Reata and Texas West of the Pecos''
(Ten Speed Press, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   Spears is the executive chef and co-owner of Reata Restaurants,
with locations in Alpine and Fort Worth. Anyone who has eaten at
Reata knows that the food is rich in taste and comes in substantial
portions _ two other hallmarks of Texas food.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK WITH CRACKED-PEPPER GRAVY
</P>
<P>
   Yields 4
</P>
<P>
   Flour Spice:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   Batter
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Shiner Bock or any good bock beer
</P>
<P>
   2 cups peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   4 tenderized round steaks (about 1/2 pound each)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Cracked Pepper Gravy (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the flour spice by blending the flour, salt, pepper and
paprika. Set aside on a plate or wax paper. Prepare the batter by
mixing the eggs with a whisk in a large bowl. Add the buttermilk
and beer. Whisk to blend. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a deep, heavy skillet, heat the oil to 350 degrees. While the
oil is heating, prepare the round steaks by dredging them in the
flour spice, taking care to coat the meat evenly. Shake off any
excess. Dip the meat into the batter, and then again in the flour
spice, evenly coating the batter so that it is dry on the outside.
When the oil temperature reaches 350 degrees (when a drop of batter
sizzles when dropped in it), gently slide one steak into the hot
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the steak about 5 minutes. Turn it, taking care not to
break the coating, and cook the meat 5 more minutes, or until the
batter is nicely browned. Drain the cooked steak on paper towels.
Repeat with the other steaks. Hold the cooked steaks in a
225-degree oven until all four are done. Pour cracked-pepper gravy
over the steaks and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Cracked-pepper gravy:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons cracked pepper (crushed peppercorns)
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan. When the foam goes down,
whisk in the flour. Continually whisk until the flour cooks,
becoming a fragrant light brown. Slowly add the milk, continuing to
whisk to keep lumps from forming. Season with salt and pepper.
Simmer gravy for 10 minutes to cook and reduce. Serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per serving with gravy: 783 calories, 41
grams fat, 39 grams carbohydrates, 62 grams protein, 265 milligrams
cholesterol, 1,408 milligrams sodium, 47 percent of calories from

IF ONLY IT COULD TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MONTGOMERY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It traveled from Macy's menswear into Cold War Russia;
it outlived Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. Now, like
an over-the-hill pugilist who doesn't know when to quit, this
much-traveled old sheepskin coat is fighting its way through one
more Russian winter.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has fallen in love with a '55 Chevy or a favorite old
armchair knows that inanimate objects seem to have lives and
personalities. And like the proverbial walls, they could regale
listeners with spellbinding tales if only they could talk.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with this coat, which did its first tour of duty in
Moscow in the early 1970s on the back of another correspondent and
is now under my stewardship in post-Soviet Russia. During its first
tour in Russia, it had close encounters with Russian dissidents,
menacing KGB agents, an inebriated sea captain and the gray-visaged
men of Russia's Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after its Moscow debut, though tired and
tattered, it bears witness to Russia's Great Depression and the
final days of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, who knows? After all, it has repeatedly endured
things that thwarted the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf
Hitler: Russia's cold and snow.
</P>
<P>
   The coat was bought in 1970 by Jim Peipert, who then was a New
York-based Associated Press newsman headed for a new assignment in
Moscow. In those days before Gore-Tex, Windbloc and other high-tech
fabrics, he wanted something to fend off the Arctic blasts. So he
paid a visit to Macy's department store in New York and, for about
$99, came away with a huge sheepskin coat.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's advertised it as a ``Turkish army officer's coat,'' and
it boldly looked the part: eggshell-white suede stretching from
knee to neck, thick fleece inside, deep canvas pockets on each
side, and an immense fleece collar that could be turned up to ward
off the fiercest wind.
</P>
<P>
   Jim wore it during the Cold War as a U.S. correspondent in the
Soviet Union of Leonid Brezhnev from 1970 to 1974. He wore it to
Red Square for parades of Soviet tanks and missiles and to
late-night street-corner meetings with Russian dissidents and
Jewish ``refuseniks'' _ frequently under the watchful eye of the
secret police.
</P>
<P>
   The coat traveled with Jim and his family to postings in London;
Johannesburg, South Africa; and Nairobi, Kenya. But in those more
moderate climes, the coat stayed in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The coat was just a distant memory when Jim came to Fort Worth
at the end of 1986 to become an editor for the Star-Telegram. The
coat stayed hidden in the back of a closet, too fine a piece of
apparel to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, I was assigned to become Moscow correspondent
for Knight Ridder Newspapers, the Star-Telegram's parent company,
and the Turkish army officer's coat was suddenly destined for a
second stint in Moscow. One evening at the Peiperts' home in Fort
Worth, Jim resurrected the coat from the closet as a gift to wear
on my new assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a beautiful dove gray,'' observed my wife, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, actually,'' said Jim's wife, Mary Ellen, ``it's supposed
to be white.''
</P>
<P>
   A scouring at the cleaners removed only the surface layer of
nearly three decades of grime. After that, the coat headed back to
Russia. It was too bulky to carry _ weighing about as much as three
hefty Sunday newspapers _ so we shipped it for more than $100,
nearly the price of a new coat. It quickly resumed its utilitarian
role as I confronted Russia's harshest winter in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   I began wearing it everywhere. Thanks to the coat's sheer bulk,
it is as warm as any modern cold-weather gear. But in the New
Russia, where trendy Finnish stores peddle goosedown imports, my
``tulupchik'' (sheepskin) had become an oddity. I looked like a
polar bear, and wherever I went, Russians and Westerners alike
never failed to gawk. I never knew if I was making a fashion
statement or a fashion faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   One night at a Moscow party, I met Chicago Tribune correspondent
Michael McGuire, who first worked in Moscow in the early 1970s. We
discovered that we had a mutual friend, Peipert, and I told him
that I was now the guardian of Jim's old ``tulupchik.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore that coat!'' he exclaimed. The garment, he recalled,
was the envy of the tight circle of American correspondents, and in
January 1974 he asked to borrow it for a trip to Murmansk for a
story on the Soviet Union's Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving, McGuire and Los Angeles Times correspondent
Murray Seegar were invited to the cabin of a fishing boat captain.
In true Russian tradition, the vodka began flowing. McGuire
obligingly matched the captain drink for drink. To refuse would
have been an insult.
</P>
<P>
   Two bottles later, they were reeling. Two subordinates carried
the captain to an unknown part of the ship, and McGuire was
escorted into the captain's cabin, where he collapsed on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   He still had the presence of mind to drape the ``tulupchik''
over his head _ not so much to stay warm but to avoid being
photographed in a drunken state. Back then, ubiquitous KGB agents
were notorious for photographing American journalists in
compromising situations.
</P>
<P>
   During the night, as the bed started spinning, McGuire became
miserably sick, and the ``tulupchik'' was the unfortunate
receptacle. He scrubbed it the next day, paid for a professional
cleaning when he returned to Moscow and gave it back to Peipert,
sheepishly explaining the mishap.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades after performing noble service for at
least two Moscow correspondents, the coat endures. But its days may
be numbered. The impressive fur collar hangs by a fragment,
resembling a dead animal, and fleece is protruding from gaping
holes in the suede.
</P>
<P>
   I fear that the chemicals from the last dry-cleaning might have
upset a delicate ecological balance. But I plan to wear it proudly
to the end before I replace it with some latter-day upstart from a
mail-order catalog. After that, perhaps it belongs in a museum.  &QL;

<P>
   Bill Clinton's optimistic State of the Union address and his
promise of a New Dawn for America are stirring new debate over the
likelihood of his continued presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged to this debate, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
``Bill Clinton's Legacy (The First Draft),'' a five-part series
adapted from Jacob Weisberg's prescient article in The New York
Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART I: BILL CLINTON'S LEGACY: THE FIRST DRAFT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents
something that is truly historic _ a break in the way the American
presidency functions. He has changed the nature of the presidency,
removed its heroic mandate and downsized the office as demanded by
the historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART II: BILL CLINTON: THE GOVERNOR-PRESIDENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his concern with Social Security, welfare, health insurance,
the minimum wage and other issues generally thought of in
connection with state government, President Clinton has made the
Oval Office into a kind of extended governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _ PART III: HOW BILL CLINTON CREATED A DEMOCRATIC COALITION &LR;  &QL;
</P>

   Bill Clinton's optimistic State of the Union address and his

TRUE SUPERMARKET IS WHAT'S IN STORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grocery stores have become food for serious corporate thought.
</P>
<P>
   Why go through the hassle of a trip to the grocery store when
you can get a complete meal at 7-Eleven or by driving past a window
where dinner is delivered in a bag? Americans are spending about 50
cents of every food dollar on vittles prepared by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   United Supermarkets thinks it has an answer for those who ponder
the question, whither the American grocery store? For some of those
average shoppers who make 2.2 trips to the grocery store a week (50
percent of them on Saturday or Sunday mornings), shopping is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of United Supermarkets? Well, you would have if you
lived in Quanah, Amarillo or Abilene, Texas cities where the
Lubbock-based 38-store chain has grocery stores. And you certainly
would have if you lived in Wichita Falls, where the company's new
concept, United Market Street, has opened to rave reviews. How
often does a mayor write to thank a chain for opening a grocery
store that isn't an urban renewal project?
</P>
<P>
   It is busy customers such as Her Honor Kay Yeager who appreciate
swinging through a grocery store, buying a meal that needs only to
be reheated or tossed (think brisket with three vegetables, King
Ranch casserole or bagged salad in its own mixing bowl), and
gassing up their car in the parking lot. They're on their way home
in moments. At United Market Street, home-meal replacement is taken
to places it has never been before.
</P>
<P>
   Home-meal replacement (and because it's the food of the future,
it would be nice if someone would come up with a more appetizing
name) has made strides in the 1990s. The Eatzi's concept, pioneered
in Dallas by Phil Romano, is probably the Tiffany of the genre,
offering hundreds of meal combinations that require only reheating,
if that. More mainstream stores are trying to expand in that
direction, but apart from rotisserie chicken, fried chicken, fairly
ordinary vegetables, salads and the occasional sushi tray, the
options are often better in the frozen-food case.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps big cities are the wrong place to look for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all watching the same CNN these days,'' says United's
director of marketing, Renee Underwood. ``People in the Lubbocks
and the Abilenes want the same things that people in big cities
want. And their lives are just as stressful, with two parents
working and children to get to practices and rehearsals.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of United Market Street in October took a
combination of design and manpower effort. Much of the signage and
design was handled by DSArts, a Dallas company that developed a
Disneyland Main Street concept of a bakery, pizza parlor, coffee
shop, grill and deli.
</P>
<P>
   Finding enough trained workers to fill the 270-person employment
roster was another chore. It was going to take more than stockers
and checkers to prepare all that go-and-heat food. The company
created a corporate chef position, and recruited workers from the
food service industry to work all the to-go sections of the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a supermarket that is affordable, convenient and,
well, rather Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   If it's the family you need to feed, order a fresh pizza, ready
for the oven. (Or soothe your own savage breast by paying $2.98 for
two baked slices and a soft drink.) Or get the sliced brisket
family meal for $6.99 or a rotisserie chicken (properly trussed, we
might add) for $5.49.
</P>
<P>
   For true Texas flavors, buy Texas caviar (marinated black-eyed
peas) for $3.99 a pound, or train wreck (a goulashlike concoction)
for $3.99 a pound. If you don't have the time for the servers to
dish up a portion, grab the preboxed version of the same item,
which includes microwave instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vegetable section displays a meal to go. Three
varieties of salad (Santa Fe, Italian dry salami and Caesar) come
packed in large bowls, perfect to toss with dressing and croutons,
at a cost of two for $5. Displayed right below the salads are their
natural partners, pastas. Packaged to go straight from the
microwave to the table, the pastas are mushroom marinara, tomato
Parmesano and broccoli Alfredo, again at two for $5. A combination
of the two items would easily serve four people.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for the folks who want to dash and dine, there is a
separate cash register in the ``market street'' area. If you miss
that one, there's another register in the main body of the grocery
store reserved for meal-to-go customers.
</P>
<P>
   Home-meal replacement isn't the only niche United Market Street
is filling. All of the ordinary groceries _ the necessities of
everyday life such as toilet paper, bathtub cleanser and boxed
macaroni and cheese _ are there, too. And the bonus is, they are
arranged in a consumer-friendly, instead of a Pavlovian, manner.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently purchased items in a grocery store,
according to the nonprofit Food Institute, are milk, fresh eggs and
refrigerated juices and beverages. For that reason, most
supermarkets position those items in the boondocks of the store _
far back in refrigerated corners that can be reached only by
passing scads of potential impulse buys.
</P>
<P>
   But not at United Market Street. At the front of the store,
right by the bank of cash registers, is a convenience store-size
cooler stocked only with milk, eggs and juice.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the very front of the store are diapers, both children's
and adults'. Now parents can rush in with the squirming offspring
and get out quickly. And embarrassed adults are not forced to
parade through the store with their purchase in the cart.
</P>
<P>
   For the poor consumer who drags himself out of bed during the
cold and flu season, right there on the end of an aisle, next to
the cash registers, is an assortment of cough medicine, aspirin,
antihistamines and throat lozenges _ in
</P>
<P>
   child and adult strengths.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmacy, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of a
supermarket's business, is usually shoved to a far wall or corner,
making it a trek for the ill and infirm. Invariably, there's a wait
for the prescription, and if there is a seat at all, it's generally
attached to the blood pressure machine and faces an attractive wall
of crutches and corn patches.
</P>
<P>
   At United Market Street, the pharmacy is at the front of the
store, a bench is provided, and the view is of the floral market.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, one day, all grocery stores will have such a rosy
outlook.  &QL;

USER'S GUIDE: TOWARD A TABLE ETIQUETTE UPGRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 BY MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I had not viewed the wreckage my three brothers routinely
created in restaurants when we were little, I would probably not be
so concerned about my own children's table manners.
</P>
<P>
   One day in the early 1970s, I was a witness to the creation of
the Mashed Potato Graveyard. As a waitress looked on in horror, my
brothers ingeniously used such everyday materials as toothpicks,
packets of sugar and an innocent vegetable side dish to create a
complicated scale model of a rural cemetery we had recently visited
on vacation. Even now, I shudder at the memory of the powerful
imagery evoked by the rivulets of ``blood'' (that is, gravy)
running down the sides of each mounded ``grave'' (potatoes).
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder why my parents didn't step in, I can only say in
their defense that they tried. These days, as I observe my own
daughters, as their haphazard attempts to saw through food set off
terrible chain reactions of spilled milk and splashed gravy, I can
appreciate the scope of the parental challenge. Entreating Zoe, 9,
and Ella, 7, to keep their elbows off the table, I hear in my voice
an echo of my mother's tone as she begged her sons, ``If nothing
else, at least remove your meat from your sister's hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience was a virtue for my mother, who had few other options.
But I have become a parent in an exciting time; I have at my
disposal a child-rearing tool called software. One night last week,
an incident in my home (involving Oreo cookies being mashed
frantically in a glass of milk) convinced me that it was time to
install some help.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner the next day, I set an extra place at the kitchen
table _ for my husband's IBM Thinkpad. Then I called in my family.
As my daughters skidded into their seats and assumed their usual
mealtime postures _ chairs tilted waaaaaay back to balance
precariously on two legs, unused napkins languishing beside the
plates _ Ella pointed at the computer and asked, ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guest,'' I said, explaining that I had installed Cook'n for
Kids, a CD-ROM from DVO Enterprises that tries to teach children
all about food, including, er, social skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are our table manners really that bad?'' Zoe asked.
</P>
<P>
   I solemnly nodded yes, opened the program and called up the
learning screen. A video clip appeared, showing DVO's president,
Dan Oaks, riding across the screen on a giant spatula, his
besneakered feet dangling in midair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, that looks like really good manners,'' Zoe observed
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the possibility of an insurrection, I explained my
plan. As questions of etiquette arose during our meal (beef
stroganoff over noodles with a side dish of steamed broccoli), we
would consult the computer for a ruling. I showed them how the left
side of the computer screen displayed a list of etiquette
questions, covering topics like posture, proper use of utensils and
mealtime courtesy. Clicking on a question calls up an appropriate
answer on the other half of the screen. ``She wants us to be Miss
Manners,'' Ella said, spearing a noodle with her fork and sucking
it into her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aha,'' I said, moving the cursor down the left side of the
screen. ``Your behavior raises an interesting question. `When can I
start eating?' Perhaps you would like to read the answer, Ella?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting until everyone at your table is served is _ '' She
dissolved into giggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, is that bad manners, giggling with your mouth full?'' Zoe
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' I said, frantically scrolling through the questions,
which suddenly did not seem so comprehensive. ``The most relevant
topic seems to be, `Should I contribute to the table conversation?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Mimicking a professor, Zoe read, `` `Mealtimes are a great time
to talk about pleasant subjects.' '' Ella giggled even louder,
prompting Zoe to laugh so hard that she dropped her fork onto the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   My husband raised his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rude to raise your hand at the table!'' Zoe shrieked,
pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have an etiquette question?'' I asked my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes: Is it rude to read from a computer screen at supper?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the meal, my family shouted questions that the
program could not parry, like, ``Is it rude to snort milk out your
nose if you are in the school cafeteria and the only people who can
see are other kids?'' ``When Uncle Danny built the Mashed Potato
Graveyard, would he have been more polite if he hadn't turned the
salt shaker upside down in the potatoes to make a headstone?'' and
``Which cultures want you to burp at the end of the meal if you
enjoyed it?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as I scraped errant, drying noodles off the floor, I
realized that my children had tuned out the CD-ROM as instinctively
as they ignored my exhortations. The reason? We both relied solely
on words to try to make our points, and table manners, like most
manners, are best learned by following another's example. What if
the program had instead offered visual object lessons?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the program already utilized video clips to
demonstrate cooking techniques to kids. So instead of saying
``Don't gag yourself,'' the program could have been much more
effective if it had shown a video clip of Oaks while he was choking
on a meatball the size of a tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I helpfully phoned Oaks to suggest revisions.
``That's a great idea,'' he said. ``In fact, we had someone
approach us recently who had developed a manners video. It had a
whole section of table manners, and we've been thinking of bundling
that with the program as an add-on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oaks couldn't say when the improved version might be
available in stores. I'm afraid it will arrive too late to help me.
My daughters want mashed potatoes for dinner tonight.

AIR FORCE STUDY COULD LEAD TO JOB REDUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A cost-cutting study could trim military and
civilian jobs at Air Force bases in Alabama, Mississippi and Texas,
Air Force officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Gen. Lloyd W. ``Fig'' Newton, commander of the Air
Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base, on
Tuesday described the so-called A-76 studies as ``good business''
and ``good government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's competitive sourcing and privatization effort
will scrutinize 27,000 military and civilian jobs throughout the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and the Boeing Co.
likely will bid for base support work, but the Air Force will
continue to perform such core tasks as recruiting and training.
</P>
<P>
   A-76 studies already are under way at Maxwell Air Force Base in
Montgomery, Ala., and at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.
Similar reviews will be conducted at Columbus Air Force Base in
Mississippi and Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas,
and at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much money the studies are expected to save at the five
bases isn't known, said Dave Smith, a spokesman for the Air
Education and Training Command.
</P>
<P>
   The service plans to any savings to buy high-tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Lackland ``A-76'' study, which began Tuesday, could reduce
the 1,675-member military and civilian work force by one-fourth in
the spring of 2001, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro D. Rodriguez, a member of the House National Security
Committee that oversees military affairs, said that while the
cost-cutting studies boost efficiency and save money, they also
carry a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it does hurt,'' said Rodriguez, D-Texas. ``Just
like the analogy of losing weight, it's bothersome and it hurts,
but in the long run it's a bit more healthier and a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph will be the last of five bases scrutinized, with its
work force of 1,400 possibly reduced in mid-2003.

TEEN-PREGNANCY PROJECT OFFERS GLIMMER OF HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think sometimes about the teen-age mothers I met while living
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Their names escape me now, but I've never forgotten the reasons
they gave for wanting to have babies: to prove to their boyfriends
that they loved them, because they wanted someone to love, someone
to love them.
</P>
<P>
   Because I had spent much of my entire adolescent years trying to
make sure I didn't get pregnant, this never made much sense to me.
I did appreciate, however, wanting to be loved.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I am haunted by the hungry tone of their voices, by their
unsophisticated but old-before-their-time manner. And I am
disturbed by this yearning that lingers still in another
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia McAlister, community educator for Planned Parenthood of
North Texas, understands my sentiments. The stories haven't changed
much, if at all, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hear that,'' McAlister said. ``I hear kids say things
like, `I didn't think it would happen to me.' Some of it is this
same old thing that having someone's baby proves you love them,
that it somehow gives you power in their life.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers I met in Sacramento are well into their 20s now,
but I was reminded of them recently while talking with a group of
volunteers with the local Birthing Project, a national organization
that seeks to lower the mortality rate among infants of teen-age
mothers, especially African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I was curious about their experiences with the project and
wanted to know if those have been what they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   My own experiences have not.
</P>
<P>
   My goal as the local project's coordinator had been the same as
the national office's, and to a great extent we've been successful
in meeting that goal. Out of the 16 girls who have gone through the
project, 13 have had healthy babies. Three more are still due.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that keeps eating at me, though, is the number of
young mothers in the project who lack a stable, loving home. They
are like npmads, staying one night with their baby's father,
another with their mother and still another with a grandmother or
aunt. Sometimes, because their mothers are nowhere to be found and
their fathers are prison, they must stay with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do case management, but what I can tell you is there
are multiple issues going on in their lives, and pregnancy is just
one of them,'' McAlister said.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems, she said, range from troubled relationships to
child abuse to neglect to abandonment by one or both parents. My
experiences with the Birthing Project bear this out.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, I shared my concerns with the project's
volunteers, and they could only nod their heads in agreement. They
had their stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the circumstances, love seemed the least common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   And so I was relieved by Maria Tilley's story. When she first
met the 15-year-old she mentors, the teen-ager would barely lift
her head to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to go like this, and just answer `Yes, ma'am, Yes
ma'am,' '' Maria recalled, looking into her lap. ``Now she holds
her head up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other night she said to me that `You always say
you're praying for me and my baby. I prayed for my mom to get a
good night's sleep, and she did.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maria smiles, and quiet falls around the table. We bask in her
seeming success. Then she says, ``Working for married and engaged
couples was rewarding, but I really feel like I'm making a
difference in this child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we can't solve all of their problems, but imagine what
Maria Tilley feels like for having loved this child _ who so
desperately needed it _ enough to try.  &QL;

<P>
   And they're off!
</P>
<P>
   It was Tomlin's Flag by four lengths one day not long ago, as
the ponies rounded the turn of the Aqueduct horse racing track in
New York. The few thousand gamblers at the track weren't the only
ones anxiously watching the dust fly. Thanks to a specially
designed computer network, thoroughbred fans across the country
could be focused on the very same race.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical Saturday afternoon, Aqueduct pulls in about $1.4
million from gamblers at the track, $3.1 million from elsewhere in
the state and $5.6 million from out of state. With a computerized
betting network like the one employed by the New York Racing
Association, betting from afar is easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an explosion in interstate wagering,'' said Bill
Nader, director of broadcast communications for the New York Racing
Association. The association's three New York area tracks _
Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga _ earned more than $1 billion
in interstate revenue from New York and other states in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Off-track betting in New York began in the mid-1970s. Bets were
recorded then on magnetic tape, and information was manually
entered into Aqueduct's database; OTBs relied solely on radio
broadcasts for updated information. Around that time, the racing
association's tracks switched from an electromechanical wagering
system, which had to be updated manually, to an electronic one
called a Totalizator (the current system is provided by Autotote,
in New York City).
</P>
<P>
   This high-powered computer, nicknamed Tote, has doubled its
transaction rate since 1985; it can now process several hundred
transactions per second.
</P>
<P>
   At Aqueduct, a 40-year-old track, the Tote resides in the
windowless basement of the clubhouse. During a race, the Tote
monitors the wagers at Aqueduct as well as at the nearly 800 OTB
parlors linked nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   At the track, gamblers have three choices for placing a bet.
Throughout the clubhouse are ticket-issuing machines, called TIMs,
with touch screens. They are somewhat similar to an automated
teller machine at a bank; a gambler simply punches in the type of
bet, the horse and the amount of the wager, then receives a ticket
recording the bet.
</P>
<P>
   If the gambler is lucky, that ticket can be redeemed for cash
after the race. Gamblers can open accounts and use bar-coded cards
and PINs to get access to the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller ticketing machines, called Tiny TIMs, are in the
clubhouse restaurant. And for those who would rather deal with
people _ and judging by the length of the lines, there seem to be
plenty of those _ clerks are ready to dole out tickets and
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Tote system continually polls the wagering stations at
Aqueduct and elsewhere. Rather than running all 800 OTBs through
one machine, data traffic is managed by 65 hubs, each handling a
dozen or so OTBs.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 3,500 gamblers who have personal accounts with
the racing association can place bets over the telephone. They can
still see the races because races are simulcast on cable television
in the city and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And since last June, live audio feeds of the races have been
available from Broadcast.com; a link to the broadcasts can be found
on the New York Racing Association Web site at www.nyra.com.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming video is expected soon as well. By moving to the
On-Line Past Performances page at the Web site, a surfer who pays a
small fee can also get detailed race information.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a gambler can open an account with the racing
association, get race information from the association's Web site,
place a bet over the phone, then listen to the race on the Net.
It's not Internet gambling _ which is, of course, still illegal in
the United States _ but it is gambling that makes use of the
Internet for information purposes. Bets are placed over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Dhanoa, the racing association's director of information
systems, said the group was exploring the idea of using an
interactive broadcast system called ODS, for on-demand system. With
ODS, a set-top television box would pipe in live simulcasts of
races and allow a gambler to use a remote control to place
on-screen bets. ODS would require state regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Such innovations might increase the profits of thoroughbred
racing and make the sport more accessible, but they just can't
capture the thrill of being there. What fun is winning a bet if
there's no stranger to high-five?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steven Ahn and his housemate, Pekka Kauranen, didn't
expect to spend much time hunting for a place to rent. But as they
went from open house to open house, their hopes began to dim.
``Everyone was there before us, in hot pursuit,'' Ahn said.
</P>
<P>
   So, when they saw a good-size two-bedroom loft a short distance
north of Houston Street, near Broadway, they leapt at the $3,000 a
month the landlord was asking.
</P>
<P>
   But in Manhattan these days, finding the rental apartment you
want is only the beginning. Ahn, 25, and Kauranen, 27, both
bankers, soon found themselves in a bidding war _ for a rental _
and by the time the dust had settled, the two had agreed to pay
$300 a month more than the asking price and pledged to put up one
month's rent and three months' security in advance. They had also
produced the financial credentials that made them acceptable
candidates to pay that rent.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the young bankers had their documentation already
prepared, including bank-account balances and a sampling of
references. The landlord then proceeded to scrutinize their
application, the type of scrutiny once reserved for co-op board
applications in Park Avenue buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In this winter of 1999, fewer Manhattan rents than ever are
firmly regulated. Under new laws passed in 1997, more than 3,000
apartment rents have been deregulated. Many new apartment buildings
do not fall under rent regulations. Furthermore, within the last
year, thousands of co-op and condo owners have decided to sublease
their apartments _ at any price the market will bear. And agents
say there are hundreds of apartments available in buildings that
were built without rent regulations in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Rents in all of these are increasingly likely to be bid up. One
studio on West 78th Street started out at $1,000 a month, said
Bridget Smalley, the rentals manager at Manhattan Apartments, a
large agency. ``It lasted five seconds,'' she said. ``It went up to
$1,350 in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current market, studios rent for an average of $1,505 a
month and two bedrooms for an average of $3,895, according to a
report just released by Halstead Property Co., another large firm.
If the apartment is desirable _ with good space, good views and,
above all, if it is offered at a fair price _ there may well be a
bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the price is agreed upon, there may be more stress
for the prospective renter. Brokers say landlords are looking for
excuses to get an extra month or two in a security deposit. ``One
month is standard, but if somebody's from Canada or there's a
glitch in somebody's credit, the landlords will make a grab for one
or even two months extra,'' Ms. Smalley said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with just about any rental apartment now, the renters
have to be prepared with elaborate documentation of their income
and credit history. In rare cases, reference letters are requested
for renters' pets.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, said brokers interviewed for this article,
landlords tended to take the first qualified person who walked in
the door. Now, landlords are apt to take applications and study
them for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Renting an apartment was once a clear alternative for the person
who didn't have the money or the credentials to buy one, said
Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, a
mid-size Manhattan real estate company that handles both rentals
and sales. But now, he continued, buying can be cheaper than
renting, especially figuring in the tax deductions. And renting, he
said, may no longer even be easier, because of the newly necessary
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   For the best apartments _ from Greenwich Village studios to
Fifth Avenue four-bedrooms _ there are often multiple bids. At 45
Fifth Ave., a prewar building at 11th Street, four people were
bidding on a co-op sublease, said George Arana, a Halstead agent.
The apartment's owner wanted the man who offered a year's rent up
front. But the co-op board, which must approve all subleases,
turned the man down.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Bell, another Halstead rental agent, said she watched one
Soho loft, on Crosby Street, listed at $4,500, edge up by $50
increments to $4,900. ``There were people who offered more, but the
owner just decided to cut it off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conn Fishburn, 25, an advertising strategist, said he has grown
sick of ``greedy landlords'' _ and of what he called ``real-estate
broker manipulation.'' Fishburn and his roommate, Tony Ivins, a
currency trader, had picked out a large place on Ann Street in the
financial district and tried to sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story kept changing,'' he said. ``Then, they tried to
raise the rent because I said my girlfriend might be staying with
me. Then, they wanted two months' security deposit, which I thought
was outrageous. With the broker's fee, it was going to be $10,000
we'd have to put down. That was bad enough, but then they wanted
more!''
</P>
<P>
   Fishburn walked away from the deal. Eventually, he found a
smaller apartment, a little over 1,000 square feet, in a new
building at the edge of Battery Park City. He saw the sign on the
side of the building, so he didn't have to pay a broker's fee. He
and Ivins, who have moved in but as yet have no furniture, are
paying $3,215 a month. And they have a terrific view of Ellis
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' Fishburn said.
</P>
<P>
   As Fishburn found out, not every apartment is the subject of a
bidding war. Within the last few months, some landlords _ mainly in
the city's newest rental buildings _ have started offering
concessions to renters.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Gershwin, at 250 W. 50th St., and the Paramount, at 240
E. 39th St., two brand new rental towers. In both buildings, the
landlords are offering tenants one month's free rent to sign a
lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do that because their rents are so high,'' Ms.
Smalley said. At the Gershwin, for example, one-bedrooms rent for
between $2,375 and $3,000, and two-bedrooms run as high as $5,200.
``The landlords have to do something. There's still a lot of people
who want to rent out there, but for the first time in years, they
can take their pick of five new buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for rental apartments these days need almost as much
documentation as buyers of co-ops. Brokers who specialize in rental
apartments advise their clients to bring along as many of the
following as possible:
</P>
<P>
   _ Most recent W-2 form.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax returns for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recent letter from employer verifying that the prospective
renter is employed and, if possible, that he or she will continue
to be.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay stubs showing yearly incomes of roughly 40 to 50 times the
monthly rent. If the apartment rents for $3,000 a month, landlords
and owners increasingly want to see $120,000 a year in salaries,
says Chuck Pinnix, an agent at Halstead Property Co. If the
candidate does not have this much income, a guarantor must produce
documents showing an income of 80 to 100 times the monthly rent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A credit report or a check for the fee to have a credit check
done. (If there are any problems in a credit history, the
prospective renter must write a letter of explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Reference letters, business and personal, including one from
the current landlord, saying the candidate is never late with a
rent check.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recent statements from checking, savings and investment
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also heard _ no kidding _ of pet reference letters,''
Pinnix said. ``They do everything but check your fillings!''

CRITIC'S PICKS FOR 50 TOP SCREEN LEGENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I received my invitation last year to be a juror for the
American Film Institute's poll selecting the ``100 greatest
Hollywood films of the century,'' I somehow managed to misplace my
ballot, and then forget about it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know that President Clinton and Newt Gingrich also
were on the jury, that the poll would be the movie event of 1998,
and that the list would become a whole new reference point for
movie history.
</P>
<P>
   I still lie awake nights thinking that, had I voted, I might
have been the factor that bumped ``Pulp Fiction'' (No. 95) to a
notch on the scale below ``The Searchers'' (No. 96). If only, if
only ...
</P>
<P>
   So when I received my ballot and voting instructions for the
sequel, ``AFI's 100 Years, 100 Stars'' _ a poll selecting the 50
top film legends (25 men, 25 women, who will be revealed in a June
8 CBS special featuring appearances by 50 of today's greatest
stars, hence the ``100 Stars'') _ trust me, this time I took the
responsibility very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And the task seemed, at first anyway, easy _ given the strict
criteria: star quality (or mythic persona), craft (acting skill),
legacy (body of work), popularity (over time) and historical
context (place in the cultural history of the 20th century.)
</P>
<P>
   The AFI let me know right off that it didn't want a list of my
esoteric personal favorites; it wanted a list of movie stars that
are likely to live forever in the collective unconsciousness _ the
mythos _ of our culture.
</P>
<P>
   That's a list your cocker spaniel could probably come up with,
right? The icons. Bogart, Dean, Monroe, Gable, Garbo, Stewart,
Bette Davis ... then maybe Brando, Newman, Beatty, Hoffman, Pacino,
Nicholson, Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! There's a catch. The candidates must have made a movie
before 1950 or be dead. So John Belushi can be a legend and Sean
Connery can't. Divine and Sabu are candidates but Paul Newman and
Clint Eastwood are not.
</P>
<P>
   Also, after the dozen obvious choices in each gender, it's not
so easy. Who do you pick: James Mason or James Cagney? Judy Garland
or Judy Holliday? Alan Ladd or Lassie? (Actually, I picked none of
the above.)
</P>
<P>
   The following are the stars I did pick. And before you click
your e-mail button, I know, I know. No Shirley Temple. No Ingrid
Bergman. Where is Marlene Dietrich? No Mary Pickford, for crying
out loud. What can I be thinking of?
</P>
<P>
   The men:
</P>
<P>
   1. Clark Gable _ No star in all of cinema has the masculine
appeal of this ex-Portland shoe salesman with the big ears, killer
grin and curiously expressive mustache. No star has ever appealed
more evenly to both men and women. He's still the King of the
Movies.
</P>
<P>
   2. Humphrey Bogart _ There's no denying the powerful lingering
appeal of Bogie, the movies' surly embodiment of downbeat cynicism.
Something about the man's persona speaks to us down through the
decades in a way few other movie stars do.
</P>
<P>
   3. Marlon Brando _ Along with Montgomery Clift, this instinctive
genius (there's no other word for him) brought in a new kind of
brooding sexuality and a whole new acting style _ the Method _ to
American films of the '50s, and completely redefined the contours
of male stardom.
</P>
<P>
   4. James Stewart _ Capra's Mr. Smith, bumbling screwball
comedian, star of the grittiest westerns of the '50s, triumphant
fighter of lost causes, the great American Everyman _ his name
belongs near the top of any list of Hollywood immortals.
</P>
<P>
   5. Douglas Fairbanks Sr. _ One of greatest treats I had in 1998
was watching a Paramount Theatre audience fall madly in love _
love! _ with this star at a revival showing of the 1920 ``Mark of
Zorro.'' His bouncy, devil-may-care panache is synonymous with the
word ``swashbuckler.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Gregory Peck _ If the only role this always underrated star
with the world's most mellow voice ever played was Atticus Finch in
``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' I'd still want him on my list. But he
also made a dozen other classics over four decades, comprising one
of film's greatest bodies of work.
</P>
<P>
   7. Edward G. Robinson _ This squat, genuinely ugly Romanian-born
actor is my choice as the consummate male movie actor of the sound
era, a man who could play a brutal gangster or meek bookkeeper and
always be the most riveting person on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   8. Buster Keaton _ No films of the silent era hold up as well as
the brilliantly conceived comedies of this sad little deadpan,
knockabout comic who co-wrote and directed his best films and
possessed an uncanny understanding of what worked best for him.
</P>
<P>
   9. Cary Grant _ He disguised his poverty-striken roots, dropped
his real name (Archie Leach) and transformed himself into the
suavest, wittiest, most distinctively urbane man the movies ever
produced. No star ever made it look easier.
</P>
<P>
   10. John Wayne _ The only movie star to have a major municipal
airport named after him, the Duke worked his way up from B-cowboy
movies to become the most consistently popular male actor of the
sound era and the main focus of Hollywood's greatest mythological
cycle: the John Ford westerns.
</P>
<P>
   11. Charles Chaplin _ The first true international superstar of
the movies, Chaplin elevated the craft of silent-screen comedy from
clumsy pratfalls to a subtle and layered art form that reached its
peak of brilliance in his silent masterpieces of the late '20s and
early '30s.
</P>
<P>
   12. Gary Cooper _ In the '30s and '40s, he reflected America's
best image of itself _ the shy, quick-to-anger country boy of
``Sergeant York'' _ and yet made a startling transition to a more
insecure, guilt-ridden figure who was a perfect reflection of the
confused America of the postwar '50s.
</P>
<P>
   13. Rudolph Valentino _ He was the first male sex symbol of the
movies, the first ethnic sexual threat to America's WASP majority,
and the first star to prove that dying young can be a great career
move. Though his image is mostly played for laughs today, he is
still amazingly charismatic on film.
</P>
<P>
   14. Errol Flynn _ Think of that scene in the 1936 ``Adventures
of Robin Hood'' when King John's stooge asks Robin, ``Do you speak
treason?'' and Flynn as Robin spits back, ``Fluently!'' Who else
could make that one word so magical? Flynn was the great
rascal/swashbuckler of the sound era.
</P>
<P>
   15. Tyrone Power _ The only truly beautiful man on this list, he
had a spiritual sincerity, a larger-than-life grandeur and a sheer
likeability that made him more than just a pretty face. Through
several key career transitions, he was the most consistently
popular star in the history of 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   16. Frank Sinatra _ One theory says the essence of stardom in
the sound era is in the ``character'' of the voice _ which explains
why so many singers become movies stars, even if they're as
funny-looking as Streisand, Bing Crosby or this greatest of the
singer/stars: the Chairman of the Board.
</P>
<P>
   17. Yul Brynner _ This Russian-born, ex-folk singer had a bald
head, the movies' most graceful walk and two signature roles in two
different genres: the King of Siam in ``The King and I'' and the
head gunfighter of ``The Magnificent Seven.'' He was one of a kind,
and absolutely mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   18. James Dean _ He only starred in three films, but like
Marilyn and Bogie, the ripples of his impact are so great he
remains a supreme icon of the movies: the first sexually insecure
troubled youth and the spiritual father of all rebels without a
cause of every subsequent generation.
</P>
<P>
   19. Henry Fonda _ From what his children say, Hank wasn't a bit
like the characters he played, but _ from Tom Joad to Young Mr.
Lincoln to Mr. Roberts _ he embodied a certain common-sense,
Midwestern set of values that makes his performances as appealing
and inspiring as a trip to Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   20. Burt Lancaster _ He may have had the movies' all-time most
infectious grin, he was as adept at swashbuckling (``The Crimson
Pirate'') as he was at heavy drama (``Elmer Gantry''), and _ like
Gable _ he had a masculine presence that women loved and men wanted
to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   21. Sidney Poitier _ In retrospect, he seems a bit
one-dimensional and stagey, and he never really learned to play
comedy, but Poitier commanded the screen with precision and
dignity, and as the first major black Hollywood star, his impact on
cinema was profound.
</P>
<P>
   22. Robert Mitchum _ He survived a drug scandal in the '40s to
become a droopy-eyed, tough-guy star of westerns, war movies, film
noirs and Hollywood blockbusters, and everyone's favorite
laid-back, bad boy of the next four decades. He also was the best
movie-star dialectician of them all.
</P>
<P>
   23. Ronald Reagan _ Invariably dismissed by his enemies as a
``B-movie actor,'' the Gipper was a star for 26 years, and
projected his screen persona _ tough, no-nonsense, quintessential
American honesty _ beyond Hollywood and into two terms as U.S.
president. Now, that's a screen legend.
</P>
<P>
   24. Steve McQueen _ No star of the '60s constructed a more
consistent body of work or crystalized that peculiarly '60s brand
of existential cool as this incorrigible maverick who turned his
back on Hollywood at the peak of his popularity to spend his last
years as a recluse.
</P>
<P>
   25. Kirk Douglas _ With his razor smile, dimpled chin and
con-man manner, this star vibrated with an intensity that made him
unforgettable as prototypical postwar heels, men of principle and
historical characters as diverse as Doc Holliday, Vincent van Gogh
and Spartacus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   And the women:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bette Davis _ One of the cinema's true originals, this never
especially attractive, snarlingly tough woman with a gash of a
mouth and a perpetually dangling cigarette, was somehow,
inexplicably, sheer poetry in every role she tackled in a near-60
year career.
</P>
<P>
   2. Joan Crawford _ ``Mommie Dearest'' has left her an object of
camp, but no other woman star had a career with her dimensions:
From silent era flapper to long-suffering martyr of '30s, '40s and
'50s weepies, to horror queen of the '60s, this woman was a star
with a capital ``S,'' and don't you forget it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Audrey Hepburn _ With her exquisite beauty and elflike
elegance, her obvious joy for life, and her undercurrent of
integrity and moral fiber beneath the fragile exterior, this woman
left Hollywood with a legacy of grace and style it will not soon
forget.
</P>
<P>
   4. Carole Lombard _ Cut down in her prime (a victim of a WWII
air crash), this leggy blonde with the ditzy smile, dazzling wit
and edgy street smarts was the virtuoso of one of Hollywood's great
contributions to world cinema: Depression-era screwball comedy.
</P>
<P>
   5. Vivien Leigh _ If she'd never made another movie after ``Gone
With the Wind,'' her Scarlett would still put her on this list _
it's simply the most flawless, most influential female movie-star
turn ever. But her equally flawless, career-redefining Blanche of
``Streetcar'' makes her doubly worthy. 6. Elizabeth Taylor _ The
dreamy child of ``National Velvet,'' the passionate ingenue of ``A
Place in the Sun,'' the cynical Maggie of ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,'' the sex-goddess supreme of ``Cleopatra.'' This woman's
changing persona _ and off-screen exploits _ have never ceased to
obsess America.
</P>
<P>
   7. Jean Harlow _ In her brief, seven-year career, this first of
Hollywood's blonde bombshells established a new kind of
naturalistic, unaffected, if-you've-got-it-flaunt-it brand of
sexuality that is as unique and appealing today as it was when her
early death stunned the world in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   8. Katharine Hepburn _ Never one of my personal favorites, I
will hereby acknowledge that this personification of flinty New
England indomitability _ and the movies' most Oscar-decorated
actress _ was (and is) an irreplaceable national treasure.
</P>
<P>
   9. Greta Garbo _ Perhaps the only Hollywood star to fully
transcend the coming of sound _ she was equally popular in silent
and sound films _ this enigmatic Swedish beauty is still the
screen's most haunting manifestation of the mystery of womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   10. Lillian Gish _ She was a successful character actress to the
end of her long career, but in the silent films she made for D.W.
Griffith and others _ from ``The Birth of a Nation'' to ``The
Wind'' _ she was that era's most poignant symbol of unspoiled
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   11. Lana Turner _ There was always a kind of wooden quality to
her acting, but she still was dynamite on celluloid and she also
had the ``X-plus'' factor: that mysterious something _ and not just
the notoriety of her many off-screen tragedies _ that never ceased
to fascinate the moviegoing public.
</P>
<P>
   12. Claudette Colbert _ It's hard to believe she was born and
partly raised in France, because her good-humored, all-American
pluck in films like ``It Happened One Night,'' ``The Egg and I''
and ``Since You Went Away'' _ was the standard by which American
women measured themselves for nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   13. Maureen O'Hara _ Of the screen's two magnificent red-headed
Irishwomen, I flipped a coin and _ sorry, Greer Garson _ came up
with this fiery vixen who was John Wayne's best-ever on-screen
partner and the highlight of ``How Green Was My Valley'' and many
other classics.
</P>
<P>
   14. Lizbeth Scott _ What? You've never heard of Lizbeth Scott?
Shame on you. In films like ``Pitfall,'' ``I Walk Alone,'' ``Dead
Reckoning'' and half a dozen more, this deep-throated siren was the
quintessential female star _ and most tempting femme fatale _ of
postwar film noir.
</P>
<P>
   15. Rita Hayworth _ Like Lana Turner and Kim Novak, this woman
had _ at her peak, 1946's ``Gilda'' _ a unique sex appeal that
somehow transcends the status of her pin-up-queen contemporaries
(Betty Grable, Ann Sheridan, etc.) to give her immortality as the
unrivaled Hollywood goddess of the '40s.
</P>
<P>
   16. Ava Gardner _ With her cool elegance, her gorgeous cat eyes
and her vague air of haughty superiority, this actress epitomizes
Camille Paglia's notion that female sexuality equals feminist
power. Frank Sinatra couldn't get her out of his system to the day
he died. Small wonder.
</P>
<P>
   17. Grace Kelly _ No woman actress made a bigger splash in the
'50s than this society girl-turned-movie-star (``Rear Window,''
``The Country Girl'') who further immortalized herself by becoming
a fairy-tale princess and then by dying relatively young.
</P>
<P>
   18. Myrna Loy _ As Nora Charles, the distaff side of the ``The
Thin Man'' team, she will live forever as the Mona Lisa of '30s
wit, sophistication and glamor: the ultimate,
quick-to-heckle-her-husband liberated wife in a marriage of equals.
</P>
<P>
   19. Sophia Loren _ The heart of my inner teenager wants to put
Gina Lollobrigida in this slot I've reserved for an actress who
worked primarily in foreign-language films, but Sophia won the
first acting Oscar in that department, and _ I'm forced to admit _
had the better career.
</P>
<P>
   20. Marilyn Monroe _ Obviously, Marilyn belongs on any list of
screen legends: a new book, a new ``revelation,'' a new lover comes
forward every year. She's bigger today as an object of fascination
and adulation than when she committed suicide, or was murdered, or
was abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   21. Barbara Stanwyck _ She could be vulnerable and sexy, she
could be hard as nails, she could play good-hearted burlesque
dancers or man-killing psychopaths, she excelled in Capra movies,
weepies, film noir and westerns. She was the female Eddie Robinson:
the consummate female star of the sound era.
</P>
<P>
   22. Gloria Swanson _ Somehow, the one-two-punch juxtaposition of
her extraordinary career as a silent star and her eerie 1950
comeback as the tragic has-been of ``Sunset Boulevard'' (who was
not a bit like Swanson, incidentally) combine to make her a
``must'' on any reasonable list of screen legends.
</P>
<P>
   23. Natalie Wood _ She was one of the few child stars to ever
become an adult star. She amassed the most impressive body of work
of any female star of the '60s. Since her still-unexplained death
in 1981, the ever-growing interest in her life and films has pushed
her right into the Hollywood pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   24. Clara Bow _ Except for ``It,'' her films are not that
well-known or much-revived, but she is simply irresistible on
screen, and her spunky-sexy image (further immortalized by her
cartoon incarnation, Betty Boop) has become as much a trademark
symbol of Hollywood as Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   25. Deborah Kerr _ Her six nominations but never a win is an
Oscar record, her roll in the surf with Burt Lancaster is one of
Hollywood's signature moments, and her unique blend of grace, charm
and stiff-upper-lip good nature have elevated each of her movies
into something special.

STATE OF THE ART: LIFE AFTER THE VCR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My videocassette recorder, like many modern electronic devices,
apparently has a special chip that detects the moment the warranty
expires and then causes things to go haywire. In this case, it ate
the fifth of six videotapes composing the ``Brideshead Revisited''
epic and could not be coaxed into giving it back. It was a rental
tape, and the video store was charging by the day. It was an
expensive six-tape set, and no place would sell ``Brideshead/Book
Five'' alone.
</P>
<P>
   So I took the VCR to Circuit City to have the tape extracted.
The store shipped it to a central repair depot for an estimate. Ten
days later, the call came: It needed a new ``lower head,'' and the
repair, with labor, would cost $238. A brand-new, fancier hi-fi VCR
was selling a few feet away for less than $200, so I declined the
repair and asked the shop just to extract the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wandered over to look at the DVD and Divx video players
on display next to the VCRs. The difference between the two kinds
of players, and the reason I emphatically prefer one over the
other, is the point of this column, if you'll just have patience to
let me rant a bit.
</P>
<P>
   My VCR arrived back at the Circuit City store a week later. The
tape was still trapped inside. Either no one in Circuit City's
repair depot had even so much as bothered to take the cover off my
VCR before writing the estimate, or else they had scrupulously
jammed the tape back in and then resealed the case before sending
it back.
</P>
<P>
   I lugged the crippled VCR to the video store to demonstrate my
good-faith effort to return the tape and to plead for leniency. A
young man in line at the store overheard my plight and said, ``Take
it to Murray.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray worked at another neighborhood video store. Standing
behind the cash register, in between waiting on customers, Murray
grabbed a screwdriver, opened the VCR and extracted the tape. Is
there any way to fix the problem? He shrugged. ``All you need is a
new belt and a head cleaning,'' he said. I assumed he was talking
about the VCR, so I said OK.
</P>
<P>
   He fixed the machine while I waited, and cleaned and adjusted
it. Total cost, including a new high-grade tape to use as a head
cleaner: $50.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us back to DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   During the time my ailing VCR was being held hostage in the
Circuit City repair depot, I decided the time had come to buy a
``digital versatile disk'' player. The decision had not been not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Although DVD video players have been available in this country
since early 1997, the technology is still evolving, and standards
are still in flux. DVD players cost on average twice as much as
VCR's, yet the consumer models cannot record anything _ they can
only play back prerecorded audio and video disks.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start in which some major film studios refused to
release their movies on DVD _ there is no DVD version of ``Star
Wars'' yet, for example _ some 2,500 movie titles are now
available, still a meager selection.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, DVD disks offer much better picture quality
than VHS videotapes. And when connected to a receiver capable of
decoding Dolby Digital AC-3 signals _ which are then pumped through
a home theater speaker system _ the disks sound almost as good as
sound in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   One can also jump to particular scenes in the movie by clicking
on a menu. The disks do not have to be rewound. They take up less
shelf space than videotapes. Viewers can also change the shape of
the picture so it's wider, as it is on a movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   And, because DVD disks and audio CD disks are physically
identical, almost all DVD video players can serve double duty as CD
players when connected to a stereo.
</P>
<P>
   DVD movies often come with multiple-language soundtracks and
subtitles, so one can listen to ``Pulp Fiction'' in Spanish, for
example. Some disks, like the new ``Casablanca'' DVD, offer extra
scenes not found on the tape version, as well as a
behind-the-scenes documentary narrated by Lauren Bacall. Most have
biographical information on the cast and crew.
</P>
<P>
   In short, DVD is a no-brainer upgrade for film buffs. Unlike the
much larger laser video disk, which remains a niche format, DVD
disks appear to have reached the mainstream. My local Blockbuster
store now stocks two aisles of DVD rental disks, double the space a
month ago. Amazon.com has added DVD titles to its music and book
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   One computer in my office has a DVD-ROM drive and MPEG-2 decoder
card that allows me to watch DVD movies. Without the MPEG-2 card, a
DVD-ROM drive is basically a fancy CD-ROM drive waiting for
something interesting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Watching DVD movies on the small screen is an amusing way to
pass those otherwise tedious deadline hours, but it stops being fun
when I want to share a movie with the family. The family is not
keen, either, on the prospect of sitting on my lap for two hours in
front of a 17-inch computer screen, especially since there is a
comfy sofa and a big-screen television in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   So I have taken to moving the computer into the family room and
connecting its MPEG-2 decoder card to the television set, a process
that is easier than it sounds. The real hassle is disconnecting the
computer from its rats' nest of cables and lugging it to the
television, then carrying it back and reconnecting the wires when
the movie is over.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All that makes a separate DVD video player sound attractive,
especially if one's VCR is in the shop. So I wandered from the
repair desk to the DVD video sales section of Circuit City to see
what was available.
</P>
<P>
   The sales-youth who intercepted me opened by saying, ``Are you
looking for a Divx player?'' I asked him to explain the difference
between Divx and DVD. His answer: ``Well, Divx is better than DVD,
and all the major manufacturers are going to start making Divx
models now.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Divx, or Digital Video Express, is a technology developed by
Circuit City and a law firm in Los Angeles. It was initially
offered as an ``enhancement'' on certain DVD players. But it has
recently become apparent that Divx is striving to become an
alternative technical standard, one set not by technologists but
rather by a bunch of entertainment industry lawyers and by the same
folks who had held my ailing VCR hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The main differences between Divx players and regular DVD
players are that Divx machines contain a modem and a special
security chip that ``remembers'' each time a given disk is played.
The goal _ and here is where the lawyers come in _ is to make sure
that the movie makers get paid every time the movie is played.
Because of these ``enhancements,'' as the Divx folks call them _
and this is where retail electronics salespeople come in _ Divx
machines cost $50 to $100 more than comparable non-Divx DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   The customer buys a Divx movie disk for about $5. Once the disk
is put in the player, the clock starts. The movie can be viewed an
unlimited number of times in the first 48 hours. Then the customer
has to pay again. Or the disk can be thrown away. ``No more
late-night trips to the video store to avoid late charges,'' Divx
proponents say cheerily.
</P>
<P>
   The Divx machine must be connected not just to the television,
but also to a phone line, which means that there had better be a
phone jack next to the television. Then the Divx machine calls the
mother ship at regular intervals to report every Divx movie you
watch, when you watch it and how often you watch it. You are then
sent a monthly bill. If you disconnect the phone, the Divx player
refuses to allow you to watch more Divx movies. (Divx machines can
also play regular DVD disks.)
</P>
<P>
   The user has the option, for an additional fee, to convert the
Divx disk to ``silver'' status, for unlimited playing on one
particular machine. Divx also announced a ``gold'' program that
allows you to buy certain disks up front for unlimited viewing on
any machine. In other words, Divx gold is simply an alternative
standard to regular DVD, except that with DVD, no one is looking
over your shoulder and reporting your habits and preferences to a
central computer in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that I think Divx is the spawn of evil?
</P>
<P>
   As for everybody jumping on the Divx bandwagon: it's not quite
true, either, that all major manufacturers are going to start
making Divx models. RCA, Proscan, Panasonic and Zenith are making
Divx players today, and JVC, Pioneer, Kenwood and Harman/Kardon
have indicated that they will make Divx players in addition to
their regular DVD players later this year. But other manufacturers
_ Sony, Yamaha, Mitsubishi and so on _ have so far resisted Divx's
charms.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I have decided against Divx, the question becomes: What
kind of DVD player should I get? Tune in next week.

SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTS TAKE AIM AT HOMELESSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Merchants and residents concerned about San
Francisco's chronic homelessness urged more action from the city
government, signalling a shift from tolerance to frustration with
street people.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a divided Board of Supervisors voted to launch a new
drive to roust homeless people, drunks and drug dealers from
downtown streets and public plazas, about 25 merchants, residents
and public officials took turn tackling the issue on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting organized by the Greater Geary Merchants
Association, the city's policy of aiding the downtrodden with
general assistance checks was targeted as one factor that
encourages vagrancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the city are actually contributing to street people's
situations by giving them GA checks,'' said Earl Rynerson, a former
member of the city's Human Services Commission. ``The majority of
the $16 million we spend on GA to the homeless is going to drugs
and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Marv Warren, who heads the District Council of Merchants, said,
``One of our dirty secrets is we've let advocates define
homelessness instead of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the meeting were advocates for the
homeless, who were invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rynerson said ticketing vagrants will not resolve the problem
and that solutions lie in providing services to people who
demonstrate a willingness to overcome substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful how we provide services,'' he continued.
``I think it's a waste of the police department's time giving out
tickets for drinking. Treatment with respect demands a level of
responsibility. That means we continue to provide services
contingent upon them improving themselves; withhold services until
they can demonstrate they can take some specific behavior steps.
The way we do it now gives them no incentive to improve
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Amos Brown, who sponsored legislation to crack down
on homeless people in the United Nations and Halladie plazas, was
pleased with the dialogue and hoped it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saddens me homeless advocates who were invited and have not
shown up,'' Brown said. The supervisor and Baptist minister said
his intent was not ``mean-spirited, callous or cold.'' He said
homeless people were creating ``unhealthy conditions'' while the
city was providing services and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be intimidated by the volume'' of advocates' rhetoric,
Brown said, adding that he had been to a shelter in Brooklyn and
marveled at how clean it was. ``If they can do it in New York, we
can do the same thing here.''

PLANNING FOR PUTTING UP A TIN CEILING

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tin ceilings became very popular toward the end of the last
century. Victorians were fond of ornate and decorative ceiling
treatments; they found that the tin ceilings were practical because
they covered up the unsightly network of cracks that often
developed in plaster ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Tin ceilings are still popular today because they relieve the
monotony of a plain plaster board ceiling. If they are coated with
a clear polyurethane finish, the shiny metal will reflect light and
brighten a room.
</P>
<P>
   There are two drawbacks to tin ceilings. First, they do not
absorb noise like a conventional ceiling. So rooms with tin
ceilings will be noisier than those with plaster board ceilings.
You can usually dampen the noise by installing heavy drapes and
carpets, although this is not practical in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The second drawback to installing a tin ceiling is the cost.
Putting up an ordinary plaster board ceiling will cost as little as
40 cents a square foot; a tin ceiling may run as high as $4 a
square foot. This includes not only the cost of the metal panels
but also the amount for the plywood substrate.
</P>
<P>
   A tin ceiling is made up of thin-gauge metal panels (usually
steel) stamped with a repeating pattern. It is necessary to fit
three types of panels together to create a tin ceiling: the field
panels form the overall central pattern, the cornice pieces span
the corner where the walls and ceiling meet and filler panels fill
the gap between the field and cornice pieces. Fitting these pieces
together takes careful planning and attention to detail; otherwise,
the patterned pieces will not line up properly and the ceiling will
look like an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   The first step then is to choose a pattern that will complement
the room. This will have to be done through mail order catalogues
because most home and decorating centers do not stock tin ceilings.
Look in the classified section of magazines that feature vintage
house restoration for manufacturers of tin ceilings (two suppliers
are: AA-abbingdon Affiliates Inc., 2149-51 Utica Ave., Brooklyn,
N.Y., 11234; and Chelsea Decorative Metal Co., 9603 Moonlight Dr.,
Houston, Texas, 77096). In addition to catalogues showing their
products, most companies will offer some form of technical
assistance to guide you through the process of installation.
</P>
<P>
   There are no hard and fast rules for choosing a ceiling pattern.
Generally bold patterns work better on high ceilings. Subtle
patterns work better in rooms where the ceiling is only eight-feet
high. Field panels are 24 1/2 inches by 48 1/2 inches or 24 1/2
inches by 96 1/2 inches (The 1/2-inch border allows for overlap).
It's best to order the smaller panels, because they are easier to
handle and there is less danger of bending the panels during
installation.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of installing a tin ceiling is the layout and
planning stage. First measure the width and height of the ceiling,
then transfer these measurements to grid paper. The patterns on the
field panels are usually blocked in six-inch squares, so set up a
scale of 1 to 6, where each square on the paper represents six
inches.
</P>
<P>
   Include in your layout all projections, like a bay window that
extends the ceiling or a chimney that cuts into the ceiling. Be
sure that these are accurately drawn in scale.
</P>
<P>
   When you have the outline of the ceiling rendered, draw a line
to show the cornice boundary; that is how far the cornice will
project from the wall onto the ceiling (this measurement varies
with different cornice styles). Next draw blocks to represent the
area that the field panels will cover. You can cut the panels to
fit if necessary, but you can only cut where the pattern repeats.
If you have panels with six-inch pattern squares, you can only cut
the panel by 6, 12 or 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely will the field panels fit to the exact proportions of the
room. That is why the filler panels are necessary. They bridge the
gap between the field area and the cornice. The filler border does
not have to be the same width all the way around, but it should
match on opposite sides of the room. Thus the border along the east
wall should be the same width as that along the west wall, and the
north and south borders should match.
</P>
<P>
   The filler panels have another function. They can fill in those
areas that are too small or too irregular to accept a field panel.
You can use filler panels to cover the ceiling over a bay window,
or in corners that are not exactly 90 degree angles.
</P>
<P>
   When you have made a precise layout and ordered the necessary
panels, you are ready to begin installation. Installing and
finishing a tin ceiling will be covered next week.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, the temperature soared to 80 degrees in
Asheville, N.C., as a strong ridge of high pressure settled over
the Southeast and Middle Atlantic states. This marked the warmest
January day of record in the mountainous city of the southern
Appalachians. A similar weather pattern Thursday will promote
unseasonable warmth once again across the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Overcast skies will occur throughout much of the Great Lakes and
Northeast. Areas of light snow will surround a cold front
stretching from northern Michigan to New Hampshire, otherwise
little precipitation is expected across the region.
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet stream disturbance will emerge from the southern
Rockies on Thursday, setting the stage for inclement weather from
eastern New Mexico to western Oklahoma. Several inches of wet snow
are likely in northeast New Mexico and the northern Texas panhandle
with further snow accumulation expected Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the disturbance encounters a stream of humid air from the
Gulf of Mexico, showers and thunderstorms will erupt over eastern
Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley during Thursday afternoon
and evening. A few of the storms will produce heavy rain,
especially later Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A plume of Pacific moisture aimed toward the Northwest will
bring heavy rain to western Washington and Oregon. As the damp air
is lifted and cooled by the higher terrain, heavy snow will blanket
the west-facing slopes of the Cascades above 5,000 feet. Meanwhile,
dry and seasonable conditions will cover central and southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Mirror
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, afternoon temperatures were in the springlike 60s and
70s in the Middle Atlantic and Southeastern States. At the same
time, the exceptional Arctic chill covered interior Alaska and the
Yukon where temperatures were 20 to 40 below zero. Frequently, the
weather in Alaska is a mirror image of the conditions in the East.
All weather systems around the hemisphere are connected. The
typical distance between the centers chill and warmth is about 2000
miles. Thus, in response to strong cooling over western North
America mild winds from the south tend to increase over the East.

ANIMAL LOVERS GO WILD WITH `ZABOOMAFOO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a safe bet your preschooler doesn't know that binturongs
smell like buttered popcorn. And she's probably never seen the
webbed feet of a capybara up close, either.
</P>
<P>
   That, say brothers and animal adventurers Martin and Chris
Kratt, is a shame. And they decided to do something about it.
Beginning Monday, the popular hosts of the 2-year-old Kratt's
Creatures PBS series for children bring a new wildlife series to
public television: Zaboomafoo.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing host duties with the brothers is Zaboomafoo himself, an
endangered leaping sifaka lemur from the island of Madagascar that
is at various times shown as a puppet, animated clay figure and
real-life primate. Although portions of the show involve adventures
in Zabooland, the lemur's imaginary clay-animation world where he
learns life lessons in cooperation and friendship, the heart of the
show is the up-close and personal interactions among the Kratts,
Zaboomafoo and a wide range of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about making friends with animals,'' Martin Kratt says.
To that end, for the premiere season, more than 500 untrained
creatures visited the set's Animal Junction, including a
flesh-eating Southeast Asian catlike creature with a prehensile
tail (the binturong) and a 4-foot tailless South American rodent
(the capybara). Squirrel monkeys escaped into the lighting grid. A
black bear ducked out through an air-conditioning duct. A camel
made a large wet spot on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kratts, it's all part of the fun. ``Just as preschoolers
are learning about animals, we hope that a lot of parents have the
opportunity to see animals from a more personal perspective,'' says
Martin Kratt, whose experiences 10 years ago working with lemurs as
an undergraduate at Duke University provided the inspiration for
the series. ``We'd like parents to come away reaffirming that
learning is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch Zaboomafoo at 8:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Monday-Friday on
PBS.

ENSEMBLE KEEPS ALIVE THE SONGS BORN IN FIELDS OF PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many nations and groups can claim a great heritage of folk
music.
</P>
<P>
   But no other body of folk music is as expressive, complex and
appealing as the African-American spiritual. Born across the
centuries on two continents, derived from the tortured experience
of a captive people, it is a genre that contains hope, history,
defiance, sorrow and religious fervor far beyond that of any other
musical folk tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the New England Spiritual Ensemble, a Boston-based vocal
group, will appear at Bass Performance Hall in an evening concert
benefiting the Children's Education Program at Bass Hall and the
scholarship fund of the Renaissance Cultural Center. Earlier that
day, the group will present four concerts for young people,
promoting for a new generation the preservation of an art form
that, despite its strength, is threatened with obscurity in a noisy
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disturbed by the number of adults who didn't know about
spirituals _ even African-Americans,'' says Vincent Dion Stringer,
the ensemble's founding artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston classical singer and teacher, Stringer was inspired by
the similar Harlem Spiritual Ensemble and had considered starting
one himself. Then, five years ago, he joined a number of other
African-American soloists to perform a classical European concert
work, the Christmas Oratorio of Camille Saint-Saens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the blend and energy we had as a group,'' Stringer
says. ``So I asked the others if they would be interested in
putting together an ensemble to do spirituals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Spiritual Ensemble gave its first performance at
Symphony Hall in Boston. Now, the group calls on a pool of 12
singers and tours nationally with eight singers and a pianist.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the spiritual is complex and rooted in
controversy. As early as the 18th century, African-American slaves
sang spirituals while they worked. The spiritual flourished until
the years after the Civil War but began to fade as a living form as
African-Americans moved to cities and created the new genres of
jazz, blues, ragtime and _ drawing on all of these _ gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   And, though the spiritual is closely related to African-American
gospel music, it is a distinctive form. Gospel is still a live
form, constantly created and re-created, and, at least in theory,
always improvised. It continues as the main form of music for many
churches, and it always has instrumental accompaniment. Famous
gospel songs include Thomas A. Dorsey's ``There'll Be Peace in the
Valley for Me'' and ``Precious Lord, Take My Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual, however, is now a purely historical form.
Although it originated as improvisation, spirituals are written and
sung by trained choirs and soloists in arranged versions. Famous
spirituals include ``Roll, Jordan, Roll, Deep River'' and ``Steal
Away.'' Gospel performers have often used spirituals as the basis
of gospel improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, particularly in the early years of the 20th
century, white musicologists assumed that the unskilled slaves and
freedmen could hardly have created such an incredible body of
music, and that they simply had embellished the white spiritual
tradition of the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   More recent historians, especially John Lovell Jr., author of
``Black Song: The Forge and the Flame'' (1980), take an opposite
view, dismissing almost all white influence. Lovell points to the
rich musical and religious traditions of the West African regions
where African-American slaves originated.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell traces the structures, such as question-answer formats,
to West Africa as well. According to Lovell, even the literary
themes, which are completely biblical, may have come with the
slaves from West Africa. Many tend to assume that African slaves
knew nothing of Christianity until it was imposed upon them in
America, but Lovell says that knowledge of Christianity was common
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their origin, spirituals represented one of the few
possessions of an otherwise impoverished people. It expressed hope
in a brighter future _ sometimes after death, sometimes in the
dream of emancipation, sometimes, in the most veiled terms, in
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Biblical images of Abraham, Moses, the prophets and Jesus became
emblems of faith, liberation and self-worth. Escape routes,
subversive innuendoes and defiant proclamations could be embedded
in the songs, going largely unnoticed by the white masters. And it
was all integrated with rich poetic imagery _ of starlight and
rivers and simple everyday items _ and smooth, flowing, singable
melodies revised and renewed by a thousand different singers into
the best melodies ever made.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, African-American colleges began to
organize choirs to sing formally arranged concert versions of
spirituals; the most famous of these was the Fisk Jubilee Singers
of Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn. The singers, touring the
Northern states, found themselves coolly received when performing
their program of traditional European and white American music.
</P>
<P>
   But the audiences went wild when the group inserted a few
spirituals in their concerts. Within a year, New Yorkers clamored
to hear what amounted to the 19th-century version of a musical
sensation, and the tradition of the spiritual choir was born.
</P>
<P>
   In the following decades, spirituals were generally arranged for
unaccompanied chorus in harmonically rich versions calling for up
to 16 parts, or as art songs, for solo voice with piano
accompaniment. The arrangements, generally produced by
African-American composers, served such legends as Marian Anderson
and such current superstars as Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman.
The choral arrangements have introduced generations of singers of
all races in church, school and college choirs to the riches of the
spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   The classically trained singers of the New England Spiritual
Ensemble perform these arrangements, plus new arrangements
specially made for them by composer John Andrew Ross.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in awareness of the spiritual that inspired Stringer
to organize the ensemble may be reversing. The American Negro
Spiritual Research Foundation in New York provides a focus of
research and promotion, and presents an annual spiritual vigil on
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, often drawing leading operatic artists.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many distinctive ethnic contributions to American
culture, the African-American spiritual can be a point of special
pride for the group that created it and a source of joy for the
rest _ in this case, a beautiful artistic expression emerging from
the horrible experience of slavery.

`RAINBOW' OF LOVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Singer Michael Feinstein is telling a story about
E.Y. ``Yip'' Harburg, the lyricist who wrote ``Over the Rainbow''
and numerous other pop standards.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pleasant winter day in Los Angeles, and sunlight filters
through the high windows in a large room in Feinstein's house. He
is seated on an overstuff sofa, dressed in jeans and a gray sweat
shirt. With his frameless clear glasses he looks like someone you
would see strolling around a college campus rather than where you
might usually picture him, sitting behind a grand piano, attired in
white tie and tails, crooning a Gershwin or Porter tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all the great lyricists, he would try to find ways to
say, `I love you,' without saying, `I love you','' Feinstein says
about Harburg.
</P>
<P>
   Harburg was working on the Ziegfeld Follies when one of the
producers said to him (here, Feinstein goes into pushy New York
accent), ```We need a song that, a, like, I mean, should, a, like
communicate, it should, like, be about love'.'' And so he wrote
(and here Feinstein sings): ``I like the likes of you. I like the
things you do. Looks like I like the likes of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the bridge,'' he continues (then back to singing), ``Oh
dear, if I could only mean what I say. That is if I could only say
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a moment that says a lot about Harburg's cleverness and
resourcefulness _ that he took that experience and turned it into a
great song. And it says a lot about Feinstein's love of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is hosting ``Look to the Rainbow: Celebrating the
Timeless Lyrics of Yip Harburg,'' a benefit performance on Monday
at the Mark Taper Forum. He and others, including Tim Curry,
Maureen McGovern and Malcolm Gets, will be singing songs like
``It's Only a Paper Moon,'' ``April in Paris'' and ``Old Devil
Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein _ who moved to Los Angeles in 1976 and had become the
personal assistant to Ira Gershwin _ knew Harburg before the
latter's death in 1981. Harburg and Gershwin were born the same
year (1896) and had been school classmates. Besides becoming
pre-eminent lyricists, they remained lifelong friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yip was the most energetic octogenarian I knew,'' says
Feinstein. ``It was always full steam ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his viewpoint of life. He always writes songs of
hope.'' Feinstein says what also attracts him to Harburg's lyrics
was the cleverness and wit.
</P>
<P>
   We all know, ``Which old witch?''; it's ``the wicked old
witch.'' And know that ``when I can't be near the girl that I love,
I love the girl I'm near.'' And ``with the thoughts that I'd be
thinkin', I could be another Lincoln if I only had a brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Harburg was a child of poor Russian Jewish immigrants living in
New York's Lower East Side, and though he could write light
ditties, he also had a social conscience. That's reflected in the
Depression anthem ``Brother Can You Spare a Dime?'' with its
lyrics: ``Once I built a railroad/ I made it run/ I made it run
against time/ Once I built a railroad/ Now it's gone/ Brother can
you spare a dime?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yip always made a great point that was not a song about
begging or asking for a handout, that it was about someone trying
to understand what had happened, wanting a job,'' Feinstein says.
</P>
<P>
   There are also political messages of racial equality in the
musical ``Finian's Rainbow'' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   Harburg was blacklisted in 1950 because of his ties with
socialist-leaning organizations and barred from working in movies,
radio and television for 12 years. He continued to write for the
theater, however, on such shows as ``Flahooley'' (1951) and
``Jamaica'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein says Harburgh carried a lot of bitterness about being
blacklisted, and it infuriated him during those hysterical times
when he was accused of writing ``Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe''
about Joseph Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man who espoused deep belief in the survival of human
spirit and the goodness of people,'' Feinstein says, ``but he had
to work to stay light because of what happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Harburg could be a ``difficult guy,'' Feinstein says, but on the
other hand, ``He was the most charming man, who could spout off
these most wonderful verses that he had created. ... He loved the
ladies, and he was his most charming with a pretty woman around.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Harburg had some dark periods, Feinstein likes to
remember a concert of Harburg's work put on by UCLA students in
1979 that the lyricist had worked on. ``You left not only humming
great songs but with hope for humanity. And that's what he wanted
to accomplish in his life and in his work.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Feinstein? Now in his early 40s, he has performed
and recorded numerous classic tunes. Last year he commemorated
George Gershwin's 100th birthday with a series of concerts,
television appearances and a CD, ``Michael &AMP; George _ Feinstein
Sings Gershwin.'' And short of Bobby Short, who turned 75 recently,
all of this has made Feinstein the unofficial torchbearer of what
some call ``America's music.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it, he feigns running wearily ahead, torch in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never my intention to gain that position,'' he says.
``I just love this material, and I sing it because I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he grew tired last year doing all those tributes to
Gershwin, though the composer will always remain his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein currently has a number of projects on his plate. He's
recording a series of half-hour radio shows on different composers
called ``The Michael Feinstein Songbook'' for the BBC. Then there's
another tribute album singling out a composer, this time Jay
Livingston (``Buttons and Bows,'' ``Mona Lisa'').
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein recently finished the score to the documentary ``Get
Bruce,'' which is screening at Sundance, and says he hopes to do
more composing for film.
</P>
<P>
   And he's also been introducing his audiences to some original
material ``a little at a time.'' Feinstein says he's been writing
with the likes of Carole Bayer Sager, Melissa Manchester, and
Marilyn and Alan Bergman. His next mainstream album will be half
original songs and half from the composers with whom he has
written.
</P>
<P>
   And he has another project cooking. This one with Jimmy Webb
(``By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ``The Moon Is a Harsh
Mistress''), who Feinstein sees as a link between Gershwin and
today.
</P>
<P>
   When it's lamented that Webb has been overlooked in recent
years, Feinstein says: ``The great thing about a song is that once
it exists, it's out there and can be picked up by anyone at any
time and suddenly have new life again.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an optimistic, over-the-rainbow, hopeful
statement _ something that Harburg, whose songs will have new life
on Monday, would endorse. &QL;

SCREEN GRAB: ODES TO OPERA'S STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take two of the most obsessive afflictions known _ Web surfing
and opera _ then develop sites devoted to their stars, and you have
created an opportunity for a serious online wallow.
</P>
<P>
   This is no time for an elaborate overture in print. You'll want
your headphones, not just for the too-brief online sound but also
for imagining the full performances. This sampling is not intended
to rate the best of either sites or performers; there are far too
many of each. The emphasis is on history, biography and a general
sense of devotion to the star as well as to the music. Commercial
sales sites are mostly not included.
</P>
<P>
   A good first stop is the singers' page from Operaweb:
www.opera.it/English/Cantanti.html, an Italian site that has
English and Italian versions. There are international performance
schedules, opera history and a chat line, as well as pages for
singers, including some of those in this column.
</P>
<P>
   Operaweb has links to other pages, ranging from brief
biographies to multiple sites, for 17 divas and 21 divos, including
those three tenors. (A new arrival is an homage to the late Lucia
Valentini Terrani.)
</P>
<P>
   For a wider selection, Opera News Online
(operanews.com/Template/visitors/visitors.dbm), the Web site of the
magazine published by the Metropolitan Opera Guild, provides links
to many artists' professional pages and separate links to many fan
pages about artists.
</P>
<P>
   MARIAN ANDERSON  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The importance of this contralto transcends her voice. In an
online transcript of the ``News Hour With Jim Lehrer''on PBS for
Feb. 26, 1997, Charlayne Hunter-Gault discusses Anderson's life,
work and importance to civil rights. Roberta Peters recalls the
evening when Anderson made her overdue Metropolitan Opera debut at
age 57 
(www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/remember/1997/anderson(underscore)2-26a.htm
l).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARIA CALLAS
</P>
<P>
   From Venice, the Associazione Internationale Maria Callas has
created Callas Divina, the Official Maria Callas Web Site
(www.callas.it). Besides a biography, a bibliography and a
discography, the site has close-ups of the soprano's costumes, a
plait of hair cut in 1958 and other artifacts from the group's
traveling Callas exhibition. It also has a biography of Marie
Duplessis, the original Lady of the Camellias and the model for
Violetta in ``La Traviata.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENRICO CARUSO
</P>
<P>
   The Enrico Caruso Page (www.paix.com/caruso.html) &UR;  &LR; has a
four-part biography of Caruso and pages of individual photographs.
An unusual one shows the tenor with Helen Keller, who is touching
his mouth and throat to feel the sounds she cannot hear.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KIRSTEN FLAGSTAD
</P>
<P>
   The Kirsten Flagstad Museum
(www.max.no/kultur/flagstad/index.html) honors the Norwegian
soprano regarded by many as the century's greatest Wagnerian
heroine. The site comes in English, German and Norwegian. Besides
photographs, posters, CD's and books, the online gift shop offers
Norwegian postage stamps and a bank note bearing her likeness.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS HAMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Here is a newer arrival. Hampson, the popular baritone from
Spokane, Wash., opened Hampsong (www.hampsong.com), his official
Web site, a year ago. ``After spending a late night
post-performance surfing,'' he writes, ``I had computer lingo on
the brain and I found myself at an interview the next morning
describing `song as the software of the soul.'''
</P>
<P>
   I bet Bill Gates wishes he had said that.
</P>
<P>
   Hampson, taking the Internet seriously, promises an ambitious
upgrading of his Web site in early 1999, including a themed Thomas'
Bookshelf and an interactive multimedia Listening Room, with score
and text analysis and his own commentary.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAURITZ MELCHIOR
</P>
<P>
   His home page comes from Denmark, his homeland
(wap03.informatik.fh-wiesbaden.de/weber1/melchior/melframe.htm).
The site includes a selection of memorable sound clips, some from
the early 1920s. You need to have downloaded Real Audio Player to
play the clips. His biography includes his successes at Bayreuth,
his early baritone roles, capsule biographies of his great
conductors and stage partners (Flagstad, Lotte Lehmann, Helen
Traubel and others) and a partisan essay titled ``Why is he the
greatest heldentenor?'' Here is one very nontrivial fact from the
site: Melchior sang ``Tristan'' 223 times.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOAN SUTHERLAND
</P>
<P>
   Dame Joan Sutherland _ La Stupenda is the title of this site
(www.cygnet.co.uk/thedame/diva01.htm). It includes a discography,
photos, lists of recitals, operas and videos, and a biography of
the Australian diva, whom the authors term ``the undisputed
coloratura soprano of her time.''

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The impeached president meets with the pope in a city whose
first name is Saint. Don't tell us Mr. Clinton's image folks aren't
good.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. A bazillion people in St. Louis come to see the pope,
even though last season he hit 70 fewer homers than Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise in the papal visit is that the big newspaper in
St. Louis didn't, in his honor, temporarily change its name to the
``Pope's-Dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Mr. Clinton and the pontiff in St. Louis was
their fourth. Maybe the president is trying to figure out how John
Paul II gets by without having to have a vice pope.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton has been offered $5 million for her
memoirs, but she won't consider a book deal before 2001. Darn. We'd
like to read ``It Takes a Village to Defend My Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein was against the U.S. Senate debating
parts of the impeachment trial behind closed doors. ``What is
this,'' she asks, ``a Starr Chamber proceeding?''
</P>
<P>
   This is odd. If you rearrange the letters in Monica Lewinsky's
name, they spell ``man wins coil key.'' Sounds like a conspiracy to
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``we can actually foresee a time
when we can break the cycle of welfare for good.'' What will
corporations on the dole do?
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City will be strange. The mascot,
after all, will almost have to be a male deer named something like
E.Z. Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein has told Iraqis that in the struggle against the
U.S., ``Your blood will not go in vain.'' Iraqis, of course, are
more interested in keeping their blood in vein.
</P>
<P>
   No, as far as we know the Olympics won't be adding these sports:
Cross-country Bribing and Downhill Misbehaving.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have decided to hold their 2000 national convention
in Philadelphia. And will they name Monica Lewinsky their Liberty
Belle?
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have narrowed their 2000 national convention site
possibilities to Los Angeles, Boston or Denver. Was Salt Lake City
out of bribe money?
</P>
<P>
   GOP House managers interviewed Monica Lewinsky in a
$5,000-a-night hotel suite. That price sounds reasonable _ if it
sleeps 100.
</P>
<P>
   A Ken Starr spokesman says the suite in which Lewinsky was
interviewed cost taxpayers less than $5,000, but he didn't know how
much. Is Starr eligible for a 10 percent AARP discount?
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Clinton visited Beebe, Ark., the other day to see storm
damage, Paula Jones was in the crowd. Sort of the Ghost of Charisma
Past?
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats called the GOP weekend interview of Lewinsky a
desperate act. There are lots of synonyms for desperate but,
surprisingly, dumb isn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   It continues to be clear there aren't 67 Senate votes to convict
Mr. Clinton. Yes, but if chasing one's own tail didn't have
something to recommend it, dogs and Congress wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Over two days, senators at the impeachment trial asked 104
questions. That's 103 more than Aunt Ilse from Oelwein: ``Why are
they doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   Senators looking for a graceful exit to the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal may want to avoid suggesting everyone simply kiss and make
up.

<P>
   &UR; Scandal will test Olympic mettle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So it turns out that some of the people in charge of the world's
most prestigious amateur sporting event - the Olympics - are a
bunch of sniveling cheaters who accepted babes, baubles and bucks
in return for their vote on where to hold the games.
</P>
<P>
   This is no Greek tragedy. It's just your run-of-the-mill sordid
tale of greed, lust and abuse of trust that seems to attach itself
like a blood-sucking tick to just about everything these days. We
aren't even stunned anymore. When you live in a time where the
leader of the free world is willing to jeopardize his job, family
and credibility simply to have some big-haired bimbo tickle his
fancy inside the White House, well, you have to assume that there
is absolutely no position of honor and trust that is not above
being trashed.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising thing is not that corruption exists in lofty
places. That's where corruption thrives, up in the high country
where ideals, ethics and morals litter the ground like empty oxygen
canisters. What is surprising is how cheap it is to corrupt people
these days. It's as if there has been a total collapse in the world
corruption capitalization market and now it is possible to buy off
just about anyone for a couple of rubles and a day pass to
Euro-Disney.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to fill up secret Swiss bank accounts when a
gold-digging debutante chubbette who couldn't win a wet T-shirt
contest at a truck-stop tavern can corrupt the president of the
United States simply by exposing a thong strap on an equine-esque
thigh. Olympic committee members were willing to peddle their
influence regarding the selection of future sites for the games not
for gobs of money but for free school tuition for their grandkids
and an evening with $50-an-hour escorts. Why try to corrupt someone
at Neiman-Marcus prices when Walmart will do just as well?
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee, being a global enterprise,
may be beyond the legal reach of any one prosecuting body. Perhaps
they should clear out all those Yugoslavian war criminals at The
Hague for a few days and herd several IOC members before an
international tribunal. Or at least Judge Judy. And then what? So
you find out that the creeps sold their souls for less than a luge
helmet full of filthy lucre (does lucre come in any other flavor?).
What are you going to do, put them under house arrest at the
Olympic Village and force them to sell those little lapel buttons
as a means of community service?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the Olympic games are more about competition and
testing the limits of human endurance than the bribery of a bunch
of self-important gasbags. The only sport the committee members
compete in is international butt-smooching. When you are on a
committee whose decisions can result in millions of dollars being
pumped into a city, you are met by long lines of accomplished
butt-smoochers whenever you roll into town.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some committee members are quitting and others are being
forced out in an internal putsch apparently intended to show that
the IOC can change the sawdust in its own stall. The last thing
they want is for a disgruntled prosecutor from one of the jilted
cities to start firing off indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Even without criminal charges, damage has been done. From now
on, every time an Olympic athlete is forced to pee into a cup to
test for drugs or allegations of blood-doping or some other method
of performance enhancement is alleged, the stench of hypocrisy will
rise around the proceedings like swamp gas. Maybe one of the
committee members should be forced to hold the cup.

   The impeached president meets with the pope in a city whose
first name is Saint. Don't tell us Mr. Clinton's image folks aren't
good.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. A bazillion people in St. Louis come to see the pope,
even though last season he hit 70 fewer homers than Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise in the papal visit is that the big newspaper in
St. Louis didn't, in his honor, temporarily change its name to the
``Pope's-Dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Mr. Clinton and the pontiff in St. Louis was
their fourth. Maybe the president is trying to figure out how John
Paul II gets by without having to have a vice pope.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton has been offered $5 million for her
memoirs, but she won't consider a book deal before 2001. Darn. We'd
like to read ``It Takes a Village to Defend My Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein was against the U.S. Senate debating
parts of the impeachment trial behind closed doors. ``What is
this,'' she asks, ``a Starr Chamber proceeding?''
</P>
<P>
   This is odd. If you rearrange the letters in Monica Lewinsky's
name, they spell ``man wins coil key.'' Sounds like a conspiracy to
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``we can actually foresee a time
when we can break the cycle of welfare for good.'' What will
corporations on the dole do?
</P>
<P>
   The 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City will be strange. The mascot,
after all, will almost have to be a male deer named something like
E.Z. Bucks.

   Saddam Hussein has told Iraqis that in the struggle against the
U.S., ``Your blood will not go in vain.'' Iraqis, of course, are
more interested in keeping their blood in vein.
</P>
<P>
   No, as far as we know the Olympics won't be adding these sports:
Cross-country Bribing and Downhill Misbehaving.

<P>
   Republicans have decided to hold their 2000 national convention
in Philadelphia. And will they name Monica Lewinsky their Liberty
Belle?
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have narrowed their 2000 national convention site
possibilities to Los Angeles, Boston or Denver. Was Salt Lake City
out of bribe money?
</P>
<P>
   GOP House managers interviewed Monica Lewinsky in a
$5,000-a-night hotel suite. That price sounds reasonable _ if it
sleeps 100.
</P>
<P>
   A Ken Starr spokesman says the suite in which Lewinsky was
interviewed cost taxpayers less than $5,000, but he didn't know how
much. Is Starr eligible for a 10 percent AARP discount?
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Clinton visited Beebe, Ark., the other day to see storm
damage, Paula Jones was in the crowd. Sort of the Ghost of Charisma
Past?
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats called the GOP weekend interview of Lewinsky a
desperate act. There are lots of synonyms for desperate but,
surprisingly, dumb isn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   It continues to be clear there aren't 67 Senate votes to convict
Mr. Clinton. Yes, but if chasing one's own tail didn't have
something to recommend it, dogs and Congress wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Over two days, senators at the impeachment trial asked 104
questions. That's 103 more than Aunt Ilse from Oelwein: ``Why are
they doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   Senators looking for a graceful exit to the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal may want to avoid suggesting everyone simply kiss and make

   So it turns out that some of the people in charge of the world's
most prestigious amateur sporting event - the Olympics - are a
bunch of sniveling cheaters who accepted babes, baubles and bucks
in return for their vote on where to hold the games.
</P>
<P>
   This is no Greek tragedy. It's just your run-of-the-mill sordid
tale of greed, lust and abuse of trust that seems to attach itself
like a blood-sucking tick to just about everything these days. We
aren't even stunned anymore. When you live in a time where the
leader of the free world is willing to jeopardize his job, family
and credibility simply to have some big-haired bimbo tickle his
fancy inside the White House, well, you have to assume that there
is absolutely no position of honor and trust that is not above
being trashed.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising thing is not that corruption exists in lofty
places. That's where corruption thrives, up in the high country
where ideals, ethics and morals litter the ground like empty oxygen
canisters. What is surprising is how cheap it is to corrupt people
these days. It's as if there has been a total collapse in the world
corruption capitalization market and now it is possible to buy off
just about anyone for a couple of rubles and a day pass to
Euro-Disney.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to fill up secret Swiss bank accounts when a
gold-digging debutante chubbette who couldn't win a wet T-shirt
contest at a truck-stop tavern can corrupt the president of the
United States simply by exposing a thong strap on an equine-esque
thigh. Olympic committee members were willing to peddle their
influence regarding the selection of future sites for the games not
for gobs of money but for free school tuition for their grandkids
and an evening with $50-an-hour escorts. Why try to corrupt someone
at Neiman-Marcus prices when Walmart will do just as well?
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee, being a global enterprise,
may be beyond the legal reach of any one prosecuting body. Perhaps
they should clear out all those Yugoslavian war criminals at The
Hague for a few days and herd several IOC members before an
international tribunal. Or at least Judge Judy. And then what? So
you find out that the creeps sold their souls for less than a luge
helmet full of filthy lucre (does lucre come in any other flavor?).
What are you going to do, put them under house arrest at the
Olympic Village and force them to sell those little lapel buttons
as a means of community service?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the Olympic games are more about competition and
testing the limits of human endurance than the bribery of a bunch
of self-important gasbags. The only sport the committee members
compete in is international butt-smooching. When you are on a
committee whose decisions can result in millions of dollars being
pumped into a city, you are met by long lines of accomplished
butt-smoochers whenever you roll into town.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some committee members are quitting and others are being
forced out in an internal putsch apparently intended to show that
the IOC can change the sawdust in its own stall. The last thing
they want is for a disgruntled prosecutor from one of the jilted
cities to start firing off indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Even without criminal charges, damage has been done. From now
on, every time an Olympic athlete is forced to pee into a cup to
test for drugs or allegations of blood-doping or some other method
of performance enhancement is alleged, the stench of hypocrisy will
rise around the proceedings like swamp gas. Maybe one of the
committee members should be forced to hold the cup.

LOST IN CYBERSPACE: HOW TO HOLD ON TO YOUR ADDRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: In the e-mail addresses below, (AT) should be replaced with
the typographic symbol.) 
(DW) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I took the existence of e-mail and my 6-year-old e-mail address
for granted until I found out last month ago that my Internet
service provider was discontinuing my address.
</P>
<P>
   The change came because my old provider, Digital Express, had
merged with several other providers to become a company known as
Intermedia. In an effort to harmonize the brand names and create
one service, Digital Express informed its customers, the new
company was discontinuing the old e-mail addresses ending with
digex.net.
</P>
<P>
   My new address, if I wanted to keep the service, would end with
iamdigex.com. I didn't want that address, though, and so I was cast
into confusion.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, changing an e-mail address looks like a problem
that can be handled by several hundred electronic notes to friends
and relatives. It is often, however, much more complicated than
that _ especially if mailing lists, stationery and other software
packages are involved. My old address, pcw(AT)access.digex.net, is
locked away in archives and Web sites around the world, and no bulk
e-mail is going to change all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Pritchard, a spokesman for Digital Express, said: ``The
whole dial-up business is being coordinated and consolidated into
one service. The effects on folks like you and other folks who have
been around for a few years is more negative than we would have
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have stepped in to try to solve the problem.
Among them is an e-mail provider called Bigfoot. Lenny Barshack,
the company's chief executive, said Bigfoot had started out trying
to become a comprehensive directory of e-mail addresses throughout
the Web. Then company officials noticed that each year, 40 percent
of the e-mail addresses in the directory were changing, as people
switched jobs or service providers.
</P>
<P>
   So Bigfoot began offering a permanent forwarding service for
e-mail accounts. The accounts are free, but Barshack said the
company hoped to make money by offering additional services like
smart forwarding, which will forward to several addresses.
</P>
<P>
   As a freelance writer of books and magazine and newspaper
articles who is also a programmer, I have a small business that is
widely scattered. Being quickly accessible to the people who might
want to hire me, and to readers, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   The most permanent examples of my e-mail address are printed at
the end of magazine articles I have written and in the front of my
books. They still generate about one or two letters a week.
Electronic versions are contained in archives of computer
discussion groups I take part in, like the Risks Digest, about
computer crashes and technology problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the electronic documents, at least, could, in theory, be
changed, it is often impossible to do so. While I don't have
printed business cards or stationery with the e-mail address as
many other people do, the address is almost everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   I am luckier than most because my name is not too common and
people should be able to find me with search engines. Others, with
more common names, are bound to experience some trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Watson, another longtime Digital Express customer, said
his e-mail address was in countless places throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually the ringing master of the Washington Ringing
Society and the contact person for that,'' he said about his hobby
of organizing people who make music by ringing bells. ``I've
changed my address on three pages in Britain and Australia, but I
can't locate every other Web page that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Intermedia originally wrote to inform customers on Nov. 10
that the e-mail addresses were changing starting on Dec. 1 _ short
notice _ the company said it would forward e-mail from the old
addresses for three months. After that, it said, we would be on our
own.
</P>
<P>
   After many customers complained, the company announced a new
plan: it will forward mail for up to a year _ as long as people
sign up for the new service plan. After that, the old addresses
will be toast.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I went for the one-year plan, but I also decided to
search for something more permanent. Here are some of the options
for others who may find themselves in similar situations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose a big provider. America Online, for example, is not
very likely to merge and change its name to form a new corporate
image. In cases where AOL has merged, it is the other company that
usually changes its identity to AOL, although in many cases, AOL
maintains the old company's separate name and brand. Compuserve
customers, for instance, still have Compuserve addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But Trish Primrose, a spokeswoman for AOL, points out that the
AOL service agreement says only that ``AOL provides you with a
limited, nonexclusive license for no more than the term of your
membership to use the screen name.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Go back to school. Many schools offer alumni permanent
addresses because to do so costs little and ties users together and
to the school. These addresses are probably much more stable than
those of the big service providers. The only downside is that big
schools with long histories often end up with several students with
the same name.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check out the e-mail services on the Web. All of them promise
free e-mail and forwarding. Hotmail, Yahoo, Geocities, Bigfoot and
Netscape are some of the more stable Web-based e-mail sites.
Providing the service is relatively inexpensive for them, and the
companies can often make money selling advertisements that they
show you when you read your mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ The best solution is to gain control of your own domain name.
Steven King, a programmer, is another former Digital Express
customer who also must worry about disappearing on the Web among
the many references to the writer of the same name. He told me he
doesn't worry as much about his e-mail because he now largely uses
an address tied to a domain name he controls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had been having all his mail forwarded to his Digex
address. ``Now I have to look for a new dial-up provider,'' he
said. ``It's going to cost me about $300.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many people own the domain associated with their last name.
Ralph Merkle, a cryptographer and nanotechnologist, controls
merkle.com. Pete Loshin, an author and former Byte magazine editor,
controls loshin.com. Unfortunately for me, wayner.com is owned by
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this solution is not inexpensive. Network Solutions,
the company that controls the registration of domain names ending
in .com or .org, charges $70 for two years of service. Other
countries around the world are running competing services.
</P>
<P>
   Once you own the domain name, you must arrange for some computer
to answer all requests for that domain. There are many companies
offering what is known as domain hosting for fees that range from
$5 to $50 a month. Most of these plans are aimed at companies that
need a place for their Web site, but they usually include e-mail as
part of the package. The fees are often determined more by how many
people visit the Web site than by how many e-mail messages you get.
</P>
<P>
   Since I already control a few domain names, I have moved my
e-mail address to one of them, flyzone.com, and I have also
registered a name at Bigfoot. Assuming no major changes are afoot
for the domain system, you can reach me at pcw(AT)flyzone .com. I
hope. &QL;

have done _ and forgive us,'' muses Jo Becker, the narrator, near
the end of Sue Miller's riveting new novel, ``While I Was Gone.''
Jo continues: ``We need to tell. We need to be whole in someone's
sight: Know this about me, and yet love me. Please.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo realizes that her wish is hopelessly idealistic. ``But it's
so much to ask of other people!'' she concludes. ``Too much.'' You
can't confide an infidelity to your husband and ask him to go on
loving you in the same way. You can't confess a crime that affects
the listener and expect no consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jo has glimpsed the promised land of intimate revelation.
She once confessed to her present husband, Daniel, a minister, that
she was tempted to have an affair; he responded by helping her to
surmount her feelings. And she has learned in dealing with her
three daughters ``that you need not collapse when the shriek comes:
 &UR; Don't you get it? I &LR;  hate &UR; you! &LR; '' She explains: ``You need to
understand and accept being hated. I think this is one of the
greatest gifts children can give you, as long as it doesn't last.''
</P>
<P>
   So wholeness in someone's sight is at least fleetingly possible,
Jo believes. In ``While I Was Gone,'' Ms. Miller tests its
consequences under several conditions. By doing so, she has once
again taken a morally extreme position and made it seem both
plausible and questionable, as she has done often in her previous
fiction, most startlingly in her debut novel, ``The Good Mother,''
in which the conflicts between passionate sexuality and parental
love were compellingly explored.
</P>
<P>
   In ``While I Was Gone,'' Jo Becker is a happily married
veterinarian who suddenly feels that life is somehow passing her
by. When Eli Mayhew, a distinguished biochemist, shows up from her
past and asks her to treat his crippled dog, she remembers the time
in the late 1960s when the two of them happened to be living in the
same small commune in Cambridge, Mass. Hiding from a loveless
marriage, Jo found the experience an ecstatically happy one _
walking home from the bar where she worked, ``I sometimes broke
into a run, I was so eager just to be there'' _ even though,
unknown to her, for Eli it was a less happy time.
</P>
<P>
   Eli and his wife have recently moved to the western
Massachusetts village where Jo and her husband live. With his
reappearance, Jo finds herself recalling the commune and its
``horrible'' ending, when another member, a woman whose affection
had taught Jo ``how to love with enough recklessness and generosity
to make it real,'' had been murdered in what police concluded was
``a robbery gone bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Aroused by Eli's presence, Jo develops what she calls a ``crush
if you could call something so psychologically distorted by such a
playful name.'' But the crush is on herself. As she explains: ``The
middle-aged Eli contained for me, of course, his youthful self,
yes. But he contained me also. The self that had known him then.
Myself-when-young. And that was what made him attractive to me.''
So she gingerly edges herself toward an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller does many things well in this novel. She shows a deep
respect for all her characters. You experience the pleasure of the
commune's members at the same time that you understand the contempt
they are held in by police, their community and the relatives of
the murdered victim. The scenes are emotionally textured,
particularly those with Jo's children or the animals she looks
after so affectionately. The narrative pacing is masterly, building
tension even in its most psychologically subtle passages. The story
is at once so well made and vividly imagined that one might call it
an exercise in spontaneous craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   But most impressive is the complex portrait of the protagonist
that Ms. Miller draws. The story depends on Jo's seeming slightly
elusive to everyone close to her. In fact, she lies about her
identity to the members of the commune. In a parlor game they play,
the adjectives they choose to describe her are ``reserved, sexy,
curious, fragile, blue and opaque.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet to the reader she remains almost entirely sympathetic.
The reason for her elusiveness is a feeling she herself can never
quite put her finger on, a feeling that goes back to her childhood
when she first ran away from home over some trivial incident but
was left with a sense of shame that ``felt deep and permanent, a
stain I would wear forever, an agony I was condemned to wake to
over and over, a final isolation I'd brought on myself by turning
in the wrong direction, heading the wrong way, when I was confused
and wounded.'' Her problem, of course, is that she has no one to
whom she can disclose herself completely. Part of her is
permanently ``gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel's epigraph comprises lines of a poem by Ms. Miller's
mother, Judith Beach Nichols (1919-1979), that nicely sum up the
story's themes.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar waxwings dart among the swallows
</P>
<P>
   Iridescent fish with wings,
</P>
<P>
   Layers of life above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Under, the trout.
</P>
<P>
   The trout, so stolid and weighty in the poem that they bring all
movement to a stop, are feelings in the novel that underlie
everything, yet, like good trout, are difficult to catch. Thus does
``While I Was Gone'' celebrate what is impulsive in human nature
and at the same time lament what lies deep below the surface
flickering darkly.

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ Republicans mustered a party-line majority today to
defeat a Democratic motion to dismiss the impeachment case against
President Clintion and to approve witness depositions. Democrats,
however, demonstrated they have the strength to block the
two-thirds majority needed to oust Clinton from office. (Sherman,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ White House reaction to
Wednesday's votes in the Senate; President Clinton's day. (Deans,
Cox News Service).

   IMPEACH-GADEL_ WASHINGTON _ A look at how Georgia's senators
voted on today's motions and why. Interviews with both. Foskett
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-MANAGERS _ WASHINGTON _ The rift between House and
Senate Republicans continues to grow. House managers see the Senate
deal as a sellout and say they 've been told by Senate leaders that
there will be no live witnesses because the upper chamber must not
be sullied by this sordid affair. Carr
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ Departing from his usual practice,
Ted Kennedy invites reporters into his ornatge hideaway office to
discuss the votes today. As he holds forth, Eunice Shriver and Amb.
Jean Smith quietly sip tea in the corner. Just another of the odd
scenes of this day of massive spin. (Baxter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BAXTER-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ There she goes, again. Monica
Lewinsky and her entourage decamped from Washington on Wednesday,
her business with the House impeachment managers finished for the
time being. Soon enough, Lewinsky is likely to be talking to the
Senate, and eventually to Barbara Walters. But she arrived and
departed from this visit without dispelling the air of mystery that
has transformed her from a California girl to a national enigma.
Except to those authorized to question her, she remained silent,
lips closed in a faint half-smile, Mona Lisa with a logo on her
cap. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED TUESDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ If the U.S. government is running a
surplus, how come the national debt is still going up? Overall
federal borrowing surged by $113 billion last year despite
celebrations over a ``$70 billion surplus.'' That's because the
excess revenues came into the Social Security trust fund, whose
cash was then borrowed to finance the rest of the government
operations. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday
reaffirmed his plan to allocate projected budget surpluses for
Social Security and Medicare, but said that in the case of
Medicare, further reforms are needed beyond the infusion of new
case. (Schultz, Cox News Service).

specific plans for what may be his last legislative session in a

for any big policy surprises; this will be more about putting
details to his campaign promises on education, taxes and
compassionate government. With reaction, color and comparison to
his 1997 speech. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

   ATLANTA-CRIMESTATS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta police investigators
violated FBI crime reporting procedures and distorted the city's
crime statistics by routinely dismissing incidents as false or

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After more than an hour of art talk one recent day,
Lisa Yuskavage, 36, a painter whose often shocking work deals with
sex, misogyny and self-loathing, got up from the couch in her
studio above a used-furniture warehouse in Tribeca and fetched the
secret of her latest success.
</P>
<P>
   She held up two plaster sculptures of oddly misshapen, fleshy
female nudes, each about 10 inches high. She described how she had
made them and three similar statuettes and used them to experiment
with composition and lighting. She would find poses she liked, take
photographs, make drawings from the photographs and paint small
studies from the drawings. Only then did Ms. Yuskavage put pigment
on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   And what paintings they are: provocative depictions of loose,
blase women in colors that glow or sometimes scream. Many have
salacious titles. Critics have described the works, usually in
praise, as ``anatomically impossible bimbos, nymphets and other
female travesties'' and ``demonically distorted Kewpie-doll women''
that are ``perversely entertaining'' and ``visual spectacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yuskavage once said she captured the ``far-out extension''
of male sex fantasies. To question prevailing views about women and
sex is not enough; she wants a reaction, as so many artists of her
generation do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wonders why Ms. Yuskavage (pronounced you-SKA-vidge)
went through the drawn-out artistic process. Her recent works,
which sold out at prices of up to $30,000 at the Marianne Boesky
Gallery in Soho last fall, are directly descended from two series
she made a few years ago called ``Bad Babies'' and ``Big Blondes.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then she simply painted, conjuring up her ``sinister and
precocious'' (another critic's label) creations the way a child
might invent imaginary friends. Those paintings made her reputation
and created a following among top curators like Robert Storr of the
Museum of Modern Art and influential collectors like Charles
Saatchi, the British advertising magnate.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ms. Yuskavage, a voluble woman who seems to be making up
for the long hours she spends alone in her studio without even a
phone, spoke about the often studied but still elusive creative
process, she was clear about the reasons for her new method.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of making sure that painting is not dead,'' she
said. ``Paintings of nudes have been done, so I asked, `How can it
be done differently?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She quotes Jasper Johns' famous self-instructional sketchbook
note: ``Take an object. Do something with it. Do something else
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her earlier works, Ms. Yuskavage's figures often floated,
apparition-like, in color fields. Her newer creations set the same
sort of woman in more complex backgrounds, sometimes with
references to art history or psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her theory or process, things do seem to be working
right now for Ms. Yuskavage. No less an artist than Chuck Close has
called her work ``beautifully painted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Garrels, the chief curator at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, explains the appeal this way: ``The images are
extremely seductive in terms of color and her use of light, yet I
find her paintings extremely unsettling and uncomfortable. And it's
the combination of the seductive and the unsettling that makes them
so interesting. They are very haunting and very poignant paintings,
and they are brave paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Her work was not always so well received, as Ms. Yuskavage tells
it. Born into a working-class family in Philadelphia, she ``found
art'' when she was about 12, partly to be different than her older,
``smarter'' sister, who became a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before I wanted to be an artist, I remember sitting at my
grandmother's table with a tablet _ that's what we always called a
pad of paper _ and drawing,'' she recalled. ``I always drew naked
people, and then I tore them up. I was always only ever interested
in people.''
</P>
<P>
   After earning a bachelor's degree at Temple University and a
master's at Yale University, she started showing her paintings in
group exhibitions. But she was not happy with her mild depictions
of large-eyed girls looking away from the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Then two things happened. Ms. Yuskavage visited the Sonnabend
Gallery in Soho to see a Jeff Koons show: 18 kitschy objects
inspired by soft porn, rock music, movies and television and made
according to Koons' instructions, but not by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I liked it,'' she said. ``It was an affront.
But it was like getting smacked in the face. It was nasty work, but
it was better than what I did because it was affecting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some time after that, another breakthrough occurred during a
conversation with her husband, Matvey Levenstein, who is also a
Yale-educated painter. At the time, ``my personality was too much
for people _ I was too provocative,'' she said. ``I felt no one
liked me because I was too wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaped to an odd conclusion: ``I told my husband I think I
should not paint anymore; painting is the problem,'' she said. ``I
was very original, very take it or leave it. I felt I was more
original than my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Levenstein, she said, suggested that she exchange places with
her work, toning down her ribald personality while allowing her
paintings to become more abrasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for a year: What would it take to make my work the
opposite?'' she said. ``And I realized I could do it. So I made
those `Bad Babies' paintings of angry demons. I let them be dirty
and lazy.'' Her series of ``Big Blondes,'' who smoked, squatted and
did things unprintable in a family newspaper, followed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most days, Ms. Yuskavage went to her studio and simply painted,
with few preliminaries. ``I knew how to draw bodies out of my
head,'' she said, ``and I understand how light works.'' She has
always, she added, loved paintings ``where light became the theater
of the painting, almost the subject of the painting.'' And her best
work, she said, incorporated the female body and dramatic lighting.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the art classes she sometimes teaches at Princeton
University and Cooper Union, as she told her students how
Tintoretto placed wax sculptures in a box and used candles to play
with the light, that Ms. Yuskavage was inspired to embark on her
new way of working.
</P>
<P>
   Initially she fashioned sculptures from Hydrocal (an artist's
clay that hardens into a lightweight plaster), made a box for them
and used lights to simulate daylight, candlelight, theatrical light
and so on. ``I felt I was giving myself fluidity,'' she said. ``I
felt my earlier work was one-dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   Since those sculptures were exhibited and sold, Ms. Yuskavage
has made the process more elaborate. She asked friends to model,
rented a photography studio and hired makeup artists and equipment
assistants. Voila: a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get it done in eight hours, and it was the hardest
thing I ever did,'' she said, getting excited all over again about
the experience. ``Everyone was asking me what to do.'' Which was a
180-degree turn from her usual solitude. From those photographs,
Ms. Yuskavage made sculptures and drawings and oil studies before
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason she does all this is that she always wants to move
forward,'' said Marianne Boesky, her dealer, ``and when she gets
too good at something, she feels like she's cheating and she has to
start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yuskavage will sometimes ruminate for weeks before starting
a new body of work, and her ideas can come from anywhere. ``I have
a lot of ideas backed up,'' she said. ``I keep a lot of them in my
head. I'm a list maker, too, but if it's important, you never
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her studio, a no-frills white rectangle messy with paint,
brushes, containers and canvases in various stages of completion,
Ms. Yuskavage tends to listen to the radio, generally a public
station that has some talk so she feels ``connected to the world,''
though she does not really hear much of what is said.
</P>
<P>
   She rarely starts painting right away. Instead, ``I look at what
I have done, I make a list of what needs to be fixed on a painting,
then I may work on something else,'' like a watercolor. ``It's like
a warm-up for an athlete,'' she said. ``I enter a different level
of thinking after a few hours of working.''
</P>
<P>
   Once at this level of ``alertness,'' as she terms it, ``I'm not
confused; I'm the master of my domain,'' she said. ``It's not
mystical. But you don't paint with your hands, you paint with your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yuskavage once said in an interview with Close that when she
paints, ``I allow all sorts of things to run through my head.'' She
mentioned dirty songs, a passage about urinating from James Joyce's
``Portrait of the Artist,'' Shirley Temple movies and the light in
a Giovanni Bellini painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's base; some of it's elegant,'' she said. ``It's a
Frankenstein way of putting a painting together. The parts of the
corpse come from different bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all artists, Ms. Yuskavage is reluctant to put
specific meanings on her paintings. ``Viewers are always trying to
get it one way, and it's not like that,'' she said. ``It changes.
Within one painting, it can change from top to bottom. It's like
dreams, the way dreams work, starting out one way and ending up
another way. Artists play with shifting boundaries, and that's the
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``ornery'' person, Ms. Yuskavage deflects more
detailed probing about her thought processes. Still, she
acknowledges an element of self-portraiture in her work. She has
also said that her works are about misogyny and bad habits like
social climbing and self-deprecation. Critics have commented on
those things as well as on the anger in her creations and the
conflict between self-love and self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yuskavage agreed that in a cultural climate where anything
not only goes but might even seem necessary to gain attention, the
temptation is to grow ever more provocative. But she said she would
not take that road. Citing a 1995 work called ``Rorschach Blot,''
which depicted a nude woman, standing, with her legs spread apart,
she said, ``That was the painting in which I answered how low will
I go, how vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   Her newer work, a bit more subtle but ever sexual, has a little
more context, though narrative remains minimal. One painting,
``Honeymoon,'' poses a long-haired blond woman, clad in a peignoir,
at a window overlooking a mountainous landscape. Another,
``Loved,'' is a seductive nude with strategically placed flowers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, a widely admired German arts
executive, has been named executive and artistic director of
Carnegie Hall, officials announced Wednesday. Ohnesorg succeeds
Judith Arron, who died on Dec. 18 and had run the hall since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was ratified Tuesday afternoon in a unanimous
vote by Carnegie Hall's board, said Sanford Weill, the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one person she respected above all others in the
profession,'' Weill said of Ohnesorg in an interview before the
news conference. ``We felt as though Judy was telling us what to
do. He has the vitality and imagination that are necessary to build
on the work that she did here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohnesorg (pronounced OH-nuh-zorg), 51, has been director of
2,200-seat Cologne Philharmonic Hall in Germany since 1983. In that
position he has presented about 400 concerts a year, in a season
that resembles Carnegie's in that it includes visits by
international orchestras and recitalists, as well as jazz
performances. He has also been active in promoting contemporary
music, having commissioned 140 works, on his own and in
partnerships, over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Carnegie, Ohnesorg will oversee 550 to 600 concerts a year in
the main hall and Weill Recital Hall, and programming in the new
Arthur and Judy Zankel Hall, which opens during the 2001-2 season.
His contract is to run two years, beginning in September, but will
have an evergreen clause that allows for automatic renewal. He will
also become a member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising element of the appointment was that with so
many accomplished American arts executives to choose from, the most
famous concert hall in the United States selected a European. Ms.
Arron had come to Carnegie from the Cincinnati Symphony, and has
been credited with transforming the hall by expanding its
educational activities and making new music a larger part of the
hall's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Stern, the president of Carnegie Hall, said he and Weill
had spent the last month in ``an assiduous search'' that included
discussing the post with eight or 10 other candidates, but that
they considered Ohnesorg to be Ms. Arron's handpicked successor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after cancer was diagnosed in Ms. Arron, she invited
Ohnesorg to join the staff as her partner, partly in the hope of
guaranteeing a smooth succession. Ohnesorg was unable to accept the
position then, but a week before her death, Ms. Arron asked him to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Ohnesorg said that friends in the American orchestral world had
given him an appreciation of American culture. He has adopted one
decidedly American idea in Cologne. Like many European
organizations, his hall faced a loss of government support, with no
tradition of philanthropy to compensate. Ohnesorg persuaded
European companies to underwrite 20 percent of his hall's budget.
</P>
<P>
   His experience overseeing the planning and construction of the
Cologne hall, which opened in 1986, was also appealing to Carnegie.
He will have a similar task with Zankel Hall, and a free hand in
shaping that hall's programming, none of which has been planned.
The schedule for the coming season and much of the 2000-1 season in
the main hall and Weill Recital Hall is already in place;
Ohnesorg's stamp will not be evident until the next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far too early to speak about details,'' he said. ``This
is the most vibrant and intact organization I can imagine, and if I
find things I would like to change, I will speak to the staff and
the board about them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected to keep Carnegie's artistic staff in place.
``I can't be, and don't want to be, a copy of Judy Arron,'' he
said. ``I have to find my own way. But she left a great heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohnesorg _ his name means without worry in German _ was born in
Weilheim, in Bavaria. He was trained as a flutist but also earned a
degree in management from the University of Munich. He worked as a
freelance journalist before taking his first music management job,
as a touring manager for the conductor Karl Richter and the
violinist Gidon Kremer. From 1979 until he took his Cologne post,
he was the managing director of the Munich Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only mixed feeling,'' Ohnesorg said, ``is that I have to go
back this afternoon to explain to my own team, which I assembled
over the last 15 years, why I have to come to New York.''

MAYOR CRITICIZED FOR FLYING BOYCOTTED AIRLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown flew United Airlines to New
York City this week, despite a call by San Francisco's gay
supervisors and other community leaders to boycott the airline
because of the company's opposition to the city's domestic partners
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mayor or any other official, elected or otherwise, is
flying United at this point without the consciousness of our
boycott, or our legal battle with United, then I'd like to sit down
with them and educate them on the issue,'' Supervisor Mark Leno
said.
</P>
<P>
   United, the largest airline operating at San Francisco
International Airport, has gone to court to challenge the law that
requires companies doing business with San Francisco to provide the
same benefits to workers with unmarried partners as they give to
married employees.
</P>
<P>
   United joined a federal lawsuit filed in May 1997 by the Air
Transport Association, the trade group for the nation's biggest
airlines, seeking exemption from the ordinance. The airlines
contend that only federal regulators can force such a requirement
on the industry. The case pending before a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Leno and two other city supervisors have supported the boycott
of United.
</P>
<P>
   They said they hoped city employees would use an airline other
than United whenever possible. Boycott organizers asked that if
people did use United, they wear buttons announcing their
displeasure with the company's position on unmarried partners. They
asked people in the private sector to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the spokeswoman for the mayor, said Tuesday that
she did not know whether the mayor was aware of the boycott, but
she said his support of the law could not be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in this city has been more supportive of equal benefits
than Mayor Brown. No one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Tom Ammiano, an author of the law, said the
mayor's decision to fly United as unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not earth-shattering,'' he said, ``but United is viewed
in the queer community as the enemy, and has been the focus of
rallies and picket lines.'' The message of the boycott, he said,
``is don't fly United unless you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was in New York to visit relatives. He also will
attend a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bender said the mayor ``has severe time constraints, and he was
looking for the most efficient flight to get him where he needed to
go quickly.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: FROM SINCERE TO SLICK, AMBITIONS FLICKER AT
SUNDANCE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Mark Borchardt is a long-haired guy from
Milwaukee who has been obsessed with filmmaking since childhood.
While supporting himself by delivering newspapers and working as a
cemetery caretaker, he was able to wheedle enough money out of his
uncle to make the slasher film of his dreams, ``Coven.'' He shot it
in black and white and roped his reluctant mother into helping out.
Now here he is, suddenly famous enough to be spotted on Main Street
in this town, but a far cry from the Cinderellas who once made such
hot copy here. The increasingly important and businesslike Sundance
Film Festival has long since outgrown its favorite fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``American Movie,'' Chris Smith's funny,
affectionate, warts-and-all documentary about Borchardt's
determination to get a movie made, is such a quintessential
Sundance experience. The old can-do spirit of independent
filmmaking is here, but so is the link between the tough times in
Borchardt's life and the wild escapism he wants to bring to the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie,'' which has been delighting audiences here
despite the print that caught fire and the large duct that fell out
of the ceiling at Tuesday's screening, isn't one of those
documentaries that reiterates the expected. It finds something
unexpectedly fresh and moving in subject matter that could have
been so familiar. Then there's the added novelty of Smith and
Borchardt, who sound relatively indifferent to the prospect of
overnight success here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I gearing up for?'' said Borchardt, who has three
young children. ``Going back to delivering papers. I'm not going to
sit around thinking about my big future while they take me off to
debtors' prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambitions were somewhat different at the meeting in a hotel
lobby two days earlier; there was talk about a $170 million gross
before the high rollers had finished brainstorming about a story
for their new film. What they had so far was the name of an A-list
leading man, an action-packed conspiracy plot about a priest and a
shroud, some questions about who should play the dark-haired
younger sidekick (one possible actor was vetoed because ``I don't
want to work with him, he'll be hitting on all the women'') and the
question of whether Tony was a good name for a leading man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony sounds like the guy who works on my car,'' one
participant observed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this year's festival is unfolding in a lively middle
range somewhere between these two extremes. Some of the work here
is so polished and commercial, especially in the very strong
premieres category, that the effect is one of looking at new models
at an auto show. Tuesday night's centerpiece selection was
``Sugartown,'' a sure-fire winner from Allison Anders and Kurt Voss
in which various Los Angeles users and losers cross paths, and
everyone has some tenuous show-business connection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anders, the director of ``Gas Food Lodging,'' was no doubt
instrumental in creating an array of interesting female characters
(played by Ally Sheedy, Rosanna Arquette, Beverly d'Angelo and a
crafty newcomer named Jade Gordon) and turning the idea of feminist
humor into something other than an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugartown'' has the sly ensemble flavor of a Robert Altman
film. Needless to say, so does Altman's own delightful ``Cookie's
Fortune,'' which opened the festival this year. Altman's long,
up-and-down career is on a serious upswing in the wake of his
evocative genre film ``The Gingerbread Man'' and now this breezy,
beautifully acted small-town story, revolving around the heartfelt
friendship between an elderly white widow (Patricia Neal) and a
black caretaker (Charles Dutton, in a warm, funny performance that
sets the tone for the film) and spinning all manner of mischief out
of a cast including Glenn Close, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Thus
far, these are the most blissfully entertaining films in town.
</P>
<P>
   Another early triumph here is the dreamily beautiful Spanish
film ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle,'' directed in madly romantic
fashion by Julio Medem. Medem once planned a career in medicine,
thinking of psychiatry, and in view of the insight and delicacy he
brings to the screen, that comes as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   His film, unfolding with an enraptured sense of destiny, follows
the lives of a boy and girl who meet as 8-year-olds, have
palindrome names (Ana and Otto) and share ardent secrets. One of
its more magical moments finds Otto throwing dozens of paper
airplanes out a window, each repeating the same sentence so
romantic that it causes people to fall in love. Asked what sentence
that was, Medem smiled a lovely, cryptic smile.
</P>
<P>
   No less entrancing in its own spookier way is Errol Morris'
brilliant `` Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,''
which contemplates the thought processes of a scientist who proudly
specializes in killing. Morris, once again Sundance's reigning
philosopher king, shows no interest in passing judgment on
Leuchter, who threw himself enthusiastically into the task of
scientifically demonstrating that the gas chambers of Auschwitz
could not have killed half a million people. Rather, Morris
considers the difference between seeing and understanding, between
knowledge and moral responsibility, in ways that give `` Death''
much farther-reaching implications than Leuchter himself generates.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chilling, fascinating extension of the work begun by
``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control,'' as Morris wearily explained
after a full day of jumping through hoops here and one more photo
session to go. ``Can't the picture be taken posthumously?'' he
asked his publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Death may not sound like a sexy topic. But along with Vietnam, a
major concern in several films this year, it is one of the few
subjects here that isn't torrid. The actor Tim Roth has directed
``The War Zone,'' a film of bleak, haunting power about graphically
depicted incest.
</P>
<P>
   For self-evident reasons, crowds have been lining up for the
Hughes brothers' documentary ``American Pimp'' and for ``Sex: The
Annabel Chong Story,'' in which a college-educated pornography star
has sex with a couple of hundred men for what are putatively
feminist reasons. Then there's ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' in
which Mike Figgis brings his considerable powers of erotic
suggestion to a vague, pretentious story set forth in gauzy
vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   For more mainstream smoldering, soon to be shown is ``A Walk on
the Moon,'' which tells the story of a dutiful Jewish housewife who
meets a sexy salesman at a Catskills summer camp near Woodstock, a
setup that has life-altering possibilities. Maybe only
``Ravenous,'' Antonia Bird's tragically earnest film about a Donner
Party-like tale of cannibalism, sounds this hard to swallow. But
Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen make ``A Walk on the Moon'' a whole
lot easier on the eyes.

FEINGOLD, ALONE IN JUMPING PARTY LINES, SAYS HE IS UNDECIDED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., the only senator to
cross party lines in Wednesday's twin impeachment trial votes, said
he voted with the Republican majority because he's undecided about
the merits of the case for removing President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply cannot say that House (prosecutors) cannot prevail''
in their case, he said in a statement. Thus, prosecutors should be
given leeway to make their case with witnesses because they have to
prove it ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold stressed that his votes don't imply that he is leaning
toward convicting Clinton when a final up-or-down vote is cast in
the Senate. He said the House prosecutors' case ``has some serious
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard this as a close case in some respects,'' Feingold
said. ``The best course to follow is to allow both sides a fair
opportunity to make the case they wish to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-sponsored measure to call witnesses carried by a
vote of 56-44 while the Democratic-sponsored motion to dismiss the
case failed by the same margin. Feingold voted with the Republicans
on both ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Mayer, a political science professor at the University of
Wisconsin who advised Feingold in his 1998 re-election campaign,
said Feingold's votes ``show he's not afraid to stick his thumb in
the eye of anybody if he thinks it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan and White House
aide Sidney Blumenthal are to be interviewed in depositions.
Feingold said he would reserve judgment on whether to permit live
witness testimony on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Spring, chair of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin, said
she was chagrined that Feingold voted with the Republican majority
to continue the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Feingold is a man of integrity and if he believes this is
the proper way for this process to continue, then I'm not surprised
he would vote his conscience,'' she said. ``But I am
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feingold won praise from Senate colleagues on both sides of
the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Feingold was troubled over
the second of two impeachment articles charging Clinton with
obstruction of justice and wanted to hear from witnesses. ``That's
fair and reasonable and I certainly respect his right to dissent,
having been there a few times myself,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he was surprised that more
Democrats didn't vote to depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Feingold was reaching out to the reality _ are we
going to restrict the right of the House prosecutors to do
justice?'' Murkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, 45, is best known for his co-sponsorship with Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., of legislation to overhaul federal campaign
finance law. The McCain-Feingold bill would have banned ``soft
money,'' unlimited contributions to the Democratic and Republican
parties for party building and getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money'' contributions during Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign became the focus of Senate and House investigations after
revelations that millions in illegal contributions had flowed into
Democratic coffers from overseas donors. The bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold was one of just a few Democrats to join Republicans in
calling for an independent counsel to investigate alleged
Democratic campaign finance abuses. Attorney General Janet Reno
turned down those requests.
</P>
<P>
   A gregarious, energetic, ``Mr. Nice Guy'' kind of senator and a
Harvard law school graduate and former Rhodes scholar, Feingold
first won his seat in 1992 with an upset victory over Republican
Bob Kasten.
</P>
<P>
   He showed a light touch in a television ad featuring a mock
newspaper headline endorsement from Elvis Presley, and a second one
showing him opening a closet in his Middleton, Wis., home and
remarking, ``Look, no skeletons.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1998 campaign, Democratic advisers privately worried he
was shooting himself in the foot by refusing to accept ``soft
money'' help from the Democratic National Committee and even
rebuffing television ads from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he eked out a narrow victory over aggressive GOP
challenger Mark Neumann by a thin 50-49 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   In his six years in the Senate, Feingold has wracked up an
independent voting record. He and another prominent Senate liberal,
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., were the only votes against a $250.5
billion defense spending bill last October.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is against the death penalty, Feingold was among
eight senators opposing 1996 anti-terrorism legislation. Both bills
were backed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On free-speech grounds, Feingold led the fight against a 1995
constitutional amendment prohibiting desecration of the U.S. flag.
</P>
<P>
   And he has voted against efforts to ban partial birth abortion,
a dicey vote in a state such as Wisconsin with a strong
anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who has a firm belief in core principles,'' Mayer
said. ``It's not like he looks for reasons to create this image,
but he won't pass them up simply because someone says that in the
interest of the party, you must do X or Y. That's not good enough
for him.''

<P>
   CARDIFF, Wales _ Liz Shankland, a 35-year-old public-relations
executive here, was thrilled to marry her longtime love, Gerald
Toms, last November. But she was not thrilled when people started
to call her by the name of a person she does not believe exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``At parties, people would say, `This is Gerry Toms _ and this
is his wife, Mrs. Toms,''' she related. ``They didn't even give me
a Christian name. And when I said my name was Liz Shankland, they'd
say: `You can't do that. You're really Mrs. Toms.'''
</P>
<P>
   The comments grew more extreme. ``One woman said to me, `Don't
you think you're being rather disrespectful and rude?''' Ms.
Shankland recalled _ and so she decided extreme measures were
called for. So the new bride, a former reporter and editor at The
Western Mail here who knows the value of a well-timed media
offensive, decided to take the unusual step of buying a classified
ad in her old paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although she has now publicly pledged undying love for her
husband, she has not changed her name to `Mrs. Toms,''' the ad
said. ``Instead, she will continue to be known _ personally and
professionally _ as Ms. Liz Shankland, and makes no apology to the
misguided fuddy-duddies who believe that to be strange or
unconventional.''
</P>
<P>
   In its small way, Ms. Shankland's situation illustrates a larger
phenomenon in Britain. It is sometimes hard, women say, to convince
people that you don't want to take the name of your husband (if you
have one). And it is sometimes hard to get people to call you Ms. _
a word that, while in wide use in some professions, still seems to
carry connotations of the stereotypical bra-burning, man-bashing,
non-leg-shaving feminists who apparently so terrorized British men
in the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just can't cope with Ms.,'' said Margaret Blott, a London
obstetrician in her 30s, who felt compelled to use Miss when she
began practicing medicine. (Under the British system, many of the
highest-qualified doctors don't call themselves Dr.) Miss Blott,
the only Miss in a sea of Mr.'s on the front door of her elegant
Harley Street office, said she would have much preferred Ms., but
didn't want to unsettle anyone in the conservative medical
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make all sorts of assumptions when you use Miss,'' she
said. ``They come in and expect someone who's 60 years old. On the
other hand, Ms. does have connotations of aggressive feminist
overtones, and a lot of people don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Kathy Lette, an expatriate Australian novelist who has
made a career of poking fun at the stodgy ways of British males,
said it's sexism, pure and simple. ``When I say I want to be called
Ms. Lette,'' said Ms. Lette, who is married to one of Britain's
most respected human-rights lawyers, Geoffrey Robertson, ``they
either ignore me, or they just go ahead and call me Mrs. Robertson,
or Mrs. Lette. When you make an issue out of it, they look at you
like you've turned into Lorena Bobbitt.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their trappings of enlightenment, she said, British men
are unreconstructed cave-dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women here have been lulled into a false sense of security,''
she said. ``When I moved here, I thought I'd come to New Man
planet. The men talked about gardening and opera and quoted huge
whacks of poetry. They knew Shakespeare's sonnets by heart. I
thought, `Oh, they're so sensitive.' But it's a big scam _ they're
just as sexist as Australian men, but it's much more hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, it seems, is that Britain has always
resisted what it sees as American-style political correctness, a
term derided as describing a ridiculously tortured sensitivity that
has resulted in absurd changes to the language.
</P>
<P>
   Britons are loath to demonstrate such sensitivity, or to make
such changes, themselves. Thus, people who deliver the mail here
are still called postmen, even if they happen to be post-women.
Michael Portillo, the former Tory defense minister, was routinely
referred to as ``the Spaniard'' in newspaper reports, a reference
to the fact that his father was a Spanish immigrant, and nobody
seemed to object.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism is a highly charged concept here, as it is to some in
the United States, and many women seem almost physically afraid of
the term. Margaret Jay, the leader of the House of Lords, recently
declared in an interview with The Guardian that she was not a
feminist, even though one of of her jobs is to run the government's
Women's Unit, which deals with issues like education, child care
and equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics, feminism is seen as negative, complaining about
things,'' said Lady Jay, who as a bona fide baroness since her
elevation to the House of Lords no longer has to bother deciding
whether she wants to be Mrs., Ms. or Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Shankland, who so objected to being seen as what she
calls ``part and parcel of my husband,'' balks at the label. She
deliberately tried to make her ad playfully hyperbolic, she said,
``so that people wouldn't think I was one of those raving feminists
who doesn't agree with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in equality and all the rest of it, but the word's
just got such connotations,'' she said. ``It reminds people of
trade unions, of crew-cut hair and dungarees, and give the
impression that you sort of hate men.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shankland certainly doesn't hate her husband, a
superintendent in the South Wales police force, who came in for a
bit of ribbing when her ad appeared, particularly because she had
not told him about it in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware that she was going to resolve the situation in
such a direct and public way,'' Superintendent Toms said. But he
proclaimed himself unfazed by the experience, even when he found
that the ad was playfully inserted into the agenda at his office's
meeting the day it appeared. ``I don't, as a man, need to put a tag
around a woman's neck to say that I'm married to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Has there been any fallout? ``Some people look at me like I'm
somebody with two heads, but a lot of people have rung me up and
said, `Good on you,''' Ms. Shankland said. One other thing: ``At
Gerry's office, they're calling him Superintendent Shankland.''

<P>
   From the Henry R. Luce Foundation to the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum: $750,000. The money is a two-year grant for the first
comprehensive survey of American art to be presented in China. The
exhibition, ``America 300,'' is tentatively scheduled to open in
Beijing next year and travel to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The show will consist of art from the Colonial period to the
present and cover all the major art movements, including the Hudson
River School, American Impressionism and Abstract Expressionism.
Among the 150 artists to be represented are Frederic Church, Albert
Bierstadt, Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Georgia O'Keeffe, Edward
Hopper, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, Carl
Andre and Andy Warhol. The grant will support the exhibition and
its catalog.

   Twice Told
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In time for Black History Month in February and
Women's History Month in March, an artistic double header built
around African objects spanning five centuries and photography
spanning 30 years and half the world begins Friday at the Museum
for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   One show, ``A Sense of Wonder: African Art from the Faletti
Family Collection,'' features 70 objects from western, central and
eastern Africa that date from the 16th to the 20th century. The
other, ``Landscapes of the Soul: Women of the African Diaspora,''
presents some 70 portraits of African and African-American women
made by Chester Higgins Jr., a photographer for The New York Times,
in his travels in the United States, the Caribbean, Europe and
Africa. The shows continue through March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hughes, the British poet, has become the first writer to win
the Whitbread Book of the Year award twice and the first to win it
posthumously. In London, his best-selling collection of poems,
``Birthday Letters,'' which bared his previously unrevealed
feelings on the suicide 35 years earlier of his first wife, the
poet Sylvia Plath, won this year's $34,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes died in October. His daughter from his marriage to Plath,
Frieda, collected the prize in her father's behalf. Hughes also won
in 1998 for his translation of ``Tales of Ovid.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtain Call
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ceremonies at the Gershwin on Monday, the Theater
Hall of Fame will induct its class of 1999. The honorees are the
producer Alexander Cohen, the actors Charles Durning and Richard
Kiley, the composer-lyricists Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt, the set
designer Robin Wagner and, posthumously, the producer, director and
actor Ellis Rabb.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders Award for outstanding contribution to the American
Theater will go to Edward Colton, the theater lawyer. In a new
category, regional theater, Zelda Fichandler, co-founder and
producer of the Arena Stage in Washington, will be honored.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ &UR;  &LR; As a choreographer, Boris Eifman continues to
surprise. There was a very different side to the Eifman Ballet of
St. Petersburg in the two U.S. premieres that this company from
Russia presented on Tuesday night here.
</P>
<P>
   Emotion is always synonymous with Eifman's work. But there are
many ways to express it, as he shows here with ferocious conviction
in ``Requiem'' and ``My Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   These are startling works, unnerving in their naked sincerity
and unabashed spiritual visions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiem,'' filled with dazzling ensemble patterns and superbly
at one with its recording of Mozart's ``Requiem,'' is a meditation
on the three ages of man.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Jerusalem'' is more problematic. It offers an image of
three great religions reconciled through the metaphor of a youth
culture moving to a rock beat.
</P>
<P>
   The passion and energy that Eifman demands of his amazing
dancers was again on display at City Center here, where this new
double bill is to have its final performance Thursday night. The
two works are at a deliberate remove from the bold, theatrical
spectacles that New York audiences, until now, have found so
different from American ballet.
</P>
<P>
   As does ``Red Giselle,'' which is to be given over the weekend,
the earlier ballets draw upon biographical and literary sources.
For all of Eifman's eclectic vocabulary, they are rooted in the
ballet idiom.
</P>
<P>
   The newest pieces are virtually plotless. Eifman is visibly
seeking a nonclassical idiom, and there are moments when the
choreography will strike Americans as a naive attempt to reinvent
the wheel of modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   If so, this is a special wheel, and familiar devices and
concepts are used here with a freshness that creates new meaning.
``Requiem,'' for instance, introduces figures in white sacks that
recall Martha Graham in ``Lamentation'' and Alwin Nikolais' dancers
in their stretch-jersey shapes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Requiem,'' the image is specifically dramatic: the sack
figures represent tilted tombstones in a cemetery; they preface the
beautiful image through which Vera Arbuzova, the serene mother
figure of ``Requiem,'' dies and then reappears in an illuminated
doorway, beckoning her son into a consoling afterworld.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to say that modern dance already has shown us
clusters of raised arms and folk patterns. But if Eifman, who
apparently has seen few American modern dance companies, wanted to
be an imitator, he would not be doing what he is doing. It is
easier to copy than to hammer out your own language.
</P>
<P>
   For all its focus on soloists, ``Requiem'' is a vast communal
round. Eifman abstracts folk patterns with dazzling skill, and the
dissolving chains, circles and lines have the emotional effect of a
universe reconciled unto itself. Here is choreography designed on
the highest formal level.
 &UR;  &LR;  Eifman nonetheless has a story to tell, and he does so in a sober
stage vision of dark and light, enhanced by Simon Pastukh's
backdrop of cutout forms that change into symbolic doorways,
crosses and disks.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious figures dragging bundles across the stage in primeval
darkness introduce Ms. Arbuzova, eventually lifted by a group to
give birth to Igor Markov. He is the child, succeeded by Albert
Galichanin, the mature man who finds love with Yelena Kuzmina, and
finally Andrei Gordeyev, representing old age.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Eifman said that after his mother died when he
was 26, he thought he could be reunited with her in a spiritual
sphere. If this personalized vision rules his ballet, it is highly
emotional in a generalized manner.
</P>
<P>
   Markov is careful to define his innocence, expressed throughout
the entire body rather than in gesture, and he stands out against
the aggressive ensemble. Galichanin, with a clinging Ms. Kuzmina,
has a power that is amplified through the other couples. Gordeyev
dances with dignity, railing against death until Ms. Arbuzova
gathers all her ``sons'' before the luminous close.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Jerusalem'' is less nuanced and certainly clear in its
vision of reconciling three great religions. Eifman saw an ideal
unity when he viewed houses of worship side by side in Jerusalem.
Three abstract solos symbolizing Islam, Christianity and Judaism
have a persuasive character, as danced by Yuri Ananyan, Ms. Kuzmina
and Markov. The strife of a hippy tribe moving to the electronic
beat of techno rock is, by contrast, painted in overly broad
strokes. The final spectacular image is nonetheless not to be
missed. Reconciled, the tribe sails away on Vyacheslav Okunev's
rocking crescent, a space age Noah's ark.

 &HT;    ``Heat brings'' steamy nights to PBS
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes you just have to wonder who really needs the big
broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``ER'' is good. ABC's ``The Practice'' is involving. And,
certainly, Fox's ``The X-Files'' is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   But, frankly, HBO's new mafioso manifesto ``The Sopranos'' is
easily TV's best drama. And this season, PBS' ``Mystery!'' has been
running at nearly a full clip.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, ``Mystery,'' which earlier this TV season aired the
remarkable ``Touch of Evil,'' starts another often riveting new
five-part British series called ``Heat of the Sun'' (9 p.m. on WGTV
and 10:30 p.m. Friday on WPBA).
</P>
<P>
   With Kenya as its setting (the miniseries was actually shot in
Zimbabwe), ``Heat'' mixes drugs, arson, blackmail, racism and
murder in its two-hour opener into a compelling 1930s whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Eve (``The Politician's Wife'') stars as Albert Tyburn,
Scotland Yard's own Dirty Harry who's banished to Africa after
tracking down and executing a prominent Londoner _ and child
molester _ in a dark alley.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, our headstrong hero immediately investigates the death
of a well-to-do British woman. It looks like a case-closed mauling
by lions, but Tyburn smells murder and the scent leads to the dead
woman's bush pilot sister Emma (Susannah Harker, ``Pride and
Prejudice''), a rash of fires and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of ``Heat's'' wallop is its unflinching depiction of
Britain's ugly colonialism. Tyburn frequently locks horns with his
new police commissioner over unequal treatment of Africans. And the
ever-bored, always partying high-brow Brits? The men come off
offensively proper while their drunken wives stagger about with
such unsure footing they sometimes plop into the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   It's a highly watchable show, one in which you won't so easily
finger the culprit in the early frames. Following tonight's first
two-hour story are a pair of two-part tales, each involving fresh
murders, in hour installments airing on Thursdays on WGTV and
Fridays on WPBA through Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   It takes extra bucks to wire HBO into your home. But PBS' ``Heat
of the Sun'' on ``Mystery!'' is available with a simple flip of the
remote.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Voodoo pitched for TV show
</P>
<P>
   Ready to watch ``Voodoo Divorce Court''?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a show yet, just a concept. But it's one of the pitches
at this week's annual National Association for Television Program
Executives meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Among other shows vying for the TV execs' attention: ``Bikini
Babe Bowlarama,'' a cooking show called ``The Cheese Guys,'' an
educational show called ``I Ain't Drunk, I'm Just Drinkin''' and TV
movies like ``I Hate Children'' and ``I Posed For Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawking his new book ``Voodoo Divorce: Put a Hex on Your Ex
Through Preparation and Knowledge'' (Forbes; $23.95) at NATPE, New
Orleans attorney Stephen Rue says several producers have expressed
interest in a show based on his advice.
</P>
<P>
   But why is Rue peddling reading material at a TV conference?
``I'm a divorce lawyer,'' Rue says. ``I want to be on various talk
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The book waxes on ways to exact revenge on a spouse for filing
for divorce. Here's one spell. Dip a purple candle in white
vinegar, light it, and place seven shiny pennies around it. Put
some ingredients like Irish Moss, Lucky Hand Root and Alfalfa in a
``gris-gris'' bag, and pin a one-dollar bill to a voodoo doll. Then
go to your lawyer's office with your joint credit card _ billed to
your spouse _ and say three magic words: ``Please charge it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only limited by your own morals, the abilities of your
lawyer, and the laws of your state,'' says Rue, who has handled
more than 1,000 divorces but has never been married himself.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a voodoo doll for hexing or protection, Rue's office
can help you get one through a local artist for about $100. He
brought a few protective dolls to NATPE, including ones for Howard
Stern, Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford and Rosie O'Donnell.

ENDGAME-ANALYSIS (Washington) - Republicans may have won
Wednesday's vote on dismissing the impeachment case, but they got
no closer to achieving a timely, dignified conclusion to the trial
that meets their goal of holding President Clinton accountable for
his actions. In fact, by mustering 44 votes against impeachment,
Democrats now have hardened proof for their claim that further
trial proceedings are frivolous because the GOP lacks the
two-thirds majority needed to oust Clinton. By JEFF BARKER. Story

Choosing a spa, deciding on specific treatments and maximizing your

MURDER TRIAL SET FOR COUNTRY SINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The murder trial of country singer Johnny
Rodriguez and Carlos Tovar, his lifelong friend, is scheduled to
begin in a Texas court on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 46, is charged with murder in connection with the
Aug. 29 shooting death of Israel Borrego.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Tovar, who lives next to the country singer's home
in the South Texas town of Sabinal, were named in the same murder
indictment returned Jan. 7 by a Uvalde County grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Tovar had not been identified as a possible suspect in the case
until he was named in the murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have posted a $50,000 bond set by District Judge Mickey
Pennington, who also set the trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Borrego, also an acquaintance of the country singer, died from a
single gunshot wound to his abdomen. He was shot at the home of the
singer's mother in Sabinal.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has said he was investigating what he thought was an
intruder in his mother's home and fired one shot in self-defense
when he confronted a man in the dark house.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's songs include ``Funny Things Happen to Fun Lovin'
People Like Me'' and ``Down in the Boondocks.''

EX-AGITATOR TURNED MINISTER LOOKS TO REMAKE GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Funny place, Germany. An environmentalist is
about to direct the country's foreign policy from a Nazi-era Berlin
building where Hitler stored gold stolen from Jews and the East
German Communist leader Erich Honecker later held court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a puzzling prospect,'' said Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, a Green Party leader who will soon move from Bonn to a
refurbished ministry in Hitler's former Reichsbank. ``For me the
most astonishing thing is that I will actually sit in the office of
Mr. Honecker. But we will deal with our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Fischer has dealt with his own. A revolutionary
agitator in the 1960s long known for a disheveled look featuring
sneakers, he is now something of a dapper squire with a penchant
for three-piece suits and somber ties. Every inch the minister, he
sports black shoes that actually gleam.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do his eyes. During an interview, Fischer exuded
passion, describing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as a
``murderous'' politician who would have fit perfectly in the Europe
of the 1930s; arguing that European political union was inevitable;
calling the Chinese leadership ``Wall Street Communists'';
insisting that all would be well with Germany because there was
``no negative genius lurking'' in the new capital, Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Vertigo is not an unusual sensation in the Germany of Social
Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, as taboos tumble, barriers
crumble and coyness recedes. Having done the proper thing for
decades to prove its post-Holocaust credentials, the country now
seems ready to speak its mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody more so than Fischer, who has already cast aside the
conventional wisdom of a trade-driven world to lambaste China for
its treatment of dissidents; ruffled American feathers by calling
on NATO to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons, and trashed
long-held assumptions that Germany will bankroll the European Union
because the country still has a moral debt to pay.
</P>
<P>
   So is he a loose cannon, this 50-year-old former member of the
Revolutionary Struggle movement? It seems not. For all his evident
convictions, Fischer appears to have found in the passage from
protest to responsibility a school of pragmatism and balance.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kosovo. Like most members of the Greens, a party with
origins in the peace movement, Fischer has little taste for
military force. Above all, he believes, a political strategy is
needed to stop the fighting in the southern Serbian province. ``We
must bring the two sides to the table,'' he said. ``We must start a
political process. Air power is worth nothing if there is no
political strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked if he therefore opposed NATO air strikes, Fischer
said: ``I am not a friend of using force, but sometimes it is a
necessary means of last resort. So I am ready to use it if there is
no other way. If people are being massacred, you cannot mutter
about having no mandate. You must act.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the foreign minister argued that the ``activation
order'' approved by NATO last October was still a valid basis for
air strikes, although it would be preferable to obtain an explicit
mandate from a United Nations Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a globalized world,'' he said, ``the best basis for action
must be the United Nations. Unilateral actions are generally not in
the interest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Wry, provocative Fischer has evidently given considerable
thought to the job he took over three months ago, seeking a balance
between a firm commitment to the Western alliance and a
determination to put forward some new ideas. Self-taught _ he left
school at 16 _ he evidently relishes debate.
</P>
<P>
   As the North Atlantic Treaty Organization seeks to redefine
itself, preparing a new post-Cold War doctrine to be unveiled at a
50th anniversary summit meeting in Washington in April, it is
inevitable that ``the global American superpower'' and ``more
cautious'' Europeans will have some differences, Fischer suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has always had a regional structure,'' he said, ``and I
think it is not without risk to open that structure and propel the
organization toward broader purposes and a broader area.''
</P>
<P>
   This warning was evidently meant to counter American proposals
that NATO see itself now as an ``alliance of interests'' in some
instances taking on far-flung missions against chemical and
biological weapons, nuclear proliferation or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that rather than being ``reactive,'' NATO should
energetically seek means to prevent the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction. His proposal that the alliance renounce the first
use of nuclear weapons remains on the table, he added, but will not
be discussed before the Washington summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have not been amused by Fischer's suggestion
that first use be renounced, and one said, on the condition of
anonymity, that the foreign minister had failed to build trust.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the sparring, it appears clear that a new German-American
relationship is in the making, in which the country that the United
States helped rebuild from postwar ruin will no longer
automatically bow in grateful acquiescence. Fischer is tentatively
due in Washington and Canada about the first of March.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Europe, Fischer said the European nation-state was
now shaped by forces beyond its control. With the introduction of a
single currency, the euro, he added, an important part of
sovereignty has been abandoned and it is inevitable that steps
toward greater political integration will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the enormous pressure of the euro, which would otherwise
be at risk,'' he said, ``we will at the end arrive at a political
subject called the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer did not make clear what exactly that ``subject'' would
be. But he said the issue was ``Europe's common future in a
globalized world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The European nation-state is simply not the right size,'' he
added. ``We are too small. We need a Europewide size.''
</P>
<P>
   Major obstacles confront this vision, and Fischer made clear
that Germany, which currently holds the presidency of the European
Union, was determined to reform the European budget and
decision-making process as the condition for an expansion of the
European Union to countries like Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Budget reform _ essentially changing European agricultural
policy _ is favored by Germany as a way to cut its contribution to
the European Union, now by far the highest. Mediterranean countries
like Spain, which benefit from farm subsidies, are fiercely opposed
to the reform.
</P>
<P>
   The new decision-making methods proposed by Germany would allow
majority voting on European issues _ a further surrender of
national sovereignty that is also controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not reform the European budget, and we let in
countries like Poland with large agricultural sectors, the system
will explode,'' Fischer said. ``Without reform, anti-European
sentiment could grow in Germany, and we know there will be a fierce
reaction from our allies if we ever fall back on national
positions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And will Berlin _ with its granite Nazi buildings, its size, its
gargantuan new construction projects and its memories _ stir the
nationalist in the German soul?
</P>
<P>
   The debate on this question is active, and the decision to put
ministries in old Nazi buildings _ including the Reichsbank, where
Hitler's bust once stood in the lobby _ is still contested by some.
But the alternative of entirely new construction would have been
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fears about Berlin will remain only that _ fears,'' said
Fischer, who appears to relish the quirks of history that soon will
place him in a building completed in 1940. ``We are passionate
federalists in Germany, and the move will not change that. France
can try to reform itself but will always be a centrified country
focused on Paris. Hamburg or Munich could never accept the status
of a Bordeaux or a Lille.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister smiled one of his quizzical smiles. ``In any
case,'' he said, ``the nation-state in Europe is now a thing of the
past, no more than a virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   With time, he added, perhaps even politicians in the Balkans
could be led to accept this view.

 &HT;    GM exec makes headway, but faces more challenges
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something is working right at General Motors. On
Wednesday, the stock hit a 52-week high of $92.81 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit is going to G. Richard Wagoner Jr., now
president _ and previously chief financial officer _ of the
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   He has restored profitability in domestic operations, trimmed
the product line, and improved the efficiency of product
development and manufacturing, Business Week (Feb. 1) notes in its
cover story.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still big problems at General Motors that the
45-year-old Wagoner must deal with, the magazine says. Among them:
making labor peace, producing cars that appeal to younger consumers
and increasing profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Business Week: Special reports offering advice for small
businesses, and for mutual fund investors.
</P>
<P>
   Doubting Thomases
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Feb. 8) questions the wisdom of the bidding war for
AirTouch Communications. Vodafone won, by agreeing to pay $4,300
per customer. But unless wireless carriers can attract a wider
audience _ say through more price cuts _ all they are likely to do
is keep trading the same customers back and forth, Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, the magazine suggests, the deal is not worth
$4,300 per customer.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of Fortune that looks at technology trends offers
some cautionary words on the Vodafone-AirTouch Communications deal,
too, but reserves its toughest words for the subject of automotive
mergers. Fortune's view: ``Dumb idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler has infected the
industry ``with a virulent case of merger madness,'' the magazine
notes. Looking back at earlier combinations, Fortune offers that
the increased interest in mergers now is ``more hysterical than
rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Betting on technology
</P>
<P>
   Investing in red-hot Internet stocks may have seemed easy
earlier in January when everything seemed to be moving up _ by
leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
   But from now on, buying the right technology stocks is going to
be more complicated, Fortune (Feb. 15) suggests. The magazine says
investors will have to think more like venture capitalists, which
means being pickier about stocks, better at balancing portfolio
risk and more attuned to broad industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, Fortune offers what it thinks are 10 trends in
technology ``you can bet on.

 &HT;    100 Black Men to use $35 million to perform `Miracles of
Mentoring'
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 100 Black Men of America Inc. has launched a $35
million ``Miracles of Mentoring'' campaign with a goal of building
a national youth leadership institute in Coweta County.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Dortch, president of the organization, said the institute
will be built on 500 acres that have been donated by Browning
Ferris Industries. Black youngsters will be exposed to successful
black leaders and decision-makers through mentoring programs run by
the institute, Dortch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't deprive our young people of dreaming dreams, and we
can't blame anyone else, if we don't make sure our kids get to the
talented 10th,'' said Dortch.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the organization has raised about $11 million toward its
``Miracles of Mentoring'' campaign. Members have donated $5 million
of that amount, said Dortch.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the campaign will be used to provide $21 million
in grants for mentoring programs in the 81 chapters of the 100
Black Men of America, including one each in Kingston, Jamaica;
Birmingham, England; Nassau, Bahamas; and Goree Island, Senegal,
said Dortch. The group's scholarship endowment fund will get $4
million and the remainder will be earmarked for programs and
facilities, including $5 million for the first phase of the youth
institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch said the 100 Black Men of America Inc. will partner with
the American Futures Institute, also based in Atlanta, and enlist
the services of its executive director Joshua Murphy, a clinical
psychologist. He said 33 organizations are involved right now in
the collaborative effort to groom new leaders and the goal is to
have the center ready and running by fall of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dortch and fellow Atlantan Jane Smith will be
presented the ``From Whence We Came'' awards for their
contributions in the black community. The awards gala, which will
be hosted by actor Blair Underwood and broadcast by WGN-TV in the
spring, will be held at Chicago's Navy Pier Grand Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch and Smith are among 12 honorees from around the nation
named by Allstate for the award. Other honorees include actresses
Ruby Dee and Sheryl Lee Ralph, actor Ossie Davis, radio personality
Tom Joyner, former Detroit Piston Dave Bing, author George Fraser,
former Congressman William H. Gray III, Johnson Publishing
President Linda Johnson Rice, Miami Congresswoman Carrie Meek, New
Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, and social activist Mother Mary Ann
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous honor,'' said Dortch, 48, who headsTWD
Inc., a consulting firm. For 16 years, Dortch was the state
director for U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, the first African-American to
serve in such a capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 51, took the helm last year as the chief executive
officer of the 4 million-member National Council of Negro Women
based in Washington, D.C. She is replacing Dorothy I. Height, who
held the post for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Smith gained national recognition for her work at
the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change and
as director of the anti-poverty program called The Atlanta Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what I am is based in Atlanta and I will accept the
award proudly for Atlanta and the District of Columbia,'' said
Smith.

SENATE VOTES TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND CALL WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND And JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, rebuffing a White House effort to end
the impeachment trial of President Clinton, voted Wednesday to
continue the proceedings and to take sworn testimony from three
presidential confidantes at the heart of the sex-and-cover-up
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly seized on the near-party line margin to
argue that there aren't enough votes to convict the president and,
therefore, the trial should end.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action represented a dramatic setback for the White
House effort to block the possibility that former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky would give nationally televised testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The only senator to break party lines was Sen. Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., who voted with the Republicans to block the dismissal of
the case and to summon witnesses. The move to dismiss was defeated
56-44, with all 55 Republicans opposed and all but one of the 45
Democrats voting for it. The vote breakdown on the witness issue
was the same.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, leader of the White House legal team fighting
Clinton's conviction and removal from office, said the Senate's
actions ``make clear that the votes are not there to convict and
remove the president from office.'' Conviction would require
two-thirds or 67 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Craig added: ``Any proceedings from this day forward only serve
to delay the final resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a newly elected member of the
Senate who served on the Republican-controlled House Judiciary
Committee that approved the impeachment charges in December, said
uncertainty lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predictions that this can end quickly are hopeful but not
necessarily valid,'' Schumer said. ``Anyone who makes predictions
about how this process will end does it at their peril because
every prediction has been wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., immediately began negotiating the
procedures that will govern the receipt of sworn testimony from
Lewinsky, Clinton confidante and Washington super-lawyer Vernon
Jordan and White House staffer Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said late Wednesday the depositions will be taken over the
weekend, with transcripts and possibly videotapes of the testimony
circulated to senators next Monday to enable the Senate to vote as
early as Tuesday on whether to admit witnesses to the floor of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he expected House prosecutors seeking Clinton's
ouster to try ``unfortunately to bring Monica Lewinsky to the floor
of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the proceedings could drag on beyond the Feb. 6 target
date originally envisioned in a bipartisan agreement struck on Jan.
8. Lott said he hoped to conclude the trial by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said Senate leaders were willing to
prolong the trial for a few days to make sure that witness
testimony was handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want this to be the O.J. trial where the judge let it
get out of control,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the party-line vote
to depose witnesses did not signal an end to efforts to find a
bipartisan exit from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degree of genuine concern for keeping us together has been
very apparent,'' Moynihan said. ``We're looking for one and that's
very real and we have not in any sense given up on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's legal team and his Senate Democratic allies
spied victory in defeat Wednesday, contending that 44 Democratic
senators' support for dismissal guarantees that Clinton will not be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the vote of 44 Democrats shows that more than
one-third of the Senate supports Clinton _ enough votes to block
his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democratic unity means ``the president will not be
removed from office,'' adding: ``It is now time to end this
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who has served since 1962,
declared emphatically: ``Essentially this trial for impeachment
(removal) has ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the Senate votes mean that the
``this impeachment trial is a cadaver,'' adding: ``They'll drive it
around and exhibit it for a while.''

<P>
   White House aides said Clinton did not watch broadcast coverage
of the Senate votes because he was working on a $100 million salmon
recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said House prosecutors and White House lawyers will
interview each witnesses in private as part of a traditional
fact-finding effort.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., a former federal
prosecutor, will question Lewinsky; Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
will question Jordan; and Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., will question
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors hope to show that Clinton tried to use
Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal in his effort to obstruct justice
by hiding his relationship with Lewinsky from special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr and lawyers for Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state
employee suing Clinton in a civil suit for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., part of the 13-member House
prosecution team, said House prosecutors would work within whatever
guidelines the Senate establishes for the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what we're told,'' Graham said. ``We're sort of the
blue collar workers over here in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attorney David Kendall threatened a broad quest for
information during his presentation to the Senate on Tuesday. But
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, underscored that the Senate _ not the
White House _ will set the ground rules for Kendall's fact finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run the show; we run the impeachment, not the White
House,'' Harkin said.

   Senate Democrats cloaked their support for dismissal of the case
with fresh denunciations of Clinton's personal behavior to
underscore their insistence that their vote to dismiss the case
does not mean they condone Clinton's extramarital dalliance with
Lewinsky.

   ``The president's behavior was indefensible, not impeachable,''
Daschle said. ``He should and will receive sanction and rebuke.''
</P>

   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said senators continue to talk
across party lines about a motion of censure. The former
Connecticut state attorney general said the censure effort awaits
the outcome of the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats support for dismissal of the charges ``should
not be read as a vindication of the president's behavior,''
Lieberman said. ``Honestly, if, as appears inevitable now, the
articles of impeachment are not adopted, it should not be read as
an acquittal. In my opinion, it's the equivalent of a hung jury.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For weeks, the feverish guessing game had focused
on whether a swing group of as many as a half dozen Republican
senators might buck their colleagues and side with Democrats in
trying to end or truncate the impeachment trial against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time for those pivotal votes Wednesday, only
one politician broke party ranks, and that maverick turned out to
be a Democrat, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of his Republican colleagues but none of his fellow
Democrats, Feingold, one of the Senate's most earnest and
independent thinkers, opposed a motion to dismiss the charges
against Clinton and supported a motion to take depositions from
three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He said that votes to the contrary would have been an assertion
that there was no possible way for the House trial managers to
persuade him and other senators that Clinton should be removed from
office, and he had not reached that point of certainty yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply cannot say that the House managers cannot prevail,''
Feingold said in a painstakingly worded, three-page written
statement released by his staff just moments after he had cast his
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Feingold was careful to add that his votes should not be
interpreted as signals that he was in favor of convicting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not reached a decision on that question,'' he said.
``It is my inclination, however, to demand a very high standard of
proof on this question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view at this point,'' he continued, ``that the House
managers' case has some serious problems, and I am not certain it
can be helped by further testimony from witnesses, although I
believe it is possible that it can.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Feingold's dissent from other members of his
party was largely predictable, because Feingold had articulated a
stern disapproval of Clinton's actions and hinted at a belief that
the second article of impeachment, which charges the president with
obstruction of justice, deserved careful consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Feingold's political career has been marked by
principled stands that flouted conventional wisdom or party unity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during his campaign for re-election to a second
term in the Senate last year, Feingold, a fierce advocate for
campaign finance reform, refused to use any ``soft money''
donations even as his Republican opponent outspent him and drew
ever closer in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues said they respected his independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russ is an original thinker who really grapples with the
issues,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., ``and I know he was
grappling with this one right up until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., left the Capitol after the vote,
he was overheard telling a companion, ``You've got to give Russ
Feingold credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, 45, has often chosen what he clearly considered the
intellectual high ground over the pragmatic path of least
resistance. A former Rhodes scholar and Harvard-educated lawyer, he
was one of a handful of senators in 1996 who voted against a
popular anti-terrorism bill; he cited its inclusion of the death
penalty, which he strongly opposes, as his reason.
</P>
<P>
   But he is perhaps best known as the co-sponsor, with Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., of campaign-finance reform legislation that would,
in part, eliminate the soft money spent by local and national
organizations on behalf of candidates. That legislation failed to
pass the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold was one of the first and only Democrats to call for an
independent counsel to investigate Clinton's fund-raising
activities; he has been equally critical of the president's
behavior in relation to the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any proof that he lied under oath,'' Feingold said
a year ago, ``I will have no trouble voting on his impeachment.''

CURRENCY DEVALUATION NOT ON THE HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ With world markets once again jittery about a
possible devaluation of China's currency, the yuan, the governor of
the Chinese central bank said Wednesday that there were no plans to
do so, pointing out that there is even less pressure on the
currency, also known as the renminbi, than there was last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the person in charge, I can say the renminbi will not be
devalued,'' the bank chief, Dai Xianglong, said at a news
conference in Beijing. ``During the Asian crisis, the renminbi was
not devalued and at the moment it is not necessary for the renminbi
to be devalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Dai's comments touched off a strong rally in China-related
stocks in Hong Kong, where there is deep concern that a possible
devaluation would force Hong Kong to shift its currency's link to
the U.S. dollar. Hong Kong's index of H-shares, or China-based
companies, surged more than 7 percent, while the broader Hang Seng
index rose 209.83 points, or 2.21 percent, to 9,719.66.
</P>
<P>
   Dai also said China would move ahead with plans to tighten
regulation while gradually liberalizing its financial industry
practices. All large cities will be opened to foreign banks, which
were previously limited to Shanghai and Shenzhen, the city in
southern Guangdong province that borders Hong Kong. The central
bank will also relax control over the interest rate allowed on
foreign loans, Dai said, giving commercial banks more freedom to
attract borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beijing plans to continue attacking
irregularities at banks and other financial institutions, cracking
down on improper foreign-currency dealings to protect
foreign-exchange reserves and to deter the smuggling of goods into
the country. Last year, Dai said, the central bank discovered $6.42
billion in fraudulent purchases, and added, ``A number of
underground markets and illegal money exchanges have been
eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said as well that many of China's trust and investment
companies would be reorganized. These financial institutions have
been blamed for fueling wild speculation in stock and property
markets, often creating liabilities that far outweigh assets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dai was vague about plans, described by other bankers in
recent weeks, to reduce the number of trust and investment
companies to about 40 from 240.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will be preserved; some will be merged,'' he said. ``The
restructuring will be based on commercial principles.''
</P>
<P>
   International bankers were recently surprised by bankruptcy
proceedings against the Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Corp., or Gitic, where local officials said loans might
not be repaid at all. Gitic was shut down in October with $4.3
billion in debts and assets of $2.6 billion, and the government
placed the company in bankruptcy earlier this month. The move put
foreign banks at the end of a long line of creditors seeking
repayment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dai said Beijing would like to see Gitic reorganize its
debts rather than face its creditors in court. ``If they can,
through negotiation, agree on a restructuring scheme, the central
bank would be very glad to see that,'' he said. He added that
creditor claims would be decided by the Guangdong Supreme Court,
though in China most courts take advice from Beijing on important
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Dai's comments about China's currency that drew the
most attention from traders and analysts in markets around the
world. Only when China faces a large international payments
deficit, Dai said, would the authorities be forced to consider a
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China currently runs a healthy balance of payments, even though
exports are faltering and foreign investment is slowing. The trade
surplus last year reached a record $43.6 billion, while
foreign-exchange reserves are still at a robust $145 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dai said a devaluation would hurt foreign investment, increase
the country's foreign debt burden and cause instability in other
Asian financial markets. He also reaffirmed Beijing's support for
the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying China's larger economic situation, Dai said that the
economy was likely to grow around 7 percent this year. In 1998, the
economy grew by 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   China's consumer price index, he predicted, would increase by 4
percent to 5 percent this year. The index fell eight-tenths of a
percent last year.

IN THE DEEP MIDWINTER, PLANS FOR SPRING TAKE ROOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spring fever can begin in strange ways. It hit me
hard last week, when a friend brought over a bunch of Swiss chard
purchased at an expensive natural-foods store on Second Avenue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The leaves were a deep plush green, with vermilion veins
coursing through them like rivers bursting with life. And in my
memory at least (alas, we ate the evidence), they were not crinkled
and glossy like most Swiss chard, but smooth, almost as if crossed
with a collard green. As we chopped the leaves and sauteed them
with garlic, the sensual pleasures of spring on the farm rushed
into my kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my pot of columnar basil _ a lone survivor of last
fall's cuttings taken from an oddball variety that grows like a
hedge. ``You'll be in that ol' Maryland clay before you know it,''
I said to the scraggly plant straining to catch the winter light
through the south window. I didn't say four months: it might
succumb to whitefly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I told myself it wouldn't be long before I was picking dandelion
greens on the hill by the barn and pulling wild garlic down by the
stream to saute in good olive oil (or to fry up with bacon fat,
Southern-style). I thought of my father leading us through the
marshy wood that's now a golf course, and of following our noses to
the pungent colony of skunk cabbages that lure flies seeking false
promises in the smelly striated leaves. Skunky, yes _ but a sure
sign of spring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we feasted on the chard, its bitterness like a tonic, I
longed to be putting peas in the cool, sweet soil _ and for those
days when a wool cap feels good and the knees of my pants get wet
as I set the wrinkled seeds in the trench. Forgotten are the
rabbits that ate last year's seedlings, the flea beetles that
ravaged the spinach, the groundhog that mowed down the broccoli.
This spring's crops will be as plump and perfect as the pinup
beauties in the catalogs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've spent days now pawing through those catalogs, searching for
that red-and-green chard, which eludes me like some Diana of the
vegetable world. I wonder if production is slowing in the work
force as millions of gardeners sneak phone and Internet orders at
their desks. They may be staring at their computer screens, but
they're seeing that garden in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   The farm in Maryland spreads out before me like some Italian
villa: the orchard I want to start on the hill south of the barn,
the field of basil to the east (my first market crop), the hundreds
of sunflowers I grow each year to hail visitors as they turn in the
drive, the ginseng seed I will scatter in the woods. I want more
old roses, more viburnums, and I must have a peegee hydrangea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And trees,'' Mom says, calling with a weather report (foggy,
wet, with a blue jay hogging the bird feeder). ``What about some
sycamores?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And ginkgos,'' I say. ``We need to collect whatever it is that
can save my memory.'' But first things first. ``A new asparagus
patch,'' I decide.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' she says. ``We got only a few spears from the old one
last year. We must have planted that 40 years ago.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My sister, Martha, weighs in from New Hampshire. ``But I put all
that manure and compost on it last fall,'' she says. ``People up
here keep them going for generations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll perform a scientific experiment,'' I say as I hang up
and get ordering.

TEXAS INMATES HELPLESS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ABUSIVE GUARDS, EXPERT
TESTIFIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A nationally recognized expert on penitentiaries
told Senior U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice on Wednesday
that Texas prisons are plagued with excessive use of force by
guards and that inmates are largely helpless to complain about it.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Breed, a former director of the National Institute of
Corrections who has been called as an expert in 15 states'
litigation over prison conditions, told the judge that Texas has a
``greater degree of excessive force than any other state I've
looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a systemwide problem, not an isolated problem that
occurred in only one facility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came in a hearing to determine whether Justice
should terminate his oversight of the 140,000-inmate Texas
Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the judge's rulings almost 20 years ago to end
unconstitutional conditions in Texas' then-overcrowded prisons,
Breed said the state has developed a ``very good'' set of written
policies and procedures for guards to follow when reckoning with
disruptive inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But Breed, who recently visited 18 prison units and culled
through 500 use-of-force incident reports, estimated that 70
percent of the cases involved ``excessive force,'' which he blamed
on a ``culture'' of violence among poorly trained guards.
</P>
<P>
   Breed was testifying on behalf of inmates who seek to prolong
Justice's prison oversight. The state, represented by Attorney
General John Cornyn and a battery of prison-system lawyers,
maintain that there are no longer any unconstitutional conditions
in the prison system, so Justice must terminate his role in the
class-action case filed in 1972 by inmate David Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Breed agreed there are ``many good people'' working in the
system, but he said ``there's a pattern throughout the entire
system, to deal with a problem by using force.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the situation to the ``building-tender'' system that
Justice eliminated in the early 1980s, in which inmates were
allowed to supervise _ and discipline _ other inmates. Nowadays,
said Breed, guards with ``limited training'' have been thrust into
the same role and often are unable to cope with the stress and
pressures created by the system's rapid population growth.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``in attempting to gain control, corrections
officers began to use the same techniques, the same approaches, as
the building tenders used to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Breed added that one of the biggest problems is a climate of
machismo, in which young male guards ``can't keep their hands off
prisoners,'' which violates the inmates' shaken sense of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out on the street, you don't touch somebody unless you want to
fight them,'' Breed explained, adding, ``the natural reaction is to
respond physically.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review of case files, Breed, a former supervisor of
California's juvenile offender system, estimated that 7 percent of
inmates' allegations of excessive use of force were verified by
prison officials _ a number he believes should be far greater.
</P>
<P>
   Breed said many of the applications of excessive force were
against restrained inmates who posed no danger. He cited the case
of one inmate who sustained a broken jaw while his hands were
handcuffed behind him and another male inmate _ fresh from chest
surgery _ who was slammed to the ground after asking for a bar of
soap.
</P>
<P>
   The expert also raised questions about the propriety of a female
inmate being forced to undergo cavity searches from an
``untrained'' guard.
</P>
<P>
   Breed's assessment followed an inmate's testimony that despite
having arthritis, he was forced to kneel before being served his
meals. The inmate said he refused, resulting in disciplinary action
that cost him various privileges.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, dozens of other inmates have recounted horror
stories of being raped, beaten and robbed by fellow inmates, and of
being harassed and beaten by guards _ all without consequence to
their attackers. Other experts testifying on the inmates' behalf
have raised questions about the quality of medical and psychiatric
care afforded to prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, prison lawyers have attempted to show in
cross-examination that the inmates have misrepresented their own
actions and downplayed their culpability when force was applied.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one inmate testified Wednesday that he had
mutilated himself or attempted suicide more than 20 times in order
to win transfers from a gang-plagued unit, where he claimed he had
been raped and beaten by inmates and harassed by guards. But state
lawyers brought out the fact that the inmate had a history of
psychiatric problems and of ``chunking'' guards _ pelting them with
his own urine and feces.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing before Justice, which began Jan. 21, is scheduled to
last about two more weeks. The state has yet to begin its defense
of prison conditions, and the inmates have used up only about half
their allotted time.
</P>

 NEW YORK: get ordering.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So here's my first round of cold crops from my favorite
catalogs, which are a source of not only unusual seeds but also
tips on cultivation, scraps of cultural history and updates from
the hotbed of plant politics. Many of the heirloom catalogs are
strongly opinionated on the possible dangers of genetic engineering
and on the pitfalls of F-1 hybrids, whose seeds don't ``come true''
(produce identical plants) if sown the following year. In an era
when farmers can be prosecuted for saving and replanting
``patented'' genetically engineered potatoes, I, for one, am all
the more interested in planting the old heirlooms and
open-pollinated varieties, which do come true and could be lost if
they disappear from the gene pool. So keep on passing those seeds
over the fence and sending cuttings through the mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've ordered a new variety of ASPARAGUS , called Jersey Knight.
Developed by Rutgers University, it has all-male crowns, which
don't spend any energy producing berries and seeds, so they produce
twice the numbers of spears as the old Mary and Martha Washington,
which mix the females with the males (is this gender-stereotyping
or what?). Jersey Knight is easily available, but I ordered mine
from the Cook's Garden (800-457-9703), the family-owned company in
Burlington, Vt., that's increasingly famed for its tomato-tasting
festival in the fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've also ordered my LEEKS from Cook's: Blue Solaise, a large
variety, which should be started 12(!) weeks before the last frost,
which in my neck of the woods is mid-April (so I'm already late).
When they're the size of knitting needles (a Cook's analogy, which
shows what dirt gardeners they are), you put them in trenches and
cover them with boards and so on. Barring biblical disasters, you
can still be harvesting them in winter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm starting a new RHUBARB patch, because the old one gets too
much shade to produce enough for pies. So I've called in my order
for Cherry Red from Park Seed (800-845-3369), a 131-year-old
family-run company in Greenwood, S.C. (800-845-3369).
</P>
<P>
   My ONIONS AND SHALLOTS are coming from the Southern Exposure
Seed Exchange in Earlysville, Va. (804-973-4703), which offers
potato onions, a perennial that reproduces year after year. Also
FAVA BEANS , to plant as soon as the ground can be worked. And
beets _ scarlet heirloom Chioggia beets with pink and white rings
inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My Lincoln shelling PEAS come from the Seed Savers Exchange in
Decorah, Iowa (319-382-5990), where Kent and Diane Whealy grow more
than 18,000 rare vegetable varieties. I've also ordered their CHARD
_ Ruby chard, though its leaves are crumpled, not smooth (maybe
this remembered chard exists only in my mind).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My POTATOES hail from Ronniger's Seed Potatoes, in Idaho,
because they started selling Yukon Gold and other heirloom potatoes
long before everyone else, and their homely, black-and-white
catalog is a cram course in root crops (including garlic of all
kinds). They don't take orders on the phone, so here's the address:
Star Route, Road 73, Moyie Springs, Idaho 83845. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My WATERCRESS _ I'm going to try some down by the stream _ comes
from J.L. Hudson, Seedsman, who doesn't have a phone (at least he
doesn't admit to one), so you must write: Star Route 2, Box 337, La
Honda, Calif. 94020. His catalog is full of unusual species and
varieties, as well as their stories, like the one that European
witches believed about Allium moly, the lily leek: Hermes gave it
to Odysseus to protect him against the spells of Circe and other
evils (hence the expression holy moly). Hudson also offers JICAMA
seeds, which produce a creeping vine full of crunchy, sweet,
turnip-like roots, and PURSLANE, that weed that grows so well in my
garden. It's hot right now because some scientist found it full of
Omega-6 fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   But it can't hold a candle to wild dandelion greens cooked up
with hog fat. &QL;

   Six months ago, Marina Azimova, a 36-year-old single mother,
wanted to pray for her autistic son, Joey. And she really wanted
God to hear. A Russian Jewish immigrant who lives in Wilkes Barre,
Pa., she knew that with only a part-time job, she could not afford
a trip to Jerusalem to visit the Western Wall, where Jews for
centuries have stuffed handwritten notes in the crevices of what
many believe to be Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Azimova sent her prayer through e-mail instead.

   The ``Send a Prayer'' service she used is part of Virtual
Jerusalem, an expansive site presenting Jewish news and culture
(www.virtualjerusalem.com). Each day, an employee of the site
gathers up the 75 to 100 prayers e-mailed from around the globe and
carries them to the Western Wall, then places them inside. A live
camera trained on the wall and beamed through the site 24 hours a
day can even catch him in action.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Ms. Azimova placed an entry into the virtual
Jerusalem guest book asking visitors to pray with her for a miracle
for her son. Supportive e-mail messages poured in, and Ms. Azimova
swears that Joey, 5, has improved.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of all U.S. Jews have never visited Israel,
according to a 1997 survey by the Israeli Foreign Tourism Desk.
Virtual Jerusalem was designed with them and other English-speaking
Jews in mind, as a way to bring Israel and Jewish culture to Jewish
people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The site is the brainchild of Avi Moskowitz, a Brooklyn-born son
of an Auschwitz survivor and a Russian army cook who has worked
with computers for 17 years. The former editor of the Yeshiva
University newspaper, Moskowitz originally conceived of the site as
an online magazine, which he planned to begin when he moved to
Israel with his wife in 1994. He quickly modified his plan when he
saw a much broader niche to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than try to recreate what was offline, I wanted to be
the Jewish world online, mirroring the physical community or
improving on it,'' Moskowitz said. To achieve his goal, Moskowitz
persuaded major Israeli and Jewish news organizations to link their
content to his site. At the time, Moskowitz said, ``most didn't
even know what the Internet was.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he secured contracts with Arutz Sheva Israel National
Radio, an independent radio station; The Jewish Week, a newspaper,
and the Israel Wire news service, among others, to provide material
for the site and to share advertising revenue. The site is loaded
with advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail to God is just a tiny fraction of the four-year-old
site's slice of Israeli and Jewish life, albeit a popular one.
Today, Virtual Jerusalem has more than 200 content partners divided
into eight channels, much the way the Microsoft Network organizes
its site. For sites that have related content but do not make the
Virtual Jerusalem cut, there is Maven, the ``Jewish Yahoo,'' with
links to 6,000 other sites.
</P>
<P>
   On the VJ People channel, there is a weekly gossip column, Jews
in the News. An entertainment report highlights Hollywood with
features on Jewish celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   VJ Shopping offers links to sites like CyberSimcha, a company
that creates bar- and bat-mitzvah announcements via its Web site.
J-Mart is a site whose claim to fame is ``shlock rock'' _ parody
CDs with titles like ``Bring Back that Shabbos Feeling'' and
``Woodshlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Food is also a popular feature throughout Virtual Jerusalem,
with links to companies selling kosher candy, rugelach and
marinated artichokes. Kosher recipes are offered on the VJ Life
channel. At the Kosher Mall, visitors can ask the rabbi about
kosher laws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like the city it's named for, virtual Jerusalem's main
draw is its links to religion and to politics. Moskowitz says that
VJ News is the most popular stop on the site, which counts 4
million page views a month. At VJ News, visitors read headlines
about Israel or get an opposing perspective from the Arab press.
That channel also offers a section to indulge in slice-of-life
stories that might never make it into U.S. newspapers. One such
report said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had cut a
meeting short on the eve of the Wye Summit when his 4-year-old son
disappeared from nursery school. The news channel also has links to
Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   VJ News also keeps tabs on Israel's perception of the Iraqi
threat with the Saddam-o-Meter, a gauge that bobs from ``complete
calm'' to ``all out panic.'' International figures are also toted
up on the meter. President Clinton's attitude was deemed ``complete
calm'' after the recent bombings of Iraq. The attitudes of
international figures are gauged by Virtual Jerusalem's editors.
</P>
<P>
   Religion lives on VJ Torah. There are weekly Torah lectures
given by rabbis from Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and, as one
section calls itself, ``nonjudgmental'' sectors of Judaism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Radio Rabbi offers broadcasts of Torah lectures. A popular stop
on VJ Torah is Ask the Rabbi. Here, a panel of Orthodox rabbis from
Ohr Somayach, a rabbinical academic institution, answers Talmudic
questions online, no matter what the source. George Hellmuth, a
former Catholic who is now ``heavily involved'' in the Lutheran
Church and a Sunday school teacher in Springfield, Va., sought the
rabbi's counsel when Jewish friends insisted that there was no
afterlife in the Jewish religion, and Hellmuth did not believe
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to misrepresent myself and masquerade as being
Jewish,'' Hellmuth said. The rabbis responded right away. ``They
told me that Jews don't believe in heaven or hell but that there
certainly is an afterlife for Jews,'' said Hellmuth, who was much
comforted by the rabbi's answer and by how easily he got an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Weg, an Orthodox Jew from Cherry Hill, N.J., received a
cyberpat on the back from the rabbinical panel. Weg used Ask the
Rabbi to find out how to teach his four small children the proper
way to say God's name in prayer so that, according to Jewish law,
they did not take it vain.
</P>
<P>
   Within in a day, the rabbis sent an e-mail back and told Weg to
keep up the good work with the children by teaching them prayers,
but they reminded him to stress that God's name is holy. He does.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of visitors to virtual Jerusalem are not
Jewish, Moskowitz said. To accommodate them, the company just
started a site for Christians called Holy
Land &UR;  &LR; (www.virtualholyland.com). The site has seven channels
focusing on Christianity and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For William Hisle, what is important about virtual Jerusalem is
not so much its links to Judaism as its link, he feels, to God. A
funeral director in Louisville, Ky., Hisle was reared as a
Christian, though he has one Jewish grandparent. He got his
computer last month and has sent two prayers to the Western Wall
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky enough to find the site when I typed in `Wailing
Wall' on my computer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the prayers work.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ No, the address is not www.turnerbucks.com.
</P>
<P>
   But a new source of daily information about what's happening in
the world has been posted on the Internet by the U.N. Foundation,
the organization set up to administer Ted Turner's $1 billion,
10-year grant to United Nations-related causes.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation aims to build a public constituency for the U.N.
and encourage cooperation among different U.N. agencies. And the
new web site, with its daily dose of news of the world _ and news
of U.N. activities _ will serve those purposes well, said
foundation spokesman David Harwood.
</P>
<P>
   The site works in tandem with a daily e-mail notification system
that lists for subscribers the top world news stories of the day,
and provides the web address to click on to for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that this was an excellent undertaking,'' Harwood
said. ``In one week, we've gotten more than 1,500 subscribers, and
probably half of those are from the U.N. system.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the foundation's pro-U.N. bias, Harwood said the web
site will display critical news stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just summarizes what's in independent news publications,''
he said. ``We survey 1,500 publications from around the world _
print and broadcast. It's reflective of what reporters like you
write.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the site active takes a staff of six or seven people and
a $5,000,000 grant.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ritalin, Ritalin, seizure drugs, Ritalin. So goes the
rhythm of noontime for Mary Jane Kemper, nurse at the Donald McKay
School in East Boston, as she trots her tray of brown plastic vials
and paper water cups from class to class, dispensing pills into
outstretched young palms.
</P>
<P>
   In this ever-more pharmacologized society, hers is a more common
and demanding American school routine, as nurses, once known mainly
as providers of Band-Aids, cots and hearing tests, find themselves
increasingly in thrall to millions of midday doses, mainly for
attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lunchtime medication has become so extensive, and lines of
children outside nurses' offices so prevalent, that here in Boston,
public schools are now facing a ticklish question, one that experts
say has cropped up in school systems across the country in recent
years:
</P>
<P>
   With the number of children taking Ritalin estimated at well
over 3 million, more than double the 1990 figure, and other
school-day prescriptions for children on the rise, who should be
giving out the pills?
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, school officials have proposed that individual nurses
be given permission to delegate the distribution of their ``meds''
to handpicked, supervised staff members. The plan has prompted
protests from many nurses, who see the solution in hiring more
nurses, not reducing their roles, while school officials present it
as a sensible adjustment to the new psychotropic world.
</P>
<P>
   The debate under way here and nationally highlights the changing
world of school nurses. As they strive to juggle the traditional
triage of students who feel sick, they bear a growing load of other
duties: handling drugs and increasingly common asthma inhalers;
helping medically fragile students with catheters or tube feedings;
teaching children to wash their hands frequently; persuading
teen-agers to quit smoking and consider celibacy, and much, much
more.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here and aound the country, school nurses
uniformly said their jobs were changing because American life had
changed. They mentioned increased diagnoses of psychiatric illness
and learning disabilities, and more drugs to treat such disorders.
They pointed to policies of ``inclusion'' that have populated
public schools with scatterings of chronically ill children who
once would have gone to special institutions but now can be
medically managed in a more normal setting. They voiced the
impression that behavioral problems right up to classroom violence
had worsened, requiring more collaboration by nurses with school
teams that have tried to manage problem students. And they talked
about a growing public sense that a school is, in part, a health
care provider, leaned on heavily by working parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are coming to school with more health needs than they
used to,'' said Ann Lowry, a school nurse in Lenox, with 26 years
of experience. ``When I used to call a parent 25 years ago, there
was usually a big apology. `I'm sorry, I didn't know they were
sick, I'll come and get them.' You could feel that guilt coming
through. Whereas now, the pressures are otherwise: `Is this really
important? Do I have to leave work?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowry and other nurses, who also noted that parents seemed
more prone these days to err on the side of sending their children
to school and letting the nurse decide whether to send them back
home, emphasized that they were not blaming working mothers.
Rather, they were calling attention to the expanded school health
demands.
</P>
<P>
   School ``is definitely an extension of the home,'' said Ruby
Pangilinan, nurse at the Evelyn Thurman Gratts School in Los
Angeles. ``So our functions are definitely expanded. We're right in
the middle of everything. I even give out clothes. It's not just
the nurse sitting down here giving out Band-Aids.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ms. Pangilinan helped two students with catheters and
gave an anti-convulsion medication to another, among other things.
In Chicago, at Foster Park Elementary School, the nurse, Irene
Newton Ellens, helped an obese student get her daily exercise of
walking the length of the school three times, taught several health
education classes and counseled the grandparent of a student with a
severe ear infection, among other things. And in Houston, Marlise
Armstrong _ who was honored on Wednesday, which was National School
Nurse day, as the city's school nurse of the year _ commented that
she often found herself depended upon as a source of free medical
help and a conduit into the medical system, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, parents depend on your assessment because of a
lack of money and lack of places for them to go,'' Ms. Armstrong, a
school nurse for 41 years, said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston these days, all those competing pressures on school
nurses are galvanizing the debate over whether the nurse should be
able to hand off her medications to a designated assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is to try and free up nurses and use fully the
highly skilled training that only they have,'' said Thomas W.
Payzant, superintendent of Boston's public schools and a supporter
of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   For many Boston nurses, however, despite their harried days,
allowing someone else to distribute the medication, even though it
would be under their own training and oversight, is a frightening
thought. In general, said Marcia Buckminster, president of the
Massachusetts School Nurses Association, nurses here oppose the
idea, in part because it means giving up some control while
retaining liability.
</P>
<P>
   When a nurse has pill assistants, she said, ``and they give the
wrong dose, it's her license that's in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also question the wisdom of reducing school nurses' roles
rather than pushing to hire more nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be careful this isn't a step backwards,'' said
Dr. David Cimino, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
School Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still just trying to get more nurses in schools,'' he
said. In his home state of Florida, he noted, the ratio of school
nurses to students remains one to several thousand _ while the
ideal is more like one to 750 _ so that many schools simply have
clerical workers hand out the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over what to do about the growing demands of
pill-distribution has been taking place in spots across the country
for years, said Judy Robinson, executive director of the National
Association of School Nurses. The number of midday medications that
nurses give out has perhaps doubled in the last decade or so, she
said, and she has heard anecdotally of extreme cases in which
nurses at 600-student schools give out as many as 75 or 80 pills
each day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin, or methylphenidate, administered during the school day
because that is when its action is most needed to improve
concentration, dominates the scholastic pharmacy. It is considered
a mild stimulant of the central nervous system that, for reasons
not fully understood, often helps children who are chronically
distractible, impulsive and hyperactive settle down and
concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1995, use of methylphenidate more than doubled,
according to a 1996 study at Johns Hopkins University. By mid-1995,
it found, nearly 3 percent of American children and youths, or
about 2.5 million, were taking it. And that number appears to have
kept rising, so that by now, it may have hit 3.75 million,
according to a rough estimate by Dr. Lawrence Diller, author of
``Running on Ritalin'' (Bantam, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that remain the subject of debate, childhood asthma
has also increased significantly. And it often falls to school
nurses to supervise some use of inhalers among younger pupils _
pulling the devices from a special inhaler drawer or shelf,
checking to be sure the right child has the right labeled inhaler
and watching its effect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, psychiatric medications in general have become more
common in schools, several nurses noted. Janet Douglass, a director
of the School Health Institute at the University of Massachusetts
at Lowell, said that in a recent visit to a nearby elementary
school she had been struck by the overall level of medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they give out more psychotropic medication than a
psych hospital did when I did psych,'' she said. ``Not just Ritalin
but heavy-duty psychiatric medications.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ritalin dominates. And lunchtime distribution has become
so common that Dr. Diller, a behavioral pediatrician, opens
``Running on Ritalin'' with a vignette from a California school: a
secretary carrying her tray of Ritalin around to pupils, each vial
accompanied by a photograph of the child meant to receive its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   (California is less rigorous than Massachusetts in its use of
school nurses and often has secretaries hand out the Ritalin, he
said. In New York, by contrast, state law requires that medications
be given by nurses.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Ritalin use in schools may come in part from
pressure or encouragement from the school itself, said Dr. Diller,
who regularly prescribes Ritalin to his own patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regularly, parents have reported to me that the school
initiated a medical evaluation,'' he said, ``which is code for `see
if your kid needs Ritalin,''' and teachers have been known to
recommend it to parents as well. But he added that ``the notion
that kids, out of convenience for parents or teachers, are being
drugged into submission'' is ``hyperbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, a survey given for the first time last year indicated
that the school system's 86 nurses, who serve its 64,000 pupils,
had given out about 200,000 doses of medication, but school
officials said the survey was imperfect and the actual number of
doses was probably higher.
</P>
<P>
   With nurses often serving more than one school at a time, the
whole middle of the day can be taken up in a school-to-school
scurry to dole out drugs, Dr. Robinson and other nurses said. In
some rural areas, nurses cover as many as five or six small
schools. And children have been known to wait as long as a
half-hour outside a nurse's office to get their pills while more
urgent medical needs are answered.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its practical problems, the school medication
procedure raises some privacy issues as well, for it exposes
children to their peers as dependent on medication.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diller said that elementary-school children did not seem
much bothered by that aspect of the routine, tending to complain
more about the annoyance of stopping by the office for a dose. But
Kathy O'Neill, nurse coordinator and high school nurse in
Lynnfield, said that with older students, ``there is a certain
amount of stigma attached to having to go to the nurse's office.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, like many other states, has already passed a law
setting down strict rules for how nurses may delegate the role of
giving medication. Each school district must apply separately and
show that no staff cuts will result; the nurses must agree to the
idea, then approve and train whomever they deputize, and continue
to supervise them closely.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But even so, nurses like Mary Jane Kemper wonder aloud how they
can allow the delicate business of giving out doses, watching for
side effects and generally inspecting the children up close to be
taken even partially out of their hands. Her own medication load is
not especially high. Of the 900 students in the two schools she
serves, she gives out about a dozen lunchtime pills. But she
accompanies them with subtle, hawklike appraisals of her patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it our professional responsibility that this be
done in the most professional manner possible,'' she said, ``but
these children have lots of needs you have to observe and assess
before you give that medication, even though you may feel, `I've
only popped a pill in a mouth.' And a lot of lay people can't
understand that.''

<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia _ Indonesia said Wednesday that it was willing
to grant independence to the troubled province of East Timor if a
majority of islanders reject an autonomy offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want their freedom they are welcome,'' Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said at a news conference in Jakarta after a
meeting of President B.J. Habibie's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In another conciliatory move Alatas said the government would
transfer the resistance leader, Jose Xanana Gusmao, from a
maximum-security prison where he is serving a 20-year sentence for
inciting rebellion to a house that it says is an extension of the
jail, in reality house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas described the move as a sign of flexibility and good
will.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was invaded by Indonesia
in 1975 and annexed the next year, a move that the United Nations
never recognized. Talks between Portugal and Indonesia on the issue
are scheduled to resume on Thursday at UN headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government is pressing negotiations on autonomy,
or ``special status'' for East Timor. But officials said the
Cabinet was prepared to ask the legislature to grant independence
if autonomy is rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is not accepted by the mass in East Timor we will
suggest to the new membership of the People's Consultative Assembly
formed as the result of the next elections to release East Timor
from Indonesia,'' said Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his house in Sydney, Australia, the East Timorese
resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta, who won the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1996, said he was skeptical about the proposal, demanding that
words be first converted to deeds. Indonesia should first release
all East Timorese political prisoners and withdraw its 20,000
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta said such moves would provide a ``basis to start a
new chapter with mutual trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao has said in the past a period of autonomy would be
acceptable if a referendum on self-determination followed.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with strong diplomatic pressure to resolve the crisis,
Alatas proposed at a recent Cabinet meeting that Gusmao be
transferred to house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's official policy is that Gusmao's release be linked to
a comprehensive solution that involves international recognition of
Indonesian sovereignty over the former Portuguese colony. After
Indonesia invaded East Timor, pro-independence rebels started an
insurgency, controlling much of the interior but provoking a harsh
response. Credible estimates of the number of fatalities from the
population of 650,000 run to 100,000 because of military action,
starvation or disease.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently Indonesia has refused to countenance any form of
independence or autonomy, a policy that changed with the ouster of
President Suharto in May, ending 32 years of iron rule that
included keeping a firm lid on simmering separatist aspirations in
the far-flung provinces.
</P>
<P>
   A national election is scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas said Wednesday that the government was convinced that a
self-determination referendum after four or 10 years of autonomy
``would not be a good solution'' because it might lead to renewed
civil war and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if a solution of wide-ranging autonomy cannot be
accepted,'' Alatas said, ``we will take the second option, which is
returning to the people's will'' through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``we will separate in a decent and peaceful
way with East Timor.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton touted his plan to preserve
Social Security and give working families personal savings accounts
Wednesday as an alternative to Republican proposals to use the
money for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came at a White House forum featuring a panel
of economists discussing the president's proposals to use the
surplus to shore up the Social Security and Medicare programs. Most
of those invited to attend, including Vice President Al Gore, were
administration officials and lawmakers sympathetic to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me there can be no better use of our surplus than assuring
a secure retirement and health care to older Americans, and I
believe that it is not only good for older Americans but for their
children and grandchildren as well, and for the larger economy,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have signalled interest in using a portion
of the surplus for across-the-board tax cuts. But Clinton said the
money should be dedicated to Social Security and Medicare before
considering a tax cut. He also argued that his plan would promote
economic growth by lowering the federal debt and reducing interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategy that will actually grow the American
economy while preparing for the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would earmark 62 percent of the budget surplus _
more than $2.7 trillion _ to the Social Security system over the
next 15 years. Medicare would receive 15 percent of the surplus _
about $650 billion. That would extend the project life of the
Medicare Trust Fund from 2008 to about 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Once Social Security and Medicare receive their share of the
surplus, Clinton would use $536 billion over the next 15 years to
provide tax credits to working families to invest in personal
savings accounts he calls Universal Savings Accounts (USAs). The
government would match additional voluntary investments in the
accounts by using a sliding scale which would give a larger match
to low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Clinton's former chief economic adviser
and a member of the bipartisan commission on reforming Medicare,
praised the plan, but warned that even with the proposed surplus,
``Medicare ... will still require additional funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed the infusion of the budget surplus would not
solve Medicare's long-range problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, reforming Medicare and committing the surplus go
hand-in-hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is scheduled to offer its recommendations for
reforming Medicare by March 1. Reforming current rules, allowing
Medicare to become more competitive, and including prescription
drugs as a benefit are among the proposals being considered, said
Stuart Altman, a commission member and professor of national health
policy at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is a major victory for young adults,'' said Hans
Riemer, founder and director of the 2030 Center, which opposes
plans to shift Social Security to a personal investment program.
``Social Security benefits should be there for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.) said, ``The president's package
substantially enhances the opportunity to reach a bipartisan
agreement on Social Security and Medicare.''

&HT;        MULTI-CITY GUN LAWSUIT NOT LIKELY, RENDELL SAYS AT U.S.
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS.
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 27, -- Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said
cities across the country are unlikely to file a joint lawsuit
against gun makers to recover the cost of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   After leading a closed-door meeting on gun violence Wednesday at
the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors, Rendell said differences in
state laws make a multi-city lawsuit too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be individual decisions by cities,''
Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cities may sue. Some may not sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who has threatened to sue the gun industry for more
than a year, called for cities to strengthen law enforcement,
negotiate with the gun industry and push for more federal
oversight. ``We are looking at every aspect of fighting this
problem,'' Rendell said. ``We need to fight this battle on
different fronts. We should not put all our eggs in the lawsuit
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chicago and New Orleans were the first two cities to
file lawsuits against the gun industry. Dade County Florida and
Bridgeport, Conn. just announced they have filed suit, and will
likely be followed by other major cities seeking compensation for
law enforcement and medical expenses related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said after the meeting that he was ``closer'' to a
decision on whether to file a lawsuit himself. But he would not say
which way he was leaning. He said he doesn't know when he will make
up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say a decision to sue gun manufacturers
would make it difficult for Rendell if he has aspirations of
holding a state office. Pennsylvania has the second highest
membership to the NRA, after California.
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell said he just wants to find the best way to curb gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a class-action tobacco suit, where we are all
looking to get lots of money,'' Rendell said. ``That's all a bunch
of bull. We are looking to curb behavior to prevent kids from
getting killed. If that can be achieved through a settlement, or
programs rather than a lawsuit, then fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said he has not been impressed so far in his discussions
with the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the usual... 'guns don't kill people, people kill
people,''' Rendell said. Even though other cities have shot ahead
of Philadelphia in filing lawsuits against the gun industry,
Rendell said the city is still a leader on curbing gun violence.
Rendell touted programs like Philadelphia's new ``Operation Cease
Fire,'' which requires a mandatory five-year sentence without
parole to a criminal convicted of a federal gun violation. ``I
don't feel we've been usurped by other cities in taking the lead,''
Rendell said. ``No not at all. Our role in this was never just for
lawsuits.''

   Smart Cards Coming, And Smart Hackers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just about now, someone who will be a malicious hacker in the
21st century is leaving homeroom, heading off to the junior-high
cafeteria. By the time the student graduates, the people at
Schlumberger Test and Transactions hope they will have figured out
a way to stop the mischief.
</P>
<P>
   The company's smart-card technology division is working on
innovative measures to prevent hacking into smart cards, those
credit-card-size, chip-based devices used as debit or telephone
cards. The cards are not yet big in the United States, with Europe
so far leading the way. But the cards are expected to gain wide
acceptance in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The company's concern is that smart people could find ways to
modify smart cards. For example, a hacker could increase the
monetary value of a card. Already, smart-card makers have developed
defenses against someone's simply inserting a card into a computer
and reprogramming it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Schlumberger, based in New York and Paris, is testing a
defense against hackers who seek to open a card to alter its
content with microscopic probes that inject information. Unlike
credit cards, the smart cards have intrinsic monetary value, so
such alterations would essentially be counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this, Schlumberger is coating the chips inside the
card with a compound that makes them so brittle they self-destruct
when tampered with. A consumer-technology analyst, David Card, with
the New York-based market research firm Jupiter Communications,
said the defenses could become significant as the use of smart
cards becomes more prevalent and hacking of them becomes more
lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some future hacker has just read this story on a
school PC and is now heading to chemistry class to find a way to
dissolve the anti-tampering compound used on the chips. &QL;

   Follow the Soaps By Watching a PDA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One downside of always being on the go is that it's tough to
follow the latest murder plots, marital affairs or the sudden
appearance of an evil twin. No, not the normal doings in your
office _ we're talking about television soap operas, and the fans
who really want to keep track of each episode's events. Now, they
can do so through their handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Tristar Interactive is starting a new Soap City Daily
Dose newsletter that downloads automatically to a Palm Pilot or
Windows CE device. Columbia joins roughly 70 companies, including
the likes of USA Today and Excite, that provide content to Avant Go
in San Mateo, Calif. Avant Go then makes the information accessible
via a Palm Pilot or Windows CE computer.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers plug their mobile device into the Internet and
receive automatic updates of their choice, said David Rice,
director of content development for Avant Go.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Soap Opera site, who finds it really necessary to
have instant and mobile access to developments on major soap
operas? ``A lot of college students are hooked on soaps'' and a lot
of them have handheld computers or personal digital assistants,
said Lynda Keeler, general manager of Columbia Tristar Interactive.
``They can be in class and get their favorite updates.'' &QL;

   Bad News for E-Mail Addicts: It's Play-by-Mail Scrabble &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until the world's dictionaries formally embrace ``e-mail,'' it
may not be appropriate to use on a Scrabble board. But it is
possible to use a Scrabble board in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Hasbro Interactive plans to market a series of old
games, but newly playable via e-mail. The games, Scrabble,
Battleship and Grand Master Chess, will include virtual game boards
that appear as attachments to e-mail messages. Your opponent does
not have to buy a copy of the game, just download a small piece of
``client software'' to take his turn, and send it back to you.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro (email.games.com/egg) plans on Feb. 5 to promote the
PC-only games by giving away 100,000 CD-ROMs of the $14.95 games at
various locations in New York and some rail stations in
Connecticut. &QL;

   New Domain Names Set a Record in 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet users who registered a domain name in 1998, the first
step in publishing a Web site, were in good company. Network
Solutions, the Herndon, Va., registrar of .com, .net, .org and .edu
names, said it logged a record 1.9 million new domain names in
1998, nearly double the 1997 total of 960,000.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest number of these came from the United States,
followed by Canada and the United Kingdom. The states with the
largest number of registrants were California, New York, Florida
and Texas, which a Network spokeswoman, Cheryl Regan, said was
probably some reflection of both the size of those states and of
the Net savvy of their populations. &QL;

   Sierra Takes Major Step And Recalls Football Game &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Sports last week issued a recall of its new PC game, NFL
Pro Football '99, because of several dozen software glitches that
seriously hampered play. Bugs are common in new software, of
course, and pity the poor consumer who fails to check for updates.
But until recently, Sierra's action of removing a game from store
shelves nationwide and offering consumers a full refund was unheard
of.
</P>
<P>
   It seems in this case, though, Sierra was tackled for a loss by
its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Gleason, director of marketing for Sierra Sports, a
division of Sierra On-Line, said the company knew the game had
problems but did not anticipate the negative consumer reaction. He
said the company had been so eager to get the game to market before
the end of the football season that it may have underestimated the
bugs when it started shipping 50,000 copies in late December. More
information about the recall is available by calling (800) 757-7707
or at www.sierra.com/sierrasports/team/fb99.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra is not alone. In the last several months, two other game
makers have recalled major products, the first such recalls of
video games, said Vince Broady, editorial director of Game Spot, an
online publication that tracks the PC and video game industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bungie Software issued a recall for Myth II: Soulblighter
because the medieval strategy game contained a ``fatal error'' bug
that could erase a hard drive. Electronic Arts recalled Tiger Woods
99 PGA Tour, a game for the Sony Playstation, because a programmer
inserted frames from the ``South Park'' television cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Broady, a longtime observer of the industry, said one reason for
the recalls was that the bad news about the product bugs now spread
very quickly on the Internet and on gamers' bulletin boards. ``It
used to be you'd put a game on the shelf and it would be a month or
two before any magazine would be able to report the game had
bugs,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Better Way of Tracking Criminals on the Run &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new technology that uses Global Positioning Systems could make
it easier to track criminals who escape from their own homes and
jobs. The technology, called the Satellite Monitoring and Remote
Tracking System (Smart), is a high-tech twist on the ankle
bracelets worn by criminals sentenced to home arrest and work
release. Those ankle bracelets use radio waves to warn the
authorities when a criminal on parole or sentenced to home
detention leaves his assigned premises.
</P>
<P>
   In the handful of jurisdictions using Smart, marketed by
Security Link from Ameritech, the people sentenced to home arrest
must carry a small GPS device with them at all times. The device
communicates both with the ankle bracelet and with satellites and
then reports the position of the convict to a command center in
Palm Harbor, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the catch, and it's a big one. For the system to
work, the convict must not only wear the ankle bracelet but also
faithfully carry the GPS device, which is about a third the size of
a lunch box. The device will electronically alert officials when it
is not within a short distance of the ankle bracelet.

SENATOR LOOK TO THEIR CONSCIENCES TO DECIDE CLINTON'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton's impeachment trial revs up,
senators will ultimately have to decide if the evidence presented
is enough to find him guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the standard they will use to make that decision? Or
in legal jargon, what is the standard of proof in this case?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: There is no standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each senator will have to make up his or her own mind on the
facts and decide from there,'' says Susan Bloch, a law professor at
Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Constitution includes no reference to any standard in
an impeachment trial, Bloch says the senators likely will look to
the standards of proof used in American courts as a guide on how to
judge the evidence presented by the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Those standards require that defendants must be convicted if the
alleged offense is proved:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Beyond a reasonable doubt'' in criminal trials. This rule,
according to legal historians, dates from 1770, when British
soldiers were tried for killing five American civilians in the
Boston Massacre. The leader of the squad that fired the shots and
four other British troops were acquitted, and two soldiers were
found guilty of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   _ By a ``preponderance of the evidence'' in most civil trials;
</P>
<P>
   _ By ``clear and convincing evidence,'' a higher standard, in
extraordinary civil proceedings such as determining the loss of
citizenship, committing a person to a mental institution or taking
away custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   Although it does not require the Senate to apply a specific
standard of proof, the Constitution also does not bar it from
adopting its own evidence threshold.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, who is charged with perjury and
obstruction of justice in trying to cover up his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the White House has argued for
the ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard. Such a high threshold,
it said, would assure the public ``that this grave decision has
been made with care.''
</P>
<P>
   That standard has been supported by some senators, including
conservative Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, moderate Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., and Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del. Others, including liberal
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and moderate Susan Collins, R-Maine., have
favored the ``preponderance of the evidence'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, no senator has pressed for official adoption of any
standard.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1986 impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge Harry
Claiborne of Nevada, his lawyer, Oscar Goodman, asked the Senate to
apply the ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard for conviction.
But the Senate rejected the request, saying its members must vote
their conscience. Eventually, the Senate found Claiborne guilty of
three articles of impeachment for filing false income tax returns
and removed him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, during the impeachment trial of U.S. District
Judge Walter Nixon Jr. of Mississippi, defense lawyer David Stewart
also considered making a similar motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without one standard of proof to aim for, it was as if I
needed 100 different legal strategies _ one for each senator,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But when he consulted with Senate lawyers, Stewart decided
against the motion. ``After the Senate's rejection of the same
motion in the Claiborne case, we figured that there just wasn't
much chance of it happening, and we didn't want to antagonize
anybody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was convicted of lying before a federal grand jury and
removed from his post.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Freedman, an expert on impeachment trials at the Hofstra
University law school in Hempstead, N.Y., says the Senate made the
right choice in rejecting the motion in the Claiborne case.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to remember that what's going on here is a mix of
law and politics; so the usual standards don't apply,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman says each senator's decision to convict or acquit will
have two parts _ determining if the evidence proves that the
president is guilty of any of the crimes listed in the articles of
impeachment and if those crimes warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that second part that makes any single standard of proof
unworkable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Determining whether removal from office fits the crime, Freedman
says, is a ``very personal'' decision for senators and should be
left up to their own consciences. ``It's a decision that the
founding fathers wanted to come from the gut, not from some outside
standard,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers have suggested that the two parts of the decision
be formally split. Then, they say, the Senate could adopt a
standard of proof for deciding whether the president is guilty.
Following a guilty verdict the senators would make an admittedly
subjective determination on whether he should be removed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloch says the founders considered the two-decision option
and rejected it because they believed it would cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if the Senate said, `Yes, he's guilty of the crime but we
don't believe he should be removed?''' Bloch asks. ``The country
would have a criminal for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman notes that the Constitution requires that ``the
president ... shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and
conviction of, treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' That provision, he says, was aimed at preventing
the Senate from convicting presidents of crimes without removing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding fathers had a fear that Congress would use
impeachment as a political tool; so they made it huge deal by
requiring removal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to kick somebody out of office, it had better
be for something really big or else the public won't stand for
it,'' he adds.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton unexpectedly used his State
of the Union message last week to propose vast changes in the way
Social Security is financed, he touched off what may become the
hottest policy debate of the year.
</P>
<P>
   No other government program has ever been relied on by so many
people. Nor has one been so popular or so expensive. And probably,
no other measure affecting the general public is so complicated and
so misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   As a guide in following the debate, here is a primer describing
the basics of the program, its problems and its politics and
explaining what the president and the Republicans in Congress want
to do about it.
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Social Security &UR;  &LR; And How It Works
</P>
<P>
   A payroll tax is imposed on almost all workers and their
employers _ 6.2 percent each on all wages below $72,600. (The
workers and employers pay an additional 1.45 percent each in
Medicare taxes and there is no income ceiling.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of the money is now used to pay monthly
benefits. Most of the money goes to retirees and their widows and
widowers. A much smaller amount is paid to the survivors of workers
who died before they retired and to disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Today's workers are taxed to pay retirement benefits for their
parents' generation. When today's workers retire, their benefits
will be covered by their children's generation. The principle is
different from an investment, an insurance policy or an annuity, in
which individuals pay premiums and the income from those premiums
is used to pay their benefits later.
</P>
<P>
   When, as is now the case, the government receives more money in
Social Security taxes than it must pay in benefits, the reserves
are credited to a trust fund. The money is invested in government
bonds. The interest on the bonds is credited to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund is no more than a bookkeeping entry, a collection
of government IOU's promising to pay benefits to future retirees.
This obligation will be fulfilled only to the extent that
politicians are willing to raise the necessary money through taxes
or borrowing. But as a political matter, it is an obligation that
would be hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the surplus in the trust fund has been used to meet
part of the operating expenses of the government and to offset part
of the overall budget deficit. But this is no longer necessary
because, for the next 15 years, the government is expected to run a
total budget surplus of $4.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Problem
</P>
<P>
   Despite today's surplus, the future is far from rosy.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of workers paying taxes to retirees drawing benefits
has been shrinking for years. In 1950, there were 16 workers for
each Social Security beneficiary. Today, there are slightly more
than three. By the second or third decade of the next century, when
most baby boomers will have retired, actuaries project that there
will be only two people at work for each person receiving benefits.
When that happens, unless changes are made, the trust fund will go
into the red.
</P>
<P>
   The latest estimate is that Social Security taxes will continue
to exceed benefits until 2013. Because of interest payments owed on
the bonds credited to the trust fund, the income in the fund will
be more than what is paid out until 2021. After that, the trust
fund will begin to shrink rapidly year after year until the money
runs out in 2032.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and politicians agree that the sooner the problem is
addressed, the less painful and abrupt the solution will be.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Proposal
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan would keep the Social Security tax and
benefit structure. He has proposed giving 62 percent of the budget
surplus over the next 15 years to the Social Security trust fund,
$2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion projected surplus. (The rest of
the surplus would be spent on Medicare, the military and other
programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the $2.7 trillion, Clinton proposed that the trust fund
invest $700 million in the stock market. The White House insisted
that steps would be taken to insulate the investments from
political tampering, but no details were offered.
</P>
<P>
   The other $2 trillion would be used to buy government bonds from
the public to lower the outstanding public debt _ the sum of all
the annual budget deficits over the decades _ from nearly $4
billion to less than $2 billion. As a proportion of the total
American economy, the national debt would fall from about 45
percent today to 10 percent in 2014, the lowest level since the
United States entered World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sees three advantages for Social Security in
this approach:
</P>
<P>
   _ Historically, the average return on stock investments over a
long period has been much higher than the return on government
bonds. The return on stocks is about 7 percent above the rate of
inflation, compared with about 3 percent for bonds. Over the next
50 years, based on the long-term average return of stocks,
investing $700 billion in the stock market instead of government
securities would extend the life of the trust fund by five years,
the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paying off $2 trillion in public debt over the next 15 years
should strengthen the economy by lowering interest rates and
opening the way for more productive private investments. A stronger
economy would increase the number of people working and the size of
their paychecks and make it less painful for workers to pay the
taxes needed to support Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   _ The interest on the $2 trillion in additional bonds would be
credited by the Treasury to the Social Security trust fund,
increasing the amount promised for retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   These proposals, the president believes, would extend the life
of the Social Security trust fund until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president would allow people ages 65 to 69 to
continue to work and receive full benefits. Under the existing law,
their benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 earned. And the
president would improve benefits for widows.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered no means of paying for these additional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Social Security, Clinton would set aside $500 billion
from the surplus to create what he calls universal savings
accounts. To encourage workers to save and invest, the government
would give low- and middle-income Americans seed money to invest in
their own accounts in financial markets. Then the government would
match a portion of people's own money that they invested, similar
to the way that many companies match their employees' contributions
to 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledges that the plan would not fix Social
Security's problems once and for all and that ultimately, in order
to keep the program solvent for the next 75 years, taxes will have
to be raised or benefits cut. But the president avoided dealing
with this question. For the present, his proposal would not require
any sacrifice by taxpayers or retirees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Position
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who control Congress, have not developed a
single proposal of their own. But they are united on three points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government should not invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Social Security system should be overhauled so that
workers could themselves invest in financial markets some of the
money they now pay in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 62 percent of the surplus that the president wants to use
for Social Security is the proper proportion, but much or all of
the rest of the surplus should be used for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe that government investments in financial
markets would be a mistake as a matter of principle and as a matter
of economics. They say it would give the government too much
control over private companies. And they argue that the return on
investments would be reduced because politicians would not be
prevented from abandoning their fiduciary responsibility and
voting, for instance, to prohibit investments in companies that
make cigarettes or firearms or certain contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   One approach under consideration by Republicans would allow
workers to invest themselves part of what they now pay in Social
Security taxes. Guaranteed Social Security benefits would have to
be reduced accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican approach would be to maintain the current
Social Security tax and benefit structure but give workers an
income tax cut if they invested the money in retirement accounts.
This would eventually cause the federal deficit to rise again if
other taxes were not raised or spending cut to offset the
income-tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Politics
</P>
<P>
   Social Security was born in 1935 over Republican opposition, and
Democrats from Franklin Roosevelt through Bill Clinton have
trumpeted it to their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Republicans have tried to tinker with the system, they
have suffered politically. For instance, Republican support for a
cut in benefits was seen by many as a reason the party lost control
of the Senate in the 1986 elections. In the 1995 budget struggle
with Congress and in his 1996 race for re-election against Bob
Dole, Clinton made headway with his accusation that Republicans
wanted to cut Medicare, Social Security's close cousin, in order to
give a tax cut to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Republicans in Congress agree that sooner or
later a solution must be found and that it must be bipartisan. But
given this history of political mistrust and the added divisions
arising from the president's impeachment, it will be
extraordinarily difficult to reach an accord this year.

ANGOLA TO ABANDON PEACE PACT WITH REBEL GROUP
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In a further sign of the
deterioration of peace efforts in Angola, a high-level government
official said Wednesday that the ruling party would abandon a
four-year-old peace treaty with the principal rebel movement and
deal only with a splinter group.
</P>
<P>
   Territorial Administration Minister Faustino Muteka told
Parliament that an official declaration ending the validity of the
treaty, known as the Lusaka Protocol, would be issued before the
end of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's decided, we are going to conclude the Lusaka Protocol
only with UNITA Renovada,'' Muteka said, referring to the splinter
group.
</P>
<P>
   Muteka said the move had been prompted by the actions of the
mainstream rebels, known as UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, who had returned in recent weeks to an
armed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations-brokered treaty, which took months to hammer
out, aimed at ending more than 20 years of civil war between the
government and UNITA. It resulted in the longest period of peace
that Angola had seen in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, both sides appear to have returned to war.
Muteka's remarks came on a day when the government was forced to
admit that the rebels had overrun a key northern city that could
allow them to launch attacks on foreign-owned oil installations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao told the National Assembly that
UNITA rebels took control of Mbanza Congo on Tuesday, after days of
heavy shelling and intense combat with government troops.
</P>
<P>
   The government's announcement about the protocol in some ways
only confirms what has been going on for months. The government has
stopped trying to deal with the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, and
has been instead encouraging a small, splinter group that has
denounced Savimbi and called for peace.
</P>
<P>
   But the splinter group has no power base and its recognition by
the government will have little effect on Savimbi, who has been the
head of UNITA since its inception decades ago. He is said to
control a well-armed, disciplined army of guerrillas. Most experts
estimate he has at least 30,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on UNITA Renovada, however, the government is trying
to maintain the illusion that it is still trying to negotiate a
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fighting began Dec. 5 when the government, impatient
with UNITA's foot-dragging in turning over control of certain areas
of the country, attacked its two strongholds, Andulo and Bailundo,
in central Angola. But the government army was soon repelled, and
the rebels have counterattacked with success.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, they appear to be stepping up attacks in the
oil and diamond areas that produce most of the country's wealth.

COMMENTARY: SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Note language, `putain,' 3rd graf from end.) 
(JT) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE

   LONDON _ Americans are afflicted with the notion that we should
be embarrassed by the Clinton Impeachment Follies. We think that
sophisticated Europe is going tut-tut at our seeming constitutional
instability and tsk-tsk at our obsession with what Dale Bumpers
brushed off as a mere ``sex scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut the blushing. Eurocorruption is busting out all over. Never
have so many taken so much so blatantly.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair's eminence grise, a
smooth manipulator of public opinion named Peter Mandelson, was
caught secretly taking a half-million-dollar interest-free loan
from another Cabinet minister whose department he was
investigating. This illicit arrangement, giving new meaning to what
is known here as ``the third way,'' caused much red-faced New Labor
harrumphing and spun the spinmeister out of his job.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, a score of the faceless commissioners of the
European Union were nearly sacked when an anti-fraud squad of the
European Parliament found cronyism and evidence of rigged bids and
embezzlement rampant in the management of humanitarian funds.
Sticky-fingered bureaucrats who believed that humanitarianism began
at home may soon face a new force: an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   And how about that money-grubbing International Olympic
Committee? A new gold medal for kickbacks has been struck at IOC
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. Competition in the 500-meter
shakedown was discovered in Salt Lake City and spread to Sydney,
Australia, and to Nagano, Japan, where records of the corrupt
bidding were consigned to the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Ringleader of the five Olympic rings is Juan Antonio Samaranch,
who built the Olympics into a billion-dollar business. As
investigators in sucker cities close in on the center of extortion,
this grumpy geezer maintains he was merely blind to the high living
of his agents. Urgently needed is a high-integrity replacement
unbeholden to the old regime, such as Sir Roger Bannister, the
eminent neurologist, who in his youth was first to break the
four-minute mile.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they're not venal, Europe's honchos of hubris are
making history. The judge who cast the swing vote to turn over Gen.
Augusto Pinochet to Spanish prosecutors turns out to have had a
whopping conflict of interest: Lord Hoffmann failed to reveal his
longtime association with Amnesty International, an active party in
the case. For the first time in the long history of the Law Lords,
a decision was scrapped and a new panel appointed. This has flipped
more than a few wigs.
</P>
<P>
   However, sexually enlightened France's entry in the Kickback
Olympics puzzles Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The head of France's independent Constitutional Council is
roughly equivalent to the Chief Justice of the United States.
Roland Dumas, 76, a former foreign minister and a man of great
dignity, is the subject of a book by a former friend, the lobbyist
Christine Deviers-Joncour, entitled ``The Whore of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine told investigators she was paid $11 million by the
French oil giant Elf Aquitaine to use her connection with Dumas,
then foreign minister, to drop his opposition to a sale of six
warships to Taiwan. The sale, worth $2.7 billion, went through.
Dumas says he has a clear conscience and ``will continue in all
serenity'' to preside over French justice.
</P>
<P>
   He is less serene about the pictures in bathing suits with
Christine on a beach near the oilfields, published by the gossipy
Paris Match. The investigation has just been concluded and France
is holding its breath: Will its top judge be indicted? Will the
``putain'' be discredited or believed? A trustworthy European
source tells me: ``All Paris is agog.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you agog? Of course not. We Americans have long ago given up
agogging when it comes to affairs of the heart by powerful
politicians. We smile tolerantly; we shrug expressively; we lift a
sophisticated eyebrow to show we are not prigs or moralizers or
hypocrites. This is the way of the world, is it not so?
</P>
<P>
   Clintonized Americans regard with world-weary disdain those
French prudes snooping on each other in a ``nouvelle vague'' of
sexual McCarthyism. When will Europe grow up?

AMERICAN FACES QUESTIONING IN MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Conn.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The successor to the Soviet KGB has ordered a
Connecticut man in for questioning about the assassination in St.
Petersburg last November of Russian pro-democracy lawmaker Galina
Starovoitova.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Whitmore of New Branford, Conn., has not been named a
suspect in the Starovoitova case. A reporter for the local
English-language newspaper, The St. Petersburg Times, Whitmore, 36,
knew Starovoitova and is a friend of her aide, Ruslan Linkov, who
was seriously injured in the Nov. 20 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the case has taken a strange turn as investigators have
begun interrogating people who were close to the slain legislator.
Some of those questioned say investigators appeared more interested
in finding out compromising information about Starovoitova and her
confidants than finding the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore, who has written extensively on Starovoitova's murder,
said he received a call last week from an officer of the Federal
Security Service, or FSB, the Russian successor to the
counterintelligence branch of the KGB. The officer, who identified
himself as Alexander Andreyev, asked Whitmore to appear at the
``Big House,'' the St. Petersburg office of the service, last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `We've got a lot to talk to you about. Plan on
being here for a long time,' '' Whitmore said by telephone from St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   But when Whitmore arrived with an officer from the US consulate,
the investigator would not let the American official in. When
Whitmore refused to go inside without the consular officer, the
investigator issued him a subpoena for questioning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A US embassy spokesman in Moscow said he was aware of Whitmore's
case but declined to comment on the issue. Russian law does not
allow witnesses to be accompanied by lawyers for interrogation, and
apparently this rule applies to foreign citizens and consular
officers. Whitmore said he was apprehensive about his interrogation
after talking to other reporters who had been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   One journalist, Daniel Kotsubinsky, of the weekly St. Petersburg
newspaper Chas Pik, said his interrogator told him that the youth
wing of Starovoitova's political party indulged in immoral
behavior. Kotsubinsky said Detective Mikhail Balukhta tried to get
him to confirm such behavior by Starovoitova's allies.
</P>
<P>
   Another journalist who was interrogated agreed that solving the
crime did not seem to be a high priority of at least one
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the interrogation he said to me: `We are going
to solve this case in such a way that it buries your democratic
movement,' '' Whitmore quoted journalist Tatyana Likhanova as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore said the investigation had turned on Starovoitova's
friends following an article in a Russian newspaper, Komsomolskaya
Pravda, that fingered Linkov as the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore said the report contained inaccuracies that could
easily be disproved _ for example, it said Linkov, who is still
recovering from bullet wounds to his head and neck, was unhurt in
the shooting. But Whitmore worries the report and the odd
investigation is in fact a political ploy aimed at discrediting
Starovoitova's allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it really gone so far that they're going to pin this on
her allies? If that is the case, we are back in 1937,'' he said, a
reference to a critical point in Stalinist political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The FSB was unavailable for comment on the case. Alexei
Vostretsov, FSB spokesman for St. Petersburg, told the Interfax
news agency that no one has been detained in the Starovoitova case,
but that officers had interviewed ``several thousand people and
interrogated over 100.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Petersburg FSB has led a three-year investigation of
Alexander Nikitin, a former Navy captain who was accused of treason
after coauthoring a report that accused Russia of negligence in
handling nuclear waste from the submarines based on the Kola
Peninsula. The local St. Petersburg Times has been critical of the
FSB's handling of the case, as have Western governments and human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Linkov charged Wednesday that the investigation of
Starovoitova's case had turned into a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am interested in finding the murderers,'' Linkov told
Interfax. ``(The investigation) is trying to gather dirt on Galina
Vasilyevna (Starovoitova) and other democrats.''

   MARTHA-GRAHAM-LEGACY (subslug) (New York) _ Monday, one day
before opening a three-week season at the Joyce Theater, the Martha
Graham Dance Company will vacate the school and studios at 316 East
63rd Street, where Graham taught and choreographed for 40 years
before she died in 1991. The small brick building will be
demolished, sold to pay off debts, retire a $1.5 million mortgage
and establish an endowment. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   RUSHMORE-FILM (Undated) _ Wes Anderson, the 29-year-old director
of ``Rushmore,'' which opens on Friday, is as singular a
personality as Max, his comic creation. Where Max is flamboyant,
however, Anderson is quiet. Underneath this reticence, though,
lurks a gentle fierceness that has enabled him to make two
thoroughly offbeat films within the Hollywood studio system.
Anderson wrote both ``Rushmore'' and his first movie, ``Bottle
Rocket,'' with his friend, and fellow Texan, Owen Wilson. By Laura
Winters. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   FEMALE-FILM-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ ``Directing is the final
frontier,'' said the producer Gale Ann Hurd, who was involved with
``The Terminator'' and ``Armageddon'' and who knows a bit about the
perils of breaking into a male bastion. ``It's the one area where
women have made no real inroads.'' In fact, while the 1980s saw
dramatic gains _ the number of women directing studio releases rose
from zero to 7 percent or 8 percent of the total _ those figures
have remained flat through the 1990s. By Nancy Hass. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ORGAN-DONATIONS-FILM (New York) _ Early last month at the New
York Public Library's Donnell branch, a standing-room-only
screening was held of ``The Kindness of Strangers,'' a 104-minute
documentary that provides a close look at organ donation and
transplantation from the personal perspective of donors, survivors,
recipients and their families. When the lights came up, teary
audience members could be seen fishing for their drivers' licenses
and filling out the organ donor consent information. By Jean
Nathan. (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-HEART-THEATER (London) _ ``Blue Heart,'' one of two one-act
plays by Caryl Churchill was widely acclaimed in its London debut
nearly 18 months ago at the Royal Court Theater, where critics
praised an ever-adventurous dramatist _ perhaps Britain's most
consistently daring _ as well as a cast that illuminated fully what
in lesser hands might have come across as a stunt. The double-bill
made its American debut last Friday at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music's Majestic Theater, following an international tour last
year. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MAKEOVERS-THEATER (Undated) _ The retooled ``Scarlet Pimpernel''
has given theatergoers a rare glimpse of the critical role played
by the directors of Broadway musicals. Yet when you talk to them
about what they do for a living, they resort to simple metaphors
that belie the complexity of their task. They will tell you the job
is about finding a rhythm, seeing a picture, hearing a motor. Or
maybe making an arc, weaving a spell, taking a journey. By Sylviane
Gold. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   CUNNINGHAM-GRAHAM-PHOTOS (Undated) _ Imogen Cunningham
photographed Martha Graham in the summer of 1931, in Santa Barbara,
Calif. They worked outside, in front of the barn at Graham's
mother's home. The afternoon was hot, the smell unpleasant and the
flies bothersome, but together they managed to produce a collection
of nearly 90 images, an extraordinary double-portrait of both
photographer and choreographer. By Ann Daly. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FELDMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ It may not be helpful to living
musical practitioners to know this, but death does wonders for a
composer's reputation, at least as measured by representation on
CD. Numerous recordings of works by Luigi Nono, John Cage, Witold
Lutoslawski and Toru Takemitsu have come too late for them to hear,
and the posthumous crescendo is even more spectacular in the case
of Morton Feldman. At the time of his death, in 1987, the CD
catalogue included barely a handful of his pieces. Now his whole
immense output is heaving into view, and the peaks are beginning to
become evident. Most recently, three releases have started to
repair the neglect of his orchestral compositions. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCHOENBERG-MUSIC (Undated) _ Arnold Schoenberg probably gets the
nod as the most reviled composer in history. So when the
Metropolitan Opera presents its first production of his masterpiece
``Moses und Aron'' on Feb. 8, more of the animosity the composer's
music has always attracted will undoubtedly be whipped up. By
Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-MUSIC (Undated) _ No one is bolder in his embrace of a
tonal, lyrical and Romantic past than Lowell Liebermann. And not
coincidentally, perhaps, Liebermann, 37, a New Yorker, has been
blessed with enthusiastic audiences and big-name performers, many
of whom rarely champion contemporary music. Just now, Liebermann
seems to be everywhere at once. His opera ``The Picture of Dorian
Gray,'' based on the novel by Oscar Wilde, will receive its
American premiere on Friday at the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee.
Two weeks ago, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and its music
director, Andrew Litton, appointed Liebermann
composer-in-residence, a three-year position to take effect in the
fall. The New York Philharmonic has scheduled the premiere of his
Trumpet Concerto in May 2000. And BMG Classics recently released a
disk of his flute music, played by James Galway. By K. Robert
Schwarz. (Moved).

   JAZZ-LACY-ABROAD (subslug) (Undated) _ Since the be-bop era,
jazz musicians seeking a better life have landed with their
suitcases on the shores of Europe. In cities like Paris, Stockholm
and Berlin, they have found steady work, low rents, congenial
audiences and a more hospitable racial climate. But for all its
attractions, living abroad has seldom advanced the art itself. By
Adam Shatz. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   TEN-ARTISTS-EXHIBIT (Undated) _ At the little-known Mercury
Gallery in Boston, a mostly forgotten group of American artists
from the 1930s is the focus of an exhibition that also turns
attention to the group's sole surviving member, a very fine painter
named Joseph Solman. The show in Boston (through February) is about
the Ten, as the group chose to call itself, somewhat eccentrically,
considering that there were only nine of them in the beginning.
(The numbers changed over the years.) Solman was the youngest
member and became something of a ringleader. By Michael Kimmelman.

<P>
   CARAVAGGIO-ART (Boston) _ Since it was rediscovered in the
Jesuit Residence in Dublin in 1990, Caravaggio's ``Taking of
Christ'' has left Ireland only twice. In 1995, the painting spent a
month at the National Gallery in London and two months in Rome.
``The Taking of Christ'' was not scheduled to leave Dublin _ where
the Jesuit Fathers have left it on indefinite loan at the National
Gallery of Ireland _ for the next 25 years. Yet Monday it will be
on view in Boston, as the centerpiece of ``Saints and Sinners:
Caravaggio and the Baroque Image,'' a show of 17th-century Italian
religious art that opens at the McMullen Museum of Art at Boston
College, through May 24. By Ken Shulman. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   TV-HOLOCAUST (Undated) _ Television and the Holocaust are
clearly an odd couple, says Jeffrey Shandler, who teaches in the
department of Hebrew and Judaic studies at New York University. But
they are also ``age mates,'' having entered the American
consciousness around the same time. And more than film or art or
literature, Shandler says, the much-maligned small screen is
responsible for turning the Holocaust from a calamity befalling a
foreign people in a different time and place into a ubiquitous,
paradigmatic part of American culture. By David Margolick. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FOLK-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Outsider art continues to upstage
American folk art in gallery and museum exhibitions as well as in
the press. But at the auctions, traditional American folk art
chalks up spectacular prices for the choicest examples, while the
quirky, visionary Outsider art lags far behind in the prices
fetched at auction. This month's folk-art sales began with the
proverbial bang at Christie's when two extraordinary paintings by
Edward Hicks rewrote the records for the artist and for folk art.

JORDANIANS ON EDGE AS KING HUSSEIN PREPARES FOR THE NATION'S
FUTURE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Banners welcoming King Hussein home still adorn
the streets of this capital. Full-color posters depict a smiling,
relaxed monarch, his arm slung over the shoulders of his brother,
the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Shakespearean machinations of the last eight days,
the adornments seem to many Jordanians to be totems of a distant
past.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince, Hassan, has been replaced by his nephew, the
king's son. The king, battling cancer, has left the country in
haste for treatment. The new heir, Abdullah, young and
inexperienced, received well-wishers for the first time Wednesday,
but only amid questions about what might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our king is a magnificent man, and now we don't know if he
will ever come back,'' said Tarek Bourghol, a 23-year-old merchant.
He was among countless Jordanians who watched as the new crown
prince made his debut, in a ceremony that was broadcast live on
Jordanian television.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors of the king confirmed suspicions Wednesday night
that he had a relapse of cancer, saying he had been readmitted to
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for treatment of non-Hodgkins
lymphoma. A statement broadcast on state television here said the
king was in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has decided to stop here
on Thursday to meet for the first time with Crown Prince Abdullah,
her spokesman said in Cairo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the impression of sickness and strife, the Hashemite
royal family has sought to display resilience. Hassan, said to be
bitterly disappointed by his ouster after 34 years as heir to the
throne, joined the line of dignitaries paying tribute to the
successor Wednesday who bestowed a kiss on one cheek and then the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, wearing a blue business suit, and standing near a
gold-rimmed throne, assured the dignitaries one by one that his
father, the king, was still in good shape. A letter from the king,
meanwhile, has expressed ``categorical confidence and trust'' in
his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, and sometimes even in public, Jordanians are
saying that what is taking place strikes them as not just drama but
perhaps even tragedy in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it seems that the king is very sick, and the present and
the future seem less defined than in the past,'' said Radwan
Abdullah, a political scientist and consultant. ``This is bound to
lead to insecurity and apprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   The most gnawing concern voiced by Jordanians Wednesday was for
the 63-year-old king, who has ruled this tiny kingdom since he was
17. Most Jordanians have known no other king, and many say they
cannot imagine how anyone could replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The new worries over how much longer the king might reign have
also sharpened what many Jordanians still describe as bafflement
and disbelief over his abrupt change of successors. Some say they
find it hard to understand his decision, carried out in the space
of a week, apparently with the knowledge that he was ill, to wrest
the title of crown prince from an experienced statesman and hand it
to a 36-year-old career soldier who has never had a political role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the only Hashemite with experience, knowledge,
maturity, intelligence, connections and seriousness,'' said a
member of a prominent Jordanian family in reference to the ouster
of Hassan, 51. ``And we replaced him with a zero as far as most
people are concerned. Prince Abdullah might be a nice guy, but he
has no experience, no education, no seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most people critical of the king's decision, he agreed to
be quoted only on the condition that his name not be used. But he
and the others said they were speaking frankly because of real
unease, and a feeling that Abdullah might not be well suited to
guide Jordan in an unsettled region.
</P>
<P>
   The king, on his return last week from six months of cancer
treatment in the United States, said that he was determined ``to
make people more confident and more comfortable about their
future'' after years clouded by economic problems and troubles
across the Israeli and Iraqi borders.
</P>
<P>
   But what he set in motion in less than seven full days at home
has only compounded insecurities. The steps included his abrupt
removal of Hassan, to whom the king had referred for years as ``the
apple of my eye,'' then the bitter letter that all but accused his
brother of treachery, and finally his own sudden departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been very strange, but we have to hope that
somehow all of this will lead to a change for the better,'' said
Samr Khayat, 27, a cook who was grilling lamb on an outdoor stove.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the king's success at steering Jordan through
nearly five decades of turbulence in the Middle East has forged a
faith that even if what he is doing seems hard to understand, it
might well be right.
</P>
<P>
   As one woman, Joumana Nuqul, 35, a travel agent, put it in a
conversation Wednesday, ``In a phrase, I think the king knows what
he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahd Fanek, a Jordanian columnist, argued in the newspaper
Al-Rai on Tuesday that such sentiments meant that any discontent
over Hassan's ouster would ultimately fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can cast any doubt on Prince Hassan, his ability and
his experience during 34 years in office,'' Fanek wrote. But, he
added, ``Popular trust in King Hussein is considerable, and the
Jordanian people happily accept any decision he takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Jordanians, however, say they wonder whether illness might
have robbed the king of some of his judgment. As possible evidence,
they have pointed with some amazement to the king's letter to
Hassan, dated Jan. 25 and made public early Tuesday. In translation
from the Arabic, it runs to six single-spaced pages and in a
departure from the king's usual eloquence, it is rambling and
barely coherent in some sections.
</P>
<P>
   From its main point _ the reasons for his brother's ouster _ the
letter veers at one point into soliloquies on germ warfare and the
ozone layer. In other sections, it abandons its tone of royal
reserve, even suggesting the king and his family ``were hurt by the
gossip and lies about my wife and children'' that he said had been
spread by Hassan's supporters.

IRA TURNCOAT COLLINS KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An admitted IRA assassin who turned against the group
and wrote a best-selling book renouncing violence was killed
Wednesday in Northern Ireland, adding fuel to an increasingly
incendiary debate over the vigilante attacks by paramilitary groups
there.
</P>
<P>
   Police said an autopsy showed that Eamon Collins had been
stabbed as well as run over. If the killing is linked to the Irish
Republican Army, it will put pressure on the British government to
ban Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, from the new Northern
Ireland assembly, putting the whole peace process at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Collins's friend and lawyer, Jason
McCue, said he had no doubt that Irish republicans were behind what
he called an execution. McCue said whoever hit Collins stopped the
car and backed over him several times, mutilating his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an accident,'' said McCue.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons Wednesday, opposition leader William
Hague cited Collins's death as further evidence that prisoner
releases must be suspended until both Irish republican and British
loyalist paramilitary groups end their beatings, shootings, and
expulsions of dissidents and petty criminals. But a motion calling
for a suspension of releases was easily defeated 343-141.
</P>
<P>
   Hague and others say the vigilante violence used by paramilitary
groups to control their neighborhoods and supplant the police makes
a mockery of the cease-fires the various groups claim to be
observing. But Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected calls to suspend
the releases, saying they are an integral part of last April's
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that this is . . . an imperfect process and an
imperfect peace. But it is better than no process and no peace at
all,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 44, the father of four children, was found dead on an
isolated road in his hometown of Newry, 35 miles south of Belfast.
Police said he suffered extensive head injuries, but they were
unsure whether he was run down on purpose or had been slain earlier
and dumped on the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   McCue said Collins regularly took early-morning walks because of
a heart condition. He was adamant that a car was used as Collins's
killers could engage in semantic gymnastics and claim the
cease-fire was not violated by his murder.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate suspicion fell on Collins's former comrades in the
IRA. In 1985, he broke with the IRA, initially confessing to
involvement in five murders and naming 50 associates for police
before recanting and avoiding prison. While the IRA usually
executes informers, Collins escaped that fate because the IRA had
issued an amnesty for so-called ``supergrass'' informers who
recanted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some former comrades never forgave him, especially after
his 1997 book ``Killing Rage'' exposed the venal reality behind the
romantic idealism of the IRA. His parents' home, which he was
refurbishing, was burned down last year and his home was daubed
with graffiti denouncing him as a traitor just last week.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Boston Globe last year, Collins said
that while he did not believe the IRA would order his death because
of his high profile, there were many individuals in the IRA who
harassed him and wanted to kill him. He said an IRA man was driving
the car that knocked him down two years ago, breaking his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he testified against Thomas ``Slab'' Murphy, who had
sued the Sunday Times of London for libel when it named him as the
IRA's chief of staff. Collins backed the newspaper, and Murphy lost
the suit, was humiliated, and was forced to resign as the IRA's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   While it is possible that dissident IRA members killed him at a
sensitive time in the peace process to stir up trouble, detectives
say Collins was most at risk from IRA members in Newry who resent
that he turned on them and denounced them in his book and in
various media accounts as gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on BBC radio on Friday, Collins made
new enemies when he said the IRA's most recent recruits were
behaving like gangsters, terrorizing their own community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that the volunteers of the republican
movement have descended to such an awful level,'' he said.

BUSH TOUTS EDUCATION, TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, acting on expensive
promises he made on the campaign trail, laid out a legislative
agenda Wednesday calling for more than $2 billion in tax cuts and
more funding for public schools, but some lawmakers said they doubt
there is enough money to pay for his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the State address, Bush also acknowledged that
national spotlight is focused on the Texas Capitol because of the
unending speculation about his presidential aspirations. But he
encouraged legislators to use it to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't ask for it _ but it is here anyway. And we can
either view it as a distraction or seize it as an opportunity to
show the world what limited and constructive government looks
like,'' Bush told a joint session of the state House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He is weighing running for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000 and is expected to make a decision by May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big answer to the big questions is I really don't know
yet,'' Bush told the packed House chamber about the possible
national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he did have some answers about his plans for the legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   His goals include a $2 billion school property tax cut; an
additional $1 billion in funding for public schools; elimination of
the sales tax on diapers, over-the-counter medicines and the
Internet; a research and development tax credit; and a tax break
for some small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also will push for a school voucher pilot program that
would allow some children in low-performing schools to transfer to
private schools at taxpayer expense, and a law requiring parental
consent for teen-age abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few months are the last time this great body will
meet during this century,'' Bush said. ``We have an opportunity to
rise to the challenge and continue to make this state second to
none _ a place that is open, educated and united in our
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to use an estimated $5.6 billion budget surplus to pay
for his tax cuts and spending increases, including $1 billion for
school districts to use at their discretion.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Republican governor, who won re-election with 69
percent of the vote, received an enthusiastic welcome from
legislators, but not everyone was ready to jump on the Bush
bandwagon with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican senator said it would be difficult to
accomplish all the governor's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, chairman of the budget-writing Senate Finance
Committee, said it would be hard to pay for Bush's tax cuts and
spending proposals with the less-than-expected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the budget surplus was pegged at $6.3 billion. When
the lower estimate came out earlier this month, Bush said he may
have to trim his proposals, but there was no hint Wednesday that he
did. He will outline specifics of his budget proposals later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen his full layout and full proposals, but all I
can just say is I think it's going to be difficult,'' said Ratliff,
who is from Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several Democratic senators gathered after the speech
to voice their concern about the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is simple: Kids first, cuts second,'' said Sen.
Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. ``We believe, in our party, the
business of this state is kids, and particularly kids' education.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic senators, including Judith Zaffirini of Laredo
and Carlos Truan of Corpus Christi, said they want to focus first
on fully funding educational needs, including pay raises for
teachers, before giving tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rather rare display of public criticism of Bush, though
the senators avoided any personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, said his constituents were
telling him: ``Please take care of our critical needs. Don't play
politics with modest tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants tax cuts,'' Zaffirini said. ``But at the very
same time, all of us before you today, say first education, first
health and human services, first meet the needs of all of the
people who need are services and let us put our money where our
mouths are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us demonstrate our compassion, our understanding and our
interest doing our best job for the families of our great state,''
she added, alluding to Bush calling himself a ``compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, said he put education above
all other issues, but he believes a ``substantial'' tax cut still
is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think that is within the range of reality,'' Perry
said of the $2 billion figure.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has sometimes expressed
discomfort with the relentless speculation over whether he will run
for president in 2000, brought the matter up himself Wednesday in
his State of the State address, saying legislators should seize
this ``national spotlight'' to teach Washington lawmakers a thing
or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been asked about it, you have been asked about it,''
Bush told the legislators. ``You didn't ask for it, but it is here
anyway. And we can either view it as a distraction or seize it as
an opportunity to show the world what limited and constructive
government looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31 members of the state Senate, which the Republicans
control by one vote, walked across the Capitol to join the 150
members of the Texas House of Representatives, where the Democrats
have an eight-vote majority, and heard Bush give his third State of
the State address _ the last he will give before the presidential
election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Widely regarded as the front-runner in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination next year, the governor has said
he will not announce whether he will run until March or April, when
he will either establish an exploratory committee, say he is
definitely in the race or take himself out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has played host in recent weeks to a stream of potential
fund-raisers and presidential advisers _ to help him make up his
mind, he has said _ and political professionals in several crucial
states have said he has asked them not to commit to another
Republican candidate until he makes his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me, will I or won't I?'' Bush said in his
speech Wednesday. ``The big answer to the question is, I really
don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, Texas could teach Washington some
lessons in how to behave with bipartisan collegiality and fiscal
responsibility. ``The national spotlight gives us a chance to show
how well limited government works,'' Bush said. ``And together, we
can show Washington how to handle a budget surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Although estimates of the size of the Texas budget surplus have
shrunk from $6.3 billion to $5.6 billion since the governor made
campaign promises based on the higher figure last year, the
proposals he outlined Wednesday included almost everything that he
promised in last year's campaign. He won a second term with 69
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believed there was still enough money to
significantly raise state spending on public education and to cut
taxes, even the $2 billion property tax cut that he had campaigned
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``During times of plenty we must not commit our state to
programs we cannot afford in the future,'' he said. ``We must meet
basic needs, dedicate the lion's share of new money to public
schools, then send money back to the hands who earned it, the
taxpayers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some legislators in his own party, including the veteran
state Sen. Bill Ratliff, a Republican, expressed skepticism that
Texas would be able to accommodate all of the governor's education
proposals and his proposed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic leaders, in a news conference after Bush's
speech, said they would oppose any tax cuts until all of the
state's other needs were met. ``The message is simple,'' said Sen.
Eliot Shapleigh. ``Kids first, cuts second.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, much of the debate in the remaining 125 days of
this legislative session _ Texas lawmakers meet for only 140 days
every other year, another thing that Bush said is a lesson to
Washington _ will be over whether there is enough money for both
education increases and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   After a very successful first legislative session in 1995, the
governor came back in 1997 with a proposal to cut state property
taxes by $3 billion. In what many viewed as a chastening setback
for Bush, legislators trimmed his proposed cut to $1 billion. So it
was a surprise to some on Wednesday that he pushed for the full $2
billion property tax cut that he had promised in last year's
campaign, especially since the lower state surplus projections now
gave him ample political cover to propose a more modest cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Wednesday also proposed eliminating sales taxes on
diapers, over-the-counter medicines and access to the Internet, a
small-business tax cut ``to provide relief to the small
entrepreneur,'' and a research-and-development tax cut to encourage
further high-tech investment in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing a theme from his first administration, the governor
said he would support legislation to end social, or automatic,
promotion in most cases in Texas public schools. He also said he
wanted to double the amount of state money for bond programs to
build new schools, begin a pilot program for school vouchers ``to
see if it works,'' and send $1 billion of state money to local
school districts to pay for teacher raises, new hires and smaller
class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, Bush asked legislators to approve financing for
more case workers in child protection programs, to lower the
state's legal blood-alcohol limit to eight-tenths of 1 percent, to
reduce ``frivolous lawsuits'' that might result from year 2000
computer problems, to insure parental notification of abortions for
minors and to continue to reduce the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spotlight is on us,'' Bush said. ``Let us show Texas knows
how to fund our priorities, balance our budget and cut taxes.''

   Trust a Baldwin to know what brotherhood means, even though it's
professional rather than genetic.  &UR; Billy Baldwin &LR;  has come to
 &UR; Sean Penn &LR; 's defense in a volleyball game of accusations of greed
and selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that  &UR; Penn &LR;  had refused to attend a ``Thin Red
Line'' screening in Houston because 20th Century Fox wouldn't pay
for a private jet to get him there,  &UR; Bernard Weinraub &LR;  of the New
York Times wrote ``Dead Man Whining,'' a story in which Penn was
likened to spoiled actors who insist that studios provide for such
perks as scented candles and personal trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Weinraub quoted Fox executives who were unhappy about the amount
of publicity Penn had given the movie _ ``He gave us two hours
after two weeks of negotiation'' _ and quoted from a letter the
actor had written to the studio, with copies to  &UR; Rupert &LR; 
 &UR; Murdoch &LR; , God Almighty and others: ``I therefore requested that Mr.
Murdoch's gigantic corporation might be so generous (with the money
they've earned exploiting the pain and suffering of myself and my
peers in their tabloids) as to supply me with a private jet to
travel to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Baldwin sent a letter to the editors of the New York
Times and distributed it to other members of the media. Weinraub's
column, he wrote, was ``an extremely weak attempt to define Sean as
a whining, conventional studio movie star and perk pig.'' Penn is
``the anti-Tom,'' wrote Baldwin (referring to movie stars  &UR; Tom
Hanks &LR;  and  &UR; Tom Cruise &LR; ), whose career ``is a road map for how not
to sell out to commercial studio interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times won't print the letter because the newspaper's policy
prevents it from using letters that mention reporters by name.
Baldwin refused the option of editing out Weinraub's name, that
paper said.

POPE TELLS 100,000 THAT DEATH PENALTY IS `CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Wis.)   (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Preaching consistency in moral values, Pope John
Paul II urged American Catholics Wednesday to extend the crusade to
protect human life to include murderers on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who are
unconditionally pro-life,'' the pope preached to 100,000 people in
the Trans World Sports Dome. ``Modern society has the means of
protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the
chance to reform.'' He called the death penalty ``cruel and
unnecessary,'' and said it was so ``even in the case of someone who
has done great evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has often urged an end to the death penalty, but
Wednesday's was the most explicit statement against capital
punishment he has made in the United States. In Missouri, which
executed a convicted murderer 12 days before the pope arrived and
delayed the execution of another, scheduled for Wednesday, until
after the pope returns to Rome, the pope's uncompromising message
had an uneasy resonance. Many American Catholics support the death
penalty. And even at Wednesday's Mass, some followers expressed
deep reverence for the pope _ and disagreement with his teachings
on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here because I really believe. I am a believing Catholic
and I love this pope,'' Araminta Rincon, a translator who arrived
at the dome at 3 a.m. from Green Bay, Wis., explained. But she,
like others, said she also believed in the death penalty. ``In some
ways, it's very sad. But there is no other way _some people are
just very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This 30-hour stop is the 78-year-old pope's fifth pastoral visit
to the United States, and once again, the pope finds himself
confronting one of the chief frustrations of his papacy: Many
American Catholics display a stubborn independence from Vatican
teaching. The pope, who stopped in St. Louis after an episcopal
meeting in Mexico to instruct Americans about their responsibility
to the world in the new millennium, also had to remind Catholics to
heed the basic tenets of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, the pope mentioned some of the moral issues which
divide Americans, and also many Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of God's gift of life
and love?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting St. Louis, the pope chose a metropolitan area that
is close to 55 percent Catholic. But his message was also aimed at
the nation at large, and before leaving St. Louis he held an
evening prayer service at the St. Louis Cathedral for about 2,000
people, including Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., and their wives.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told his audience that as the only surviving
superpower, the United States was a model for the rest of the
world. ``Radical change in world politics leaves America with a
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he preached.
``From salvation history we learn that power is responsibility: It
is service, not privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, who was the first pope to apologize openly for the
failure of many Catholics to resist the Nazi policy of
exterminating Jews during World War II, has tried to make
ecumenicism and reconciliation with the Jews a hallmark of his
papacy. A Jewish rabbi, Robert Jacobs, executive vice-president of
the St. Louis rabbinical association, gave a reading about a
prophecy of the renewal of Zion _ Isaiah 35:1:6 _ at the vesper
service, giving the opening in Hebrew. The pope has visited
synagogues, and prayed with rabbis at interfaith services, but this
was the first time a rabbi had given a reading at a Catholic
service officiated by the pope.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning Mass, the pope asked his audience to ``put an end
to every form of racism, a plague which your bishops have called
one of the most persistent and destructive evils on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, at a youth rally of 20,000, the pope discussed
the less-privileged side of American society, decrying the
abandonment of the homeless, the proliferation of urban gangs,
sexual abuse and drugs, and implored his young audience to break
free of the secular society that surrounds them. ``Do not listen to
those who encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility, to put
yourselves first,'' the pope said. ``Do not listen to those who
tell you that chastity is passe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ailing pope, whose voice is slurred as the result of
Parkinson's disease, was at times difficult to understand. In both
sports arenas, giant screens included captioned text of his
remarks. But he seemed buoyed by the wild enthusiasm of his
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tuesday's rock-concert-style rally, the pope was
presented with a hockey stick. As he rose from his armchair to
leave the podium, he briefly lowered his staff and used it to mime
the motion of a hockey pass _ winning roars of laughter and
applause.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the stadium, the fervor at times melted away. Though
there were some areas where the crowds were six people deep, other
sidewalks along his parade route Wednesday were empty, and the huge
crowds that had been anticipated in the center of town did not
materialize. Security was extremely tight _ acolytes who assisted
the pope as he celebrated Mass wore security badges over their
robes _ but security restrictions and traffic warnings were only
partly the reason for the thin crowds outside the events.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in the United States are less demonstrative than in
many poorer countries. ``We thought there would be 100,000 inside
and another 100,000 outside,'' Craig Rhodes, a St. Louis police
officer, said as he stared at an empty street where the
``popemobile'' had been expected to pass. ``We got the barricades
up but there is nobody there.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, however, the pope's message struck home with some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was for the death penalty,'' said John Magee, 34,
a branch manager of an electrical-supply company who attended the
Mass. ``I always thought pro-life was about abortion, not the death
penalty. I may change my mind.''

DEBATE COULD DELAY 2000 CENSUS, LAWMAKERS SAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 2000 Census could be postponed by court fights
and funding shortfalls if the Clinton administration insists on
counting Americans in two different ways, two influential
Republicans warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureau's decision to seek a two-track approach ensures
that the 2000 Census will be delayed into the next millennium,''
said Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican who threatened
to block federal funds to the agency if it tries to use statistical
sampling, in addition to a traditional headcount.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Dan Miller, a Florida Republican who chairs the
House census subcommittee, told the US Conference of Mayors annual
meeting ``we may not even have a census'' in 2000, because the GOP
will challenge in court any White House attempt to produce one set
of census numbers for apportioning congressional seats and another
for redrawing local legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the Supreme Court ruled the Census Bureau cannot use
statistical sampling, or estimating, to count the US population for
purposes of apportionment. The 5-4 decision, written by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, suggested sampling could be used and perhaps
might be required to get accurate population figures for state
redistricting and distributing $180 billion in federal funds across
the nation each year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said no determination has been made on
how to conduct the 2000 Census in the wake of the decision, but
they have not abandoned their sampling plan. Indeed, they are
leaning toward a census strategy that would produce two sets of
population numbers _ one for apportionment and another for
redistricting and dividing federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Census Bureau is proceeding today to finalize its plan
consistent with the Supreme Court, and we will follow that plan
unless we are directed by law or the Congress not to,'' said Robert
Shapiro, the Commerce Department's undersecretary in charge of the
Census Bureau. ``We will have a census, and it will be
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution authorizes Congress to direct an ``actual
enumeration'' of the American public every 10 years for
apportionment. Described often as the government's largest
peacetime mobilization, the next census is scheduled to be
conducted from April 1, 2000, to Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republican threats to block funds for the Census Bureau were met
Wednesday by Democrats with warnings of their own. Representative
Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who is the ranking member on
the House census subcommittee, told the mayors that President
Clinton would veto the appropriations bill that funds the Commerce,
State and Justice departments if census funds were restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moral issue, it's a civil rights issue,'' said Maloney,
citing government figures that the census missed 8.4 million people
in 1990. ``If the Republican majority comes forth and puts language
in a bill that tries to stop professionals in the Census Bureau
from doing their job, President Clinton has a lot of ink in his
veto pen, and he will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been in favor of sampling because it is
considered the best way to correct the Census Bureau's chronic
decennial undercount of hard-to-find minorities and the urban poor
_ groups that tend to fall politically into the Democratic column.
Republicans oppose sampling because it could reapportion or
redistrict them out of their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders hailed the Supreme Court decision as the
final word on sampling and are furious the Clinton administration
is looking for what they say are loopholes to try to keep it alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely going to be a disaster for the country if we
have a two-number census: one number that is going to be trusted by
the Supreme Court and one number that President Clinton says `trust
me to manipulate,''' Miller told the mayors, a group with serious
concerns about accurate census counts, particularly as to how they
are used to divide federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Miller suggested Congress might be able to accommodate cities'
financial concerns about an undercount, but he was adamant that
Republicans would fight Democrats' attempts to ``play games'' and
adjust the census for political redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be fought up to the Supreme Court through next
year, and we may not even have a census if they try to do that,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Republicans were committed to an accurate census and
would demonstrate that by supporting his initiative to hire an
additional 100,000 enumerators for hard-to-count areas, add $300
million to the Census Bureau's $100 million advertising budget for
2000, and conduct a second mailing of census forms to reach some 19
million more people.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, who was involved in the 1990 Census as a city
councilwoman in New York, said experience shows that money is
wasted on hiring more census takers and doing more advertising to
try to reach people who, for a variety of reasons, don't want to be
counted. ``The people who oppose the use of modern scientific
methods in the census want to make sure millions of people missed
in the census are left out forever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Census is expected to cost between $4 billion and $6
billion, a figure the Clinton administration says probably would
climb if it conducts a two-number census. Gregg, chairman of the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Census Bureau,
said he would oppose providing any more funds for sampling, and he
urged the White House to stop ``disregarding'' the Supreme Court
decision.

COMPAQ REPORTS RECORD 4TH-QUARTER SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter
results reached a record and surpassed Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq reported earnings of $758 million, or 43 cents a diluted
share, up 14 percent from $667 million, or 42 cents a share, in the
period a year earlier. Per-share figures reflect an increase in the
number of shares outstanding. Analysts expected Compaq to earn 37
cents a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings. Revenue rose 48 percent, to $10.86 billion, from $7.32
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were not impressed. Shares of Compaq fell $1.75,
to $47.50. They rose 5.5 percent on Tuesday, to $49.25, when the
company announced that it planned a public offering of a minority
stake in Alta Vista, its World Wide Web search engine, which was
acquired last year with the $9 billion purchase of Digital
Equipment Corp. Although Alta Vista's value has been hidden in
Compaq's share price, analysts said it could be worth $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said Wednesday that it had successfully integrated
Digital and that it was gaining market share from key competitors.
Compaq's acquisition of Digital, along with the earlier purchase of
Tandem Computers Inc., has transformed the company from the world's
largest maker of personal computers to a broad spectrum computer
systems manufacturer, second in size only to IBM. Compaq is cutting
its work force by 20 percent in the integration with Digital and
said it had made 13,000 of the 17,000 planned cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that although the company beat estimates, much of
the gain came from lower costs and a lower tax rate. Tax credits
from the Digital acquisition cut the company's tax rate to about 26
percent from its usual 32 percent, said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst
with Warburg Dillon Read. Without the credits, Compaq would have
earned 38 cents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, analysts said, Compaq still faces competitive issues.
The company's costs are still higher, and growth still slower than
those of Dell Computer Corp., which builds each computer to order
and sells directly to customers rather than through dealers. Compaq
struggled with an inventory glut last year as it moved to adopt a
build-to-order system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is on the road to recovery, and they seem to be
executing the integration of Digital on schedule,'' Wolf said.
``That said, I'm still concerned with one issue: Compaq, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard still fulfill a majority of their orders through
the dealer channel and that is an addition to cost that Dell
doesn't incur.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Mason, Compaq's chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview, ``We had a great Christmastime with the
consumer, with 100-percent sales growth out of the retail
channel.'' Sales of Digital's high-end computer systems and
services also showed strong growth in the quarter, he said. ``We
took a lot of market share in the quarter; I don't know yet from
whom.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said sales by its dealers and distributors grew 43
percent compared with those in the quarter a year earlier, a growth
rate it contended was three times the industry average. Mason said
North American sales grew by 53 percent, Europe by 46 percent,
Japan by 51 percent, and Latin America by 8 percent. Sales declined
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Compaq reported a loss of $2.74 billion, compared
with a profit of $1.86 billion, or $1.19 a diluted share, in 1997.
Second-quarter 1998 earnings included charges of $3.63 billion
related to the Digital acquisition. Revenue rose 27 percent, to
$31.17 billion, from $24.58 million. &QL;

SENATE GOP SAYS IT HAS THE VOTES TO CALL WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
WASHINGTON _ Suddenly strengthening their resolve, Senate
Republicans announced Tuesday that they had enough votes to depose
witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment trial, provoking
outrage from Democrats and a White House threat to retaliate by
dragging the trial on for weeks with legal counter-maneuvers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's clearly been a dramatic change in the last 12 hours,''
said Senator Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``This trial is going the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm went so far as to predict that witnesses _ including
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky _ would testify on the
Senate floor, although that would require another majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and other Republicans also predicted that some Democrats
would break ranks to vote in favor of deposing witnesses. That vote
will take place Wednesday, along with a vote to dismiss the
charges, which is expected to fail along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the trial to witness depositions throws a potentially
explosive element into the already volatile Senate proceedings. The
Senate is on unmapped ground, feeling its way through an
extraordinary political, historical and constitutional thicket.
Although the ultimate outcome _ a vote to acquit _ remains in no
real doubt, how the Senate gets there very much is.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors insisted that seeing witnesses live _ to
clarify such conflicts in testimony as whether or not Clinton lied
to his aides to influence their grand jury testimony or whether
Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan got Lewinsky a job in return for a
false affidavit _ is essential. House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., said there is a huge difference between reading a ``cold
transcript'' and seeing a witness testify in person.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors also included a request that Clinton answer
questions under oath. On Monday, Senate Republicans forwarded 10
questions to Clinton, which the White House refused to answer, but
Republican senators said they would not attempt to compel Clinton
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lawyer David Kendall ridiculed the House prosecutors'
demand for witnesses, quoting at length their comments during their
Judiciary Committee hearings that hearing live witnesses was
unnecessary, given the thousands of pages of testimony collected by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall warned that if any witnesses are called, ``the genie is
out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   He said White House lawyers would demand extensive ``discovery''
or investigation of thousands of pages of documents not yet
released by the House to determine which or how many witnesses to
call for Clinton's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proceeding, I need not remind you _ I know everyone
recognizes its gravity _ to remove the president of the United
States. You have got to give us _ and I believe you will _ the
discovery that will enable us to represent the president
adequately, competently and effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dismissed the threat, saying the Senate has full
control over whom to depose, while at the same time promising
fairness to the White House. A spokesman for Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said the depositions could be over as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Monday, GOP ranks appeared to be fracturing over the
witness issue, with several Republicans saying they were not sure
they needed to hear more testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday as House prosecutors and White House lawyers argued
the case, Republicans announced _ and Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., agreed _ that they have at least 51 votes to depose
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those soft Republicans have turned hard,'' Daschle
said, referring to Republicans who had been wavering.
</P>
<P>
   The tide turned when the House prosecutors narrowed their list
of potential witnesses from as many as 15 to what House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called ``a pitiful three'':
Lewinsky, Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors left Oval Office secretary Betty Currie off
the list, presumably because she frequently testified that she did
not feel Clinton was threatening her when he asked her a series of
questions about her knowledge of the affair and that she believed
it was Lewinsky who suggested to her that she hide gifts from
Clinton under her bed.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told the Senate that prosecutors do not need witnesses to
prove their case. ``Witnesses help you,'' Hyde told the Senate.
``They won't help me. I know the record.''
</P>
<P>
   sub graf: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``There's been a change since they came in with three,'' said
Senator John Chafee, R-R.I. As far as he knew, Chafee said, none of
the 55 Senate Republicans would vote against deposing witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were furious. ``It's outrageous,'' said Senator Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md. He said House prosecutors insisted they did not
need to judge the credibility of witnesses during the Judiciary
Committee hearings, but now they are insisting that it is vital for
the Senate to judge their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to that, I was asking myself, `Why didn't you ask
about the credibility of witnesses before sending the articles of
impeachment to the Senate?''' Sarbanes said.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments from the defense and prosecution on witnesses
raged on the Senate floor through the afternoon before the Senate
closed its doors to the public to discuss the issue in secrecy.
Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin made another effort to open the
deliberations _ supported by California Democrats Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer _ but failed again, with some senators crossing
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutor James Rogan, R-Glendale, arguing to call
Blumenthal as a witness, clearly scored points on the GOP side of
the aisle when he read from Blumenthal's grand jury testimony.
Republicans looked at each other wide-eyed and nearly broke into
guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan quoted Blumenthal's testimony that he had spoken to
Hillary Rodham Clinton when the scandal first broke in the press,
and that she said her husband was being attacked for political
motives, and that he ``ministers to troubled people all the time,
and he does so out of religious conviction and personal
temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal then told Clinton, referring to Lewinsky, ``I
understand that you want to minister to troubled people. ...
However, you're president, and these troubled people can just get
you in incredible messes. You have to cut yourself off from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Clinton replied, ``It's very difficult for me to
do that, given how I am. I want to help people,'' going on to say
he felt like a character in a novel who was being victimized by a
stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the White House was ``bluffing'' with its threat of
extending the trial indefinitely and was trying to ``blackmail''
Republicans into not calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee dismissed Democratic warnings of a long trial, saying the
Senate could wrap up the depositions by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had just the opposite reaction, saying that absolutely
nothing new could be learned from further testimony and ridiculing
House prosecutors' insistence that the Senate must ``look into the
eyes'' of witnesses to determine their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said his front-row seat allowed him to look into
witnesses' eyes, but that few others had such a choice view. ``And
come to think of it, that itself is going to take a lot of time
because if each one of us looks into the eyes _ I expect five
minutes for looking at eyes times 100 _ you're talking about a lot
of eye-looking there.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said witnesses could extend the trial to March or
April. And she said that nothing she has heard so far has amounted
to strong evidence warranting conviction and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling there is that there is so much equivocal evidence,
so much that's done by inference, that the evidence contained in
the record doesn't meet the burden of proof,'' Feinstein said.
``And I don't think witnesses will change that.''

REPUBLICANS AGAIN DEFY PUBLIC MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By Marc Sandalow  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
WASHINGTON _ Republicans cannot help but feel snakebit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year to the day after President Clinton delivered his
indignant, finger-waving declaration _ ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' _ Republicans were mired
in an unpopular impeachment proceeding while Clinton was in St.
Louis meeting with the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Republicans are poised to compound their public
relations problem by rejecting a motion to drop the charges and
then approving a motion to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It is without apology that Republicans have rebuffed Democratic
efforts to bring the impeachment proceedings to a quick conclusion.
Driven in part by a political calculation that Americans will not
hold it against them in the 2000 elections, and in part by an
unwavering belief that Clinton's behavior should not escape
punishment, Senate and House Republicans have at least temporarily
formed a united front to push forward with the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been as swift as decency would allow us,''
Representative Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Tuesday on the Senate
floor. ``The threat of prolonged hearings is supposed to make us
tremble. It doesn't me. But different strokes for different
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican's insistence that the trial go on has earned them
both ridicule and scorn.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John Kerry, D-Mass., compared the Republicans to Don
Quixote without a noble cause, saying they are ``proceeding on a
track that seems separate from reality.'' Senator Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., said the GOP is motivated, in part, by a desire to
``humiliate the president.'' Polls show that two-thirds of
Americans want the charges dismissed. Public attitudes toward the
party are at a historic low. And talk show hosts Jay Leno and David
Letterman routinely rib Republicans as prudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question we worry that people won't understand
what we are doing,'' said Cliff May, communications director for
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we figure if we don't stand up for the Constitution and
the rule of law _ the principle that no one is above the law _
these ideas are just not going to be defended,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument that has been made repeatedly both by true
believers that Clinton is evil and by wavering Republicans who
appear pained at having to participate in the impeachment
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know _ oh, do I know _ what an annoyance we are in the bosom
of this great body,'' Hyde told senators over the weekend. ``But
we're a constitutional annoyance, and I remind you of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hyde appeared genuinely hurt by the serious
consideration given to dismissing the case even before votes can be
taken on the articles themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this whole sad, sad, drama will end; we will
never get it behind us until you vote up or down on the articles,''
Hyde said, seeming to understand that the vote will not turn out
the way he would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you do, however you vote, we'll all collect our
papers, bow from the waist, thank you for your courtesy and leave,
and go gently into the night,'' Hyde said with a touch of mock
melodrama. ``But let us finish our job.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a deep sense among many Republicans in the Senate as
well as in the House that duty binds them to proceed. And they are
already beginning to argue that even when Clinton triumphs, their
work will not have been in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost at that point,'' May said. ``We have done our
duty. And maybe at some point people will say, `You know, they did
their duty, and the other guys participated in Clinton's lies.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't lose based on the outcome (of the vote),'' May added.
``If we follow the Constitution, if there is an impeachment, a
trial and witnesses, I don't think we count that as a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are well aware of the immediate political costs.
</P>
<P>
   It frustrates them to no end that Clinton's dishonesty about an
affair with a 22-year-old intern contributed to the loss of
Republican seats in the Congress, the departure of Representatives
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Bob Livingston, R-La., and the highest
approval ratings of Clinton's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can Republicans do? The Constitution says they have to do
this,'' said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican consultant and
pollster. ``Of course they'd rather not be doing this. And I wish
chocolate wasn't fattening and Brussels sprouts were.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one asked for this,'' she added. ``I can't think of a
single Republican senator who is happy this is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are gambling that the public's frustration over the
impeachment proceedings will quickly disappear. The next election
is nearly two years away, and they presume that the public will
have long forgotten about whether the impeachment proceedings
lasted three weeks or six.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some have argued that there might be a greater danger
in antagonizing their base by dropping their quest against Clinton.
Elections are decided by moderates who make up the vast majority of
the electorate. But many months before an election, political
strength is often gained by appealing not to moderates but to the
true believers on the ideological extreme _ the ones most willing
to make campaign contributions.

PAC BELL DEFENDS SALES TACTICS BEFORE STATE REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SOLOMON  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Bell, defending itself against charges
of aggressive marketing practices, will present evidence Wednesday
that it fired four service representatives for ``unethical sales
behavior'' last year and encourages employees to report misleading
sales tactics to supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marks the fifth day of hearings at the state Public
Utilities Commission to determine whether Pac Bell engaged in
misleading and deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Gilley, vice president for Pac Bell's consumer markets
group, will testify Wednesday about the company's firing of the
unethical reps.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have accused Pac Bell of forcing its service
representatives to sell add-on phone features, such as Caller ID
and Call Waiting, to customers regardless of whether they want or
can afford the products.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman Paul Cohen said the company has not engaged
in any illegal behavior. ``This trial is looking exclusively at
whether we violated PUC guidelines, not whether we are allowed to
sell,'' Cohen said. ``The truth is, we haven't broken any laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a Pac Bell official told the PUC that service reps are
required to offer products on every call but denied that they are
punished for failing to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service representatives are not required to sell, only
offer,'' said Jewel Stoddard, director of Pac Bell's consumer
markets group.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard disputed claims made by consumer groups and service
representatives that Pac Bell requires reps to sell products on
every call.
</P>
<P>
   While service reps do get rewards _ such as gift certificates
and money _ for making sales, their performance evaluations and
base pay are based on the number of offers they make, not the
number of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Service reps must offer products to customers on at least 75
percent of the calls they handle to meet Pac Bell's performance
standards, according to Pac Bell documents.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard also defended the names of Pac Bell's phone packages.
Consumer groups have accused Pac Bell of trying to mislead
customers by giving phone-service packages misleading names such as
``The Basics'' and ``The Essentials.''
</P>
<P>
   Both phone packages include lots of extras _ such as Caller ID,
Call Waiting and other services _ which are not basic or essential,
the groups argue.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard said the official names of the packages _ ``Basics
Saver Pack'' and ``Essentials Saver Pack'' _ were included in a
filing Pac Bell made to state regulators in 1996 and were not
challenged. She added that the official names are not misleading
because they indicate something other than basic phone service.
</P>
<P>
   However, a confidential market research report that Pac Bell
commissioned in 1997 concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Basics seems to put people at ease and suggest that the
services included in the package are important to have; not
frivolous or luxuries. ... It sounds practical and affordable. This
is perhaps the greatest strength of the name: counteracting the
perception that customers who buy a package will end up paying for
a lot of services they don't need or use.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by Nehrig Marketing of St. Louis, was
among the documents submitted to the PUC by Pac Bell critics.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard testified Tuesday that she knows of no customers who
are unhappy with Pac Bell's marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the outrage? There is none,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But testimony submitted by consumer groups seemed to undercut
Stoddard.
</P>
<P>
   The Utility Consumers Action Network, a consumer group in San
Diego, provided complaints from customers who said they were
``harassed'' by Pac Bell telemarketers. One customer who filed a
complaint with the PUC said he arrived home to find two Caller ID
boxes that he never ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's marketing practices also came up at a hearing state
Senate hearing on telecommunications Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing before the state Senate Energy, Utilities and
Communications Committee, a Pac Bell official acknowledged that the
company has started sending Caller ID boxes to new customers _ even
those who say they don't want the service.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina Del Rey, chairman of the
committee, said she recently received one of those boxes at home
after ordering new phone service and declining Caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Evans, Pac Bell's executive director for regulatory
affairs, said the boxes are being sent to some customers ``to
promote what we feel is a valuable service.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers who don't want Caller ID, which costs $6.50 per month,
can send the boxes back to Pac Bell at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and other senators said Pac Bell is placing an unfair
burden on customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen on Tuesday proposed a five-day ``cooling off period,''
during which Pac Bell could not offer additional services to new
customers.

 `THE WOMEN': PIT VIPERS OF THE '30s, AND ECHOES OF TODAY 
 (rk) 
 By   PETER MARKS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What plays in the nation's capital? Why,
infidelity, innuendo and gossip, of course _ and not just as
aspects of the hit melodrama now running on (and off) the floor of
the U.S. Senate. At the estimable Arena Stage, director Kyle
Donnelly has cannily revived ``The Women,'' Clare Boothe Luce's
blood-drawing comedy, in a tart and snappy production that seems
eerily well suited to these tawdry, scandalmongering times.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1936 play, Luce had it in for pampered, preening
Manhattan socialites, a malicious pack of leisure-class urban
guerrillas who spend their days having their nails done and their
nights dreaming of sinking them into one another's flesh. That the
ambitious Luce would herself eventually be elected to Congress (as
a Connecticut Republican) adds to the satisfying sense of parallel
back-stabbing worlds. You have only to turn on CNN or C-Span these
days to experience exactly the kind of gladiatorial zeal that
animates Luce's brittle characters.
</P>
<P>
   The Arena's theater-in-the-round is a natural base of operations
for these coifed combatants. Surrounded by spectators on all four
sides and performing in what is essentially an oblong pit, the
women _ 40-odd characters played by 18 actresses _ are alligator
wrestlers in alligator shoes. There's no hiding from us in
Donnelly's clinically thought-out period production, except perhaps
in the Art Deco shower stall that rises ingeniously from the floor
of Thomas Lynch's enchanting cookie-cutter set. And thoroughly
apropos of this nasty little squall of a play, we're compelled by
the physical demands of the space to look down at all times on
these women and their predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Women'' also presents all sorts of predicaments for a
director. The soapy saga at the play's center, the tale of poor,
rich, deluded Mary, betrayed by the unseen husband whose name she
so proudly claims _ ``I'm Mrs. Stephen Haines!'' _ is incredibly
cloying. So much so, in fact, that actors (for men have portrayed
these women too) often feel as if they have no choice but to play
it all for camp.
</P>
<P>
   The unhappy wives and would-be wives who fill out Mary's world,
the cynics and gossips, vixens and lushes, pragmatists, naifs and
malcontents, are all the usual suspects, a gang one might just as
likely encounter on Cellblock H in a hard-boiled women's prison
movie. Such contempt for womanhood is harbored here (Mary's
daughter even expresses the wish to grow up to be a man) that it
takes an interpreter with an acute ear for irony to navigate the
tricky channel between scorn and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Donnelly knows what she's doing. She stages ``The
Women'' straight up, so that much of it becomes outright farce. The
desperate rivalries, the not-so-secret pleasure taken in others'
pain, the outlandish escapades and eccentric ancillary characters
now seem like the elements of a screwball comedy. It's impossible
to take Luce's sensibility seriously, but you can certainly
luxuriate in the dish. For if George Cukor's famous movie version
with Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Rosalind Russell emphasized
Mary's dreary domestic downfall, Donnelly's revival takes its cues
from the seat-of-the-pants antics of ``The Front Page.''
</P>
<P>
   The delicious game of choice here is dirty pool, a game that
everyone can play. For instance, a scene at a department store
perfume counter staffed by young women whose interest in a sale has
little to do with talcum powder turns the act of the retail come-on
into a decidedly earthier pursuit. When several of Luce's Manhattan
matrons wind up together in Reno, all there to obtain divorces from
their latest spouses, all pretense of gentrified delicacy
evaporates; infuriated by the revelations of their serial betrayals
of one another, the rich ladies go at it like guests of Jerry
Springer. Even the help gets into the act. In one of the
production's sharpest, funniest interludes, a maid played by the
terrific Elizabeth Pierotti floridly and brazenly re-enacts for a
co-worker both sides of her employers' teary argument over another
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tazewell, who designed the costumes for the Broadway
production of ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' makes a
hilarious spectacle of the dressing of all these birds of paradise
lost. This is a production whose subtext resides on the surface:
it's a gaudy, never-ending fashion show, and though the occasional
wig goes askew and a dress or two could stand another fitting, the
sartorial achievement borders on tour de force.
</P>
<P>
   The actresses themselves accessorize this production
excellently. Ellen Karas' level-headed, broken-hearted performance
never allows Mary to devolve into a pity part. Brigid Cleary is a
constant giggle as a baby maker who likes nothing less than the
sight of her own children. Stacey Leigh Ivey turns Crystal, the
villainess of the piece, into a great drawling, platinum pile of
trash, and Martha Hackett, Sarah Marshall, Nancy Robinette, Rosalie
Tenseth and Naomi Jacobson all tackle their supporting roles with
relish and Luce's repartee with crisp authority.
</P>
<P>
   If anything is absent in this version, it's the magnetism of a
star turn in any of the five or six marquee roles. What fun it
might be to see some knowing, all-star Broadway incarnation, with
the likes of, say, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Swoosie Kurtz,
Sigourney Weaver, Susan Sarandon or Stockard Channing. Donnelly's
production, after all, reveals that you can enjoy ``The Women''
without accepting its world view; the play's antique notions of the
rigid rules to which rich women were forced to conform is almost as
useful a comic window as the ones opened by Jane Austen. The
service Donnelly has performed is in elevating ``The Women'' to
something like a historical document, which makes it all the more
relevant for the Washington stage.

FEINGOLD   VOTE WITH GOP NO SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin
became the only Democrat Wednesday to join with Republicans in
keeping alive the impeachment trial of President Clinton, no
surprise was registered on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   If any Democrat might be expected to bolt from the party without
fear of possible consequences, it is a senator such as Feingold.
Wisconsin observers describe him as ``aggressively independent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always does what his conscience dictates,'' said Senator
John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has worked closely with
Feingold on campaign finance legislation. ``I was not astonished at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   A boyish-looking maverick, Feingold, 45, won reelection in
November without taking any unregulated ``soft money''
contributions that his campaign finance plan would have banned. The
Rhodes Scholar and Harvard Law School graduate showed his political
mettle when he was first elected to the Senate in 1992, at age 39.
Before that he was an attorney and was in the Wisconsin Senate from
1982 to 1992. He has a reputation in Wisconsin as a liberal but
also as a deficit hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold has long been known for his streaks of righteousness,
having once run campaign ads that included a tour of his closet,
just to show that there were no skeletons in it. He has boasted
that his net worth was only $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost an apolitical act,'' congressional scholar Thomas
Mann of the Brookings Institution said of Feingold's votes. ``He is
not strongly connected to his party. He comes out of the Wisconsin
progressive tradition, with strong feelings of right and wrong. He
does march to his own beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kettl, director of the LaFollette Institute of Public
Affairs at the University of Wisconsin, said the votes fit with
Feingold's carefully cultivated independent stance. While Feingold
is somewhat politically insulated because his reelection is nearly
six years away, Kettl said the votes ``wouldn't have surprised me
if his reelection was tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after casting votes against dismissal of the
impeachment charges and for the deposition of witnesses, Feingold
issued a three-page statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To dismiss this case would in appearance and in fact
improperly `short circuit' this trial,'' Feingold said. ``I simply
cannot say that the House managers cannot prevail regardless of
what witnesses might plausibly testify and regardless of what
persuasive arguments might be offered either by the managers or by
senators who support conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's votes were not entirely unexpected. On Saturday, he
joined with Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, to suggest
that separate votes be allowed on the perjury and obstruction of
justice charges, which was interpreted as suggesting he believed
there may be merit to one of the counts.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat, said
Feingold ``had some concern about Article II, on the obstruction of
justice,'' a view Feingold did not make in his statement. ``He
wanted to hear witnesses on that, and that is fair and reasonable,
and I certainly respect his right to dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seized upon Feingold's votes as proof that the
impeachment trial has not been entirely partisan. ``We have one
Democrat who was willing to stand up to his own caucus,'' said
Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican. ``Let me tell you, that
was a big-time thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Feingold stressed that his votes do not mean
that he would support convicting the president. ``It is my
inclination...to demand a very high standard of proof on this
question,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that witnesses have been called in every Senate
impeachment trial of a president or federal judge, Feingold said,
``It would call the fairness of the process into question were we
to deny the House managers the opportunity to depose at least those
witnesses that might shed light on the facts in a few key areas of
disagreements in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's votes are not likely to make him popular with Clinton
or the Democratic Party, but that would hardly be a first. When
Feingold last year rejected ``soft money'' raised by the national
party, some Democrats expressed concern that he was recklessly
costing the party a chance at retaining his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Democratic Party began running ``issue ads'' in
Wisconsin in an effort to help Feingold, the senator told the party
to ``get the hell out of my state with those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold triumphed in the end, beating Republican Representative
Mark D. Neumann by 50.6 to 48.4 percent, but Feingold has remained
at odds with his own party.

POPE OFFICIATES AT MOST-ATTENDED INDOOR MASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He came to the Americas on a revival crusade and
with a strong admonition to the world's lone remaining superpower
to redeem its sinful soul.
</P>
<P>
   While it's impossible so soon to tell the consequences of his
mission, it is hard to disagree that Pope John Paul II is one of
the most indefatigable salesmen in the history of the Roman
Catholic Church _ and not just because he occupies St. Peter's
throne.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has certainly seen its share of uninspiring,
introverted, even corrupt, pontiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But John Paul _ whether people disagree with him or not _ again
showed his talent as a pitchman during his six-day swing through
Mexico and United States, which ended Wednesday. No better
indicator was Wednesday's stirring Mass before 110,000 people at
the TWA Dome _ the biggest indoor Mass in US history.
</P>
<P>
   This latest journey helped to further cement the pope's intent
to make the church a ceaseless advocate for a ``culture of life''
that is in conflict with the ``culture of death'' the pontiff
believes has overtaken much of western society, particularly the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians must be the soul of this world,'' the pope declared
in the Mass he celebrated for 1 million people in Mexico City on
Sunday. ``They must fill the world with spirit, they must give it
life and they must cooperate in a building a new society motivated
by love and truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, many Catholics who attended events on the
tour seem to respect the pope's straightforward style _ finding it
refreshing in an age when many leaders base their message not on
conviction, but on the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's firmness and clarity was on display again Wednesday
when he harshly denounced what he portrayed as America's immoral
embrace of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in
the case of someone who has done a great evil,'' John Paul said in
Wednesday's festive Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation,
postponed an execution scheduled to take place during the pope's
visit here. On Tuesday, a papal spokesman called the postponement
``a mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope said that ``modern society has the means of protecting
itself without definitively denying criminals the chance to
reform'' and appealed for a ``consensus to end the death penalty,
which is both cruel and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called on Catholics to bring renewed respect to the
family ``as the primary and most vital foundation of society,''
invited disaffected Catholics back ``to the community of faith''
and termed racism ``one of the most persistent and destructive
evils of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning Liturgy was a monumental logistics challenge.
Hundreds of buses arriving from pickup points across the
metropolitan area begun unloading worshipers at 4 a.m., five and a
half hours before the pope arrived. More than 1,000 priests were
called on to dispense Holy Communion to the far corners of the vast
arena, which was temporarily converted into a cavernous cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pontiff also spoke at an ecumenical and
interfaith prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica St. Louis and
met with Vice President Al Gore at Lambert-St. Louis International
Airport before boarding his flight home to Rome. At the end of his
85th pilgrimmage, John Paul looked weary.
</P>
<P>
   But not even declining health could stop John Paul from
traveling to countries home to the world's second and third largest
Catholic populations _ Mexico and the United States, respectively _
to tell his flock of their responsibility to carry a message of
justice and piety into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of his trip was the blueprint he unveiled in
Mexico City in which he described the church's mission in the
Americas to build a more egalitarian future by ministering to poor
and rich alike.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said the pope's apostolic exhortation _ the first time
a pontiff has articulated a master plan for this part of the world
_ would give local parishes across the Americas a clear and
unifying purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Despite at times stern and pessimistic views of the world, John
Paul repeatedly expressed hope for the future, strongly believing
in human society's capacity for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``America, if you want peace, work for justice,'' John Paul said
during his last major speech Wednesday. ``If you want justice,
defend life. If want life, embrace the truth _ the truth revealed
by God.''

&HT;        MULTI-CITY GUN LAWSUIT NOT LIKELY, RENDELL SAYS AT U.S.
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS.
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 27, -- Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said
cities across the country are unlikely to file a joint lawsuit
against gun makers to recover the cost of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   After leading a closed-door meeting on gun violence Wednesday at
the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors, Rendell said differences in
state laws make a multi-city lawsuit too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be individual decisions by cities,''
Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cities may sue. Some may not sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who has threatened to sue the gun industry for more
than a year, called for cities to strengthen law enforcement,
negotiate with the gun industry and push for more federal
oversight. ``We are looking at every aspect of fighting this
problem,'' Rendell said. ``We need to fight this battle on
different fronts. We should not put all our eggs in the lawsuit
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chicago and New Orleans were the first two cities to
file lawsuits against the gun industry. Dade County Florida and
Bridgeport, Conn. just announced they have filed suit, and will
likely be followed by other major cities seeking compensation for
law enforcement and medical expenses related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said after the meeting that he was ``closer'' to a
decision on whether to file a lawsuit himself. But he would not say
which way he was leaning. He said he doesn't know when he will make
up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say a decision to sue gun manufacturers
would make it difficult for Rendell if he has aspirations of
holding a state office. Pennsylvania has the second highest
membership to the NRA, after California.
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell said he just wants to find the best way to curb gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a class-action tobacco suit, where we are all
looking to get lots of money,'' Rendell said. ``That's all a bunch
of bull. We are looking to curb behavior to prevent kids from
getting killed. If that can be achieved through a settlement, or
programs rather than a lawsuit, then fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said he has not been impressed so far in his discussions
with the gun industry.

   ``It's been the usual... 'guns don't kill people, people kill
people,''' Rendell said.

   Even though other cities have shot ahead of Philadelphia in
filing lawsuits against the gun industry, Rendell said the city is
still a leader on curbing gun violence.

   Rendell touted programs like Philadelphia's new ``Operation
Cease Fire,'' which requires a mandatory five-year sentence without
parole to a criminal convicted of a federal gun violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel we've been usurped by other cities in taking the
lead,'' Rendell said. ``No not at all. Our role in this was never
just for lawsuits.''

 &HT;    CLINTON LAWYERS FACE DILEMMA ON EXTENDING TRIAL
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House assailed Wednesday's Senate action
on President Clinton's impeachment trial, as his lawyers struggled
over whether to seek a quick exit or launch a potentially lengthy
witness inquiry of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With either legal strategy posing risks to the president's case,
the White House postponed a decision as they awaited clarification
of Senate procedures in the case, expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration lashed out at Senate Republicans and House
prosecutors, accusing them of using ''constitutional gymnastics''
and partisan gamesmanship to prolong the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like someone who knows their case is bad so they just
keep doubling up the bet to find a way to extend it and keep
going,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. ''It's
about politics and partisanship and trying to score points.''
</P>
<P>
   Perceiving victory in Wednesday's setback, though, the White
House asserted that the partisan split in the Senate votes
demonstrated that the body lacks the two-thirds majority required
to end Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's events make clear that the votes are not there to
convict and remove the president from office,'' said White House
special counsel Gregory Craig. ''The House Republican managers have
failed to make their case to remove the president because on the
basis of the law, the facts and the Constitution, there simply is
no case.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig stopped short of outlining the legal strategy for moving
Clinton's defense into the next phase of the impeachment trial,
which will include witnesses, something the White House had hoped
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 56-44 _ along party lines, with the sole
exception of Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who voted with the
Republican majority _ to reject a Democratic motion to dismiss the
perjury and obstruction of justice charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then voted, with an identical result, to allow former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses to be
questioned under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate actions presented Craig, White House Counsel Charles
Ruff and other members of Clinton's legal team with a prickly
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Should they mount their own aggressive witness-based defense _
cross-examining Lewinsky and other witnesses the House managers
intend to depose, and perhaps calling in their own witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   Or should they avoid such an approach in the interest of not
extending the trial any more than necessary, a goal the White House
has been stressing for months?
</P>
<P>
   Either strategy carries potential risks for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   More witnesses could require weeks of additional trial time, as
White House lawyers work through what's called discovery _ a
process of reviewing evidence, including many documents that
Clinton's defense team has not yet seen _ then cross-examining
witnesses and perhaps even preparing their own witness list.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged trial is not in Clinton's interest. Wednesday's
votes indicate that he has enough support in the Senate to avoid
conviction, and the public still appears to solidly back his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging the trial out for several more weeks would run the risk
of that support eroding, particularly if new revelations were to
surface that reflected poorly on the president's personal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses, moreover, are unpredictable, as is the impact of
their testimony on the 100 senators who now sit as Clinton's
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Simply going for the quickest possible witness phase, however,
presents its own potential hazards for Clinton's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers who are acting as prosecutors in the case
have about 55,000 pages of testimony and other evidence that has
not been made part of the public record in Clinton's case and, as
Lockhart said, has not been made available to the president's
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House lawyers to not take the time to scour those
documents, Lockhart said, would put Clinton's defense team at an
unfair disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like blindfolding us, and it's like asking the
president's defenders to go into a process knowing far less than
what the prosecution knows,'' said Lockhart. ''We have no idea what
else might be in documents we haven't had access to.''
</P>
<P>
   As it has since Clinton's admission last August that he had
misled the country over the nature of his relationship with former
intern Monica Lewinsky, the White House lashed out at the
president's Republican opponents, accusing them of breaking faith
with the public will by voting to continue a trial many Americans
want to end.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been going on for months. The country wants this
over,'' said Lockhart, suggesting that Republicans would pay a
political price for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we move forward here, the country will understand that this
</P>
<P>
   trial belongs to the Senate Republicans and the House managers,
and that they alone are responsible for extending this process,''
said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's a danger to everyone involved here that the
country's going to look at Washington and finally throw up their
hands and say, 'We don't know what you're doing any more, why do we
bother watching you?'''

BURNS RANKLED BY BRUINS' LACK OF EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It wasn't just losing to the lowly Islanders that
rankled Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the lack of ``a fight-back effort'' by the Bruins in
Tuesday's 4-1 defeat that prompted the coach to bench the line of
Jason Allison, Dmitri Khristich, and Steve Heinze and defenseman
Don Sweeney for the entire third period.
</P>
<P>
   And Burns was still delivering his message, this time verbally,
after Wednesday's practice at the FleetCenter as the Bruins, barely
at sea level in their quest for a playoff berth, prepared for
Thursday's game against the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not passionate about the game, you're not going to
go anywhere,'' said Burns. ``You can talk and talk and talk and
explain things, but this is sometimes the only way to get a message
through. Sooner or later, you have to get that message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is bigger than the team. No one is bigger than the
game. Last year we were a miserable bunch. We were humble. Now they
(are quite self-impressed), and I'd like to know why. We still
haven't accomplished anything yet. We've got to be mean and ornery.
We have to get back to what we were doing before.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns expected a spirited game from the Islanders, especially
under a new head coach (Bill Stewart), who scratched former Bruin
Mariusz Czerkawski for tardiness as a message of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be fair about this. All of a sudden, everybody's ears
pop in their dressing room and they go, `Oh boy, this guy means
business,' '' said Burns, who reunited Sergei Samsonov with Allison
and Khristich at Wednesday's practice. ``I knew we were in for a
tough game, but not to have a fight-back effort, that's what I
don't accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich Wednesdayfelt Burns's action was more a reflection on
the team's overall lethargy than a punishment of one line or
several specific players for the loss: ``We (his line) were part of
the reason we lost, and it was his way of sending a message to all
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burns did have some specific complaints about his chastened
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allison is at his best when he's skating and when he's mean,
when people punch him in the face and he stands tough. But when he
lies on the ground and he and Steve Heinze are playing on their
bellies, they can't help us. Allison can be such a great player. He
doesn't understand that at times, and when he doesn't skate, he's
just another mutt standing there. Heinzie is important to us. But
if he's going to go through the season and score 25 soft goals for
us, that's not what I want. He has to stand up and get in on the
forecheck and finish his hits. Khristich can't keep turning the
puck over, and Donnie hasn't played well the past two or three
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said that at one point Tuesday, he complained to Dennis
LaRue that Heinze had been tripped on a play and the referee
replied, `` `Pat, he's been on his ass all night.' All I could do
was shrug my shoulders and say, `You're right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney accepted Burns's move, while Allison preferred not to
talk specifically about his benching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake in the second period during a line change,
and you can't make mistakes like that,'' said Sweeney.
``Talentwise, when we play our best, we're right there with the top
teams. But we can't let this dip carry on too far. We can't be
complacent about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison talked about the Bruins' inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play much better in the first period, especially on
the road,'' he said. ``I haven't been playing well and I'll take
some responsibility, but it goes deeper than that. (Burns) can only
do so much. We haven't been the same team as last year, but we
haven't been as healthy, even though I hate to use that as an
excuse. Last year we really jelled and bonded and found a way to
win games, and we really haven't done that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his specific criticisms, Burns said he is ready to put
it all behind him. ``I don't want to have a war with them,'' he
said. ``I've spoken to them before. We can't just make a run at the
playoffs in the last 10 games of the season. It's going to be a
tough ride. But I'm also ready to turn the page.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ray Bourque said Burns's specific 20-minute benching was
a statement to everybody in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were singled out, but it was more a message to the club
that we're in a battle,'' said Bourque. ``We kind of knew it was
coming. Things were talked about between periods. It wasn't a
surprise to anyone, but it could have been any one of us. I thought
we played hard the first five minutes, but after we got scored on,
it kind of shook us up. It seems like in the first period when we
get scored on, we get down a little bit, and that has to change _
and not a month from now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman Dave Ellett, who missed nine games with a
hyperextended elbow, returns Thursday night, leaving forward Anson
Carter (ankle sprain) and defenseman Kyle McLaren (shoulder
separation) still on the shelf. Carter, who skated during and after
practice Wednesday, said his return by Sunday (at home against
Carolina) doesn't look promising. ``It just feels good to go out
there and skate,'' he said. ``You can only spend so much time on
the bike.'' Burns said McLaren was still having problems raising
his stick above shoulder height, ``which is understandable with a
separation like that. We don't want to bring him back too
quickly.'' . . . Burns said the Devils are ``one of the best teams
in the East and probably the best-disciplined team with great
goaltending and more experience and patience than Philadelphia. But
Philadelphia is a little bigger and a little more explosive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One of their own was down and out so they cut corners
to get him a little extra cash, and because they're politicians and
it was taxpayer money some people want to blast them.
</P>
<P>
   But not me.
</P>
<P>
   They did a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, Jeff
Groscost, created a ``special dispensation'' that allowed former
Speaker Don Aldridge to collect thousands of dollars in expense
money.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge lost a foot to diabetes and has suffered a stroke. He'd
spent a lot of years in the Legislature, which doesn't pay much,
and now he was hurting and had to resign as Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   So his friends cut him a break.
</P>
<P>
   They looked the other way while Aldridge received a daily
stipend of $60 for 218 days last year, including 86 when the
legislature wasn't even in session. It works out to a little over
$5,000 for a guy who's been hauling the bricks and mortar of state
government for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators know what that's like _ not much money, too many
headaches, late, late hours.
</P>
<P>
   They understand the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   They appreciate the effort.
</P>
<P>
   They feel for one another.
</P>
<P>
   I can't attack them for wanting to help Aldridge, for acting
with compassion and humanity. He's a part of their family.
</P>
<P>
   To the politicians who work at the Capitol, Arizona's State
House is like a home.
</P>
<P>
   Charity begins at home.
</P>
<P>
   My question is: Why the hell does it end there?
</P>
<P>
   The politicians who were so willing to help another politician
haven't done as well when it comes to the sick, the disabled, the
young or the old.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed the state's Child Protective Services to become so
understaffed that more than 4,600 cases of suspected child abuse
couldn't be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   They've allowed the counties to practically go bankrupt trying
to handle long-term health care needs of the elderly and those
struggling with handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   They've allowed the state's mental health system to waste away,
and all the poor souls in it, while they argue over how many more
prisons to build or how many more tax breaks to give big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians at the state Capitol show no pity for people earning
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they've been very generous with those who earn
twice the minimum wage _ themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, we voted to raise a legislator's pay to $24,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to that, our politicians collect daily expense
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Voters believed the extra pay was eliminated when they approved
the salary increase, but newly-elected Attorney General Janet
Napolitano said legislators can still take it.
</P>
<P>
   And they are.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Rep. Aldridge's extra money is only a part of a
larger story about legislators continuing to rake in cash for meals
and mileage.
</P>
<P>
   And whine that it's still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The expense money ``doesn't even come close (to making ends
meet)'' one legislator told a reporter for the ``Arizona
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad, the Arizona Democratic Party has advertised
for charitable assistance from ``anyone who can help provide
housing for a legislator.''
</P>
<P>
   Our elected officials are practically destitute, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Although, after listening to them, their existence seems less
hand-to-mouth than foot-to-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we live in a state where the economy is booming, tax
revenues are increasing and we're about to collect a $2.7 billion
settlement from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a state rich in dollars and in decency. A state where
politicians have proven their willingness to empty their hearts and
their pocketbooks for anyone who needs it, anyone who wants it,
anyone who's not too young, or too old, or too poor or too sick to
get elected. &QL;

CLOTHING MANUFACTURER CHARGES LOEHMANN'S STOLE ITS BUSINESS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A clothing manufacturer has filed a lawsuit against
Loehmann's Inc., the discount apparel retailer, contending that the
wife of Loehmann's chairman used documents and garment patterns
from the manufacturer to supplant it as a key supplier to
Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent loss of Loehmann's business forced the
manufacturer into bankruptcy, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Forty Three Apparel, a maker of women's suits and dresses,
contends that it hired Debbie Friedman, the wife of Loehmann's
chairman, Robert N. Friedman, under pressure from Friedman. The
lawsuit says that when Ms. Friedman left less than a year later to
start her own company, she took corporate secrets of Forty Three
Apparel with her. Her new company, the Bigio Group, then became a
chief Loehmann's supplier, forcing Forty Three into bankruptcy
court, the suit contends.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its bankruptcy filing, Forty Three filed its lawsuit
in December against Loehmann's, the Bigio Group, and the Friedmans.
Forty Three Apparel is seeking about $1.2 million it owes to
creditors and unspecified punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company believes that the filing is a nuisance suit and is
without merit,'' a spokesman for Loehmann's, which is based in the
Bronx and operates about 70 stores in 23 states, said on Tuesday.
``Loehmann's plans to vigorously defend itself in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Loehmann's and the other defendants declined to
comment further. Each has until Feb. 12 to respond to Forty Three
Apparel's charges or file a motion to dismiss. The next hearing in
the suit, which is being heard by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart
Bernstein in Manhattan, is scheduled for Feb. 25. A separate
hearing in Forty Three Apparel's bankruptcy case before Bernstein
is set for Feb. 9.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Forty Three began business in May 1996, making women's clothing
under several brand names including Michael Kaye, Laura Madrigano,
Madrigano Suits, Marco Forte and Madri. Prices of the clothing,
designed for women aged 25 to 55, ranged from about $70 to about
$800.
</P>
<P>
   The company's brands were available through a number of
department, specialty stores and catalogs, but Loehmann's was Forty
Three's biggest customer, accounting for about 80 percent of its
sales, or $8 million, said Mark Singer, the president of Forty
Three.
</P>
<P>
   About May 1997, the suit contends, Friedman called Singer and
said, ``I think it is a good thing for you and Debbie and both our
companies for you to hire Debbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Ms. Friedman, who had been an apparel buyer at
Loehmann's, Saks Fifth Avenue and other retailers, began working at
Forty Three. She was given responsibility for overseeing and
merchandising one of the company's apparel lines and attracting new
business. According to the lawsuit, her salary was $135,000, plus
10 percent of the profits on new business that she attracted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Singer thought that if he did not hire Ms.
Friedman, his company ``would lose its business with Loehmann's,
and that current business and the collectability of current
receivables might be jeopardized,'' according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Loehmann's cut the number of dresses it ordered
from Forty Three and began to defer delivery on some items, which
hurt sales, the lawsuit said. As a result, many suits and dresses
were sold at reduced prices by Loehmann's when it liquidated
inventory from several unprofitable stores, the lawsuit contends,
but suits and dresses that were delivered on time continued to be
strong sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Ms. Friedman decided to leave Forty Three Apparel,
and she started her own company in August. According to the
lawsuit, by the time of her departure, Ms. Friedman knew Forty
Three Apparel's financial condition and many details about how it
operated.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Friedman left Forty Three Apparel, according to the
suit, the company received no new business from Loehmann's and
Loehmann's canceled hundreds of thousands of dollars of orders.
Loehmann's also asked for credits, allowances and deductions on
some merchandise. The loss of business led several creditors of
Forty Three to file involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the
company, which later filed for bankruptcy voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Forty Three also contends that before Ms.
Friedman left the company, she took business documents _ including
dress and suit patterns _ and asked other employees to take company
documents. Some suits based on Forty Three patterns are now made by
the Bigio Group and sold by Loehmann's, according to Harlan M.
Lazarus, Forty Three's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's, once legendary as a retailer that sold designer
women's and men's clothes and accessories at drastically reduced
prices, has fallen on hard times recently.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which began in 1920, went public in 1996 selling
about 3.6 million shares at $17. Since then, earnings
disappointments, brought on by merchandise problems and growing
competition in the discount apparel retail industry, have caused
the stock to falter. The stock closed Wednesday unchanged in Nasdaq
trading, at $1.5625 a share.

FRIENDSHIP PLAYED A ROLE IN SEELY'S CHOICE TO JOIN PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ What took so long for the Patriots to sign
Brad Seely as special teams coach? This: ``No job is worth a
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   So said Seely, who has been a friend of Patriots assistant Dante
Scarnecchia since their days at Southern Methodist on Ron Meyer's
staff. Seely also is a longtime friend of Patriots head coach Pete
Carroll, with whom he worked at Pacific, North Caroina State, and
with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   When Carroll saw that Seely was available after Dom Capers and
his staff were fired in Carolina, he asked his old friend to come
aboard with the idea that Scarnecchia would move from special teams
to the offensive line after the firing of Paul Boudreau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dante and I have have always had a close relationship,'' said
Seely, who signed on with the Patriots Wednesday. ``It was a big
thing, a big issue with us, because no job is worth a friendship.
If this wasn't all right with Dante, it wouldn't have happened. And
I think now Dante is very excited about being an offensive line
coach, where he'll do a tremendous job.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Seely had offers from the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore
Ravens to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the deal done at about 11 a.m. this morning,'' said
Carroll. ``Brad had a few other chances, and we had to work out
some things before he accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Seely had a year remaining on his Carolina contract when he was
dismissed. The Patriots will pick up that year, then give him
sizable raises the following two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well respected in the business, and his special teams
have always been among the best,'' said Carroll. ``He's real sharp
and is very attentive to every detail. He has a way of getting the
most out of his players.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll, he tried to get Seely to come to New
England when he first took the job, but Seely had committed to
Capers.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby
Grier began to notice Seely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had known him for his work in Indianapolis,'' said Grier,
``but when he got to Carolina, his work with (kick returner)
Michael Bates really stood out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he also wanted to find a way to get Scarnecchia
more involved in the offense, feeling that was his strength.
</P>
<P>
   Scarnecchia wouldn't have taken the offensive line job had Seely
not been the choice for special teams. That's why Scarnecchia
hesitated before agreeing to move. If Seely hadn't taken the job,
Scarnecchia would have gone back to coaching special teams and the
Patriots would have consulted a list of offensive line candidates
already in place. The team swears that Atlanta's Art Shell was not
among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to get Dante in on the offensive side from the
time I got here, but it didn't work out,'' said Carroll. ``I think
he'll do a great job with our line.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Shell, ``That wasn't even close,'' said Carroll. ``We
considered several names but we never even brought up Art's name.
It took on a life of its own. I don't know how that ever got
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said reports that the Patriots made second-and third-party
contact with Shell _ who supposedly would have been ready to take
over for Carroll if New England stumbled again next season _ were
erroneous. ``We never inquired about Art in any way, shape, or
form,'' said Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll tabbed Ivan Fears as receivers coach in hopes that his
tougher attitude will get more out of Terry Glenn and Tony Simmons
than did Steve Walters, who was hired by the Tennessee Titans after
his firing here.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grier, Fears will be as involved in the running
game as he will be with the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivan implemented many of the Bears' running schemes when he
was in Chicago and he has great ideas on blocking,'' said Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the coaching staff is now complete. None of the
assistants will have supervisory tags, and veterans such as
defensive backs coach Ron Lynn and tight ends coach Carl Smith have
been given new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Seely, who will come to Foxborough Monday, said he's had a
chance to watch the Patriots on film because the Panthers played
all the AFC East teams except New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dante did a heck of a job with the special teams,'' he said.
``You can see they have talent. I had Tom Tupa in Indianapolis
(though he didn't punt there), and Adam Vinatieri went to my alma
mater (South Dakota State). There are some very good people in
place there.''

HARVARD ANNOUNCES NEW SCIENCE CENTERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass. )  By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Flush with billions of dollars from its
capital campaign and a flourishing endowment, Harvard University
plans to pump as much as $200 million over the next five years into
new science programs, including a new center on the sizzling field
of genes and how they work, a Harvard dean said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dean, Jeremy R. Knowles, of the school of arts and sciences,
said the money would go to found at least two new centers, one on
genomics and the other to investigate the region that lies between
the worlds of quantum physics and classical physics. Work at that
mesoscale may provide a window for looking into living cells and
for developing new materials, computing devices and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The money may also go toward programs on the link between the
brain's physiology and behavior, on the development of scientific
search engines for the World Wide Web and on global climate change,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are areas that, my God, they're important for society,
for education,'' Knowles said.
</P>
<P>
   On gene study, several other institutions already had come to
the same conclusion. The California Institute of Technology began
work two years ago on a new center and has raised about $60 million
of its $100 million goal, said Dr. Melvin Simon, biology chairman
at Caltech.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, the capital campaign includes a target of $60
million to support its nascent Institute for Genomic Analysis, and
the institute announced the appointment of its first director, Dr.
Shirley M. Tilghman, this month.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, with two genome centers, and the University of
California, among others, are considered leaders in genomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of very distinguished institutions are embarking on
analogous areas,'' Knowles said, ``so there is a sense for me in
which we can't afford not to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for new genomics centers arises from the flood of
information issuing from the monumental work under way to decipher
the full sets of genes of organisms from yeast to man. That mapping
is only the beginning; scientists must somehow take such genomes
and give them meaning, explain how they translate into disease or
behavior or physical form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the genome projects now focus on cataloguing the genes
and describing their structure,'' Simon said. ``The big problem
facing the 21st century is to find out what the genes do.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Tilghman put it when her appointment was announced,
scientists with genetic blueprints in hand are now beginning to
study ``how the component parts are assembled into the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, biologists need help from colleagues in a variety of
fields, like engineering (for the robots that make chips),
chemistry (for items like fluorescent molecules for labeling) and
biochemistry (for the isolation of genes and proteins).
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, like his counterparts at other universities, decided
that such collaboration required a building to bring scientists
together, and he said he concluded that the usual model, where a
single professor founds a single laboratory to work on a research
direction, would not suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the most exciting science often needs facilities that
no single investigator can buy or maintain,'' he said, citing
electron microscopes that cost more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of its competitors, Harvard does not need to raise
money to create new centers. The university's endowment is about
$13 billion, and the school of arts and sciences, which has more
than 6,000 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students,
raised about $900 million in the recent capital campaign, Knowles
said.
</P>
<P>
   About $70 million of the new science initiative that Knowles
announced Wednesday is earmarked for various construction,
equipment and hiring, he said, and he said the university would
spend $150 million to $200 million over all.

MERCER BRINGS DIFFERENT APPROACH TO NEW SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For those of you who watched, Ron Mercer appeared to be
in normal late-January form in the Celtics' exhibition opener
Tuesday night at Toronto. He scored the team's first 11 points,
drove to the basket, took a lot of shots (27), and was on the floor
for all but eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it was a logical progression from his impressive
rookie season. In another way, however, it was a bit of a
departure. This year's Mercer may look a lot like last year's
Mercer on the court, but he is quite different _ on and off the
court. He's more open, reaching out more, more vocal and determined
to be a voice within the team and the community.
</P>
<P>
   We got a few glimpses of Mercer Emerging during the lockout. He
has a New York public relations firm working for him. There was the
ill-fated attempt to organize some workouts at the Waltham campus
of Brandeis University, something for which he took inevitable
flak. He dropped big-time agent David Falk for rap star Master P's
No Limit agency. No Limit. That's how Mercer sees himself and his
role this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' he said, ``I just wanted to come in, take care of
business, and try to prove myself. This year, for me to get a lot
of things accomplished, I have to be more vocal in everything that
I do. I mean, I kind of have been like that, but I never really
showed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the Ron Mercer of four years ago, the one who chose Kentucky
to blend in and not be the main man, ever think he'd see this Ron
Mercer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I figured I would,'' he said. ``Maybe not this
quickly, but I knew I would open up sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, who has been with Mercer for four straight years,
also has noticed, and in his view, it's vive la difference!
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' Rick Pitino said. ``Very much so. We need guys in
the organization _ like Popeye (Jones) _ who will go out, be a part
of the community, be personable, and market our team. (Mercer's)
personality is a lot different. Ron is very shy, very quiet. He's
still shy to a certain degree, but he's no longer timid. He wants
to be outspoken more, to come around more, and that bodes well for
him because he needed to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said his decision to go with Master P (nee Percy Miller)
has a lot to do with his personality change. He's mentioned how he
admired the rapper's open way of greeting people and dealing with
fans. He'd like to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with him,'' Mercer said. ``Just being
around him. He's the type of person who's going to speak his mind.
You have to be able to speak up. You have to go out and make
speeches and different things like that. It forced me to open up a
little more, faster than I wanted to, which is a good, positive
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Eric Riley was at Brandeis early Wednesday, getting
started on getting into Pitino Shape. ``A coach like him can change
my career, as long as I work hard and put the sweat in,'' Riley
said. ``I think I can really improve here. If I can play for him, I
can play for anyone in the league.'' Pitino conceded he was bit
``in the dark'' on the Riley file, adding, ``He was the best
available person out there who had size and potential. He runs
well. He's a good defensive player that doesn't need a double-down.
He has a long wingspan so he can block some shots. What he has to
do is get tougher, stronger, because he's a little bit of a finesse
7-footer, but that's something we can work on.'' Riley, who was
signed Wednesday for the year at the four-year veteran minimum
figure ($475,000, prorated), was working out in Houston when he got
the call from Boston. ``It was a big surprise,'' he said. He said
he had other offers, but no one guaranteed the money. The Celtics
did. They've also guaranteed Dwayne Schintzius through next January
and may do the same for Riley if he works out. Riley says that
won't be a problem. ``I'm not even going to get a car,'' he said.
``I'm just going to practice and then back to the hotel. I've been
out eight months. That's too long.'' This is Riley's fifth team in
five years. He played a season each for the Rockets, Timberwolves,
Clippers, and Mavericks . . . The Celtics had individual workouts
and weight sessions Wednesday morning, then practiced at night.

SKI AREAS STUDY CONDITIONS IN PROBING DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three ski deaths at different areas this week have experts
analyzing the conditions to see if there was any possible link to
the weather, but, so far, authorities determined only that an
extreme thaw/freeze cycle had taken place between Sunday and
Monday, possibly creating icy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But in two of the deaths _ Sugarbush and Attitash _ the trails
had been groomed with snow-tillers that break up and pulverize ice,
according to ski area operators. The conditions were reported as
loose granular.
</P>
<P>
   A ski accident death at Loon Mountain occurred on a closed trail
in icy conditions so extreme that ski patrol members who made a
rescue had to use ice climbing gear and crampons to reach the dead
victim and two injured companions.
</P>
<P>
   The Loon accident ocurred on the Triple Trouble trail, a
non-snowmaking run that had been roped off because, in the
description of an area employee, it was a ``frozen waterfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rain fell most of the day Sunday, and by Monday the
temperature had dropped more than 20 degrees. Only snowmaking
trails groomed with the pulverizing snow tillers were open to
skiers, and Loon officials still do not know why the victims were
on Triple Trouble. ``We were very concerned because of the
terrain,'' said Loon spokesman Dave Anderson of the rescue attempt
by Loon patrolmen Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goss, 23, from Lancaster, Pa., was pronounced dead at the
scene, while his 24-year-old fiancee, Margaret Gwynn, and her
father, Howard Gwynn, 51, were taken to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
Center in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   At Attitash Bear Peak in Batlett, N.H., Monday, a 67-year-old
British skier, Robert Keough, died of head injuries after falling
on an expert slope shortly after 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At Sugarbush early Tuesday morning, 14-year-old Daniel Cardillo,
a ski racer from Waterville Valley Academy, died after a crash
while he was free skiing on a groomed intermediate trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow had been tilled and groomed,'' according to Sugarbush
spokesman Dave Dillon, who said that Cardillo was attending a US
Ski and Snowboarding Association training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause of Cardillo's crash has not been determined, but
he was wearing a helmet and was skiing with his coach, Tom Barbow,
headmaster of the academy.

<P>
   PHOENIX - One of their own was down and out so they cut corners
to get him a little extra cash, and because they're politicians and
it was taxpayer money some people want to blast them.
</P>
<P>
   But not me.
</P>
<P>
   They did a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, Jeff
Groscost, created a ``special dispensation'' that allowed former
Speaker Don Aldridge to collect thousands of dollars in expense
money.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge lost a foot to diabetes and has suffered a stroke. He'd
spent a lot of years in the Legislature, which doesn't pay much,
and now he was hurting and had to resign as Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   So his friends cut him a break.
</P>
<P>
   They looked the other way while Aldridge received a daily
stipend of $60 for 218 days last year, including 86 when the
legislature wasn't even in session. It works out to a little over
$5,000 for a guy who's been hauling the bricks and mortar of state
government for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators know what that's like _ not much money, too many
headaches, late, late hours.
</P>
<P>
   They understand the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   They appreciate the effort.
</P>
<P>
   They feel for one another.
</P>
<P>
   I can't attack them for wanting to help Aldridge, for acting
with compassion and humanity. He's a part of their family.
</P>
<P>
   To the politicians who work at the Capitol, Arizona's State
House is like a home.
</P>
<P>
   Charity begins at home.
</P>
<P>
   My question is: Why the hell does it end there?
</P>
<P>
   The politicians who were so willing to help another politician
haven't done as well when it comes to the sick, the disabled, the
young or the old.
</P>
<P>
   They allowed the state's Child Protective Services to become so
understaffed that more than 4,600 cases of suspected child abuse
couldn't be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   They've allowed the counties to practically go bankrupt trying
to handle long-term health care needs of the elderly and those
struggling with handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   They've allowed the state's mental health system to waste away,
and all the poor souls in it, while they argue over how many more
prisons to build or how many more tax breaks to give big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians at the state Capitol show no pity for people earning
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they've been very generous with those who earn
twice the minimum wage _ themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, we voted to raise a legislator's pay to $24,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to that, our politicians collect daily expense
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Voters believed the extra pay was eliminated when they approved
the salary increase, but newly-elected Attorney General Janet
Napolitano said legislators can still take it.
</P>
<P>
   And they are.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Rep. Aldridge's extra money is only a part of a
larger story about legislators continuing to rake in cash for meals
and mileage.
</P>
<P>
   And whine that it's still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The expense money ``doesn't even come close (to making ends
meet)'' one legislator told a reporter for the ``Arizona
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad, the Arizona Democratic Party has advertised
for charitable assistance from ``anyone who can help provide
housing for a legislator.''
</P>
<P>
   Our elected officials are practically destitute, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Although, after listening to them, their existence seems less
hand-to-mouth than foot-to-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we live in a state where the economy is booming, tax
revenues are increasing and we're about to collect a $2.7 billion
settlement from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a state rich in dollars and in decency. A state where
politicians have proven their willingness to empty their hearts and
their pocketbooks for anyone who needs it, anyone who wants it,
anyone who's not too young, or too old, or too poor or too sick to
get elected. &QL;

SURGEONS REPLACE NICKLAUS' LEFT HIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just before Jack Nicklaus underwent hip replacement
surgery Wednesday morning at New England Baptist Hospital, he
expressed a his preference to Dr. Benjamin Bierbaum: ``I would
rather be one down walking up the 18th fairway at Augusta than be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   After several years of agonizing over what to do to remain a
competitive golfer despite a degenerative left hip, Nicklaus acted
on the recommendation of his orthopedic specialist, former New
England Baptist resident Bruce Waxman, who referred him to Bierbaum
for the 1-hour 45-minute operation that was pronounced a success.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who has won 18 of professional golf's major
championships and made a magical run at a seventh Masters green
jacket last April at Augusta National at the age of 58, underwent
the total hip replacement because of osteoarthritis. He is expected
to be released next Tuesday and return to competition in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he told me, he got to the point where he could walk and hit
balls but he couldn't do both,'' said Bierbaum, who plays to an 11
handicap out of The Country Club and the Kittansett Club. ``He was
really at a state where he could no longer compete in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no complications. There were no unanticipated
findings in the surgery. We were able to replace it. It's our
anticipation he would be able to return to competitive golf. The
artificial joint that is inserted is very smooth, and then the
muscles take over and the normal mechanics can be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   The process involved was an Investiational Device Exemption
study of the use of ceramic for hip replacements. It's been
employed in Europe and Australia, acccording to Bierbaum, who
indicated that Nicklaus hasn't given him any golf tips yet.
According to a statement released by New England Baptist,
researchers believe the ``ceramic implants will reduce osteolysis .
. . a condition that develops when the debris given off from an
implant causes the bone surrounding the implant to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no absolute in this area. ``The type of scar tissue
that is involved in any surgery is different,'' said Bierbaum. ``If
the scar tissue is flexible, you can essentially expect normal
movement. If the scar tissue is dense and inelastic, then less than
normal motion will occur. We have to wait a few months to see what
kind of flexibility there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the development of the muscles, strength, and
coordination would be in the latter stage of the rehabilitation. I
don't think it's realistic for him to be in competitive golf for at
least six months. We spoke about it before the surgery, and I think
he's realistic about it. We'll use crutches for about four to six
weeks, in part to protect the bone that has to be healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first six weeks are rather critical because if you
overexercise, the scar tissue may form. Overexercising in the first
six weeks is not a good idea. We'll take an X-ray in six weeks to
see if normal scar tissues have formed. Then we'll form a more
strenuous exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't looking forward to the surgery, and he did
everything possible to handle this problem without surgery. He put
up with quite a bit, but it finally came to the point where he was
not able to do what he wanted to do. He held out for a long time.''

SIX-MONTH-OLD KILLING LEAVES A FAMILY SHATTERED 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas:to a close. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The physical remains of those trembling and black hours when
Edna was discovered missing are few now. The daily reporters are
long gone. The house on Travis Street is occupied by new residents.
The teddy bears, stuffed animals and angels that had been attached
to the chain-link fence where Edna was found are in Mexico, in a
little chapel built by Fidencio over her grave.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects of the events that shattered this family and its
spirit linger. Police admit that they are no closer to solving the
case and that no one who had access to the Rodriguezes' home or who
lived in the immediate area has been eliminated as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Edna's father. Police have yet to release the
results of the polygraph exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, because we don't have any witnesses, we have
not been able to fully eliminate many people,'' said police
Detective W.S. Byington.
</P>
<P>
   The small room fills with tension as Fidencio shifts his husky
body to the edge of the sofa, answering the question, ``Did you
kill your daughter?'' ``No,'' he says. ``There are a lot of people
who think that, and that's why I talked to police.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple questions why there has not been more progress in
their daughter's case. In the days that followed, Hispanic leaders
expressed anger and accused the police of moving too slowly.
Fidencio and Juanita say they still can't understand why the police
failed to activate the Amber alert.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, begun in 1996 in response to the abduction and
slaying of 9-year-old Amber Hagerman in Arlington, Texas, police
notify area radio stations about ``confirmed abductions.'' The
stations then broadcast the alert.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagerman case was one of the largest cases, in terms of
manpower, the Arlington Police Department has ever undertaken, said
police spokesman Dee Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We investigated over 5,000 leads while the task force was
running,'' he said. For about 15 months, we had 15 investigators
assigned to the case full time.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, about a dozen officers were involved in the
Rodriguez case for the first four to six weeks of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the Amber alert was not used because, with no
witnesses, Edna's disappearance was not a ``confirmed abduction.''
Since that time, police have begun using less stringent criteria
for the alert.
</P>
<P>
   None of that makes much sense to the Rodriguezes. They believe
that the police failed their daughter then, and continue to fail
their family now. They see the national stories about the JonBenet
Ramsey case continue. They know, thanks to media coverage, that
Amber Hagerman's death remains in the collective conscience of
North Texas residents. Didn't their little girl's death mean just
as much?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the police didn't do since the very beginning what they
should have done, I honestly don't believe'' the job has been
done,'' said Juanita Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Juanita says, she will remain in Mexico, where she
and her children can feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left because I was going crazy just thinking that the person
that took away my little girl's life could walk in front of my
house, and I not recognize him,'' she said. ``Maybe he's following
us. One doesn't know why that person did it. One can't have peace
of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our lives are destroyed,'' she continues. ``I'm not
running away or hiding in Mexico. I just want people to understand
that it's not easy to be here. As for me and my kids, we'll stay in
Mexico until this is cleared up.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas: window was open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frantic, he went outside to search the front and back yards, he
later told police. He then jumped into his car and drove around the
neighborhood, stopping to inquire at the homes of nearby relatives.
Unable to find any sign of his daughter, he went back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment I started calling my family and the police,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it seemed a bad week for children across the country.
The day before Edna's abduction, in Lyons, Ill., a woman returned
home from playing church bingo to find her two young children bound
with duct tape and shot in the head, one fatally. And in Jasper,
Ind., the estranged husband of another woman shot her three
children, two of them his own.
</P>
<P>
   As was her habit when she was away, Juanita called frequently to
check on her children. She called once about 10 p.m., only to get a
busy signal. An hour later, she tried phoning again but got another
busy signal. It was around 3 or 4 o'clock _ she's not sure _ on the
morning of July 11 when she telephoned and found out Edna was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling my sister-in-law, `It's not true, it's not
true, it's not happening,' '' Juanita remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But it was true. In the middle of night, with her shoes still
entangled in the bedsheets, Edna had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Juanita and her sister-in-law arrived in Fort
Worth, only to wait with the rest of the family. As they did,
mostly on the front stoop of the house on Travis Avenue, neighbors
canvassed the area, handing out fliers with Edna's picture on them,
posting some at local businesses. Ham radio operators joined the
search, and the American Red Cross provided drinks and food for
overheated searchers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 hours later, as residents prepared to mount another
search for Edna, a neighbor who had walked outside his home to
smoke a cigarette spotted the little girl's body in plain sight,
less than 10 feet from his front porch. Edna still was clad in the
pink and white T-shirt and the underpants she had worn to bed.
Someone had strangled her.
</P>
<P>
   The psalmist said: ``I will lie down in peace and sleep, for you
alone, Oh Lord, make me dwell in safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some might disagree, the Scripture Edna highlighted
that day with her grandmother, Ampora, seemed to have been
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1:15 p.m., Sunday, July 12. Edna was pronounced dead at
the scene, where associate police Chaplain R.M. Morris performed
last rites.
</P>
<P>
   As others were drawn to the site by police and ambulance sirens,
Juanita remained at home, certain that she could no more bear the
sight of her dead child than she could the thought of Edna being
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fidencio rushed over with the others, but as he approached, he
said, a police officer turned him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I realized something was wrong,'' he recalled. ``I
was trying to get closer, because I wanted to hold her.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fidencio did get closer, it was much later, at the morgue.
He identified Edna from a still photograph taken with a video
camera held over her face.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the hours immediately following his daughter's
disappearance, it seemed Fidencio might top the list of police
suspects. This, he said, is the reason ``I didn't go back to Mexico
(after the funeral to live with my family).'' He adds that he had
``nothing to fear or hide.''
</P>
<P>
   For several hours over two days, police questioned Fidencio and
administered two polygraph examinations to determine what he knew
about Edna's disappearance and death.
</P>
<P>
   According to an incident report issued later that day, police
also searched the Rodriguezes' home, including the attic. They
interviewed friends Edna had spoken to during the evening. They
notified Air One, a police helicopter, to fly over the area and
checked area hospitals. An automated, reverse 911 system alerted
neighbors 12 blocks to the north, east, south and west of Edna's
home of the girl's disappearance. The message went out in Spanish
and English. But police turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Although an autopsy revealed no signs of sexual assault, police
also questioned 20 registered sex offenders who live in the area
around the Rodriguezes' former home on Travis Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, five days after her disappearance, some 350 mourners
gathered for a bilingual service at Travis Avenue Baptist Church to
honor Edna's short life. The next day, with family members in tow,
the girl's body was transported to Mexico and buried in Minas de
Barroteran, a small town in the state of Coahuila.
</P>
<P>
   The news media that scurried about in those five days seemed to
go away, too.
</P>
<P>
   The following Sunday, with the exception of Manuel, the family
returned to Fort Worth. About a month later, unable to remain in
the house she had shared with Edna, Juanita took her other
daughters and moved back to Mexico, leaving Fidencio to face police
scrutiny without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came for me since the very beginning,'' Fidencio said of
the police. ``And I told them, `I go with you.' They questioned me
about three or four times. When we came back from the funeral in
Mexico, we arrived here at 5 a.m., we called them and told them
we're right here, whatever you need.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, they came for me again. All the time I was saying,
`Let's move forward, forward and forward. I'm right here. I have
nothing to hide.' I never refused to answer any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is winter. The hot, still air that marked the dark of
Edna's leaving has given way to cold nights. Just a few miles from
the house they shared with Edna, Juanita and Fidencio sit together
again, trying once more to make sense of the horror. Another of
Juanita's occasional and brief visits with Fidencio is drawing to a
close. MORE &QL;

ECONOMIC SCENE: IT'S HARD TO TELL WHO WON IN THE LOCAL PHONE
RULING
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from reactions, it was hard to figure out exactly who
won this week's decision by the Supreme Court to uphold federal
rules designed to open up the local telephone market to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. and other long-distance carriers declared victory,
saying the decision would allow them to go after local customers as
the Telecommunications Act of 1996 had intended. The Federal
Communications Commission, which issued the rules, declared
vindication. Even some of the losing plaintiffs, the local phone
companies, pointed with glee at the part of the decision that would
require the commission to reconsider part of its rule making.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the parties to the dispute say, the big
winner, according to many economists and consumer advocates, will
be ordinary phone customers. Gene Kimmelman, a top official at
Consumers Union, said, ``This decision will help small companies to
come into the local market and take on the reigning monopolist.''
Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, said that ``on balance, I'm happy that the court erred
on the side of the commission rather than the local Bell
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rules were designed to create competition in
local phone service, breaking the monopoly of Bell Atlantic Corp.
and the other regional Bell carriers. The Bells struck back and
found a federal court willing to throw out the rules on the ground
that the commission had strayed beyond its legislative mandate.
This week the Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision,
voting to let competition unfurl.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the 1996 act was to give consumers a choice by
inviting long-distance carriers like AT&AMP;T and cable and wireless
concerns to enter the market for local phone service. In return,
after opening their sanctuary to competition, the local Bell
companies would be allowed to enter long distance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress left it up to the commission to figure out the rules.
The problem was that no company was in a position to provide local
service using only its own equipment. Entrants would need to use,
at least initially, some or all of the Bell network, including
wires into homes, switching equipment and operator services. The
threat was that the Baby Bells would overcharge for their network
or deny access to key components entirely, blocking entry into
local service even as they drove hard into the long-distance
market. That posed the danger that the Bells would exploit the 1996
act to dominate telecommunications markets, making a mockery of
Congress' will.
</P>
<P>
   In surprisingly short time, about six months, the commission
came up, in Kimmelman's judgment, with ``smart rules that compel
the Bell companies to compete on fair terms with potential
rivals.'' The commission set down two key principles. There would
be one national pricing policy, with 50 state variations to take
account of regional cost differences, making it easy for companies
to enter any and all states at once. And the regional Bells would
be required to rent all their network or any important component of
the network. AT&AMP;T might need to rent wires into the home, but not
signaling equipment. A wireless company might not need the wires,
but might need to rent directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the commission ruled that the Bells could charge only
enough to cover the costs that an efficient concern would incur to
provide the switch, wire, operators assistance, or whatever other
equipment or service the entrant needed to rent. Said another way,
the Bells would not be allowed to pass along the bloated costs that
they had actually incurred as an inefficient, government-protected
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Some state commissions have set prices at levels well above the
commission's efficient-provider rule. But under the commission's
rules, the Baby Bells would charge enough to cover legitimate costs
_ the costs of a low-cost provider _ and not one penny more. That
way, entrants could enter and drive down prices to the level of the
lowest-cost producer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells challenged the rules, arguing that the 1996 act did
not empower the commission to set prices. Though their position
might not make a lot of economic sense, they could point to
ambiguities and contradictions in the statutory language of the act
that made their interpretation plausible. A federal appeals court
sided with the Baby Bells. The Supreme Court sided with the
commission. Whatever the pros and cons of its legal reasoning, the
Supreme Court's decision gives, after more than two years of legal
deadlock, long-distance and other potential entrants a fair shot at
the local phone market.
</P>
<P>
   The court did accept one part of the Baby Bell argument. It
ruled that the commission had forced the Bells to rent hundreds of
components and software services without determining that entrants
truly needed those components and services in order to compete. The
commission was instructed to reconsider its list, dropping items,
perhaps like operator assistance, that entrants could provide
themselves or rent from non-Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   GTE Corp. points to this provision of the high court's decision
as grounds to declare victory. Others say that this order for
re-examination will delay efforts to open the local phone market.
But these claims appear exaggerated. The commission took only six
months to issue its entire package of rules in 1996. It surely
needs less time to revise a small portion of those rules. So, at
worst, the court has imposed a delay of a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, delay is of tertiary importance. If the court had gone
the other way _ permitting states to set rental prices according to
historical costs or permit the Bells to deny access to key parts of
their network _ it would have risked putting some of the Bells in
charge of telecommunications until Congress took up another bout of
reform. Here, history is sobering. The 1996 act revised legislation
dating back to 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting a few months while the commission revises its rule
making hardly matters if the result is to create a competitive
maelstrom from which consumers should reap benefits for decades to
come. &QL;

SIX-MONTH-OLD KILLING LEAVES A FAMILY SHATTERED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES)-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas - Another lazy Wednesday sun sags behind the
wood-frame house on a foreboding stretch south of downtown. Inside,
side by side on a small sofa, Juanita and Fidencio Rodriguez sit,
talking.
</P>
<P>
   It is winter, and nearly six months have passed since their
8-year-old daughter, Edna, was found strangled in a grassy driveway
less than two blocks from their south-side home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodriguezes sit close together in a brightly lit living room
that doubles as a bedroom in Fidencio's mother's home. A floor
model TV set squats mute in a corner, tuned to a Spanish network.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish is the Rodriguezes' first language. And this is the
first interview the couple has granted since that day in July when
their lives were ripped apart.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, Juanita, a petite 30-year-old woman with dark
hair framing her face, speaks in slow, measured tones as if testing
every word. Bitterness and pain pour forth frequently in a rush of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven-year-old Fidencio cries, too. As they share their
memories, with the help of a translator, the parents often stop to
console and hold each other. Their recollections are frightening _
and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The story they tell is as complex as human emotion. It is about
a child who disappears in the middle of the night while in her
father's care. About a mother who, unable to bear being in the
place where her daughter died, has taken her remaining three
children back to her native Mexico, leaving her husband with his
mother in Fort Worth and returning only occasionally for visits.
And about a murder case that remains unsolved, commanding little
public attention compared with the 1996 strangulation of 6-year-old
JonBenet Ramsey, the beauty pageant princess from Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of progress in Edna's case weighs heavily on the
Rodriguezes. Police are no closer to discovering what happened to
Edna than they were that summer night.
</P>
<P>
   And so what lingers, for this couple, is more questions than
answers. Isn't there anyone who saw Edna's killer? Did police allow
the killer's trail to run cold by focusing so much attention on
Edna's father at the outset of the investigation? Why has Fidencio
not been eliminated as a suspect in the case? Could Edna have been
saved if police had immediately notified local news media that the
child had been abducted? Who could have killed their little girl _
and why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever did this is still out there,'' Juanita said. ``If
anyone saw, I hope they will come forward, because if this can
happen to my little girl, it can happen to other kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The thermometer peaked at 103 on that Friday afternoon of July
10 _ the sixth consecutive day of 100-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosemont neighborhood, where Fidencio and his family had
settled in a three-bedroom house on Travis Avenue just three months
earlier, looked like it had seen better times. Many of the
neighboring houses were in disrepair. A few others were boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   For the Rodriguezes, Rosemont still held the promise of the
better life they had sought when they migrated to Fort Worth eight
years ago with two young children: Manuel, who was 4, and Edna,
then just 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was really hard in Mexico,'' Fidencio said. ``We
came looking for better opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining relatives in Fort Worth, Fidencio found a job
right away doing roofing. Later, he began building mobile homes.
Juanita helped make ends meet by cleaning offices.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1998, things seemed to be going well. The
children, now including 5-year-old Wendy and 4-year-old Claudia,
were all healthy and happy.
</P>
<P>
   The family made fishing trips to Lake Worth on the city's north
side. Edna was looking forward to entering the third grade at
George C. Clarke Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   She was, her parents agree, ``a very happy girl. She liked a lot
of things. She loved going to church.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was one of her most cherished pastimes, they say.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last things Edna did as that torrid afternoon drifted
into a hot, airless summer night was to read the Bible with her
grandmother, her father says.
</P>
<P>
   Two passages, in particular, captured her attention that day.
One was from the 103rd book of Psalms. And the other was from the
Fourth: ``I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, Oh
Lord, make me dwell in safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours would pass between that theoretical farewell
and the real and horrible departure that Edna was to make.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Rodriguez was in Coahuila, Mexico, where she had spent
two weeks with her youngest daughter Claudia, taking care of her
sick father. Fidencio was charged with the care of the three other
children.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began, says Fidencio, with a gathering of friends
and relatives who ``got together because my brother was going to
take my mother to Mexico.'' It wasn't a party, he says carefully,
although he did share a six-pack of beer with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   After talking on the telephone with her friend Monica, Edna got
a craving for her favorite pizza: pepperoni and ham. The kids ate
dinner, watched ``The Simpsons'' until about 11 that night, and
then, says Fidencio, they all went to bed. As was often the case
when their mother was away, Edna and her younger sister Wendy slept
in the bed with their father. Edna fell asleep still dressed in the
pink T-shirt, shorts and shoes she wore that day. Their brother,
Manuel, retired to his room.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 2 a.m. when Fidencio awoke, he says, and realized
something was terribly wrong.''I got up to go to the bathroom. The
moment I woke up, I noticed the girl was missing.''
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't find Edna, Fidencio awakened his son, Manuel.
Then Fidencio turned on all the lights in the house. He noticed
that the living-room window was open. MORE &QL;

NEW MASSACHUSETTS AG SETS SIGHTS ON INTERNET CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly says he
intends to substantially beef up the state's efforts to crack down
on crimes committed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, the state's new top law enforcement official, struck his
tough stance during an interview this week with Globe editors and
reporters on a wide range of issues. At the top of his list:
Internet crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting an increasing number of complaints about this,''
said Reilly, who assumed his job just last week after a bitterly
fought campaign in the fall. ``It's going to require us to
dramatically expand our efforts in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said the complaints have centered around financial scams
and unsolicited e-mail containing sexually explicit material or
child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Reilly said he would collaborate with
attorneys general in other states to coordinate enforcement and
prosecution of Internet crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly filled in some of the blanks about his law enforcement
agenda, commenting on issues ranging from the use of tobacco
settlement money to antitrust issues and from health care fraud to
legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   On the anticipated $7.6 billion in tobacco settlement money that
is due to the state from the cigarette industry, Reilly disagreed
with Governor Paul Cellucci, who announced that he would use the
vast majority of the money for health care programs. Reilly
emphatically stated that the proceeds should go solely to
anti-smoking campaigns and treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the lawsuit was to prevent people from smoking and
recoup money spent on treating people who get sick from smoking,''
said Reilly. ``It's important not to lose sight of that. . . .
Everyone is seeing this as a panacea for all kinds of things. I
don't see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he saw an ``inherent conflict'' in the settlement:
``For states to get what they're looking for, people are going to
have to continue to smoke and get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   On antitrust matters, Reilly said he would be ``vigilant'' in
scrutinizing mergers and acquisitions in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be more vigilant than ever with mergers and
consolidations to make sure that competition remains in place,''
Reilly said. While he did not cite industries with unhealthy levels
of competition, he said a few transactions could easily change that
status.
</P>
<P>
   In health care, where his predecessor, Scott Harshbarger, made a
considerable effort to weigh in, Reilly said he would focus on
fraud, and possibly expand his office's Medicaid fraud task force.
Reilly said he is searching for a new chief of the office's public
protection bureau, a position held by Barbara Anthony, who was
Harshbarger's point person on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, a career prosecutor, spoke passionately on the issue of
whether to expand legalized gambling or introduce ``high-stakes''
bingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are implications in terms of law enforcement,'' said
Reilly. ``Furthermore, is it sound economic policy? Experience has
shown that it doesn't necessarily work or last in the local
business communities.''

PHILIP MORRIS EARNINGS ROSE 9% 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite domestic price increases for cigarettes and weaker
demand from overseas, revenue at Philip Morris Cos. increased 6.4
percent and underlying earnings rose 9 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year, the company reported Wednesday. Full-year
earnings for 1998 grew by 8.9 percent, to $3.17 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations.
Nevertheless, the company's share price fell Wednesday by $1.8125,
to $46.4375, on a day when the stock market declined. Several
analysts said jitters about more lawsuits against tobacco companies
caused the stock slide, although it appears increasingly unlikely
that the federal lawsuit President Clinton mentioned in his State
of the Union address will go forward.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Emanuel Goldman of Merrill Lynch, said the
company's cigarette sales in the United States were off only about
1 percent, even though Philip Morris raised its prices by more than
20 percent, or 45 cents a pack, in November. The company was the
first to raise prices after the tobacco industry reached a $206
billion settlement with 46 states, although other companies quickly
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be managing their pricing reasonably
effectively,'' Goldman said of Philip Morris executives. ``They are
offering discounts to minimize the sticker shock and phasing in the
net price increase. What they have in mind is minimizing the
trading down by consumers from Marlboro's to minor brands, because
the lion's share of the money this company makes is from
Marlboros.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its market share rose to 52.6 percent and
that Marlboro sales rose to 37.6 percent, their highest level ever.
At the same time, the company's sales costs, general and
administrative costs went up almost 45 percent in the quarter,
suggesting deep promotions and other expenses, said Marc Cohen, an
analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris reported that net earnings were down 79 percent,
to $274 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, mostly because of
$3.8 billion in tobacco litigation settlements. Without those
considerations, the company said, its earnings rose 9 percent in
the quarter. By contrast, net earnings were $1.3 billion, or 53
cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Operating revenue in the recent quarter reached $18.4 billion,
up from $17.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Kraft Foods division increased revenue by 7.2
percent, to $3.1 billion, in the quarter, although profits were
pinched by higher costs for cheese and other dairy ingredients. The
company said sales of such products as frozen pizza, Lunchables
meals, Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee all grew. Altoids
mints turned in double-digit growth, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft announced a voluntary retirement program for 600 employees
and said it would take a $150 million pretax charge for it in the
first quarter of this year. The program is expected to generate $50
million in pretax savings annually.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, income from tobacco sales rose 10 percent, though
volume fell 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the company said.
Marlboro sales grew 3.8 percent in markets ranging from Western
Europe to Japan. Sales declined in Eastern Europe and Russia,
reflecting weakened economies there.

THOMAS MANN, CAREER DIPLOMAT, DIES AT 87 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Latin America)   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thomas C. Mann, a career diplomat and an architect
of a switch in the 1960s to a U.S. foreign policy in Latin America
emphasizing free enterprise, died Saturday at his home in Austin,
Texas. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's appointment by President Johnson to a high State
Department post shortly after the death of President Kennedy was
seen as a signal to Kennedy loyalists that the new administration
was going to switch to foreign policies in Latin America that
focused on the interests of U.S. and local businesses. Former
policies had emphasized the promotion of democracy and other social
causes.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, 1963, three weeks after Kennedy's assassination,
Johnson named Mann as assistant secretary of state for
Inter-American Affairs, Johnson's first major appointment as
president. Four days later Johnson named Mann to the additional
post of special assistant to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a Kennedy adherent,
praised Mann for one aspect of his Latin American policy, his
opposition to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, recalling that ``he
thought it was nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schlesinger faulted him for the way he carried out Johnson's
policies in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Under Johnson and Mann, Schlesinger wrote in ``Robert Kennedy
and His Times,'' many of the political and social components of the
Alliance for Progress, a program aimed at helping Latin American
countries attain democracy and improve living conditions, were
removed. Much of what remained, he wrote, was converted ``into an
instrumentality for North American corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Sayre, who served on the National Security Council and
was ambassador to Uruguay, Panama and Brazil, defended his friend
and colleague against some of Schlesinger's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was Tex-Mex,'' Sayre said, explaining the
term as one once used in the government to describe those who had a
low opinion of Latin American capabilities. He pointed to Mann's
bilingual upbringing along the U.S.-Mexican border at Laredo and
his experience as ambassador to Mexico and El Salvador as evidence
of his affection for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Walter LaFeber, a Cornell University history professor, wrote
that Mann's career ``is a case study of how the United States moved
from good neighbor to the overt use of military power in the
hemisphere,'' although ``he never rose higher than the No. 3 State
Department office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mann was by no means primarily responsible for the
devolution,'' LaFeber wrote, but said it illustrated the way a
Washington policy shift originated and developed.
</P>
<P>
   Mann played important foreign policy roles involving many
countries. In 1964 he arranged help for Eduardo Frei Montalva, a
moderate, in defeating Salvador Allende Gossens, a Socialist, to
become President of Chile. Allende was to win the next election, in
1970, and died in a Washington-backed military coup that overthrew
his government in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1964, Professor LaFeber wrote, Mann supported military
officers after they overthrew the President of Brazil, Joao
Goulart, whom he viewed as ``an inept president, easily influenced
by leftist advisers and cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Johnson, at Mann's urging, sent 22,800 troops to the
Dominican Republic to put down what Washington regarded as a
Communist threat.
</P>
<P>
   That action led to opposition in Congress and Mann's replacement
in the inter-American post in 1966. By then, LaFeber wrote,
``Thomas Mann's policies were the future of U.S. policies in Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said in an interview that he had learned Spanish before
English. In high school he stood out as a scholar and quarterback,
taking Laredo to an undefeated season in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's son, the Rev. Clifton A. Mann, said his father graduated
from Baylor University in 1934 with a bachelor's and a law degree
and practiced law in Texas until the United States entered World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Pearl Harbor he went to take his physical and flunked it
because of his eyes and was despondent,'' Mann's son said. At that
point Mann saw an advertisement recruiting Spanish-speaking lawyers
and wound up working for the Office of Economic Warfare, posted in
Uruguay. LaFeber said one of Mann's jobs had been to monitor Nazi
shipping in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the war, Mann transferred to the foreign
service, where he spent the rest of his public career, retiring in
1966. He was president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association
from 1967 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's wife of 64 years, Nancy, died in 1997. He is survived by
his son, Father Mann, an Episcopal priest in Lubbock, Tex.; six
granddaughters, and three great-granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was Lyndon Johnson's first appointment, and that caused
him a lot of pain,'' Father Mann said. ``He was perceived to be a
political figure when he was, in fact, a diplomat.''

 &HT;    Coaching all Durham wants to do
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Hugh Durham speaks in public, he invariably is asked what
he did to stay busy during a two-year hiatus from college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask them: `Do you know when ``Walker, Texas Ranger''
comes on TV? Well, I do,' '' said Durham, who was fired at Georgia
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The line always gets a laugh, so Durham keeps using it. But
underneath the laughter was a truth that Durham had to face every
day he was away from the game _ Hugh Durham is a basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   It's not what he does. It's what he is. And that's why last
season, at age 60, he took on the challenge of rebuilding the
once-proud program at Jacksonville University (7-12), which plays
at Georgia State tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Durham had been a head basketball coach for 29 years, 17 at
Georgia, when he found himself without a team. Sure, he had a lot
of things to fall back on. He had a beautiful home in Athens. He
had his horses. He had golf. He had all of his family around him.
He had invested his money wisely, so, financially, he really didn't
need to coach.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, it was another matter. In those 29 seasons, Durham
had won 528 games. He had been to the NCAA Tournament eight times
and remains one of only 10 coaches in history to take two schools
(Florida State in 1972 and Georgia in 1983) to the Final Four.
Thirteen of his players _ a list that included Dave Cowens, Vern
Fleming and Dominique Wilkins _ made it to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of golf or horseback riding was going to replace that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to where, if it rained, I was indoors watching Jerry
Springer,'' Durham said, firing off another favorite line: ``When
you've been coaching all your life, what else are you going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   So Durham took over at Jacksonville, which had a brief brush
with fame in 1970 when Artis Gilmore and Rex Morgan took the
Dolphins to the national championship game, where they lost to
UCLA. In the 28 years since, Jacksonville has been to the
tournament only four times and never advanced past the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Durham inherited a program that had been 5-23 the season before.
He brought in seven new players to install his system with mixed
results and finished 8-19. This season, Durham brought in eight
more new faces, hoping to boost the talent. Jacksonville also made
a geographically smart move from the Sun Belt to the Trans America
Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results have been spotty. The Dolphins went 5-5 in
their first 10 games, with losses to South Carolina, Ball State,
Florida, Florida State and Baylor. Then Jacksonville lost its first
five games in the TAAC before finally beating Troy State on
Saturday. Monday night, JU beat Mercer, coached by Durham's former
player and assistant coach, Mark Slonaker.
</P>
<P>
   While Jacksonville arrives here on somewhat of an upbeat note,
Durham faces the real possibility of back-to-back losing seasons
for the first time in his career. In Durham's 29 years of coaching
before Jacksonville, he had only three losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, however, life is very good. Durham's wife,
Malinda, grew up in Jacksonville, and the chance for her to go home
has been a bonus. Durham's middle son, Doug, is his top assistant.
His other sons, David and Jim, both are graduates of the University
of Georgia law school and have given him five grandchildren. On
April 26, Durham, who was a standout basketball player at Florida
State before he became the Seminoles' coach, will be inducted into
the Florida Athletic Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But over the telephone, a caller gets the sense that Durham,
who'll turn 62 in October, would like one more invitation to the
NCAA Tournament. He has a five-year contract and absolutely no
thoughts of retirement. Been there. Done that. Not interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is tough; I'm not going to kid you,'' Durham said.
``But you've got to be able to look ahead. If I thought it was
going to be this way year in and year out _ if I didn't think we
could compete _ I would have never accepted the position. I know we
can win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State alum Michael Gearon Jr., who recently contributed
$300,000 to the men's basketball program, will be honored at
tonight's game. Gearon's gift will be used, school athletics
officials said, to provide support for improvements to men's
basketball facilities, academic support and recruiting and to help
create the first men's basketball endowment fund.

 &HT;    Ellis has Jazz, Hawks waiting
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While LaPhonso Ellis apparently waits for heavenly guidance on
whether to wear Atlanta Hawks red or Utah Jazz blue, his
prospective teams on both sides of the Mississippi are showing
signs of impatience.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis left a message on Karl Malone's answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the Lord was going to point him in the right
direction,'' the Utah star said. ``He used the Lord a lot; I guess
the Lord must have pointed him to Atlanta. And that's fine. I like
LaPhonso. I'm not taking a shot at him or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis, who visited here Monday with his wife, Jennifer, has
not indicated that he is headed back to sign a contract. He told a
friend with the Milwaukee Bucks he probably would go to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said Ellis wouldn't even return his
calls. And as late as Wednesday evening, neither team had a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The indecision puzzles Dikembe Mutombo, Ellis' teammate in
Denver for four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to LaPhonso three times the other day,'' the Hawks
center said Wednesday. ``He didn't know what he wanted to do. Maybe
he still doesn't know. He's very upset Denver renounced him, (but)
he loves the city. I told him, 'Hey, that's what they did to me. I
was building a house, and they never told me they didn't want me.'
I told him, 'Get over it, man. Get on with your life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis came into the NBA as the fifth pick of the 1992 draft, a
prize who averaged 15.7 and 15.4 points a game his first two
seasons. That was when he could still play power ball, before his
legs betrayed him, costing him 140 games over three seasons. The
injuries, in order, were a stress fracture of the kneecap, knee
surgery and a torn Achilles, the last in the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   He did play in 76 games last season, averaging 14.3 points, 7.2
rebounds, but at 6-foot-8 and 238 pounds, he now works almost
exclusively as a small forward. He put up 201 3-pointers last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Even a healthy Ellis wasn't able to make a difference for a
Denver franchise that stumbled through the '90s. The team is
166-306 since he signed on, has not won more than 41 games in any
season and lost 71 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jazz and the Hawks believe Ellis can help them.
</P>
<P>
   The attention Ellis is getting stems from his status as the last
high-profile free agent who still has real options; Rod Strickland
is unsigned but has no choice other than Washington. The Hawks can
pay Ellis $1.75 million, their middle-class exception salary. The
Jazz have $1.88 million under the cap to spend. The Hawks see Ellis
as a potential starter, while the Jazz look at him as the backup
for starters Karl Malone and Bryon Russell.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Hawks do sign Ellis, they will not have solved all
their roster problems.
</P>
<P>
   They still need a backup power forward to support Alan
Henderson. There were indications that veteran Grant Long, an
Atlanta resident, was ready to decline Cleveland and Milwaukee and
return to the Hawks, for whom he started over two seasons before
being dealt to Detroit in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks created a problem by bringing back second-year small
forward Chris Crawford. They felt obligated to Crawford and gave
him a guaranteed minimum contract for this season. And while 60
percent of a $350,000 contract won't prevent them from cutting
anyone, Crawford continues to be a prospect worth keeping around.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Pete Babcock says Ellis is not viewed as
critical to the Hawks' season. ``We are really impressed with what
(rookie) Roshown McLeod has shown us in camp. We have Ty (Corbin)
back, and we do like Chris, but our feeling is the more talented
players you have, the better you are. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, newly acquired No. 3 center Scot Pollard might be
on the trading block. The staff is displeased with his lack of
conditioning and impressed with what it is getting from veteran
Mark West, who will work behind Dikembe Mutombo.

 &HT;    Giant Pandas to live like royalty at Zoo Atlanta
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a major coup for Zoo Atlanta, the animal park has
inked a deal to bring two rare Giant Pandas here from China for a
10-year study aimed at finding out why the black and white bears
have such a hard time mating in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta director Dr. Terry Maple likened the panda agreement
to the deal two decades ago that brought the ``Treasures of
Tutankhamun'' exhibit to the United States for a grand tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Giant Pandas will be Atlanta's first, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement will come this morning at a news
conference, when zoo officials also will reveal plans to spend $10
million on a Giant Panda exhibit and upgrades to zoo entrances to
accommodate the throngs officials expect when the public is allowed
to see the critters in September or October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most important project that Zoo Atlanta has
ever undertaken,'' Maple, a psychologist at Georgia Tech, said in
an interview. ``Pandas are highly endangered. This is an animal
that is in trouble and we need to do something to help.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the zoo expects more than a million patrons to visit the
exhibit in the first year alone, a significant increase over
regular attendance. In the 1997-98 fiscal year, 823,984 people
visited Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The new Giant Panda habitat will be the most advanced such
facility in the world, featuring indoor and outdoor areas designed
to simulate the panda's native home. The animal area will measure
1,674 square feet and include off-exhibit holding areas as well as
two indoor exhibits or dayrooms. The 551-square-foot dayrooms are
the most prominent feature of the indoor facility and will be
climate-controlled and feature skylights.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other pandas in the United States, two at the
San Diego Zoo and another at the National Zoo in Washington. Only
about 1,000 are believed alive on the planet, including about 100
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Maple said Giant Pandas do not breed well in captivity, and
that's one of the mysteries he and fellow scientists Rebecca Snyder
and Megan Reinersten, also of Georgia Tech, hope to solve in coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who has spent many months in China _ the bears' only
native habitat _ in the past two years, leaves again Monday. In
captivity, cubs are usually taken from their mothers before they
are six months old, she said. This, she said, is likely the root of
behavioral problems that cause them to exhibit little interest in
procreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they aren't able to learn social and sexual behaviors
from their mothers,'' said Snyder, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the pandas who'll soon call Atlanta home is about 2
years old, and Maple said he hopes the male, Yang Yang, and the
female, Lun Lun, will learn to mate, and begin producing offspring,
in four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will grow up here to be breeding pandas in the same way
as Willie B, so that they'll become prime breeders when they go
back to China,'' he said. Willie B, a 40-year-old gorilla at Zoo
Atlanta, apparently found the mating game a mystery. He sired his
first offspring in 1994, at age 36, and now is the father of three
females and one male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantans can expect to see in the fall two wonderful,
youthful pandas, and they will be provided with all the care and
opportunity we can give them,'' Maple said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo marketers are banking on a big jump in attendance and
revenue, and have good reason to believe that will happen. When
pandas were loaned to the Toledo Zoo in 1988, attendance zoomed to
1.3 million, from 800,000 in most years, said Toledo Zoo spokesman
Nancy Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them 4.5 months,'' she said. ``We had lines. We had
people waiting to see them. It wasn't just the community. It drew
from Chicago and all over. Attendance-wise, there's nothing better
in a zoo than pandas. I definitely plan to come see them myself.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley Hudson, deputy director the National Zoo in Washington,
which had two pandas until its female died in 1992, said visitation
didn't increase, but more people who came hung around the pandas.
Hsing-Hsing, 27, fathered several cubs but none lived to maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People disperse throughout the park,'' he said, but a larger
number would then gravitate to that panda exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   Maple said ``a good part'' of revenue generated by panda
visitation will be returned to China ``to help them save the panda.
The panda is a symbol of conservation. This is an animal that
really needs attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Chinese researchers will be coming here, and vice versa,
to swap information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really excited,'' Maple said. ``We're thrilled. We like
running the zoo for the public. But what really gets us excited as
animal people is when we can save an animal, when we can teach the
world about animals, and when we can study them, and observe them.
And this project has all those features.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta has been sending researchers to China for two years
at the Chengdu Zoo and the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda
Breeding. For some reason, captive female pandas do not show the
behaviors normally associated with the period during which females
are receptive to males, and capable of conceiving. And most males
aren't interested or aggressive enough toward females when they are
in the biological mood.
</P>
<P>
   Because females only have one period a year in which they are
receptive to mating, figuring out the mating problem is critical to
saving pandas, one of the most endangered species in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Yang Yang and Lun Lun will be treated like kings and queens,
he said. Their building will include a bamboo storage area with
horizontal stalks, misting to ensure optimal food quality, and four
dens. Three dens are intended as porches, the other for
``cubbing,'' in the optimistic hope for future panda breeding, Zoo
Atlanta said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Though October is the likely opening date, with luck, Atlantans
might see the young pandas in September, Maple said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's hot summer climate shouldn't pose a problem, he added,
because many areas in China are just as warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited about it,'' Maple said. ``This is the
millennium animal for Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The pandas are on loan, and part of a research project involving
Zoo Atlanta scientists and researchers in China and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, the zoo will raise $4 million for the China-based
panda research program, $2 million for Zoo Atlanta's International
Giant Panda Scientific Breeding Center in Chengdu, on the road to
Tibet, and $5 million for conservation and education programs. That
phase won't be completed until December 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals have had a fair amount of mothering, but we
would like to see pandas with their mothers from 18 to 24 months,''
Maple said. ``If we can get the Chinese to see that it makes a
difference in their social skills, their emerging social skills and
then later in their mating skills, and finally in their parenting
skills,'' the decade-long study will be a success.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Teetering on the edge
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It might just be the first play of the Falcons' first
Super Bowl, a moment 33 years and two Marion Campbells in the
making. Denver's Jason Elam kicks off high and deep into the end
zone, and into whose hands should this package from heaven fall?
</P>
<P>
   A rookie pair, hands so inexperienced they don't even know
enough yet to tremble. In Tim Dwight, the Falcons must trust.
</P>
<P>
   With the right turn of a coin, Dwight will make the opening
statement of Super Bowl XXXIII. It would be an appropriate gesture,
because this sawed-off tornado from Iowa City has come to represent
the new, restless spirit of this team. He is the jitter in the
Falcons coffee, the nervous tic on their game face.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight affects a game the way a BB affects a window pane. His is
not a subtle influence
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings are still trying to figure out this maniac
who during the NFC Championship was returning kickoffs from
downtown Bloomington and catching punts over his shoulder on the
precipice of the end zone and even taking a few snaps as a
scrambling quarterback. Just as Dan Reeves still tries to decide
whether to congratulate Dwight or chew out his spleen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aggressive style,'' Dwight said. ``You can't sit back
and let the coverage team dictate what you can do. You have to
attack them first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he's fearless,'' Denver punter Tom Rouen said.
``He's going to bring it back full-blast. He's not afraid of
anything. And then he's going to dive over the top or cut
underneath you for a couple extra yards,''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy you never can underestimate,'' said Billy ``White
Shoes'' Johnson, the Falcons' coordinator of player programs and a
member of the NFL's all-time team as a punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   He is a guy many have overlooked, however, for this peculiar
duty. ``Yeah, he's too short (5 foot 8), too small (178 pounds),
can't run, too white,'' Johnson joked.
</P>
<P>
   As compensation, Dwight's developed the persona of a daredevil,
as if stuck in a constant state of proving himself. Recklessness is
a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   This aspect has captured him a bit of notice here in Super Bowl
week. Enough that he holds a daily recital about the time at Iowa
when he and some friends were in danger of missing a bus from his
dorm to downtown Iowa City. So he just kicked out a screen in his
room and jumped three stories into the snow.
</P>
<P>
   His limits are unknown because he hasn't found them yet. ``Ever
see that Mountain Dew commercial where those girls do all that
crazy stuff?'' he said. ``I try to grab some ideas from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The last eccentric act to which he will admit was going cliff
diving in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, last spring, with some imprudent
Jeep racing thrown into the mix. This has been a fairly uneventful
week for Dwight. He hasn't gone bareback riding on a mako shark or
tried distributing pro-Castro leaflets on Calle Ocho. Just a little
Jet-Skiing Monday, which to him is as tame as an afternoon nap. The
forecast is for an increasing chance of thrills Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So say that opening kickoff goes high and deep. Dwight settles
in the belly of his own end zone. It is the first play of the
Falcons first Super Bowl. But nothing is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring it out,'' he said. ``No question, it's coming
out.''

U.S. BACKS REVIEW PLAN TO END U.N. STALEMATE ON IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States threw its support Wednesday
behind a Canadian plan that would convene three expert panels to
review all aspects of Iraq's relations with the United Nations in
an effort to break a Security Council policy stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise sounds much like the comprehensive review first
proposed last year as a reward to Iraq for cooperating with
inspectors. Now, it appears to be the minimal course of action the
council may be able to agree on after U.S. and British air strikes
in December.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews of disarmament compliance, the condition of Iraqi
people living under sanctions and an accounting of the missing
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, _ 600 Kuwaitis and others _ as
well as Kuwaiti property, would form the basis for making larger
decisions later. Arab nations are particularly insistent that
Kuwaiti claims be part of the review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that in the next couple of days we will be in a
position to know whether this bridge we are trying to build will
hold the weight of the council,'' said Robert Fowler, Canada's
representative on the Security Council, after a meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would reiterate the fact that what we're talking about
is procedure, Fowler said. ``We're not now negotiating what is
going to happen in Iraq. What we're talking about is how to get to
a discussion of what's going to happen in Iraq, and on that I'm
fairly confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative, Peter Burleigh, endorsed the Canadian
proposal, now jointly proposed with Argentina, before Wednesday's
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constituting these assessment panels, as has been proposed by
the Canadians and the Argentinians, is the way to go now because
there is a deep division in the council and going to the longer
term questions now is not useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh said that in this context, the report submitted to the
council this week by the U.N. Special Commission would play a part
in the assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has rejected the report, saying that it will no longer
deal with the Special Commission, known as Unscom, or its executive
chairman, Richard Butler. The Russians, backed by China and
Malaysia, also blocked distribution of the Unscom report, which was
sent to the council on Monday. Wednesday the Netherlands and
Slovenia formally requested a lifting of the ban, and the report
can now be published.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative, did not
rule out an assessment process, although Russia wants an
unambiguous lifting of sanctions and a greater role for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in any deliberations on the future of
Iraqi policy. But speaking to reporters he cautioned that there are
still very diverse proposals on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not discussing any specific schemes,'' he said. ``We're
not yet in agreement on the concept, so before discussing options
we have to agree on concepts. We're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Celso L.N. Amorim, Brazil's representative on the council and
this month's council president, said Wednesday that he hoped the
council could agree on establishing panels within the next few
days, but he acknowledged that getting consensus on the disarmament
review would be ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada had first proposed giving the task to a combined panel
from the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. body monitoring
Iraqi compliance on nuclear weapons; the Special Commission and the
U.N. disarmament department.
</P>
<P>
   The department's undersecretary-general, Jayantha Dhanapala,
would have, under the original Canadian plan, served as chairman,
thereby giving the U.N. Secretariat preeminence over the Special
Commission, an independent body created by the Security Council.
Russia, France and China liked that plan. The Untied States and
Britain were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina then proposed an amendment making Amorim, a former
Brazilian foreign minister, chairman of the disarmament panel,
returning the oversight to the Security Council. But the role of
Unscom still remains a problem for Russia, which also wants at
least one assessment panel to visit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler of Canada said Wednesday that his aim in drafting and
then amending his government's proposal was to get the effectively
paralyzed council moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeking in this procedural mechanism to negotiate
the substance of the important issues this council has to join,''
Fowler said. Rather, he added, the aims was ``to allow the council
to decide what's next in Iraq, and above all to allow council
decisions to resume being implemented in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Since U.S. and British air strikes in mid-December, there have
been no arms inspections in Iraq.

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He came to the Americas on a revival crusade and
with a strong admonition to the world's lone remaining superpower
to redeem its sinful soul.
</P>
<P>
   While it's impossible so soon to tell the consequences of his
mission, it is hard to disagree that Pope John Paul II is one of
the most indefatigable salesmen in the history of the Roman
Catholic Church _ and not just because he occupies St. Peter's
throne.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has certainly seen its share of uninspiring,
introverted, even corrupt, pontiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But John Paul _ whether people disagree with him or not _ again
showed his talent as a pitchman during his six-day swing through
Mexico and United States, which ended Wednesday. No better
indicator was Wednesday's stirring Mass before 110,000 people at
the TWA Dome _ the biggest indoor Mass in US history.
</P>
<P>
   This latest journey helped to further cement the pope's intent
to make the church a ceaseless advocate for a ``culture of life''
that is in conflict with the ``culture of death'' the pontiff
believes has overtaken much of western society, particularly the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians must be the soul of this world,'' the pope declared
in the Mass he celebrated for 1 million people in Mexico City on
Sunday. ``They must fill the world with spirit, they must give it
life and they must cooperate in a building a new society motivated
by love and truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, many Catholics who attended events on the
tour seem to respect the pope's straightforward style _ finding it
refreshing in an age when many leaders base their message not on
conviction, but on the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's firmness and clarity was on display again Wednesday
when he harshly denounced what he portrayed as America's immoral
embrace of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in
the case of someone who has done a great evil,'' John Paul said in
Wednesday's festive Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation,
postponed an execution scheduled to take place during the pope's
visit here. On Tuesday, a papal spokesman called the postponement
``a mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope said that ``modern society has the means of protecting
itself without definitively denying criminals the chance to
reform'' and appealed for a ``consensus to end the death penalty,
which is both cruel and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called on Catholics to bring renewed respect to the
family ``as the primary and most vital foundation of society,''
invited disaffected Catholics back ``to the community of faith''
and termed racism ``one of the most persistent and destructive
evils of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning Liturgy was a monumental logistics challenge.
Hundreds of buses arriving from pickup points across the
metropolitan area begun unloading worshipers at 4 a.m., five and a
half hours before the pope arrived. More than 1,000 priests were
called on to dispense Holy Communion to the far corners of the vast
arena, which was temporarily converted into a cavernous cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pontiff also spoke at an ecumenical and
interfaith prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica St. Louis and
met with Vice President Al Gore at Lambert-St. Louis International
Airport before boarding his flight home to Rome. At the end of his
85th pilgrimmage, John Paul looked weary.
</P>
<P>
   But not even declining health could stop John Paul from
traveling to countries home to the world's second and third largest
Catholic populations _ Mexico and the United States, respectively _
to tell his flock of their responsibility to carry a message of
justice and piety into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of his trip was the blueprint he unveiled in
Mexico City in which he described the church's mission in the
Americas to build a more egalitarian future by ministering to poor
and rich alike.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said the pope's apostolic exhortation _ the first time
a pontiff has articulated a master plan for this part of the world
_ would give local parishes across the Americas a clear and
unifying purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Despite at times stern and pessimistic views of the world, John
Paul repeatedly expressed hope for the future, strongly believing
in human society's capacity for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``America, if you want peace, work for justice,'' John Paul said
during his last major speech Wednesday. ``If you want justice,
defend life. If want life, embrace the truth _ the truth revealed
by God.''

SENATE VOTES AGAINST DISMISSING IMPEACHMENT CHARGES AND FOR TAKING
DEPOSTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: IMPEACH-ASSESS, IMPEACH-SCENE,
IMPEACH-WITNESSES, IMPEACH-CLINTON-DAY, IMPEACH-FEINGOLD)

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dividing almost precisely along party lines, the
Senate voted on Wednesday to summon Monica Lewinsky and two other
witnesses for depositions in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton. Minutes earlier, it had voted against dismissing the
charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The roll calls were identical, 56-44, with only a single
senator, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, a Democrat, breaking from
party colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans prevailed, they could muster nothing
approaching the 67 votes _ a two-thirds majority _ required to
convict the president. Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader, said that the 44 votes for dismissal demonstrated
that ``the president will not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way forward was far from clear. The procedural agreement
reached by the two parties on Jan. 8 brought the Senate this far,
but now they have reached the edge of the map. As the Senate
recessed until Thursday afternoon, senators broke up into clumps to
exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Then action shifted outside the chamber. Daschle and his
Republican counterpart, the majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, conferred at length by telephone and through their
aides, exchanging written proposals in an effort to reach a new
modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement was at hand Wednesday night, but Lott said issues
had been narrowed. He hoped to have something solid when the Senate
reconvened, he said, with depositions beginning over the weekend
and concluding by Monday. The trial would be completed, the leader
suggested, before Feb. 12, ``barring some bolt-of-lightning
discovery that we don't now see.''
</P>
<P>
   That timetable would allow about 10 weekdays for the Senate to
review the depositions, for the White House to call any witnesses
it wished to, and for other motions, plus 15-minute closing
statements by each of the 100 senators. To meet it, things would
have to move along without many hitches.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries were jammed and silent for the roll calls. As the
clerk called their names, the senators stood, one by one, and
called out their votes, yea or nay. The clerk read each vote back.
The House prosecutors and the defense lawyers sat at their tables
in the well of the Senate, flanking the dais, and kept tallies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote authorized the issuance of subpoenas to Ms.
Lewinsky as well as to Vernon Jordan, Clinton's golfing partner and
confidant, and Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide. They will be
interviewed by the House prosecutors with other lawyers present,
and their testimony will be videotaped. The transcripts and the
tapes will then be shown to all the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be settled were the schedule and duration of the
depositions. Once they have been taken, the Senate will have to
decide whether to call the witnesses to the floor for ``live''
testimony. It also has to decide how much leeway to give the White
House counsels to call their own witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that lies the largest question: When will it all end?
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by impeachment arithmetic. The
Republicans have 55 votes, enough to keep the trial going and to
prevail on many major procedural issues. They could even muscle
through a timetable for the last phase of the trial, but that would
mar the bipartisan gloss they have worked to preserve. And they
lack the votes to control the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he was confident that a compromise procedure could
be worked out. But this will depend on the stance of the White
House and on the willingness of the Democratic senators to go along
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful,'' Daschle said late Wednesday afternoon, ``that
we will have a procedural plan to offer to our caucuses at some
point tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials issued seemingly conflicting statements,
and a person with knowledge of strategy sessions there said
disagreements had developed between Charles F.C. Ruff, the White
House counsel, who reportedly wants to conclude as soon as
possible, and David Kendall, Clinton's main outside lawyer, who
favors a lengthy period of preliminary evidence-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a special White House counsel, argued in a
statement issued on Capitol Hill that ``any proceedings from this
day forward only serve to delay the final resolution of this matter
and run counter to the best interests of the Congress, the
presidency and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, said the White House
deserved the chance to review 56,000 pages of evidence, still
secret, that the House collected during its impeachment
investigation. He asserted that Senate Republicans were ``trying to
put a blindfold on us'' and added, ``We believe we ought to have an
adequate chance to get prepared and to present a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another roadblock to a procedural agreement, at least
temporarily, was the desire of some Republican senators to see the
result of the depositions before committing themselves to a date
for the end of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate
Republican, was one of the frameworks discussed on Wednesday by
Lott and Daschle. He suggested giving attorneys for each side a
total of three hours to question the witnesses, allowing one
senator from each party to sit in on the questioning, with the
interview videotaped for later viewing by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators suggested that this could be accomplished by
Sunday night, or Monday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second proposal was bipartisan, with support from Sens.
Olympia Snowe of Maine and Sam Brownback of Kansas, both
Republicans, and Charles Schumer of New York and Tom Harkin of
Iowa, both Democrats. It would require the White House to state by
5 p.m. on Saturday whether it wished to depose witnesses.
Videotapes of all witnesses would be presented next Monday, and a
final Senate vote would be taken no later than Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House decided to call witnesses, the dates would be
pushed back, with the culminating vote scheduled for Thursday, Feb.
11. Friday, Feb. 12 is the start of the long President's Day
weekend, and the prospect of long weekends always tends to
concentrate the minds of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   There are two charges involved: perjury and obstruction of
justice. Several senators have suggested that they take the second
one more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Feingold, a 45-year-old maverick from a state
with a long-standing tradition of independence. A backer of
campaign finance reform, he ran for re-election last fall without
contributions from political action committees, against the advice
of his party leaders, and won handily.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a statement that he could not yet say that ``the
House managers cannot prevail,'' although he conceded that he found
serious problems with their case. He was unwilling to ``improperly
short-circuit this trial,'' he said, but this did not mean he would
vote to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's votes were expected by some of his party colleagues,
but everyone was shocked when Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., voted
against the motion of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia to dismiss
the charges and bring the trial to an immediate halt. She caught
herself in a matter of seconds and put a question to Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an appropriate time, I wish to state I made an error in my
vote,'' she said. ``I want to vote yes. May I do that now, or wait
until the end?''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist told her to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vote yes,'' Ms. Mikulski said, as laughter pierced the hush.
</P>
<P>
   While senators worked on a new road map, the House Republican
prosecutors made their assignments for the deposition. Ms.
Lewinsky, much the most important witness, will be questioned by
Rep. Ed Bryant, a soft-spoken Tennesseean. He was chosen, one
manager said, because he was the questioner Ms. Lewinsky disliked
least when she met with several of the managers last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas will interrogate Jordan, and
Rep. James Rogan of California will interrogate Blumenthal.

RIOT POLICE, ANGRY QUAKE VICTIMS CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON AND KIRK SEMPLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ Desperate and hungry victims of the
Colombian earthquake took to the streets Wednesday, looting stores
and fighting with riot police, as a stumbling relief effort was
slow to deliver necessities to hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Mobs in the Andean city of Armenia, devastated by Monday's
quake, broke down metal doors at various supermarkets and carted
off food and household goods in sacks, garbage bags, and shopping
carts.
</P>
<P>
   As the Red Cross death toll rose to 878 with more than 3,420
people injured late Wednesday, police in Armenia resorted to
swinging nightclubs and kicking looters in a vain attempt to
restore order. Reinforcing the authorities were uniformed army
soldiers and squads of secret police, who fired into the air to
scatter the crowds, some hurling stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, not even one glass of water has arrived!'' a reporter
for the Colombian TV network Caracol screamed at a government
official in a southern neighborhood of Armenia, a city of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before an unsalvagable tangle of metal that was once his tiny
convenience store, an unshaven Renal Lopez, eyes red with fatigue,
said he was blessed that he survived _ but he had no idea what he
would do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years here I never thought I'd see my town so
destroyed,'' Lopez said. ``This looks like something from a
Hollywood movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The death count was expected to rise as more debris was cleared.
Search and rescue officials say they expect the death toll to
eventually exceed 1,000 in the 17 cities, towns and villages rocked
by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross that estimated 90 percent of the buildings in some
of Armenia's poorer neighbors were destroyed. At least six people
were injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the street disturbances in Armenia, a visibly
anguished President Andres Pastrana flew here to tour the disaster
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the plane, Pastrana was shown on live TV
gesturing angrily and locked in heated discussion with his widely
criticized interior minister, who has been running the relief
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens around this South American nation donated tons of
supplies and necessities, including clothes, blankets, medicine,
crutches, and coffins. Money filled several bank accounts that were
established Monday to receive relief donations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Pastrana said that the government had hired a
foreign company to manage the donated funds, perhaps in an effort
to avoid the sort of problems that occurred after the 1985 eruption
of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano, which caused an avalance that
buried 25,000 people. Much of that aid money vanished, allegedly
into the hands of corrupt government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Clinton administration promised $8 million in and
technical assistance and relief supplies, including 8,000 blankets.
</P>
<P>
   But across this lush western region, filled with coffee and
banana farms, the aid is too little, too late. The shock and horror
that has shaken residents here gave way Wednesday to chaos and
anger _ at life, at the rescue workers and government officials who
they say aren't working fast enough to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Even as rescue workers were sifting through rubble in search of
more bodies just a few blocks away, the mobs moved like platoons
through the business district, ransacking stores and tossing stolen
goods to hungry people who waited on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Without basic necessities for more than two days, looters argued
and fought among themselves as they scrambled for powdered milk and
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no food, no milk and no water, but we have to do
whatever we can,'' said Luis Alfonso Gonzales, 44, a father of six,
said after he came out with a plastic bag of vegetables and rice he
had stolen from a market on Luker Street. ``The only ones the
government protects are the business people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Police and army troops, for the most part, stood
by passively as the crowds moved from shop to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're angry, and I don't think there's any way I can stop
them,'' said one military officer who held up his hands to show
that he was unarmed. Minutes afterward, however, the looters were
dispersed by two dozen riot police.
</P>
<P>
   Another police officer, Alvaro Andres Serna, 23, said he had
seen ``lots of delinquency'' and doubted whether the goverment
could restore order anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have lost everything they have in just 15
seconds, '' said Serna. ``Things are going to get worse before they
can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a downpour halted looting for a time, but the mobs returned
after the shower ended.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, people formed block-long lines at relief
stations for food and clothes. The streets in the center of town
were jammed with trucks, ambulances, motorcycles and pedestrians,
all of which formed a massive chaotic exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stayed watched rescue dramas from one of the thousands
of makeshift tents _ built out of spare branches and garbage bags.
</P>
<P>
   At the corner of 18th Ave. and 24th St. at about 4 p.m., a man
wearing a blue soccer shirt shouted from a pile of bricks and
stones that were once an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sheet! A sheet!'' he cried out to other rescue workers, who
passed him a large blue one. It was used to wrap Rosa Elena
Valencia's body.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old woman owned a small furniture store on the
ground floor of the building. Her corpse was carried in the sheet
to a nearby corner where rescuers then sprinkled limestone on her
to help preserve her already decomposing body. Her two sisters
shrieked as workers lifted Valencia's body onto a waiting truck.
One of her black shoes was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a wonderful woman,'' cried Lopez, the owner of the
ruined convenience store. ``She taught me about business. There's
another friend I've lost.''

REHEARING DENIED IN DEMOULAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' highest court Wednesday cut off one of
the last remaining avenues for the patriarch of the feuding
Demoulas clan as he tries to prevent his late brother's children
from taking control of the family's $2 billion supermarket empire.
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to patriarch Telemachus ``Mike'' Demoulas say the
long-running legal burlesque _ now entering its ninth year _ is far
from over, and may result in a US Supreme Court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Demoulas' lawyers had hoped to overturn verdicts that found
their client guilty of defrauding his brother's heirs by arguing
that the judge in the case was biased. After the Supreme Judicial
Court rejected that claim last month, the lawyers asked for a
rehearing, but the SJC denied that request Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Judicial Conduct Commission on Jan. 22 also
rejected the Demoulas lawyers' complaint that the judge, Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Maria I. Lopez, was biased.
</P>
<P>
   The case now goes back to Middlesex Superior Court, where Lopez
will reconsider whether to transfer a crucial 400 shares of stock
from Mike's children to the children of his brother, George, who
died in 1971. George's children sued in 1990 when they alleged
that, even as he pledged to protect their interests, their Uncle
Mike was secretly stealing their stock in the company he and George
had built up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Demoulas and his lawyers had no comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Lopez is gratified that the court has dismissed a
complaint that had no basis in fact or in law,'' said her lawyer,
Michael E. Mone,, adding that Lopez could not comment because she
is still overseeing the Demoulas case, and that he commented only
because the judicial conduct commission complaint had been widely
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The city's legal community, a large portion of which has been
involved in the case at some point, commonly refers to the family
feud as the case that won't end. And indeed, Wednesday, allies of
Mike Demoulas said they had many avenues still open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far from dead,'' said one source close to Mike
Demoulas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have 90 days after the original SJC decision, on
Dec. 22, to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   They will almost certainly appeal a decision if Lopez awards the
400 shares to George's children. Those 400 shares determine who
controls the board of the company, still privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawyers for Mike Demoulas may try to use statements
made by Lopez's former law clerk to argue again that the judge was
biased in the case. But those statements are tangled up in a
separate mess, in which the US Justice Department is investigating
whether Mike Demoulas' lawyers acted illegally in trying to get the
clerk, Paul Walsh, to say Lopez was biased.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mike Demoulas are said to be differing over whether
to press that case.

 &HT;    Party lines, mood set solid before vote
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This was one of those moments of ginned-up drama
such as politics produces from time to time, when the outcome was
as certain as an inauguration, but the galleries were packed to
standing room and the audience hung on every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in the quiet, the senators wait to be counted,'' intoned
the Senate's velvet-voiced chaplain, Lloyd John Ogilvie, in the
prayer which opened this decision-making day. ``Our times are in
Your hands.'' Then the counting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abraham?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Akaka?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the roll the count went on, almost plumb-straight along
party lines, the votes to dismiss the charges against Bill Clinton
and to permit the deposition of witnesses breaking down into
mirror-image yeas and nays.
</P>
<P>
   Assuaged by the three-witness limit, Republicans such as Richard
Shelby of Alabama and Olympia Snowe of Maine who had voiced doubts
about calling any witnesses, found their way back into the GOP
fold. Among the Democrats only Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who last
fall refused to accept soft-money advertising from his party, broke
ranks. It was as close to unanimous as that party gets.
</P>
<P>
   The only ripple of surprise was probably caused by the flu.
Ailing Democrat Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who came to the
session after being hospitalized the night before, cast her vote
against dismissal, then quickly rose to correct herself.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) described it later, the
atmosphere during the two evenings of closed-session debate
preceding the votes was markedly different than the outcome. ``With
the exception of two or three, you couldn't tell who was a Democrat
and who was a Republican,'' Kennedy said of the closed-door
discussions, unwinding with reporters in a plush hideaway office
decorated with Kennedy family bric-a brac, including one of
President Kennedy's rocking chairs and a chess set with pieces
depicting Irish politicians. His sisters, former ambassador to
Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, and Pat Lawford, chatted in another
corner of the room as the Massachusetts senator held court.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the closed-door bipartisanship, it was clear the
party lines were solidified well before the vote. Kennedy said by
Wednesday morning there was no suspense among the Democrats about
how their wavering members would vote. ``The word got out
yesterday, we got 'em,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by that certainty, the Democrats who paused to talk
with reporters throughout the day had a relatively easy time
sticking to their party's line. ``If more than 34 Democrats vote
for dismissal, this now becomes (Majority Leader) Trent Lott's
case,'' Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois told reporters in a
basement hallway before the vote. In other words, prolonging the
trial after a clear demonstration there are not enough votes to
remove Clinton from office puts the responsibility for prolonging
it in Republican hands, in the eyes of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, it becomes the majority party's trial,'' echoed
Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) at the first-floor
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republican senators, the hallway spin was a more
difficult task, because they had to walk a fine line between their
Democratic opponents and their own, increasingly frustrated House
impeachment managers. ``We don't want this to be the O.J. trial,
where the judge let it get out of hand,'' Sen. Robert Bennett of
Utah said, defending the decision to limit the depositions to only
three witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If they did not want to go the way of Judge Ito, the Republicans
were also loathe to bring it to a too-easy conclusion _ as an
object lesson to all parties. The Senate should ``make this so
difficult the institutions will always think long and hard about
bringing up impeachment,'' said Snowe.
</P>
<P>
   That task at least was accomplished, to judge from the weary
looks on the faces of the House managers, many of whom began
leaving town Wednesday afternoon as Lott and Minority Leader Tom
Daschle wrangled over procedure for the next few miles of this
uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating,'' said Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, the most
ardent advocate of impeachment, as he left to catch a plane back to
Atlanta. ``You need to get back to the real world.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: 'You're in the dang Super Bowl'
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Robbie Tobeck and Bob Hallen were driving back from
Shula's Steak House when realization hit. Tobeck reached over and
smacked his fellow lineman's leg. ``You know what?'' Tobeck said.
``You're playing in the dang Super Bowl this Sunday!''
</P>
<P>
   It happened Tuesday night, two full days after the Falcons
arrived here, more than a week after they won the NFC Championship
Game. But you have to understand: These are the Falcons. It's as if
they're waiting for the NFL to check the tape of their game with
Minnesota and, after further review, declare the pedigreed Vikings
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to pinch yourself a little,'' said Hallen, a
rookie. ``Most of our veterans aren't used to playing in January.''
</P>
<P>
   A franchise that had won two playoff games in its first 32 years
stands one game from the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Falcons' logo
is painted in one end zone of Pro Player Stadium, site of Super
Bowl XXIII. A Falcons' banner flies on flagpoles, right alongside
Denver's. External evidence indicates that, yes, this long-lost
organization has met Super standards. But internally it feels --
how?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit surreal down here,'' said Lester Archambeau,
a Stanford man. ``It's like, `Why are we in Miami? We should be
back (practicing) in Suwanee.'... When we walked off the field in
Minneapolis, you had to remind yourself that it wasn't just another
game to win. I felt numb that day, and that's the way I feel about
the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve seasons with the Falcons, Jessie Tuggle awoke the morning
after the Minnesota passion play and wondered why he was still
dreaming. ``It didn't seem real,'' Tuggle said. ``I had to ask
myself, `Did we win the NFC Championship? Is this real?' My
neighbors put stickers and balloons all over the place that was
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   A measure of shock prevails even today. Falcons in the Super
Bowl? Maybe in some Bizarro World. In real life, the Falcons are
always going to lose a lead, have a punt blocked, blow a coverage.
Aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Bennett came to the Falcons in 1996, having been a
Super participant four times with Buffalo. ``I never thought I'd be
back in this game,'' he said. ``If I said I did, I'd be telling a
big lie. I hoped to make the team respectable, hopefully a playoff
contender. But that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the national media views the Falcons with scorn would be
incorrect. The Falcons are seen more as a feel-good novelty, a
working-class stiff who buys a lottery ticket every day and then,
33 years on, hits the Powerball. Tell us your background, the press
corps beseeches daily: Start at the beginning and include all
pertinent anecdotes illustrating failure and frustration. Said
Archambeau: ``It's kind of funny, watching the competition between
media people, the jockeying for position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely weird,'' Hallen said about Tuesday's Media Day.
``For me, that was when it started to sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the message gotten all the way through? Probably not. These,
after all, are the Falcons. Come Sunday, you half-expect each of
them to look in the mirror and say: ``You know what? You're playing
in the dang Super Bowl today! Yes, you!''

 &HT;    Cow town? Denver just a big city on the mooooo-ve
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Wasted Friday Afternoon Club was coming to order,
the usual crew of professors, reporters and city functionaries
gathering in their favorite Lower Downtown brewpub, the Wynkoop.
The topic, as suggested by beers with names like Blowout Stout and
Dirty Bird Bitter, was the Super Bowl. More to the point, the
wastrels were entertaining a visitor who had the temerity to ask
how Atlantans should go about building a healthy hate for their new
gridiron rival: What, exactly, was there to dislike about Denver?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's that Russell thing,'' began Tom Noel, a history
professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, as a server
downloaded a half-pound buffalo burger.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that Russell thing _ the dirty little secret of Denver's
founding. It seems that Dan Reeves wasn't the first Georgian to get
a raw deal in Colorado. A century and a quarter before the Broncos
dumped the coach who had taken them to three Super Bowls, another
Georgian named William Green Russell also left town under
controversy. This Georgian happened to have founded the place.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, a prospector from Dahlonega, led a group of Georgians
out west in 1858 and struck gold along the South Platte River. When
the Civil War broke out, he returned to Georgia, only to have his
claim in the Colorado territory jumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chased him out, I think, because he was a Southerner,''
Noel said. ``Denver probably ought be be named Russellville. It
doesn't seem right that there's nothing named for him.'' Actually,
there is one thing in the suburbs: Russell Gulch. The man was
Denver's first settler, and all he gets is a lousy ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Denver is a nice city. Pretty scenery. Friendly folks. A
young, go-go place that reminds you of Atlanta (only smaller).
</P>
<P>
   But enough pleasantries. This is the Super Bowl, and if you
can't put on a game face and work up some animosity for your
opponent _ even an amiable one like Denver _ maybe you aren't ready
for the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, here are some tips for learning to dislike
the home of the Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   What's that smell? Denver is as touchy about its image as
Atlanta is. While Atlanta leaders live in fear that someone will
discover a Rebel flag in the laundry, Denver cringes at being
called a ``cow town.'' It's a sophisticated New West metropolis,
Denverites will have you know, with the highest education rate and
the largest park system and the best support for the arts of any
major American city. But a couple of times a year, all such
protestations go for naught as the winds shift and the giant
feedlots north of town fill Denver with an unmistakable reminder of
its Western roots _ ``the aroma of bovus excrementa,'' as
Councilman Dennis Gallagher calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Bring plenty of underwear. You'd think the home of Samsonite
would do a better job of handling luggage. When Denver's new
airport opened in 1995, 16 months late and $3.2 billion over
budget, it drew international ridicule for a state-of-the-art
automated baggage-handling system that mangled and lost countless
bags. Only by spending another $61 million on a conventional system
was the airport able to get the fiasco under control.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't we see this in ``The Godfather''? The hot Broncos
souvenir of the moment is a foam horse head that you wear like a
hat. They're selling for $50 at the Gart Brothers Sports Castle,
which Denverites say is the world's largest sporting goods store.
Standing outside last weekend, Broncos fan Hector Reyes thought the
horse head was one offer he could refuse: ``Fifty dollars! You
think they charge that much for cheeseheads in Wisconsin?''
</P>
<P>
   Denver, John. After the Colorado singer died in a plane crash, a
member of the Denver City Council launched a campaign to designate
``Rocky Mountain High'' the state song. It didn't get far. That
leaves Colorado with ``Where the Columbines Grow,'' an obscure
anthem that no one seems to know. Out of the whole table at the
Wasted Friday Afternoon Club, only one person, Councilman
Gallagher, knew how it went. He sang a couple of lines, then grew
bored and switched to another song _ a ditty about Alfred Packer,
an infamous 19th century Coloradan who was jailed for murder and
cannibalism. ``He loved his fellow man,'' Gallagher crooned, ``with
sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   They eat strange things. No, not each other. We're talking about
Rocky Mountain oysters, breaded and fried livestock testicles,
served at Coors Field and other places around town. Think of it as
cowboy Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Honest John. If you need a car, John Elway is your man. The
Broncos quarterback sells everything from Broncos to Rams at 17
dealerships that carry his name. John Elway AutoNation USA is part
of a national chain of car lots founded by former Florida Marlins
owner (and therefore tool of Satan) Wayne Huizenga. That's right;
Elway works for the man whose mercenaries kept the Braves out of
the World Series. There are so many Elway dealerships in Denver
that it takes a 12-page section in the weekend newspapers to
contain the ads. That's Elway on the front, ``John'' stitched on
his pocket, flashing that horsy grin that led one opposing player
to call him ``Mr. Ed.'' Have a complaint? ``Tell it to John,''
advises the headline, as if Elway will check the transmission as
soon as he's finished changing the oil.
</P>
<P>
   If it's good enough for horses... Speaking of endorsements,
Broncos receiver Ed McCaffrey has his own brand of honey nut oat
cereal, Ed's End Zone O's. Down, John.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, please. Denver is enemy territory in the Cola Wars. The
school district signed a $5.7 million deal to give Pepsi exclusive
rights to sell at Denver schools. And the arena under construction
for the basketball Nuggets and hockey Avalanche will be called _
you guessed it _ the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Dynasty'' skyline. The oil bust of the '80s hit Denver
hard _ which explains why its skyline, all flat-tops and reflective
glass, looks as dated as Krystle Carrington's TV wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Those uniforms. A couple of seasons ago, the Broncos ditched
their orange jerseys for a snazzier design that's blue with orange
stripes running down the side. Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders said
they looked like Junior Samples wearing orange suspenders on ``Hee
Haw.'' Many Denverites despised them, too, and not just for
aesthetic reasons. They believe that Nike, which designed the
uniforms, cleverly slipped in its corporate logo, turning the
Broncos into pack mules for shoe sales. ``If you really look at the
horse on the helmet, you can see at least three Swooshes in
there,'' says Dick Kreck, a columnist for The Denver Post.
</P>
<P>
   Californians. As in Atlanta, a majority of Denver's population
moved from somewhere else. The largest and least-liked group comes
from California _ hence the term Californicated. ``They're our
damnyankees,'' Noel says. Not only are Californians unable to drive
in the snow, but they drive up home prices and (this is
unforgivable) pull for the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Boot. Not what the Broncos did to Coach Reeves. The
boot is a 12-pound steel device that police lock onto automobile
wheels to prevent repeat parking offenders from driving away to
terrorize the populace. If you've ever been booted, you'll want to
give a Mile High Salute of a different sort to Frank P. Marugg, the
Denverite who invented the thing in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Thick and thin. Do thin people who eat whatever they want and
stay thin drive you crazy? That's Denver. A 1997 federal study
found that Denver had the lowest obesity rate of any major U.S.
city _ a fact that surprised nobody in this fitness-obsessed place
where half the population seems to have the body fat of elk jerky.
At the same time, Denver claims to make more beer than any American
city, with more than 30 microbreweries and Coors headquartered in
the suburbs. The city also boasts that it's the birthplace of the
cheeseburger; there's a plaque marking the spot where Louis Ballast
of the Humpty Dumpty drive-in first laid fromage to patty in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   A mile high and dry. Denver Mayor Wellington Webb likes to say
that his city is a mile closer to heaven. The celestial atmosphere
is tough on earthly flesh. Denver's thin, arid environment leaves
newcomers perpetually thirsty, dry-skinned and sun-blistered. The
fine dust blowing in off the plains doesn't help either. ``Oil of
Olay just loves us,'' says Kate Hawthorne, an editor at Weaver
Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shane. You thought your ``friend in the diamond business''
was from Atlanta? Think again. For years, the discount jeweler has
run radio commercials notable for his whiny, dental-drill voice.
When he isn't in Antwerp buying gemstones, His Nasalnessresides in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic slalom. Denver may be the only city ever awarded the
Games to turn them down. The International Olympic Committee voted
to hold the 1976 Winter Games in Denver, but Colorado voters backed
out because they didn't want to be stuck with the bill or the
environmental damage. While refusing the IOC might seem admirable,
Denver did not keep the courage of its convictions. Now that it
sees how profitable the Olympics have become, the city has reversed
course and started bidding again.
</P>
<P>
   They can't handle success. Last year, when the Broncos finally
won the Super Bowl on their fifth try, Denverites did something
very un-Denverlike. They lost control. At the victory celebration
downtown, revelers set fire to trash cans and overturned a car in a
near-riot that had to be dispersed with police tear gas. No
right-thinking Atlantan would wish such a calamity upon Denver
again.

 &HT;    Broncos on guard against a mismatch
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As Dan Neil stood on the visitor's sideline at the
Georgia Dome nearly 16 months ago, the rookie guard watched the
play of Travis Hall and hoped he wouldn't have to face the Falcons
defensive tackle anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 72 hours, time runs out on Neil, in his first
season as the Broncos starting right guard and the
least-experienced member of the league's best blocking unit.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of going one-on-one against Hall brings high
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when I was watching him, I thought he was a pretty
special player, and now he's even better, because he's a lot more
complete,'' Neil said Wednesday. ``For people who haven't heard
much of him, they're going to be surprised. He's really playing the
run better than he did in '97. It's going to be a test for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several coaches suggested that the Neil-Hall confrontation could
be the key matchup of the game. Hall certainly has an edge. But
Denver assistant head coach Alex Gibbs probably will use center Tom
Nalen to double-team Hall. One of Denver's staple plays, the
``counter gun,'' includes that double-team.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth season, Hall has emerged as one of the NFL's top
tackles. Even though Hall battled injuries much of the season,
personnel directors still regard him as a Pro Bowl player. He
finished the regular season with 73 tackles and 4 1/2 sacks and in
two postseason victories had seven tackles, a forced fumble and a
fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Wednesday that the way the Broncos block will force
the Atlanta line, accustomed to facing larger opponents, to make
some unusual adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different type of line,'' Hall said. ``They're a lot
quicker, across the board than just about any line we've played all
year. You have lighter guys with a lot of speed. You have to be
aware of the cut blocks and the quick reaches. Their whole thing is
to get you into a bad position. They get you running all over the
place, and they try to take advantage of the angles. In essence,
they want you to run yourself out of a play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' third-round choice in the 1997 draft, Neil is
typical of the fast, athletic lineman Gibbs favors. He has
deceptive strength and pulls well on the often-used traps and toss
plays. Gibbs would have preferred to groom Neil for another season
or two, but the departure of free agent Brian Habib pushed Neil
into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Neil has been inconsistent at times, but he played well enough
to earn the confidence of his coaches and teammates, some of whom
see a Pro Bowl in his future. He'll grow up a little more on
Sunday... or be embarrassed by Hall.

 &HT;    BRONCOS RUNNING VS. FALCONS RUN DEFENSE
 &HT;    Small Denver offensive line is also among NFL's best
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   For the Atlanta Falcons defense to shut down the Denver Broncos
running game Sunday, it will have to slow some of the most athletic
players in the NFL. And not all of them are named Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   While the former University of Georgia tailback became just the
fourth man in NFL history to rush for 2,000 or more yards, the
Broncos spread the blocking tasks all over the place and made the
protection of Davis a collaborative effort.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded fullback Howard Griffith continued to be one of the
finest lead blockers in the league. The downfield blocks of wide
receivers Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey helped Davis lead the NFL in
rushes of 10 yards or more. In his ninth season, tight end Shannon
Sharpe, always a willing blocker, got more physical.
</P>
<P>
   And the offensive line, coached by the eccentric but innovative
Alex Gibbs and relying as much on quickness as on muscle, knocked
the tar out of opposing defenses. It is an unusual collection that
mirrors the mindset of its leader and is among the smartest in the
league. It also is a unit that will cause problems for the Falcons
early in the game, some NFL coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're different, and I think Atlanta is going to have to
make some adjustments once they get into the game and get a
real-life feel for how Denver plays,'' said new Kansas City coach
Gunther Cunningham, recently promoted from Chiefs defensive
coordinator. ``The Falcons have had success with their own
quickness in the front seven, and they match up well against
(offensive lines) that are bigger than they are. It will be
interesting to see how they do against a line that's every bit as
quick and athletic as them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lean and mean
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, in their 38-3 divisional-round victory, the
Broncos mauled the Miami Dolphins' front seven, the quickest in the
NFL. The Dolphins played without two injured defensive line
starters, and the Denver blockers knocked the Dolphins off the ball
on every snap.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who rushed for 199 yards despite playing just 2 1/2
quarters, usually got 2 or 3 yards of penetration into the defense
before the first hit. The Denver star had ample time to locate his
cutback lanes or burst to the edge when the Broncos ran toss plays
to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``seal block'' taught by Gibbs isn't as
revolutionary as some people have made it out to be, Denver
blockers are proficient at them. The Atlanta front seven will have
to be wary of overpursuing Davis, having him cut back and then
getting chopped down or shielded off when they turn back to chase.
The Broncos aren't timid about using some of the chop-block
techniques taught by the 49ers for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver line also is a tough-minded unit. It is the lightest
in the NFL, with an average weight of just 286 pounds, and the
group plays with a collective chip on its shoulder. It also is
well-schooled in the nuances of offensive line play _ leverage,
hand placement, foot quickness and attention to detail. Often
overlooked when evaluating the Broncos is the hand strength of
their players. Denver linemen maintain their blocks better than any
others in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a pride factor in being so technically
sound,'' said left tackle Tony Jones, a native of Royston. ``But we
take a lot of pride, too, in putting (defenders) on their rear
ends. You come out of a game with us and you know you had a
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs also is a master at identifying which of his linemen has
the toughest individual matchup in a contest and then constructing
the entire game plan to protect that player. Observers have guessed
that that matchup for the Super Bowl is second-year right guard Dan
Neil against Falcons tackle Travis Hall. No one should be surprised
if Neil gets plenty of help on Sunday from Pro Bowl center Tom
Nalen against Atlanta's most active interior defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely scheme to cover up for their weakest link,''
former NFL quarterback Hugh Millen said.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons no pushovers
</P>
<P>
   The play of the line is of course enhanced by Davis, who has
splendid vision, balance and body lean. He is rarely knocked back
and seems to bleed every inch out of every rushing attempt. More
quick than fast, he may lack some stopwatch speed, but he is
incredibly elusive in the secondary. Against the Dolphins, he
turned an outside toss to the right into a 20-yard touchdown run
when he deked free safety Brock Marion and cornerback Sam Madison
with deft cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hit Davis high, San Diego linebacker Junior Seau said, and he's
strong enough to break arm tackles. Go for his legs, Seau said, and
he can sidestep the tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Falcons is that they have done a
remarkable job of containing most of the quality backs they faced
in 1998. The only runner to have a 100-yard game against Atlanta
was Curtis Martin of the Jets. The longest run against Atlanta was
a 32-yarder by San Francisco fullback Marc Edwards, and no
``feature'' back had a gain of more than 20 yards against the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons ranked second against the run, and in eight of 18
games the longest gain was 10 yards or less. In five of their
games, the longest rush was a quarterback scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get into the secondary very easily against them,''
Davis said. ``They force you to earn every inch you get.''

REHEARING DENIED IN DEMOULAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' highest court Wednesday cut off one of
the last remaining avenues for the patriarch of the feuding
Demoulas clan as he tries to prevent his late brother's children
from taking control of the family's $2 billion supermarket empire.
</P>
<P>
   But advisers to patriarch Telemachus ``Mike'' Demoulas say the
long-running legal burlesque _ now entering its ninth year _ is far
from over, and may result in a US Supreme Court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Demoulas' lawyers had hoped to overturn verdicts that found
their client guilty of defrauding his brother's heirs by arguing
that the judge in the case was biased. After the Supreme Judicial
Court rejected that claim last month, the lawyers asked for a
rehearing, but the SJC denied that request Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Judicial Conduct Commission on Jan. 22 also
rejected the Demoulas lawyers' complaint that the judge, Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Maria I. Lopez, was biased.
</P>
<P>
   The case now goes back to Middlesex Superior Court, where Lopez
will reconsider whether to transfer a crucial 400 shares of stock
from Mike's children to the children of his brother, George, who
died in 1971. George's children sued in 1990 when they alleged
that, even as he pledged to protect their interests, their Uncle
Mike was secretly stealing their stock in the company he and George
had built up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Demoulas and his lawyers had no comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Lopez is gratified that the court has dismissed a
complaint that had no basis in fact or in law,'' said her lawyer,
Michael E. Mone,, adding that Lopez could not comment because she
is still overseeing the Demoulas case, and that he commented only
because the judicial conduct commission complaint had been widely
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The city's legal community, a large portion of which has been
involved in the case at some point, commonly refers to the family
feud as the case that won't end. And indeed, Wednesday, allies of
Mike Demoulas said they had many avenues still open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far from dead,'' said one source close to Mike
Demoulas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have 90 days after the original SJC decision, on
Dec. 22, to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   They will almost certainly appeal a decision if Lopez awards the
400 shares to George's children. Those 400 shares determine who
controls the board of the company, still privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawyers for Mike Demoulas may try to use statements
made by Lopez's former law clerk to argue again that the judge was
biased in the case. But those statements are tangled up in a
separate mess, in which the US Justice Department is investigating
whether Mike Demoulas' lawyers acted illegally in trying to get the
clerk, Paul Walsh, to say Lopez was biased.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mike Demoulas are said to be differing over whether
to press that case.

 &HT;    Barnes emphasizes transportation agency, health care in first
State of State address
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes cast himself as a populist advocate in
his first State of the State address Wednesday, promising to
protect Georgians from the ills of managed care, higher insurance
rates and lying lobbyists who oppose his plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour speech to the House and Senate, Barnes made his
most forceful pitch yet for the key points in his legislative
agenda _ cracking down on HMOs and creating a new transportation
super-agency to deal with metro Atlanta's smog and traffic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am proposing this year are not lofty concepts far
removed from the daily struggles of ordinary Georgians,'' Barnes
told legislators. ``They are proposals that directly affect the
lives of the people we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The new governor urged lawmakers to rectify ``the worst
excesses'' of managed care by giving patients more leeway to choose
their doctors and allowing patients to sue HMOs for dictating or
denying medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, many sitting stoically as the governor
outlined his plans, promised to oppose legislation opening managed
care providers to litigation. They prefer an arbitration panel
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But the call for more regulation hit home for Rep. Sharon Cooper
(R-Marietta), one of several women in the General Assembly who led
the applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever controls your health care controls your life,'' said
Cooper, whose 37-year-old sister died recently after glitches in
managed care. ``When they're talking about denial of care, delay of
care, I know that from a personal level. It's something we've got
to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes pledged to create an insurance consumer advocate to
represent policyholders in rate-increase cases and to consolidate
into a single Department of Community Health the agencies
responsible for health care planning, Medicaid and state employee
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mableton attorney hit his stride, pounding the podium in
his best courtroom diatribe, as he picked a fight with some of the
best financed and most organized of those who roam the Capitol's
hallways: lobbyists for insurance companies and business
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe them. You know they're not telling you the
truth,'' Barnes warned of lobbyists' predictions of skyrocketing
insurance rates. ``Watch those eel-skinned briefcases and alligator
shoes. It's their job to put a wedge between us and what the people
want and demand and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Association of HMOs countered only with a measured
promise to help ``any policymaker who is interested in looking for
the best way of ensuring accountability, choice and
affordability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd want to hear exactly what he has in mind,'' said
association President Jack Towsley. ``If it isn't approached in the
right way, the very real consequence is people could find health
care is no longer affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who had witnessed some less theatrical speeches during
the administration's early days alternately applauded or murmured
disapproval at Barnes' resurgent feistiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyer Roy Barnes came out of his cage today,''
commented Senate Minority Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah). ``It
sounds good, it makes good copy, it looks good on the news. But it
has problems.'' House Speaker Tom Murphy (D-Bremen) heartily
embraced Barnes' health care initiatives, even though he said some
premiums will rise.
</P>
<P>
   And Murphy said Barnes has a lot of convincing to do before
lawmakers embrace the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority
that the governor wants to plan and control all transportation and
mass transit projects in 13 metro Atlanta counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beginning to be afraid it will affect rural areas,''
Murphy said. ``They're beginning to be afraid it will affect
revenue sources for their area if too much money goes here. That's
the most controversial thing he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating those trepidations, Barnes reiterated support for
road and economic development projects for ``places that have, for
far too long, missed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor stressed to rural lawmakers the urgency of bailing
out metro Atlanta. For example, the potential cutoff of federal
highway funds because of pollution means ``every road improvement
project, every bridge, tunnel or passing lane you ever promised for
your communities ... is coming to a screeching halt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you help me do something now or this boom town known as
Atlanta becomes a ghost town,'' Barnes said. ``And if our growth
stops here, it stops everywhere in the state.''

AMERICAN FACES QUESTIONING IN MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Conn.; i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The successor to the Soviet KGB has ordered a
Connecticut man in for questioning about the assassination in St.
Petersburg last November of Russian pro-democracy lawmaker Galina
Starovoitova.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Whitmore of New Branford, Conn., has not been named a
suspect in the Starovoitova case. A reporter for the local
English-language newspaper, The St. Petersburg Times, Whitmore, 36,
knew Starovoitova and is a friend of her aide, Ruslan Linkov, who
was seriously injured in the Nov. 20 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the case has taken a strange turn as investigators have
begun interrogating people who were close to the slain legislator.
Some of those questioned say investigators appeared more interested
in finding out compromising information about Starovoitova and her
confidants than finding the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore, who has written extensively on Starovoitova's murder,
said he received a call last week from an officer of the Federal
Security Service, or FSB, the Russian successor to the
counterintelligence branch of the KGB. The officer, who identified
himself as Alexander Andreyev, asked Whitmore to appear at the
``Big House,'' the St. Petersburg office of the service, last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, `We've got a lot to talk to you about. Plan on
being here for a long time,' '' Whitmore said by telephone from St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   But when Whitmore arrived with an officer from the US consulate,
the investigator would not let the American official in. When
Whitmore refused to go inside without the consular officer, the
investigator issued him a subpoena for questioning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A US embassy spokesman in Moscow said he was aware of Whitmore's
case but declined to comment on the issue. Russian law does not
allow witnesses to be accompanied by lawyers for interrogation, and
apparently this rule applies to foreign citizens and consular
officers. Whitmore said he was apprehensive about his interrogation
after talking to other reporters who had been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   One journalist, Daniel Kotsubinsky, of the weekly St. Petersburg
newspaper Chas Pik, said his interrogator told him that the youth
wing of Starovoitova's political party indulged in immoral
behavior. Kotsubinsky said Detective Mikhail Balukhta tried to get
him to confirm such behavior by Starovoitova's allies.
</P>
<P>
   Another journalist who was interrogated agreed that solving the
crime did not seem to be a high priority of at least one
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the interrogation he said to me: `We are going
to solve this case in such a way that it buries your democratic
movement,' '' Whitmore quoted journalist Tatyana Likhanova as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore said the investigation had turned on Starovoitova's
friends following an article in a Russian newspaper, Komsomolskaya
Pravda, that fingered Linkov as the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore said the report contained inaccuracies that could
easily be disproved _ for example, it said Linkov, who is still
recovering from bullet wounds to his head and neck, was unhurt in
the shooting. But Whitmore worries the report and the odd
investigation is in fact a political ploy aimed at discrediting
Starovoitova's allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it really gone so far that they're going to pin this on
her allies? If that is the case, we are back in 1937,'' he said, a
reference to a critical point in Stalinist political persecution.

   The FSB was unavailable for comment on the case. Alexei
Vostretsov, FSB spokesman for St. Petersburg, told the Interfax
news agency that no one has been detained in the Starovoitova case,
but that officers had interviewed ``several thousand people and
interrogated over 100.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Petersburg FSB has led a three-year investigation of
Alexander Nikitin, a former Navy captain who was accused of treason
after coauthoring a report that accused Russia of negligence in
handling nuclear waste from the submarines based on the Kola
Peninsula. The local St. Petersburg Times has been critical of the
FSB's handling of the case, as have Western governments and human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Linkov charged Wednesday that the investigation of
Starovoitova's case had turned into a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am interested in finding the murderers,'' Linkov told
Interfax. ``(The investigation) is trying to gather dirt on Galina
Vasilyevna (Starovoitova) and other democrats.''

A CHORUS LINE, RIGHT OFF THE SENATE FLOOR

<P>
   During the impeachment trial, senators in the unnatural position
of being gagged on the floor of their chamber have embraced an
alternate performance style with an odd resemblance to an old
Broadway hit. ``The Hallway News Conference'' has looked a lot like
``A Chorus Line,'' as senators scrambled out from the chamber
during 15-minute breaks and, one by one, offered a monologue to the
camera. It was as if each senator was seizing the moment to
audition for a starring role.
</P>
<P>
   And they had competition. The Rebublican managers from the House
of Representatives also flooded the halls during every break. When
Gregory Craig, one of the president's lawyers, disagreed with the
managers during his formal presentation, a gaggle of them turned up
in the hall at the first opportunity. Rep. Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas attacked what he called the White House lawyers' strategy
of attacking the managers. And so it went, with both sides floating
ideas, making arguments, moving the story along with the cameras as
accomplices. And on the staid old Senate floor, volumes of words
were poured out in the hope of producing the perfect evening news
soundbite.
</P>
<P>
   But if politicians love television when it is helpful, a more
distrustful attitude has also emerged in recent days. Senators who
voted to keep cameras away from their debates about dismissing the
case and deposing witnesses offered their on-camera explanations:
the debate would be more ``open'' and ``honest,'' less ``partisan''
(to use their favorite buzzwords) without those nagging cameras.
What does that say? That politics as usual is all about posturing
for television. As the action zoomed from the Senate floor to the
halls, as it moved behind closed doors then back out again, it
shattered any thin illusion that television is an observer rather
than a player in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   The revolving-door process started in earnest last Friday, when
the cable channels broke away from covering the Senate's
question-and-answer session for ``Breaking News'' that turned out
to be: a press release. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who often has
adjectives like ``venerable'' attached to his name, announced he
would offer a motion to dismiss the trial. It was, in fact, a
startling announcement. Just moments before on CNN, Jeff Greenfield
had been cautiously speculating that a question Byrd had sent to
the president's lawyers during the formal session might signal
trouble for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in all this was an irony buried in Byrd's full statement,
which stated his wish to end ``the hallway press conferences and
battle of press releases that are contributing to the division of
our parties and our nation.'' His own press release, of course,
merely set off an intense new flurry of hallway press conferences.
(The 81-year-old Byrd has refused to be part of those media mobs,
an austere and quaint custom that suggests he sees television as
one of those new-fangled annoyances in politics.)
</P>
<P>
   That very afternoon, the line between the Senate and hallway all
but disappeared. Soon Rep. Henry Hyde, the Republican leader of the
managers, was on the Senate floor, using part of his time to
disagree with the Byrd press release. Such seamlessness is more
realistic than the pretense that there is a division between ``the
trial'' and ``the press.'' (During the Senate session on Tuesday,
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., objected to the way David Kendall, one
of the president's lawyers, kept bringing in references to what
House managers had said on ``Meet the Press'' and other news
programs. Chief Justice William Rehnquist quickly decided such
references were allowed.)
</P>
<P>
   By Monday morning, the hallway strategy had taken on the
delirious comic quality and pace of a French farce. Before the
Senate session began in the afternoon, Democrats including the
minority leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, appeared before the cameras with various
optimistic plans to bring the trial to a quick end. No sooner would
one door slam behind a Democrat when another door would open and a
Republican would pop out to say, ``No, thanks.'' On MSNBC's screen,
these words appeared: ``Breaking News: GOP Rejects Democratic Plan
to End Trial.'' And still the Senate had not met formally.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Watching politics-in-motion this way is by definition an act of
seeing through the spin. That is why the closed-door sessions were
more than mere annoyances. If you can't hear or even read the words
of the conversation, you're dependent on leaks, which only multiply
the spin factor. And a Senate rule that forbids revealing the
content of such sessions on pain of expulsion meant there would be
no mad rush to the hallway cameras afterwards. Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., who voted to keep the first debate open, later described
that session as ``very serious and at a very high level,'' and said
``the country would have been well-served'' to have heard it. But
no one will ever know whether that session would have been less
serious and at a lower level with the cameras eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   With the cable channels charting the action minute-by-minute,
and the Senate ratifying what had already been decided, the
broadcast networks seemed in the position of being the
Congressional Record on Wednesday. ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the
voting. But the results, against dismissing the case and for
deposing witnesses, were foregone conclusions before the voting
started, and the network anchors scuttled off the air minutes after
it ended.
</P>
<P>
   Their main contribution was to observe how the two parties had
whipped their members into submission. Dan Rather pointed out on
CBS that Sen. Richard Shelby, the conservative Alabama Republican,
had previously declared his opposition to calling witnesses, yet
voted for them along with every other Republican. Sen. Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., was doubly anomalous. He was the only Senator to
vote against his party. More striking, he refused to explain his
vote on camera, releasing a three-page written statement instead.
</P>
<P>
   Trying a president on television is, of course, new terrain. At
a news conference Wednesday morning, Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., argued that witnesses would extend the trial for a very
long time, and offered a valuable, pithy reminder: ``This is not
`L.A. Law,' this is not `Judge Judy.''' In the real-life legal
process, he said, no Jimmy Stewart would appear to wrap things up
magically at the last minute. Because the Pope was saying Mass in
St. Louis at the time, only C-SPAN2 covered Dodd's remarks live.
But where there is tape there is an afterlife, and his irresistible
``Judge Judy'' sound bite turned up later on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   And he is right about ``Judge Judy,'' a show that is too fast,
too cut-and-dried, too dramatized to be compared to real-life
politics, the ultimate reality programming, which is being played
out for us on cable. Just as ``A Chorus Line'' began off-Broadway,
the president's trial is taking shape away from the main stage, in
the Senate halls.

&HT;        MULTI-CITY GUN LAWSUIT NOT LIKELY, RENDELL SAYS AT U.S.
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS.
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 27, -- Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell said
cities across the country are unlikely to file a joint lawsuit
against gun makers to recover the cost of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   After leading a closed-door meeting on gun violence Wednesday at
the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors, Rendell said differences in
state laws make a multi-city lawsuit too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be individual decisions by cities,''
Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cities may sue. Some may not sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who has threatened to sue the gun industry for more
than a year, called for cities to strengthen law enforcement,
negotiate with the gun industry and push for more federal
oversight. ``We are looking at every aspect of fighting this
problem,'' Rendell said. ``We need to fight this battle on
different fronts. We should not put all our eggs in the lawsuit
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chicago and New Orleans were the first two cities to
file lawsuits against the gun industry. Dade County Florida and
Bridgeport, Conn. just announced they have filed suit, and will
likely be followed by other major cities seeking compensation for
law enforcement and medical expenses related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said after the meeting that he was ``closer'' to a
decision on whether to file a lawsuit himself. But he would not say
which way he was leaning. He said he doesn't know when he will make
up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say a decision to sue gun manufacturers
would make it difficult for Rendell if he has aspirations of
holding a state office. Pennsylvania has the second highest
membership to the NRA, after California.
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell said he just wants to find the best way to curb gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a class-action tobacco suit, where we are all
looking to get lots of money,'' Rendell said. ``That's all a bunch
of bull. We are looking to curb behavior to prevent kids from
getting killed. If that can be achieved through a settlement, or
programs rather than a lawsuit, then fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said he has not been impressed so far in his discussions
with the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the usual... 'guns don't kill people, people kill
people,''' Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rendell, Richard Feldman, executive director of
the American Shooting Sports Council, Inc., said he was still
considering the mayor's proposals and would respond fully by next
month. Even though other cities have shot ahead of Philadelphia in
filing lawsuits against the gun industry, Rendell said the city is
still a leader on curbing gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell touted programs like Philadelphia's new ``Operation
Cease Fire,'' which requires a mandatory five-year sentence without
parole to a criminal convicted of a federal gun violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel we've been usurped by other cities in taking the
lead,'' Rendell said. ``No not at all. Our role in this was never
just for lawsuits.''

HOLLOW VICTORY ON WITNESSES HAS CLOSURE AS GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally, the prosecutors got the vote they've been
seeking for so long. But it didn't give them what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   There will be witnesses. Or, at least, there will be depositions
of witnesses. But the price the prosecutors paid for getting that
much turned out to be so high _ a witness list limited to three, no
presidential testimony, maybe no live testimony at all _ that it
amounts to a concession by President Clinton's accusers that,
barring some staggering surprise, they've given up the fight to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've found a way out, but it ain't graceful,'' said Robert
Bork, the former Supreme Court nominee, who is now a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ``The White House is
going to be able to say that these guys never had a case to begin
with. And what are they going to respond? `We had a case, but threw
it away because it wasn't popular?' They don't have a good answer.
. . .This was not a good way to bring an end to this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of an array of legal and political observers, the
Senate Republicans have decided to go through the motions of
completing the president's impeachment trial _ but without taking
some of the crucial steps any attorney would consider mandatory if
he was trying to win a case.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatic was the House managers' reluctant paring of their
witness wish list, once totaling 15 or more, to three: Monica
Lewinsky, Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal, a
White House aide. And more than the number of witnesses is limited;
the questioning of them will face time constraints as well. Key
Republicans said Wednesday that they hoped to minimize deposition
time by placing tight limits on how long each side may question the
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   With such restrictions in place, even some senators who voted to
call witnesses believe it unlikely any new information will emerge.
``I will be amazed, shocked, if. . .in the depositions, anything
comes out to change the dynamics of this trial,'' said Sen. Richard
Shelby, a Republican from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to find closure,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican senators expressed similar sentiments. And
legal analysts said the prospect for bombshells _ and therefore for
changed minds _ seemed to be further diminished by the expressed
willingness of many Republicans to see videotapes of the
depositions rather than require the witnesses to testify live.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick P. Hafetz, a former head of the criminal division of
the US Attorney's office in New York, said that from a
courtroom-strategy perspective, the Republicans' actions suggest an
objective other than victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's apparently looking to get out of this impeachment
thing as gracefully as possible without offending the House
prosecutors too much,'' said Hafetz. ``It's not the way anyone
would try a real case. . .It is, as they say, an exit strategy, no
doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said much of the action in the last few days
has stemmed from the Republican senators' desire to limit their
losses by shutting down an unpopular proceeding that has divided
their party and irritated voters who, by a wide margin, want
Clinton to remain in office. That desire presumably was heightened
Wednesday, when the motions to call witnesses and to dismiss
charges against Clinton passed on 56-44 partisan votes. Most took
that outcome as a sign the Senate probably will never find the
required two-thirds majority to evict this president from the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senators' agreement to hear some witnesses,
coupled with their numerous declarations that the House managers
have to be allowed to finish their work, evidently has another
major goal: to cool a simmering internal dispute between House
managers and party conservatives who still want to vigorously
pursue the case and Senate leaders and party moderates who want to
end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call it face-saving in one sense, sort of patching
the party together,'' said Jeffrey Abramson, a professor of
political and legal studies at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a presidential scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said the Senate Republicans were trying to extricate
themselves from a difficult position. And, short of pushing for
censure rather than a trial, they may have come up with the ``best
formula available,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to balance the intense views of the core
conservative Republicans with the sentiments of the broader
citizenry,'' said Mann. ``They are trying to cut their political
losses, but they're fearful that if they were to have ended it
without any nod toward witnesses, that the drumbeat of anger and
resentment from the base would be just too painful.''
</P>
<P>
   As they attempt to conclude the impeachment trial by the end of
next week _ the target date widely discussed Wednesday _ the
greatest stumbling block for the Republicans is how to accommodate
the president. After months of insisting that they wanted no
testimony at all, the president's lawyers now argue they may need
more time to prepare properly for the depositions and, perhaps, may
ask to question additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his attorneys don't want to risk having the blame
shift their way for prolonging the unpopular proceeding. But
Senators from both parties said Wednesday that they would not blame
the president's attorneys if they sought more information or
witnesses in an effort to ensure their client receives fair
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But several legal observers expressed confidnece that Clinton
will set aside any evidentiary concerns in favor of obtaining the
shortest possible proceeding. In a trial as interlaced with
politics as this one, normal trial practice and strategy don't seem
to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very much removed from a search for truth or a
fact-finding exercise,'' said F. Dennis Saylor, a defense attorney
in Boston who was chief of staff in the Justice Department's
criminal division during the Bush administration. He said the White
House's ``threats. . .sound like what any trial lawyer would say
(and) strike me as empty rhetoric. I doubt they have anything to
gain by a further factual investigation and they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans have publicly worried that the party will pay
for its pursuit of Clinton when voters select the next president
and Congress in November 2000. But some of the analysts interviewed
Wednesday said the GOP's effort to accelerate an end to the
impeachment trial could help the party recoup substantially.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get out of this thing, as they now look like they're
really trying to do, I don't think it's going to hurt them much if
at all,'' said Irwin Hargrove, a political scientist at Vanderbilt
University. ``Unless there's some kind of awful fiasco, . . .I
think they'll emerge just fine.''

CANADIAN FIRM'S SUIT AGAINST U.S. WILL TEST OBSCURE NAFTA
PROVISION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Miss.)   (bl)  
By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some business executives have argued for years that large jury
verdicts against big companies show that courts in the United
States are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Canadian company that lost a huge case against a
competitor in Mississippi is using a novel legal tool to seek at
least $725 million from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the claim, the first against the United States
under a little-noted provision of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, will encourage other companies to try the new tactic.
And critics say the precedent could provide a potent back-door way
for corporations to challenge the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen Group Inc., a Canadian funeral home company that lost a
$500 million verdict in a 1995 Mississippi suit over fraudulent
business practices, announced last fall that it had filed an
international arbitration claim against the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But Loewen's specific assertions and the large sum it was
seeking were secret until this month. Among other things, Loewen,
which is based in Burnaby, British Columbia, said the verdict
against it was ``infected by repeated appeals to the jury's
anti-Canadian, racial and class biases.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts said the Loewen claim advances a creative but
plausible legal argument. Other experts said the case would test
whether international trade agreements will be a new forum for
business discontent with the U.S. court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important case because it raises the question of the
extent to which domestic civil judicial proceedings will be subject
to international re-examination,'' said David Leebron, an expert on
trade law and the dean at Columbia Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The claim asserted that the government should pay Loewen damages
for what the company said was unfair treatment in the suit it lost
to a Mississippi funeral home entrepreneur, Jeremiah O'Keefe III.
Loewen settled the Mississippi case for $175 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In its claim, Loewen is seeking compensation not only for what
it paid under the settlement but also for damage to its business.
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA promises fair treatment to foreign investors. Loewen said
the court proceedings against it breached that promise, and argues
that the federal government is responsible for the damage it says
it suffered. But even some of those who were most involved in the
debate over the trade agreement five years ago say they did not
anticipate claims based on court verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen's settlement with O'Keefe would stand no matter what
happened in the arbitration panel designated under NAFTA, the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which
is a division of the World Bank. Under NAFTA's rules, the
arbitrators are to be selected from a roster of international trade
and investment specialists. Each side is to select one arbitrator
with a third to be chosen by agreement of the two sides. The panel
is likely to be named soon, with proceedings to follow within a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States lost, public funds would be used to pay
Loewen. The case does not involve the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   In its claim, Loewen attacked the Mississippi verdict, which
involved a jury finding that Loewen used fraudulent practices to
try to drive O'Keefe out of business. Loewen called the Mississippi
court action an ``uncompensated expropriation'' of its property.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment except to say
the government was fighting the claim, which she said lacked merit.
But in the months since Loewen disclosed the existence of its case,
critics have been warning about what they say are the dangers of
it.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Loewen ``would completely undermine the American
civil justice system,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, a watchdog group that has been critical of NAFTA. Forcing
American taxpayers to pay Loewen for its losses, she said, would
erode the aim of U.S. courts to punish and deter wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   James Wilderotter, a lawyer for Loewen, declined to respond to
critics in detail. But he said: ``NAFTA is part of the American
legal system, and the right to bring the action we have brought is
clearly found within NAFTA.''
</P>
<P>
   In its claim, Loewen included statements from political and
legal authorities who, the company said, agreed that its treatment
in the Mississippi courts should be considered a violation of the
trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Loewen quoted Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice. ``The
O'Keefe verdict,'' Fordice wrote, ``represents to me everything
that is wrong with the court system.'' Critics of Loewen say
several of its experts, including Fordice, have long records of
criticizing the American court system.
</P>
<P>
   But some trade-law experts said the case was a sign that the
United States would come under increasing pressure in trade battles
to moderate jury verdicts as the world economy grows more unified.
``This is the globalized economy we've all been talking about,''
said John Jackson, an expert on trade law and a professor at
Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Leebron both noted that business leaders in other
countries have for years complained that the United States' large
jury verdicts make investment here unpredictable. They both said
those assertions were much like the worries of American business
executives about other countries' expropriations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA, like most agreements that use arbitration in business
disputes, permits cases to be handled in confidential proceedings.
Under those confidentiality rules, Loewen's case will be heard in
closed hearings by an arbitration panel unless Loewen and the
government agree to public proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of Loewen's filing say they are especially troubled
by the fact that a case with large legal and financial
ramifications could be decided in a closed proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wrong and harmful to America because it substitutes
for our judicial system a confidential arbitration panel that's not
open to public scrutiny,'' said Mark Mandell, the president of the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Under the confidentiality rules, Loewen's claim documents were
not publicly released until this month. Wilderotter acknowledged
that Loewen released its claim documents only after it learned the
government was preparing to release them because the documents had
been requested under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi court battle, which drew national attention,
involved a bitter fight between O'Keefe and Loewen, a publicly
traded funeral home chain with a reputation for hardball tactics.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard-fought trial in Mississippi, O'Keefe's lawyers
succeeded in arguments to jurors that Loewen tried to drive O'Keefe
from business, sought to monopolize the regional funeral home
business and planned to raise prices to the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said publicly that they were angered by Loewen's tactics
and awarded O'Keefe $100 million in compensatory and $400 million
in punitive damages. In its NAFTA claim, Loewen said O'Keefe's
lawyers unfairly suggested to the Mississippi jury, which included
blacks, that Loewen was biased against blacks. The company said the
plaintiff's lawyers also inflamed xenophobic passions by
analogizing Loewen's move into Mississippi to the Japanese ``sneak
attack'' on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen contended the verdict, the largest in Mississippi's
history, was out of proportion to any losses O'Keefe might have
suffered. And it said it was put at a sharp disadvantage by
Mississippi law governing appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi, like many states, required a losing party to post a
bond to appeal. Because of the $500 million verdict, the bond, too,
would have been huge: $625 million. Loewen fought the bond
requirement. But the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the $625
million bond was required.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen said it could not post such a large bond. ``Loewen,'' the
company said, ``was forced to settle the case under conditions of
extreme duress.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe's lawyer, Michael Allred of Jackson, Miss., said in an
interview that no American verdict was fairer than the one against
Loewen and that Loewen should have pursued its appeal if it felt it
had been wronged. In addition, he argued that NAFTA's
confidentiality provisions attack the integrity of the U.S. court
system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the settlement O'Keefe received from Loewen would be
beyond the reach of the NAFTA arbitration panel, Allred said he and
his client were offended that the jury's effort to punish Loewen
would be nullified if the government was forced to compensate
Loewen in a proceeding that took place behind closed doors.

BUSH URGES TEXAS LAWMAKERS TO SHARE IN NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush challenged the Texas
Legislature on Wednesday to share his national spotlight and show
the rest of the country how Texans can use bipartisanship _ and a
budget surplus _ to boost education funding and still give
taxpayers a break.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the governor's proposed $2 billion property tax cut
and his plan for significant changes in public schools took center
stage in his State of the State address.
</P>
<P>
   But, mixing pleas for ``compassion'' with harder-edged demands
for more ``personal responsibility,'' the Republican governor also
laid out a diverse list of other priorities, including crackdowns
on drunken driving, illegal gambling, child abuse and juvenile
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   With speculation over Bush's anticipated presidential race
likely to repeatedly intrude upon this year's legislative session,
the governor addressed the issue early in his speech to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to the big question is I really don't know yet,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He joked that he would bundle up all the inquiries and
speculation and send them over to Texas House Speaker Pete Laney so
that ``he can bury them for a while'' in the House Calendars
Committee, a panel infamous for killing hundreds of bills each
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't ask for it (the presidential talk), but here it is
anyway,'' Bush said. ``We can either view it as a distraction, or
seize it as an opportunity to show the world what limited and
constructive government looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking cooperation on his priorities from the
Democrat-dominated House and the Republican-majority Senate, Bush
added:
</P>
<P>
   ``The national spotlight gives us a chance to show how well
limited government works. And together we can show Washington how
to handle a budget surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties promised to work with the governor,
but several of the Senate's 15 Democrats said the governor gave too
much priority to tax cuts instead of putting even more emphasis on
education and addressing other pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, said increased funding
for children's health care programs had to be a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, said he was disappointed
the governor didn't address transportation needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston has critical transportation-state highway needs,''
Whitmire said. ``Republicans, Democrats and Independents cannot get
to work and take their kids to school because of the inefficiency
of state government in terms of transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, accused the Democratic senators
of injecting ``Washington, D.C.-style partisanship into Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one key Republican also raised some concerns. State
Sen. Bill Ratliff of Mount Pleasant, who chairs the budget-writing
Senate Finance Committee, said it will be difficult for lawmakers
to cut school property taxes by as much as $2 billion and fund all
the educational improvements that Bush and others are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, the state Senate's first Republican
presiding officer, contends the full $2 billion tax reduction is
possible, and praised Bush for hitting ``a home run'' with his
vision for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office will provide more details of Bush's tax
and budgetary proposals Thursday in a briefing before the Senate
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has hinted that he will probably scale back on an
additional $600 million cut in state sales and business taxes that
he proposed during his re-election campaign because of a
lower-than-anticipated surplus and other spending needs.
</P>
<P>
   He said his proposed $2 billion reduction in local school
property taxes would cut rates an average of 13 cents for every
$100 valuation of a home or other piece of property. That would be
a reduction of $130 a year on a home valued at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, the state would reimburse school districts
for the $2 billion in lost revenue and also boost education funding
by another $1.6 billion. The governor proposed that $1 billion of
the additional funds be used to raise teacher pay or hire more
teachers to reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush admitted that there is a ``huge debate raging'' over
whether the state should use tax dollars for vouchers to send some
children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not trap students in low-performing schools. It's time
to see it it works. Let's try a pilot voucher program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's speech was interrupted by applause more than 30
times, but one of the loudest outbursts of support greeted his call
for an ``end to the failed practice of social promotion,'' which
allows students to advance to the next grade even if they haven't
mastered their schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received a standing ovation _ although many Democratic
legislators kept their seats _ when he endorsed legislation that
would require parents to give their permission or at least be
notified before their minor daughters could have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 176 Texas children were killed by abusive parents or
caretakers last year, the governor urged lawmakers to increase
funding to allow the state's child protection agency to hire 380
new caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Children's advocates said that was a step in the right direction
but only a fraction of what was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for automatic jail time for juveniles who
commit crimes with guns, endorsed legislation to lower the blood
alcohol intoxication limit for drivers from .10 to .08 and called
for legislation to protect businesses and state agencies from
``frivolous lawsuits'' over year 2000 computer compliance problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government programs cannot solve all our problems,'' he said.
``People of good will must help, what I call the little armies of
compassion which are transforming our state (by) one heart, one
soul, one conscience at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, borrowing a page from President Clinton, who frequently
introduces special guests during his State of the Union addresses,
Bush introduced a visitor in the House gallery, Tillie Burgin of
Arlington, who runs a mission for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called her a ``drill sergeant in the army of compassion.''
</P>

 &HT;    DeBerg seems to play forever
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Steve DeBerg was daydreaming Tuesday, as old people tend
to do, when he said, ``You don't think about the fact it might be
your last game. Sometimes, you just think you're going to play
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver quarterback John Elway laughed.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, Elway has assumed that DeBerg indeed has been
playing forever.
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something, because Elway, 38, is no spring
chicken. He's in his 16th NFL season and has hinted strongly that
he will retire after Sunday's Super Bowl game against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It seems strange in a way, however, when the geezer he replaced
as a rookie in 1983 will be standing across the field.
</P>
<P>
   In uniform.
</P>
<P>
   And DeBerg, 45, is saying he wants to play again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable. He's got nine lives,'' said Elway, who
supplanted DeBerg as the Denver starter at the beginning of the
1983 season. ``He was, what? six or seven years in the league when
I came in, and I thought he was ancient. Now, I feel ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient is a strong term, but it's worth mentioning that when
DeBerg was drafted in 1977 -- 22 years ago -- in the 10th round by
Dallas. That was four years before Cowboys' offensive coordinator
Dan Reeves was hired to coach the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   As the league's oldest player, DeBerg probably is the most
written-about and talked-about reserve here this week, and he
doesn't seem to mind being the punchline of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all been a great experience for me,'' he said. ``Some
guys were asking me the other day if we wore face masks when I
first started playing. Heck, I'm as old as our owner, (president
Taylor Smith).''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg, cut by Dallas in '77, has been around long enough to
play for six NFL teams. He was traded in 1981 from San Francisco to
the Broncos, where he and Craig Morton both started at times for
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg was the man in 1982, and then Elway arrived, with a
rocket arm, quick feet and unusual savvy. He took over in the
fourth quarter of a preseason game against Seattle and rallied
Denver to a comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   The starting job was his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very obvious the first time he stepped on the football
field John had Hall of Fame talent,'' DeBerg said. ``But his rookie
year was frustrating, as it is for most rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves benched his rookie in the fifth week of the season,
making DeBerg the starter until he injured his shoulder five weeks
later. Elway finished out the regular season, but when DeBerg was
healthy, he was tabbed to start the team's playoff game against
Seattle -- a 31-7 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was very competitive and felt he should play,'' DeBerg
said. ``But maybe it helped (Elway) to see that a quarterback who
wasn't as talented, but more experienced, could have some success.
My big thing was, and is, preparation and study and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Dolphins in 1993, the idea of playing
again grew out of his idea last winter of using football-type
workouts to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wants to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try and play again,'' said DeBerg, who completed
30 of 59 passes for 369 yards, three touchdowns and one
interception in one start and seven relief appearances this season.
``I'm having way more fun doing this than coaching.
</P>
<P>
   He and the Falcons ``haven't talked about anything, but there
really is no down side to a football team inviting me to training
camp,'' DeBerg said. ``That's all I ask -- hopefully in Atlanta. If
my physical skills are not good enough for me to make the team,
maybe some young quarterbacks can benefit from being around me.''

 &HT;    Walking wounded: The pain of the game
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Mark Schlereth got a head start on the virtues of
perseverance long before he began his NFL career a decade ago.
Football, in fact, was not a consideration when he began
constructing the foundation of his tenacity as a child growing up
in Anchorage, Alaska. Survival was his only ambition then, just as
it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Schlereth, the tough, thoughtful Denver Broncos guard, was
diagnosed with dyslexia, a condition that threathens the ability to
learn. A teacher picked up on it and recommended him for
special-education classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely difficult in school,'' he said. ``But I got
counseling and worked at it. I've never learned anything about
myself during good times. I've learned a lot during tough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``With dyslexia, I learned how to listen and pay attention. I
learned about survival.''
</P>
<P>
   That knowledge traveled with Schlereth from Alaska to Idaho,
where he played collegiately, and to the NFL, first with Washington
and the last four years with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Despite injuries that have required an incredible 22 surgeries,
Schlereth continues to play, and to perform at a high level. He
``seriously considered'' retiring in November 1997. It turned out
to be only a fleeting thought, however, a rare and temporary brush
with reality during a career marked by a surgeon's scapel.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery on a herniated disk in his back made him ``extremely
miserable,'' he said. But he watched at home in agony as the
Broncos faced the Oakland Raiders on a Monday night. One would
think that the violent collisions would serve as supporting
evidence to confirm his thoughts of leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Schlereth said, ``I got physically ill.'' To someone
else, that might have meant he'd eaten some bad salami. To
Schlereth, ``That was the sign that I was not ready to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he plodded on. The 6-foot-3, 287-pound guard completed
rehabilitation, rejoined the Broncos and was a major cog in the
potent offensive line that led Denver to the Super Bowl
championship in '98. Since then, he's had two more surgeries -- one
to remove bone chips from his left elbow, the other to repair knee
cartilage. Both were in October. Neither caused him to miss a game.
``They'd have to perform surgery that day for him to miss a game,''
tight end Shannon Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's missed seven games due to injury in his career.
He'll be lined up for action Sunday, although he's already expected
to have more bone chips removed from his left elbow next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of player I admire is the one who shows up for work
every day and gives great effort,'' Schlereth said. ``John Elway,
Terrell Davis, Michael Jordan. They've earned the right to be prima
donnas and skip out. Yet they show up every day and do everything
everyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have included himself in that group, according to coach
Mike Shanahan. ``After 22 surgeries, you'd think he'd ask out of
sprints (during practice),'' he said. ``And I'd let him sit them
out. But he runs every sprint we ask. He just has great desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that it? Is that what keeps him coming back? He already has
said he will play at least one more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the action out there and not be a part of it would
really kill me,'' he said. ``So I'll take it year by year. My body
tells me it's time to go all the time. But I've got the gift of
stupidity and the ability to not listen to (my body). It's not my
body that'll tell me. It's my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In a very real sense, Schlereth is the heart of the Denver
offense. His willingness to play through pain or return quickly
after surgery motivates his teammates to be like Mark. When guys
come into the locker room and think they're hurt, they look at Mark
and say, 'Hey, I'm not hurt.'
</P>
<P>
   The Schlereth surgery breakdown goes like this: twelve on his
right knee, five on his left knee, two on his left elbow, one on
his right elbow, one on his back and one for kidney stones. Eight
doctors have cut him open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't count the number of (non-surgical) finger and toe
injuries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't count the number of times his wife, Janette,
takes calls from friends and family with the first words ``out of
their mouths, 'How's Mark?' `` Schlereth said. ``Not, 'How are you
doing? Not, 'How are the kids?' Not 'How's the new home?' It's
'How's Mark?' 'How's his knee?' 'How's his elbow?' I know it's very
tiring and frustrating for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it has not been too frustrating for him. Here's a
guy who keeps a piece of cartilage in a glass above his locker.
``It's just something cool to do,'' he said. ``I show it to my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And what do they think of Schlereth's living testament to
survival? ``They're in Disney World,'' he said.

 &HT;    Some players are slaves to superstitions
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aside from studying his playbook and the Denver Broncos'
defensive schemes, third-string Atlanta Falcons quarterback Tony
Graziani has a keen eye turned to the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be 85 degrees in Miami and I am not looking
forward to that,'' said Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   For a reason he really doesn't know, Graziani started wearing
long-sleeved white T-shirts under his game jersey after the Falcons
were embarrassed 28-3 by the New York Jets in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons haven't lost a game since and Graziani sees no
reason to tempt fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started wearing them after the Jets game,'' said Graziani,
who threw an interception that day and completed just half of his
14 pass attempts for 86 yards. ``I know it's going to be hot (in
Miami), but I have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many professional athletes, Graziani, who also wears jersey
No. 13 over that long-sleeved T-shirt, is a slave to superstitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a cultural standpoint, superstitions in sports evolved
from the general public,'' says Rankin Cooter, a professor of
sports management at Georgia State University. ``Athletes are
people first.''
</P>
<P>
   With superstitions, a player usually does something that
deviates from the norm, often by chance. When something positive or
very negative happens, such as a win or unusually bad loss, the
player connects the two isolated incidents and a superstition is
born.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is no coincidence that the halftime entertainment at
the Super Bowl will include a performance by Stevie Wonder, who
penned the R&AMP;B classic ``Superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you
suffer,'' sang Wonder. ``Superstition ain't the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to the Falcons. With the Super Bowl three days
away, their individual superstitions are likely to play an even
larger role in their preparations for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Tuggle, for instance, always listens to Phil Collins
music or the theme from ``Rocky'' before games.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dwight eats sushi every Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Henri Crockett always has to be the last player on
the team to get dressed for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wait until the last minute to get dressed. I just sit
in my locker and wait,'' said Crockett. ``I have always played well
doing it, so I never stopped doing it. The coaches would always get
on me about being slow and yell at me to hurry up.''
</P>
<P>
   In professional football, superstitions about clothing are
common. While he stops short of calling it a superstition,
defensive back Ray Buchanan has some very precise rules for how he
dresses on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like wearing wristbands. I gotta have wristbands. Two on
each arm,'' said Buchanan, adding that the color he wears depends
on which uniform the team is wearing. White jerseys might require
red wristbands, while white wristbands complement black jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   As important as wristbands are to Buchanan, socks are even more
sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``More red than white has to be showing on my socks. That is
very important,'' said Buchanan. ``All of it helps me mentally.
Knowing that you look and feel good helps you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Tony Martin is also obsessed with his game-day
dress code, admitting he competes with Buchanan to see who looks
better on the field. Martin is so concerned with neatness that he
tapes his own ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uniform has to be perfect, my tape job has to be perfect,
but the socks are the key,'' Martin said. ``It came from high
school. Everyone was trying to see who was the sweetest.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the players, long-standing superstitions date from
their school days. During one high school game, guard Gene Williams
accidently put on his right sock inside out. His team won and went
on to go undefeated and win the state championship.
</P>
<P>
   His right sock has been inside out ever since. And that's not
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line eats at Pappadeaux's every Friday,'' said
Williams. ``Since we have been doing it, we have won I don't know
how many games in a row. We are contemplating having them send some
(food) down to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also has to call three friends in Ohio _ one a day _
every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all of this really does anything for you,''
Williams admitted. ``It is all psychological, like getting your arm
amputated and you still feeling it. Hey, it has taken me eight
years to get to the Super Bowl, so they are not that great.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooter said players think the rituals will bring them luck, and
from a psychological standpoint they may indeed work because the
players believe in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mask for reality, a crutch. They want to believe they
are lucky,'' said Cooter. ``In sports, a microscopic difference
makes a difference in whether you win or lose, so any little thing
can help.''
</P>
<P>
   Players who claim not to have superstitions refer to them as
routines.
</P>
<P>
   As he packed his bag for the trip to Miami, guard Dave Widell
made sure that the gray cutoff shorts he has worn in practice all
year were safely packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want the daily routine to change just for the Super
Bowl,'' said Widell. ``I want the same shorts, the same shoes I
have been practicing and playing in all year. You don't want your
routine to change in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Steve DeBerg said he has tried it all during
his 18 years in the NFL. Now, at age 45, he has learned that the
rituals don't really work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done the socks, the meals. I had them all, but I don't
have (them) any more,'' said DeBerg, the NFL's oldest player. ``If
you play long enough, you realize that every superstition you have,
you lose, you change or it eventually stops working. That is when
you find out it is not a superstition (that wins games), it is how
you play.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Bob Whitfield has also kicked the habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some superstitions, but I stopped them this year,'' said
Whitfield. ``I found myself trying to do the same thing all the
time. You don't have to eat at the same restaurant, listen to the
same music, drink beer with the same hand at the same hour every
week to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, a seven-year veteran, said he has seen some
superstitions get out of hand, as they did with former Falcon Deion
Sanders, now with the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>

   ``Deion had his favorite pair of drawers that he had to wear,
and somebody on the opposition stole them before a game once,''
said Whitfield, laughing. ``We had to put out an APB to find his
drawers. Those were Prime Time drawers. My locker was right next to
his, so I should have taken them.''

LOUISIANA SEEKS EARLIEST PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUS

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Louisiana Republican Party leaders plan to
authorize a presidential caucus early next year that would be held
ahead of the traditional opening volleys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to be first,'' said Mike Francis, chairman of the
state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Francis will convene a meeting Saturday of the party's central
committee to approve the plan. The move has the backing of Governor
Mike Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus will take place in late January or early February,
Francis said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Louisiana is required to elect delegates in a Super
Tuesday showdown in a number of Southern states in March 2000,
Francis said the state party leaders had ``found a way to divide
our delegates and elect some on Super Tuesday and some in the
earlier caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana scheme is expected to be challenged by Iowa and
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything to heighten the relevance of
it,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa Republican
Party. ``We're going to encourage the candidates to focus their
efforts on Iowa. It's the first real test.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses are tentatively scheduled for Feb. 7 next
year. The New Hampshire primary is usually held eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Republicans conducted a rump caucus in January 1996,
which drew the ire of the party officials in Iowa and New
Hampshire. Although Iowa Republicans encouraged presidential
candidates that year to boycott the Louisiana affair, Senator Phil
Gramm of Texas made a bid to kick off his campaign with a victory
here.
</P>
<P>
   Only 30,000 voters, less than 6 percent of Republican voter
registration in the state, took part in the exercise, but the
Louisiana outcome had major implications. Pat Buchanan upset Gramm,
beginning a sequence that propelled Buchanan into the top tier of
the field and forced Gramm from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Francis said he expected next year's Louisiana caucus to lure
such conservative candidates as Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire,
former Vice President Dan Quayle, and Malcolm Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get an appointment with Governor (George) Bush
of Texas to welcome him,'' Francis said.

NEWS ANALYSIS: ANOTHER DAY OF CONFRONTATION AND NEGOTIATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate convened on Wednesday for two long-
awaited showdown votes on whether to go on with President Clinton's
impeachment trial, the chaplain offered a prayer. ``Beyond party
loyalties,'' the Rev. Lloyd J. Ogilvie said, ``those on both sides
of the aisle long to do what ultimately is best for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back 56-44 votes against dismissing the case and for
calling witnesses quickly showed, however, that except for a lone
senator _ Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis. _ the other 99 chose their
party position as the one best for the nation. That appeared to
leave the Senate as divided along partisan lines as the House was
on the bitter day in December when it impeached Clinton on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate, by its own inclination, is not the House. And
the real message of the day was that there are nowhere near 67
votes for Clinton's removal from office _ the two-thirds that would
be required under the Constitution. ``This president is not going
to be impeached,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. That
realization left the two parties with the alternatives of working
together to find a way to bring the trial to an end or else bracing
for endless bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   And so they chose negotiation. Sens. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, and Tom Daschle, the minority leader, traded plans and
ideas for how to depose witnesses and bring the impeachment
proceedings that have consumed Congress since September to some
kind of conclusion by mid-February. So did smaller groups of
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get to a conclusion that completes our
constitutional responsibility and carries out our duty to carry out
impartial justice,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the negotiations, the parties sharpened their partisan
messages just in case things go awry. Democrats said the day's
votes showed that the Republicans once again were the party driving
impeachment forward against the popular will. ``Those who vote to
extend this, this trial becomes their trial in a sense,'' said Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that any slowdown now would only come
about if the White House made good on its threats to carry out
extensive and aggressive discovery proceedings. ``I don't
understand the White House threats of scorched earth, drag this out
until next Memorial Day kind of strategy,'' said Sen. Bob Bennett
of Utah, ``because the White House has been the one insisting that
this ought to come to an end and this is nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   But these arguments seemed nothing more than political sport. By
nightfall the sides were still trading proposals for an endgame for
the trial. Daschle said he was optimistic, but cautioned, ``I've
been optimistic before and it's been shown that I was too
optimistic and that can happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the Senate has been so different from
the House on this issue is a matter of timing. When the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, sent his report to the House in early
September it was two months before the mid-term election and that
spurred both parties in the House to use impeachment to play to
their most ideological core voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats went out of their way to portray the Republicans
as unfair in order to spur their supporters to the polls. They
particularly sought to play to black Americans' suspicions of
prosecutors and police. And the Republicans, in what later came to
be seen as a blunder, ran television spots just before the election
obliquely and not so obliquely criticizing Clinton's behavior in
order to appeal to conservatives in key congressional districts in
the South. Although the House did not finally vote on impeachment
until after the November election, it had already been thoroughly
polarized.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between the two chambers is that the House
needed only a majority vote, which made it possible for the
Republicans to impeach Clinton along party lines. The Senate needs
a two-thirds vote to convict Clinton and remove him from office and
the Republicans, who control the chamber with 55 votes, know they
can never assemble the necessary 67 votes to do so.

GOP OUT TO UNSEAT CLINTON, WHITE HOUSE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angered by the unified vote of Senate Republicans
to take testimony from three witnesses, White House officials
bitterly charged Wednesday that one party alone was trying to
impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of restricting criticism to the House Republican
prosecutors in the impeachment trial, frustrated White House aides
expanded their target to Senate Republicans, painting the GOP with
one broad brush even as it became clear there are not enough votes
to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   All 55 Senate Republicans, plus one Democrat, voted against
dismissing the charges and in favor of deposing three witnesses _
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, Clinton confidant
Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and White House senior aide Sidney Blumenthal.
Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin was the only Democrat to
join the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The White House seized on the nearly party-line vote to put the
blame squarely at Republicans' feet for not bringing a quick end to
the trial as both the president and the public say they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to end it today. But as of today, delay became a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Republican Party,'' said Jim
Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
voiced a similiar viewpoint. ``The fact that we have a straight
party-line vote with one exception is very similiar to what's been
going on in the House in terms of how this impeachment has gone
on,'' the aide said. ``Basically one party is trying to impeach the
president of another party. So here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers are bracing for the possibility that the
House prosecutors will eventually prevail in their quest to bring
the three witnesses before the full Senate for live testimony,
senior aides said.
</P>
<P>
   They also are prepared for prosecutors to claim they found new
evidence or facts in dispute after deposing the three witnesses, a
process expected to include the White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of quote, nothing new, end quote may be
interpreted differently,'' said one White House aide close to
Clinton's defense. ``There's an expectation that House Republicans
will find some way to keep extending this trial on and on,
regardless of what people may say now.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the president's lawyers want to leave open the
option of calling their own witnesses. They also are publicly
pressing to review some 56,000 pages in still-secret evidence
collected by the House during the impeachment preceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Not being allowed to review that evidence at a time witnesses
are being called is the equivalent of putting ``a blindfold on
us,'' said White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House was ``not bluffing'' in warning of a
possible lengthy delay if witnesses are called to testify. ``We
believe we ought to have an adequate chance to get prepared and to
present a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, a Democratic lawyer close to the White House who
served as House special counsel during the impeachment of two
federal judges, said Clinton's lawyers were ``saber-rattling'' with
such threats, but on the flip side, ``they don't want to be
sandbagged.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing new or arguably different comes out in the
depositions, the White House ``would have to be insane to call any
new witnesses or ask any questions of these,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   Under that scenario, ``they should call no witnesses, ask no
questions and call a cab,'' he said. ``If something new develops,
they are entitled to time and should get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said the witnesses would not need to
testify before the Senate if no new information develops from the
depositions.
</P>
<P>
   That also ``wouldn't trigger the need for the White House to
move toward discovery and depositions, and then we could get about
the business of moving to the debate and vote on the articles of
impeachment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, the White House spokesman, said Clinton's lawyers
were in an ``if-then situation,'' not being able to plot their next
move until the Senate agrees on procedures for dispensing with the
trial, now that it's clear the 67 votes are not there to convict
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the Republicans have the majority, and they
control the process. They own the process...lock, stock and
barrel,'' Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that House Republicans ``will push for live
witnesses, and then push for more witnesses. They will always push
for more,'' the spokesman said. ``I don't think they will ever give
up.''

 &HT;    Crime stats: Questions linger after Atlanta audit
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1996, 56 reports of women being raped were written
off by Atlanta police as never having happened. Those reports _ a
shade more than one per week _ were removed from annual totals
reported to the FBI and widely used to characterize decreases in
Atlanta's crime statistics that year.
</P>
<P>
   It was more of the same for reports of robberies. More than one
robbery a day occurred in 1996 that Atlanta police said didn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Those 56 rapes and 498 robberies were determined by the Atlanta
Police Department to be unfounded, meaning no crime occurred. But a
GBI-FBI audit of Atlanta's crime reporting determined those cases
should have been investigated more thoroughly before police ended
their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The result of wiping those crimes off the books was to make the
city appear far less violent than it actually was that year.
Because of the unfounded cases, the city was able to say rapes
declined by 11 percent from 1995, when in fact they rose 2 percent.
And robberies rose 1 percent over the previous year instead of
declining by 9 percent, as Atlanta police reported to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The state-federal audit followed public airing last summer of a
dispute between Police Chief Beverly Harvard and her deputy chief
who managed the APD's crime statistics section. Louis Arcangeli,
who since has been demoted to captain, claimed APD was routinely
manipulating crime reporting and Harvard denied it.
</P>
<P>
   After the audit report, released earlier this month, showed 16.1
percent of more than 5,700 cases examined by the GBI and FBI from
1995-97 were improperly unfounded, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reviewed dozens of incident reports and talked to former and active
police officers about crime reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard called the audit a ``vindication'' of her department in
a press conference when the report was released and maintained that
position in an interview last week. But current and former officers
and critics of the department say these figures instead leave
unanswered some troubling questions about the department's crime
reporting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer number of violent crimes that were erased is
incredible,'' wrote Atlanta attorney William McKenney, who
represents Arcangeli, in a Jan. 21 letter to Atlanta City
Councilmember C.T. Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The audit looked at unfounded cases in four violent crime
categories _ murder, rape, robbery and auto theft _ for 1995-97.
Although those categories represent only 20 percent of all crimes
reported during those years, auditors felt they would provide a
sufficient statistical sampling to determine whether APD was in
compliance with Uniform Crime Reporting policies set by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found an error rate of 25.6 percent in 1996, more than
double the 12.6 percent error rate of the previous year for those
four crime categories. By contrast, the unfounding rates of other
metro area police departments were significantly lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a significant number,'' said Paul Heppner of the
unreported crimes. Heppner is deputy director of the Georgia Crime
Information Center, which conducted the audit.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard said the FBI was sending mixed signals on unfounding
cases and as a result, the auditors used different criteria than
her investigators to judge whether crimes occurred. Had the
auditors used the same criteria in judging cases as investigators
did in 1996, those cases in question would not have been counted,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether or not we were cheating and whether or
not whatever these results are caused us to have a gross
under-reporting of crime,'' Harvard said. Her answer to both
questions is no, and that is supported by the audit report, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree. ``Chief Harvard was jubilant that the city
was vindicated but it seems like the report said exactly what
Captain Arcangeli was saying,'' said former Atlanta Police
detective Chris Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Competing criteria
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is not the only city where disputes have arisen over
police handling of crime statistics. Police in New Orleans, New
York, Philadelphia and Boca Raton, Fla., have come under scrutiny
on charges they manipulated crime stats.
</P>
<P>
   While downgrading violent crimes in police reports was more of
an issue in other cities, a primary concern in Atlanta was with
what Arcangeli saw as a surge in unfounded crimes for 1996, the
year the Olympics came to town and a mayoral election year.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of differences between APD and state and federal
agencies is the thoroughness of the investigation required to
unfound a case. The FBI defines criteria for unfounding cases in
its Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Davis, a statistical assistant with the FBI who works
with Uniform Crime Reports, said that ``beyond the definition (in
the handbook), it's a matter of interpretation. I'm sure there are
variations from department to department but they are expected to
pretty much follow the definition. It seems pretty much cut and
dried.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta police were also relying heavily on a May 1977
letter to the APD from Paul Zolbe, the FBI's chief of Uniform Crime
Reports. Known as ``the Zolbe letter,'' it provided what Atlanta
police admit is a vague set of guidelines for unfounding.
</P>
<P>
   Zolbe wrote that ``Without the cooperation of the victim, or in
cases where the victim supplies false information pertaining to
their identity and address, the reported offense should be scored
as an offense known to police. The offense may then be unfounded as
a false or baseless complaint, providing your investigation cannot
establish the offense actually occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The UCR handbook says, ``the refusal of the victim to cooperate
with prosecution, or the failure to make an arrest does not unfound
a legitimate offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said that the Zolbe guidelines would have permitted
unfounding in 1996 the 56 rapes and 498 robberies that the FBI/GBI
audit found had been done incorrectly. ``When we went back and
looked at the rapes that were suggested on the audit should not
have been unfounded, if you knew the interpretation of the Zolbe
letter, they would have been justified,'' Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation of what investigators did prior to unfounding
cases was ``vast'' in the rape cases, according to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if someone just got the report and just decided he
was going to say this didn't happen. It's documented in those cases
exactly by the detective what they did,'' Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   But the audit found that ``rape cases were unfounded with
specific accounts of the incident in the narrative'' and were
unfounded simply because the victim refused to cooperate with
investigators, which was a violation of UCR guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching the guidelines
</P>
<P>
   A significant point of dispute between Harvard and Arcangeli was
whether APD supervisors ordered or encouraged unfounding cases to
reduce reported crime.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has consistently said they did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an investigator decided they would unfound or clear a
report and it was not in accordance with policy, then what you have
is an investigator who decided he or she would cheat for
themselves. That has nothing to do with making the department look
good. But that person shouldn't be an investigator,'' Harvard said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But former Detective Brown, whose more than 24 years on the
force included 20 as a robbery investigator, said detectives were
encouraged in subtle ways by supervisors to unfound cases,
especially if they involved homeless people or both victims and
suspects were drug users. ``The system was set up to cheat a little
bit, not to cheat in big numbers,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, investigators would be told in squad
meetings by their supervisors that ``We need to do more clearups in
these cases to show something is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Brown, ``if an investigator said he had no more cases
he could clear, the sergeant would say something like: 'You know
how to get things done.'''
</P>
<P>
   That would involve looking for ways to stretch the limits for
unfounding cases, according to Sgt. VickyeReese, a former
investigator in the assault squad now on medical leave from APD.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said when she was first assigned to the assault squad in
1994, she conscientiously tried to find victims and investigate
cases. She said within a month she was told she was spending too
much time on each case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (other investigators) told me I was doing it all wrong.
They told me they would not go to that much trouble to contact the
people,'' she said. ``They told me that if you don't hear from
somebody in a week, just clear it because 'we can't keep these
reports on our desk forever.'''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of times cases were unfounded because they (investigators)
could not find people,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard bristles at the suggestion investigators and their
supervisors are being less than conscientious on all their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has come forth and named any supervisor, not one. It's
easy to just say something and don't put any responsibility in
terms of saying this is the person that did it. If you are telling
the truth about what's going on you should not have any reluctance
to state who hinted this,'' Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   But the somewhat loose guidelines of the Zolbe letter were
apparently quite well known throughout the department.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that under the guidelines of the Zolbe letter,
APD determined it was permissible to unfound a case if the victim
did not respond to telephone or written inquiries from an
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Brown, if the letters requesting additional
information or a statement from the victims came back with a wrong
address, cases would be unfounded on the basis that victim had
provided incorrect information and therefore it could not be
conclusively proved that a crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were never told where the orders came from to do things a
certain way. It was always 'they' said to do things this way or
that way. But you knew it had to be a higher ranking officer than
the lieutenant who was running the squad,'' Brown said. That's why
complaining detectives have declined to say specifically who told
them to unfound cases.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said because he did not meet a certain unwritten quote of
case clearups (including unfounded cases), he eventually was
demoted two pay grades and sent back to the street in uniform
before he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Improvement in progress
</P>
<P>
   APD's standards changed somewhat in January 1997, when the GBI
received a clarification for unfounding cases from the FBI. Known
as ``the Brewer letter'' for its author, Bennie Brewer, chief of
programs support section of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information
Services Division, this correspondence provided stricter guidelines
for unfounding cases.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer wrote that the implication of the Zolbe letter was that
``a thorough investigation actually occurs, and a reasonable
conclusion of that investigation is made that the offense did not,
in fact, occur. Merely sending a letter to the victim and the
letter being returned is not enough by itself to unfound a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Jon Gordon said the Brewer letter ``does not come
out and refute the Zolbe letter. He just adds a little bit more,
just elaborates on it and says, well, he switches it and says you
have to prove the crime didn't occur instead of trying to prove it
did occur. He establishes the notion of a thorough investigation,
which is something we believe in always.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes brought about in part by the Brewer letter and the
department's adherence to it are seen in its 1997 crime stats. The
number of unfounded rapes went from 161 in 1996 to 106 in 1997;
robberies from 885 to 248. The decline in error rates for unfounded
cases were even more dramatic. There were no improperly unfounded
rapes in 1997, compared to 34.8 percent in 1996, according to the
GBI. The error rate for improperly unfounded robberies dropped from
56.3 percent to 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the GBI audit brings with it the potential for more
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The audit recommended refresher training for APD investigators
and those responsible for compiling crime stats in criteria used to
unfound cases. It also suggested the department consider beefing up
its review process of unfounded cases.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she would implement the recommendations for
additional training and Gordon said adjustments are being made to
ensure that all the necessary documentation is filed with those
cases to be unfounded so they can be more closely reviewed. But
some officers believe it will take leadership as well as training
to accomplish change.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lower crime rate sells the city,'' Brown said. ``A push to
lower the crime rate would have to come from politicians, not
police officers. And that push would have to come from City Hall.''

 &HT;    Broncos kicker's accuracy, distance unmatched in league
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Jason Elam knows what it's like, even if he has to travel
back half a decade for the memory. Kickers are human. He found out
as a rookie in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was against Oakland. It was in overtime,'' Elam said. ``It
was a 40-yarder. I missed it wide left, and, I'll tell you, that's
as low as I've felt in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason _ Elam hasn't missed a game-deciding field goal
since then. For all of Morten Andersen's acumen _ the Falcons
kicker remains Elam's hero _ the Denver Broncos own an edge in the
kicking game Sunday. Anytime they cross midfield, they can score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does he have a great leg, but he's so accurate,''
quarterback John Elway said. ``We almost take him for granted. We
automatically think (that) any time we get down close we've got at
least three points, if we don't turn the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if all kickers admit that they live a game-to-game
existence, 1998 marked a career turn for Elam. He has spent much of
his life having to prove himself. A soccer refugee at Brookwood
High School who barely cast a football shadow until his senior
season. Dwarfed in metro Atlanta by Chris Gardocki at nearby Redan
High. Signed with Hawaii because it was his only I-A scholarship
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel kind of like you've got something to prove.
But I don't really think that anymore,'' he said. ``Morten Andersen
for sure doesn't, and he's the best, in my opinion, the best to
ever kick. If I can get anywhere close to what he's done, I'd be
happy. But I'm also pretty happy with the way things have gone. If
things ended today, I'd be pretty happy.''
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't already, Elam this season secured his place as one
of the game's most remarkable placement specialists. In addition to
tying Tom Dempsey's 63-yard distance record, he improved his career
rate on field-goal tries from 50 yards or longer to 60.7 percent,
17-for-28. Having missed only once in 260 PAT tries, he also has
the highest extra-point percentage in league history, .996.
Overlooked is the fact that most of the work was done at Mile High
Stadium, where the wind, cold weather and chopped-up field increase
any kicker's challenge. He was just selected to his second Pro
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the 63-yarder put an exclamation point on
everything,'' Elam said. ``I don't want that to sound cocky or
anything. But I think it helped my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Since entering the NFL in 1993, Elam has scored more points
(730) than anyone else, and he is coming off an 11-point
performance on a blustery day in Denver's 23-10 AFC title game
victory. In the game's most precarious craft, he has become the
Broncos' surest thing. Sunday, he faces his old hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to live and die by what the Falcons did,'' Elam said.
``I always keep in touch with some of the guys on the Falcons. I
always look on ESPN to see what they did. It's going to be tough to
root against them. But I'm going to have to root against them one
more time.''

 &HT;    Defensive tackle Pryce no spectator this time
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He was several minutes late arriving for an interview
session on Wednesday, and when Denver Broncos second-year defensive
tackle Trevor Pryce climbed behind a microphone to field questions,
the former Clemson star admitted that he still doesn't feel like a
Super Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as little as I contributed last year . . . I didn't feel a
part of it,'' said Pryce, who played sparingly in 1997 but is now a
starter. ``We got our Super Bowl rings at one of our minicamps. I
took mine, gave it to my parents and haven't seen it since. I
didn't earn it, so what's the big deal? This one, I'm going to
earn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryce didn't even dress for Super Bowl XXXII. But playing next
to veteran run-stuffer Keith Traylor, the former second-round
selection has boosted the inside pass rush of the Broncos this year
with 8 1/2 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   That he improved so much so quickly, Pryce said, was a function
of his disappointment in how poorly he performed as a rookie.
Traylor, along with ends Neil Smith and Alfred Williams, helped him
pick up the pace in training camp this season. Now Pryce is just 60
minutes away from a ring he'll keep for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one,'' he said, ``I will wear with pride.''

ADVERTISING: SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL BLITZ AS IMPORTANT AS THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Mich., N.Y.) (dal) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 130 million or so viewers tune in on Sunday for Super Bowl
XXXIII, they will watch first-time enthusiasm confront longtime
experience, with players new to the big game pitted against those
who have learned the hard way what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, and a couple of teams will play football, too.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the annual marketing bombardment will parallel the
contest between the Atlanta Falcons, Super Bowl novices, and the
Denver Broncos, six-time veterans and the reigning champions.
</P>
<P>
   Most advertisers paying a record price for a spot _ an average
of $1.6 million for 30 seconds _ are Super Bowl stalwarts like
American Express, Anheuser-Busch, General Motors, the Frito-Lay and
Pepsi-Cola units of Pepsico and Visa USA. About a third, though,
are attention-seeking rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers include retailers of sneakers, Just for Feet, and
lingerie, the Victoria's Secret division of Intimate Brands; two
Internet job-search services, Monster.com and Hotjobs.com; Land
Rover North America, part of BMW A.G., peddling the 1999 Discovery
sport-utility vehicle; Progressive Corp., selling insurance with a
spot featuring the film character E.T., and the Yellow Pages
Publishers Association, selling a new look for an old book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Bowl advertising takes on a life of its own,'' said
Clint Pollard, executive vice president for marketing at the
association in Denver, primarily because, for a change, ``people
are paying close attention to the commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, your message can strike home,'' he added, ``in ways
that it might not during regular programming.'' The association
will run a humorous spot in the fourth quarter that portrays the
comedian Jon Lovitz as ``the man who wrote the Yellow Pages.'' The
commercial was created by the Martin Agency in Richmond, part of
the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying millions of dollars' worth of banners on Yahoo doesn't
seem to impress people,'' said Richard Johnson, president and chief
executive at Hotjobs.com in New York. ``But saying `We advertise on
the Super Bowl' makes a big statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Broncos, whose six Super Bowl appearances are spread
over 21 years, other advertisers are known for dropping in and out.
Most notable: Apple Computer Inc., which advertised in 1984 and
1985, then vanished until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple sort of invented the Super Bowl as a high-profile place
to run ads,'' said Steven P. Jobs, interim chief executive at Apple
in Cupertino, Calif., referring to the famous spot, titled
``1984,'' which ran that year to introduce the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Apple had planned to remain a Super Bowl holdout, he added,
until computer users began sending e-mails to the company, urging
that a commercial appearing on the Apple Web site also be shown on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, by the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, a unit of Omnicom Group, brings back HAL 9000, the
malevolent computer from the film ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' This
time, HAL delivers a pro-Apple pitch centered on the Year 2000
computer disruptions, which are described in the past tense. (After
all, the movie takes place a year after 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether marketers are bounceback advertisers like Apple or
first-timers, they describe their reasons for spending so much on a
spot in similar terms, praising the ability of Super Bowl ads to
achieve an increasingly difficult task in an era of media aimed at
splintered consumer groups: appealing to a huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 12- to 24-year-old audience we're now seeking for 7Up is
highly fragmented, but Super Bowl Sunday has the largest
concentration of them all in one place at one time,'' said John
Swan, executive vice president and managing director at Young &AMP;
Rubicam Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're reaching other constituencies that are important to
our business,'' he added. ``The sales force and the trade, the
folks we need to go through to get to the target. That's clearly an
added benefit.'' The Y&AMP;R Advertising spot for 7Up, sold by the Dr
Pepper/Seven Up unit of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, is scheduled for the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Super Bowl is the best opportunity we'll ever have to
reach roughly 40 percent of 18- to 49-year-olds, our key target, at
one time,'' said Ed Volkwein, an executive vice president at
Philips Electronics North America in New York. The company, a unit
of Royal Philips Electronics N.V., is also scheduled to run its
first Super Bowl spot in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, by Messner Vetere Berger McNamee
Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York, part of Havas Advertising, shows
a young swain's unconventional re-creation of a drive-in theater:
He sets up in his garage a 64-inch Philips high-definition TV set,
priced at $9,990, then parks with his date in the driveway to watch
an ``Austin Powers'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach the same unduplicated number of viewers,'' Volkwein
said, ``we would have to buy the equivalent of 13 or 14 prime-time
spots.'' If those spots were purchased on ``E.R.,'' the
highest-priced prime-time series, they would cost an average of
$7.3 million to $7.9 million. By that math, the Super Bowl spot is
a bargain, even at $1.6 million, which would be enough to buy 160
of those Philips TV's (with $1,600 left over for beer and snacks).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant investment, dollar-wise,'' said Paul
Sellers, national advertising manager at the American Honda Motor
Co. in Torrance, Calif., ``but an incredibly efficient investment
when you consider the broad, family audience and the number of
households you're reaching.''

 UNDATED: you're reaching.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Honda will run a tongue-in-cheek commercial by Rubin
Postaer &AMP; Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., that presents the
Honda Odyssey as the solution to family feuding over minivan
features like cup holders and seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay to play,'' said Jeff Taylor, chief executive at
Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., which was formed this month when TMP
Worldwide merged two Internet job services, the Monster Board and
the Online Career Center. ``The players in the Super Bowl pay their
price and we pay ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. TMP is paying not once but twice, buying two 30-second
slots to run the same Monster.com commercial in the second and
fourth quarters. The spot, by Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass.,
offers a wry twist on the bromide about wisdom from the mouths of
babes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the `Ad Bowl' as well as the Super Bowl,''
Taylor said. ``It's a real way to build confidence in a new method
of recruiting to see it in a venue such as the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And for our clients, seeing us out there in front of job
seekers is important to our story,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the hoopla surrounding the advertising has become a
major aspect of the growing hyperbole surrounding the Super Bowl.
Forty-eight percent of respondents to a survey by SAA/Research in
Farmington Hills, Mich., a unit of Morpace International, listed
seeing the commercials as a reason they watch.
</P>
<P>
   And 7 percent of respondents to a survey by Eisner &AMP; Associates,
a Baltimore agency, said they watched the Super Bowl only for the
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact all this attention is being paid to the commercials
is a positive, but it can also be a negative,'' said Jon Nesvig,
president for sales at the Fox Broadcasting Co. in New York, the
News Corp. subsidiary that will broadcast the game. ``If you're
going to spend a million-six, you ought to have a good message well
told.''
</P>
<P>
   If the message is deemed to lack those qualities, a sponsor can
be ridiculed afterward by viewers, advertising critics and agency
executives. Reviewing the commercials has become a cottage
industry, extending from office water-cooler gatherings the morning
after to the annual consumer survey conducted by USA Today, known
as the Super Bowl Ad Meter, to critiques in trade publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it won't be in the bottom,'' Johnson of Hotjobs.com
said, wondering how his Super Bowl spot will fare in the critical
rankings. ``If it's in the top 10, we'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's concerns about compelling content set off one of the
more amusing recent ad flaps, one that his public relations
department fanned with well-timed calls to advertising reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt at a Super Bowl spot for Hotjobs.com _ created
by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, owned by
Interpublic _ was rejected by Fox, which said it was in bad taste.
After Johnson sought replacement ideas on his Web site and from
another agency, Hill, Holliday resigned. The spot scheduled to run
in the third quarter of the game, centered on a night watchman's
visions of his dream job, was subsequently created by
McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, Mich., part of the McCann-Erickson
World Group unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   To further allay worries over whether the creative content of a
Super Bowl commercial will stand out amid the barrage of expensive,
glitzy spots, many advertisers are making their commercials the
centerpieces of elaborate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, American Honda Motor ``will extend the value of
the media buy,'' said Gerry Rubin, president and chief executive at
Rubin Postaer, with Internet promotions, newspaper ads and kits
sent to Honda dealers. And Just for Feet is promoting a contest
giving away a Hummer in its spot, created by the Rochester office
of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   And marketers like Victoria's Secret and the M&AMP;M/Mars unit of
Mars Inc. will tie in their spots with their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo Trucks North America, an affiliate of Volvo A.B. that
advertised for the first time last year, is returning on Sunday
with a similarly ambitious multitiered game plan: a commercial,
scheduled for the first quarter; a sweepstakes, giving away trucks
and Super Bowl tickets, and the sponsorship of parties at truck
stops across the country, increased to 50 this year from 40 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We taped truckers watching a Super Bowl,'' said Michael
Delaney, vice president for marketing at Volvo Trucks in
Greensboro, N.C. ``They paid an incredible amount of attention to
the spots _ and cheered the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question our Super Bowl spot and promotions did
exactly what we hoped, giving a strong start to a year that ended
with selling the most trucks in our history,'' he added. ``We're
not doing all this for ego; we're doing it for business.'' The
Volvo Trucks commercial is created by Carmichael Lynch in
Minneapolis, an Interpublic agency.
</P>
<P>
   With all that Super Bowl marketing maneuvering, can there
possibly be anything left that consumers have still not seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still looking forward to the first overtime Super Bowl,''
said Larry Novenstern, senior vice president and director for
sports marketing services at BBDO New York, the Omnicom Group
agency that is creating spots for the Federal Express unit of the
FDX Corp., Frito-Lay (Doritos), M&AMP;M/Mars (new Crispy M&AMP;M's),
Pepsi-Cola (Mountain Dew and Pepsi One) and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Novenstern is anticipating overtime because on Sunday, as his
agency has done ``for six or seven years,'' a BBDO client he
declined to identify has reserved the first-ever commercial to run
during overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With all eyes riveted on the screen, he said, it would be ``the
biggest steal in media history.''

 &HT;    San Francisco stadium delay boosts Atlanta's chance to host 2003
Super Bowl
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ At the risk of appearing greedy, Atlanta may pursue the
2003 Super Bowl if NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue decides in the
next few months to move the game from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   League officials confirmed Wednesday that San Francisco could
forfeit its role for the second time in five years because of the
continuing delays in building a new football stadium. Cost overruns
and the uncertain status of 49ers ownership have imperiled plans
for a $525 million project that includes a shopping mall and
stadium adjacent to 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, site of the 1994 Super Bowl, already will host next
year's game on Jan. 30, 2000. Atlanta representatives, in Miami to
observe Super Bowl XXXIII (which was to have gone to San Francisco)
and pitch the city to the media and to business people, confirmed
they also could host the 2003 game because Atlanta is not
overbooked with conventions that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility of our committee is to focus the energies
of our community on the upcoming Super Bowl XXXIV game,'' said
Robert Dale Morgan, president of the Atlanta Super Bowl 2000 Host
Committee. ``One of our objectives is to do such a good job that we
are awarded another Super Bowl game as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta would probably face a battle from San Diego and Miami.
Also working against Atlanta is the fact that the next four NFL
championship games will be in sites east of the Mississippi _ at
Miami (on Sunday), Atlanta (2000), Tampa (2001) and New Orleans
(2002).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steeg, the NFL's executive director of special events, said
Wednesday he would not discourage Atlanta from bidding on the 2003
game, if it opens up. Tagliabue will address the status of the game
during his ``State of the League'' press conference Friday.

ONLINE INVESTORS COMPLAIN ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH STOCK TRADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the millions of small investors who recently
flocked to cyberspace placed an order through his online brokerage
account for a hot new Internet stock, Theglobe.com, thinking it
would cost between $15 and $25 a share. His order was filled for
2,300 shares, at a price of $90 a share and a total bill of
$207,000, nearly $150,000 more than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Another investor placed an order on his personal computer to
sell 30 shares of a different company, never got an electronic
confirmation and so placed the sell order again, winding up selling
60 shares, twice the amount of shares he had held.
</P>
<P>
   A third investor tried to cancel an order to buy 45 shares of a
stock and received an acknowledgment that his cancellation order
had been received. But the sale went through nonetheless, and the
investor wound up purchasing the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The three investors are among hundreds who have recently
complained to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
reported on Wednesday that the record amount of online trading _
now 25 percent of all retail trading and growing fast _ has also
brought a record number of complaints. As of Sept. 30, the number
of complaints had quadrupled from the previous year to 1,114.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, with new issues of highly volatile Internet and
technology stocks coming to market weekly at prices that are
seducing new investors into trying to get rich quick, officials
here report the complaints are coming in faster than they can be
processed.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, cautioned small investors who have swarmed to the trade
on the Internet to approach online investing with care, to keep the
fundamentals of investing in mind and to place limits on the prices
of buy and sell orders to avoid the kinds of problems that are
plaguing the emerging group of small traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors need to remember the investment basics and not allow
the ease and speed with which they trade to lull them either into a
false sense of security or encourage them to trade too quickly or
too often,'' Levitt said. ``Some of the issues raised specifically
relate to online trading; others are generic to all investing. The
majority of them can be addressed through better education and
investors insuring that they have done their homework.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, some 10 million brokerage accounts are
expected to be able to trade on the Internet, nearly twice as many
as are now trading on the Web. The stunning growth of online
trading has already transformed Wall Street, sharply reducing
commission costs, increasing the speed of trading and making stock
trading more accessible than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosion of online trading has prompted a certain
complacency that can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of complaints to both securities firms and regulatory
agencies comes in large part from investors who had mistakenly
thought that their ability to trade almost instantaneously through
their personal computers put them on an equal footing with seasoned
traders on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in part the problems being encountered demonstrate that
technological advances in personal computers and the Internet lag
behind the advances that have been made at the stock exchanges. For
example, the stock price that consumers see on their screens may
bear no resemblance to the actual current price at the exchange,
particularly when the stock is volatile or when trading volume is
particularly heavy. Those lags have become common with hot new
public offerings of technology stocks, whose prices have moved as
fast as the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said in an interview on Wednesday that some of the
problems are rooted in misunderstandings about the new technology.
Other problems can be attributed to neophyte traders themselves,
who lack understanding of the risks associated with such
highfliers.
</P>
<P>
   While the more than 100 brokerage companies now on the Internet
have different approaches to resolving customer complaints, the
wave of filings at the regulatory agencies demonstrates that in
many cases the companies are not reimbursing their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to reduce the problems and also try to insulate
themselves from possible liability, many firms are posting warning
statements about trading problems on their Web sites caused by
volatility and high volume. Those statements were posted even
before the National Association of Securities Dealers issued a
notice on Tuesday recommending that the firms begin to take steps
to educate investors about delays and other possible problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Levitt warned small investors that since the prices they see on
their computer screens may not necessarily reflect current prices,
they should consider the advantages of placing orders that limit
the price at which a trade can be executed. He also cautioned
investors not to forsake the basic principles of investing and
understand that as much as the new technology has provided
important benefits, it can also have its shortcomings if not used
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of new investors have taken advantage of the
unprecedented access and individual control the Internet
provides,'' he said. ``But, new opportunities present all of us
with new responsibilities, challenges and risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy M. Smith, director of investor education at the Securities
and Exchange Commission, said that the most common complaints
involved investors who bought securities at prices significantly
higher than the prices posted on their screens. Other complaints
reflected that investors had moved with a few clicks of the mouse
into securities that, upon reflection, should never have been
purchased. Still others thought that they had canceled their
purchases before they were executed, only to learn that the order
was not actually canceled.

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS ARE THE OLD PERENNIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As one candidate after another enters the ranks of
presidential hopefuls, it appears that the two political parties
have been heavily influenced by Claude Rains' famous injunction
near the end of that memorable wartime film romance,
``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Round up the usual suspects'' commanded Rains, playing the
wily prefect of police in the strategic North African city during
World War II. It was an order designed to conceal the fact that
Humphrey Bogart, a hero who combined cynicism and idealism, had
just shot and killed an evil Nazi military officer.
</P>
<P>
   As police began searching for the ``usual suspects,'' an
airplane carrying Ingrid Bergman and Paul Heinreid to freedom in
Lisbon soared into the night, Rains and Bogart strolled off across
the tarmac, and the strains of ``As Time Goes By'' filled the
night. It remains one of the unforgettable moments in the history
of motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But no one ever dreamed that 56 years after ``Casablanca'' won
an Oscar as best picture of the year, American politicians would be
conforming, even unknowingly, to Rains' order.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hopefuls now lining up at the starting gate of the
presidential race are largely the ``usual suspects'' _ individuals
who have been closely identified with the quest for the presidency
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a few new personalities in the lineup, but
the most attention is being paid the perennial candidates or those
closely related to them.
</P>
<P>
   World War II veterans, who totally dominated the presidency for
40 years, starting with Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953, are no longer
contenders for the nation's highest post. But they have not
eliminated themselves from the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In two instances, the faces may not be the same, but the names _
and the dreams _ are. The last Republican president, George Bush,
is taking a vital interest in the prospects of his eldest son,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Bob Dole, who lost to Clinton in 1996,
is a one-man cheering section for his wife, former Cabinet officer
and American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Other probable aspirants include, on the Republican side, former
Vice President Dan Quayle, publisher Steve Forbes, former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, and the 1998 vice presidential nominee, Jack
Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, a former Indiana senator, served as vice president with
George Bush and would almost certainly have sought the nomination
in 1996 had he and Bush won a second term in 1992. Kemp, a onetime
Buffalo Bills quarterback, congressman and housing secretary, was
an unsuccessful contender in 1988 and went down to defeat with Bob
Dole in 1996. Forbes and Alexander were unsuccessful contenders for
the GOP nomination that year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore, who failed to
win the nomination in 1988, is in hot pursuit of the prize in 2000.
So far, his only opponent is former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, a
onetime basketball whiz with the New York Knicks who has been
mentioned as possible presidential timber since he entered politics
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who also
tried and lost in 1988, remains a possible contender.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hopefuls and probable hopefuls are new to the
national electorate. They include Republican Sens. John McCain of
Arizona and Bob Smith of New Hampshire, GOP Rep. John Kasich of
Ohio and former Reagan White House aide Gary Bauer and Democratic
Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, claiming Ronald Reagan as their patron saint,
are generally vying for the most conservative label.
</P>
<P>
   Since the right wing is the dominating force in the Grand Old
Party, its hardliners have sought to score points by criticizing
George W. Bush's espousal of what he calls ``compassionate
conservatism.'' By doing so, they have indirectly attacked his
father, whose policies and rhetoric in some instances were more
moderate than Reagan's.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter soliciting campaign funds, Quayle recently wrote:
``I have ordered my staff to never _ EVER _ utter the words
`compassionate conservative!' This silly and insulting term was
created by liberal Republicans and is nothing more than code for
surrendering our values and principles.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference two
weeks ago, Forbes declared that Republicans will go down to defeat
if they allow themselves to be ``seduced by the siren song of these
mushy moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander accused Gov. Bush of mouthing ``weasel words'' in his
advocacy of ``compassionate conservatism.'' Bauer, who placed first
in a straw poll of conference members, told them that
``compassionate conservatism'' is redundant.
</P>
<P>
   All share the view that to win the GOP nomination they must veer
far rightward, while Bush, with solid conservative credentials,
apparently believes that to win the presidency itself a candidate
must stay near the middle of the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical question is one that has divided Republicans
since World War II and the postwar era when the White House hopes
of Ohio Sen. Robert A. Taft, the party's leading conservative, were
dashed in consecutive conventions by such moderates as Wendell L.
Willkie, Thomas E. Dewey and Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative' strongest issues appear to be the advocacy of
a Reagan-style, across-the-board tax cut and an attack on Clinton's
moral failings, which they believe cast a shadow over his
hyper-loyal ally, Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore and Bradley, they appear less divided on ideology
than by personality and the question of who can win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It is intriguing to note, however, that as we prepare to move
into the 21st century, our prospective leaders are largely those
perennials who first blossomed a decade or so ago and keep popping
up every four years.

GENETIC MUTATIONS ACCUMULATING RAPIDLY, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., U.K.)  (rk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists analyzing human genetic data in the DNA data banks
have given fresh meaning to the saying that no one is perfect.
Harmful mutations have accumulated so fast in the human genome,
according to a new study, that the immediate question is why the
human species has not become extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Although human populations are evidently doing fine, common
minor afflictions like weakened eyesight, headaches and stomach
upsets could reflect this inherited baggage of adverse mutations.
And some biologists fear that as the bite of natural selection is
relaxed by medical advances, the mutational baggage could become
more significant in the centuries ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The effective mutation rate in the human genome is estimated in
the new study as being at least 4.2 mutations per generation, of
which at least 1.6 mutations are harmful. This is a high number
considering that a harmful mutation can be eliminated sooner or
later only by the ``genetic death'' _ death without progeny _ of
its carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that humans have retained a much larger
proportion of adverse mutations in their genome than have other
animals, like mice and rats. The authors of the study, which
appears in Thursday's issue of Nature, are Adam Eyre-Walker of the
University of Sussex in England and Peter D. Keightley of the
University of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The high retention of adverse mutations probably reflects the
fact that human populations have been extremely small throughout
their evolutionary history. In small populations it is easier for a
mutation to become fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our genome appears to be degenerating in one sense,'' said
Eyre-Walker. But he noted that the seriousness of the adverse
mutations was unknown and in any case had been outweighed ``by some
key adaptations that have made us very successful,'' presumably
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding is principally of interest to those engaged in
human evolutionary history and has little immediate bearing on the
genetic health of present-day populations, because the adverse
mutations that were found are all probably small in effect, even if
large in number.
</P>
<P>
   One theoretical implication of interest to evolutionists is that
the high mutation rate confirms a long-standing speculation about
the purpose of sex. Biologists have often wondered why a species
would go to the bother of sexual reproduction when division without
sex, the way the amoebas do it, would seem to be more efficient. A
favorite answer is that sexual reproduction, in which the genomes
are shuffled between generations, is an relatively efficient way of
shedding adverse mutations.
</P>
<P>
   The high rate of adverse mutation found in the new study
confirms that some efficient mechanism _ presumably sex _ is
required to remove bad mutations from the genome. ``To flush out
these deleterious mutations we need sex,'' Eyre-Walker said. ``If
we were asexual we would probably be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James F. Crow, a population geneticist at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison, confirmed Eyre-Walker's interpretation. ``The
existence of a high deleterious mutation rate strengthens the
argument that a major advantage of sex is that it is an efficient
way to eliminate harmful mutations,'' he writes in a commentary on
the paper. The cleansing action of sex arises because bad mutations
are brought together and eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Sex has not been completely efficient, however, and many adverse
mutations still remain in the human genome. Crow is concerned that
the mutational baggage may increase in the future because of higher
living standards that allow most infants to reach reproductive age.
``Can we keep this up forever?'' he wondered. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Using DNA sequences now on deposit in DNA data banks, the study
compared humans and chimpanzees. Each DNA difference was declared
to be a human mutation if in a third species, usually a gorilla,
the DNA was the same as the chimp's.
</P>
<P>
   Some mutations are inconsequential because they do not change
the sequence of amino acids in a protein and therefore have no
effect on the organism's survival. By measuring the numbers of
inconsequential and of effective mutations, the researchers were
able to compute the rate at which mutations entered the genome over
the last 6 million years.

 &HT;    Panelists at Miami University race relations meeting challenge
audience to go beyond comfort zones
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Ohio _ Those seeking to improve race relations in
their communities must move beyond feel-good rhetoric and force
themselves out of their comfort zones.
</P>
<P>
   That was the overriding theme delivered Wednesday by five
panelists at a Miami University Hamilton Campus forum entitled
``Racial Legacies and Learning: How to Talk About Race.'' The
``town-meeting'' event _ which drew about 120 staff, students,
faculty and community members _ followed a two-hour live
videoconference, sponsored in part by the Public Broadcasting
System (PBS). It was beamed by satellite to the Hamilton campus and
other locations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The videoconference was also seen by about 60 people on Miami's
main campus in Oxford, though no additional forum followed. The
Oxford campus was rocked last fall by the posting of racist and
homophobic fliers in a black cultural center. There were two
subsequent protests over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But the campus was stunned again earlier this month by the
arrests of two black students in connection with the fliers. Both
students have withdrawn from school and deny any involvement.
University President James Garland has said the arrests won't
derail efforts to address concerns of minority students.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Hamilton participants mentioned the Oxford campus
problems. But panelist Robert Moore, executive director of an
agency that coordinates social services in and around Hamilton,
said, ``Dialogue is only the first step ... let's not make it the
last step.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Johnson, University of Dayton graduate and employee
relations specialist with Ohio Casualty, recounted lessons learned
as a black foreign-exchange student in overwhelmingly white
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Challenge yourself on a daily basis,'' Johnson said. ``Take
yourself out of your comfort zone'' by making it a point to talk,
listen to and understand those who are not like you.
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Sherman, a 1943 graduate of Hamilton High School who
served as director of the city's human resources department from
1967-90, drew some smiles and nods of approval when he declared
himself ``sick and tired of these kinds of meetings.'' The former
president of Hamilton's NAACP branch said he has heard the same
issues discussed for more than 30 years. All Americans are victims
of a racist society, Sherman said.

CLINTON PROPOSES $100 MILLION FOR SALMON RESTORATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Wednesday proposed spending $100
million next year to restore coastal salmon in the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, sought by the governors and many elected officials
in Alaska, California, Oregon and Washington, was welcomed by
politicians and environmentalists bracing for the expected listing
of numerous West Coast salmon runs under the Endangered Species
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The states, each of which would get $25 million under the
proposal, would spend the money to protect salmon habitat by
improving water quality, planting trees, mapping watersheds or
monitoring restoration activities. The money would be matched by
state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal must be approved by Congress. The governors had
sought twice as much money next year, and wanted the program to
continue annually for six years, so there will be some pressure for
Congress to do more than the president proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funds can be used up and down coastal rivers and streams
to rebuild habitat, restore spawning grounds, give salmon a new
lease on life,'' Clinton said in a conference call with Northwest
officials and news media. ``And if we work together, I'm sure that
we can succeed in restoring this symbol of your region's heritage
and ensure that for all time to come the salmon will still be
thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, as Clinton envisions it, would be used for wild
steelhead trout and chinook, sockeye and coho salmon runs. It could
be used to buy conservation easements, plant trees, rebuild
culverts and stabilize stream banks.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 10 percent of the money would be used for tribal
salmon restoration projects.
</P>
<P>
   And the administration would try to improve local access to
federal scientific expertise on salmon restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also announced that, in addition to the $100
million West Coast salmon fund, it would propose a $25 million
increase for the National Marine Fisheries Service to develop
salmon recovery plans, $1.7 million for the Army Corps of Engineers
to begin construction of the Willamette River temperature control
project in Oregon, and $12 million toward the removal of two dams
on the Olympic Peninsula's Elwha River.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed the conference call from the Oval Office, where
he was joined by Vice President Al Gore, Seattle Mayor Paul Schell,
King County Executive Ron Sims and Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash. The
call, to Govs. Gary Locke of Washington, Tony Knowles of Alaska and
John Kitzhaber of Oregon, as well as Northwest Indian Fisheries
Commission Chairman Billy Frank Jr., took place just as the Senate
was voting against dismissal of impeachment charges against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was welcomed by numerous Washington state
officials, who are expecting Puget Sound chinook to be listed as
threatned under the Endangered Species Act in March, and bull trout
to be listed in June. The listings could require changes to
development along rivers in the densely populated central Puget
Sound region.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., called the announcement ``welcome
news,'' saying that ``salmon are a huge part of life in the
Northwest, closely tied to both our environmental values and our
traditional economic base.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks predicted that a broad-based panel will be named to decide
how federal dollars are spent. He also said that at least a
temporary U.S.-Canada agreement is needed to assure chinook salmon
will be able to return to Puget Sound spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has been critical of federal
efforts to restore salmon on the Columbia and Snake rivers but more
optimistic about the prospects in Puget Sound, also was positive.
Gorton had called for spending $310 on coastal salmon restoration
next year, but has insisted that state and local governments decide
how that money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say I'm encouraged that the amount of money he's
recommended in his budget is significant, (and) I'm more encouraged
by the fact that it looks as though it will get to the states and
even through the states to local governments and to private
entities who I think have the best record of salmon restoration for
the amount of money devoted to their activities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that the amount of money's not larger ... but
this is a good start. ... I applaud it and I encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a very useful proposal, but we want to say that
it's not the silver bullet for all salmon problems,'' warned Steve
Moyer, vice president of Trout Unlimited. ``This is a good time to
remind the administration and the governors that there are key
salmon issues not covered by this decision, such as what is to be
done with the Columbia and Snake river stocks, and trying to fix
the U.S.-Canada salmon treaty. ... If we don't make those kinds of
decisions this year the benefits that can be received from this
will be undercut.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hayes, an associate director at American Rivers, worried
about whether the money would be wisely spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many areas of the West, there is the perception that the
feds just want to impose restrictions, and this is a good
opportunity for federal agencies to show they want to put their
money where their mouth is and they want to be part of the team,''
he said. ``But one thing I don't see is the accountability, so that
this money will be spent wisely and on projects that are really
getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke has placed a particular emphasis on accountability,
knowing that there is widespread skepticism about the effectiveness
of past salmon conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that we will use these dollars in a way
that's scientifically based, that will result in demonstrable
improvement and recovery of our wild salmon _ the wild salmon which
are the icons of the Pacific Northwest,'' Locke told Clinton.

STOCKS FALL   AHEAD OF GREENSPAN'S TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell for the first time in three sessions
Wednesday as investors took some profits before congressional
testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Selling was particularly pronounced in computer and bank shares.
But it was another good day for Internet stocks, which were lifted
by better-than-expected earnings reports from Amazon.com and Ebay.
After the market closed, America Online released fourth-quarter
figures that also beat estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two stocks fell in price for every one that rose on the
New York Stock Exchange. On the Big Board, volume was 894 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gave back all of its gains from
Tuesday, falling 124.35 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,200.23.
Declines in IBM, J.P. Morgan and Chevron were the biggest negative
influences on the blue-chip index. Computer-generated sell programs
were responsible for virtually all of the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slipped 9.14 points, or
seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,243.17. And the Nasdaq composite
index, which has been on a torrid pace so far this year, declined
26.27 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,407.14. The Russell 2000 index
of small company stocks fell 4.21 points, or 1 percent, to 421.12.
But Thestreet.com's index of 20 Internet stocks gained 14.51
points, or 2.8 percent, to 534.60.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the broad-based sell-off, analysts said the decline was
orderly and understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is at price levels that concern me, but there is no
sense that this is anything beyond profit-taking and hesitancy
ahead of Mr. Greenspan's remarks and what people are certain is
going to be a strong report on the economy on Friday,'' said
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. Thursday
morning, Greenspan is scheduled to testify before the Senate Budget
Committee. And on Friday, the Commerce Department is expected to
release its first report on fourth-quarter economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day for Internet and some technology stocks,
and not much else,'' said Karl Mills, executive vice president at
Junka &AMP; Voyles, a firm based in Oakland, Calif., with $5 billion
under management.
</P>
<P>
   It was a particularly good day for Ebay, the online auction
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, which reported its fourth-quarter results after the market
closed on Tuesday, soared 82|, to 303{. The company said it earned
7 cents a share in the fourth quarter, comfortably beating
consensus estimates of 4 cents a share. It also said it would split
its stock 3 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the session was a dismal one for First Union and other bank
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   First Union led bank shares lower after it said higher expenses
and an accounting change will cut into its profits this year.
</P>
<P>
   First Union fell 4~, to 52 3/16, after the report. Other bank
stocks followed.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica lost 2 13/16, to 62[. J.P. Morgan slipped 4 3/16, to
100 1/16. And Mellon Bank fell 2 3/16, to 64 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Compaq led computer shares lower.
</P>
<P>
   IBM lost 7 5/16, to 178 5/16. And Compaq, which has seen its
stock price more than double since early October, fell 1}, to 47{,
despite posting fourth-quarter results that were better than
expected.

PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE SENDS MIXED SIGNALS ON STRATEGY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's defenders took seemingly
contradictory positions Wednesday, seeking a rapid end to the
impeachment trial while insisting that they would need an extended
period of legal fact-finding to answer any new information produced
by the witnesses approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not bluffing,'' the president's chief spokesman, Joe
Lockhart, said of the White House threat to seek weeks of legal
discovery, and perhaps call witnesses of its own, in the
president's defense. He stridently blamed Senate Republicans for
dragging out the proceedings by Wednesday's vote to hear three
witnesses requested by House impeachment managers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's ominous warnings of weeks or months of legal
wrangling came amid signs of a split in the president's legal team
between those seeking a quick end to the trial and those who
believe extensive fact-finding could help prepare Clinton's defense
against any possible criminal charges after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed signals from the White House appear to reflect
divisions between White House counsel Charles Ruff and David
Kendall, the president's chief private attorney, according to two
Democratic senators and one of Clinton's legal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Jack Reed of
Rhode Island, said they believed that Ruff was confident that the
three witnesses would offer no damaging information and would not
alter the outcome of the trial. Ruff was said to favor a strategy
of taking depositions from the three witnesses and then moving
quickly to a vote on the impeachment charges, without demanding any
new evidence or introducing additional delay.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall was described as concerned about Clinton's possible
legal jeopardy after he leaves office. Kendall was said to be eager
to take advantage of weeks of discovery and deposition-taking to
help strengthen the president's defense against any future
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also wants to use the fact-finding period to explore the
connections between Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and lawyers
for Paula Jones, whose sexual misconduct lawsuit against Clinton
brought his relationship with Monica Lewinsky to light, according
to a member of the president's defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year-long Lewinsky investigation, Kendall has
alleged improper collusion between Mrs. Jones' lawyers and Starr's
office. A wide-ranging discovery process would allow Kendall to
gather evidence of what he has called extensive prosecutorial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kendall is thinking ahead to insure the president incurs'' no
liability for future criminal prosecutions, Lieberman said. ``But
Ruff is just trying to end the trial successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that ordinarily a lawyer would seek as much
information as possible, even if it meant substantial delay in a
trial. ``Under a normal courtroom setting, lawyers would ask for
discovery,'' he said, ``but this is hardly something normal.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials vigorously denied such a split among the
president's lawyers. ``Everybody here wants this over now,'' a
senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which the sharp partisan divide seen in the House on
impeachment moved into the Senate chamber, the White House accused
the Senate Republican majority of blindly following the wishes of
the Republican House trial managers. Not only will the burden of
delay fall on the Republican majority, so will the public dismay
and disapproval, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings also served as a pointed message to Senate
Republicans that a long trial would only further damage the
Republicans' standing with a scandal-weary public.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward here, the country will understand that this
trial belongs to the Senate Republicans and the House Republican
managers, and that they alone are responsible for extending this
process,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart and other White House officials have until now
refrained from characterizing the Senate impeachment trial as a
partisan exercise. But with only one member of the Senate voting
with the other party Wednesday, the White House changed its tune.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Senate Republicans on Wednesday marched in
lockstep with the House prosecutors in defeating a motion to
dismiss the charges and then voting to authorize depositions from
the three witnesses urged on them by the House _ Ms. Lewinsky;
Vernon Jordan, a close friend of the president's; and White House
aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's vote was a vote to extend the process and a vote to
accommodate the House managers and our views on the House managers
are well known,'' Lockhart said. ``They have taken a path not
marked by a legal foundation but by a partisan and vindictive
attempt to remove the president. Whatever their motive, the Senate
Republicans have acceded to the wishes of the House managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart and other White House officials charged that
Republicans in the Senate appeared to be following what they
characterized as bait-and-switch tactics practiced by their House
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans broke numerous promises during the debate over
articles of impeachment last fall, White House aides complained.
They suspect that the approval of three witnesses is a ploy that
will lead to additional maneuvers and an indefinite extension of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all promised us that it would be over soon, they didn't
need witnesses, it's going to be bipartisan, and look where we
are,'' one White House official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``After a while you start to worry.''

 &HT;    Prominent Atlantans sue over lost investment
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An investment group dominated by wealthy Atlantans has
sued Chicago-based LIT Clearing Services for seizing and selling
$21.6 million of stock the investors had pledged as collateral in a
conservative, private investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta on Dec.
22, alleges Chicago fund manager E. Thomas Jung lost money in other
accounts and then pledged the collateral of the Atlantans' fund to
the clearing firm to shore up those losses. When Jung's losses
continued to mount, the clearing firm illegally sold the stock,
which should have remained segregated in the Atlantans' fund, the
complaint alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The private investment fund, Strategic Income Fund, was marketed
by Atlanta stock brokerage Lamon &AMP; Stern, most actively by firm
co-owner Hollis Lamon, a long-time associate of the now-bankrupt
Jung. The suit was filed in Georgia because the fund was organized
as a Georgia limited liability company in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to recover all of the investors' money and then
some,'' said Donald A. Loft, an attorney with Morris, Manning and
Martin, who represents the fund holders.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Atlantans who seek the return of their money plus $50
million in punitive damages include Internet entrepreneur U.
Bertram Ellis, chairman of iXL; nursery founder William Pike; and
car dealer Stephen Hennessy. Also included are liquor wholesalers
Jennings and Doug Hertz of United Distributors; wineries owner
Charles Slick; and interior designer Carter Kay.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 57 fund holders are suing.
</P>
<P>
   Fund holders either didn't return phone calls or referred all
inquiries to Loft.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jung nor Lamon is named in the lawsuit. But Loft said
Jung faces possible criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jung, whose Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing disclosed negligible
assets, according to the Wall Street Journal, is cooperating with
the fund holders.
</P>
<P>
   LIT Clearing Services merged in October with First Options of
Chicago, a unit of New York-based Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg. All of
these firms are being sued because the fund holders maintain in
their complaint that the clearing firms ``knew or should have
known'' Jung was not allowed to use the fund's pledged securities
as collateral for outside trades, an arrangement about which the
fund holders also say they knew nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the companies, according to the Wall Street
Journal, contend Jung and his options trading firm, ETJ Partners,
had only one account, implying they had no way of knowing Jung was
using inappropriate collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenzweig of Rogers &AMP; Harding in Atlanta, who
represents the defendant companies, couldn't be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The fund holders said in their complaint the account had ``a
series of sub-accounts'' and LIT Clearing Services had been advised
to put the collateral in these sub-accounts. LIT was also advised
the pledged stock was not the property of Jung or his firm, the
complaint alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic Income Fund was designed to be a safe investment
generating premium income from conservative stock option trades. As
margin for this options account, fund holders had pledged their
stocks, most of which were saddled with long-term capital gains
which would trigger high taxes if the stock were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fund holders are not only out their $21.6 million, but,
because LIT Clearing Services liquidated their stock, the fund
holders are facing a big tax bill that can only be recouped if the
lawsuit is settled in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant firms have until Feb. 22 to reply to the
complaint.

<P>
   TORONTO _ After Salt Lake City lost the 1998 Olympics to Nagano,
Japan, its Olympic organizers vowed to change their strategy for
the 2002 Games. One of their first moves was to hire a former
member of Egypt's national volleyball team who had close personal
contacts with athletic officials in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud el-Farnawani, a 65-year old sports-souvenirs salesman,
is part of a new breed of global lobbyists who have swarmed around
those who decide where to stage the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials had ample reason to believe
el-Farnawani could help them. After he had worked as a volunteer
for Toronto during its unsuccessful campaign to win the 1996 Summer
Games, the Australian Olympic Committee paid him $60,000 for
helping Sydney secure the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his biggest payday so far, $161,000, from Salt Lake
City for his efforts to garner votes from North African delegates,
work he compared in a series of interviews to that of a Washington
lobbyist astutely identifying the preferences of key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he happily married, or is he not?'' he said. ``How many
children does he have? Is he a religious person, or not? What kind
of food does he eat, what kind of subjects not to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Africans courted by el-Farnawani figured prominently
in the Olympic movement's recently released report on abuses by
Salt Lake City. A son of Libya's Olympic delegate received a
scholarship to a Utah university and $700 a month payments. A
Sudanese delegate received $25,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who is not currently working for any city, said he
did not know of these arrangements and was surprised to read about
them in press accounts. The Libyan resigned and the Sudanese was
expelled from the Olympic committee last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Olympic officials said they are determined to impose
much stricter rules on the lobbyists, who have proliferated in the
years since the games became a lucrative business for cities that
win the bid competition. The middlemen are at the center of the
worldwide scandal that focuses on whether Olympic committee
members' votes have, in effect, been bought over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into this issue of the so-called `agents' who
prey on the vulnerabilities and naivete of bidding cities,'' said
Richard Pound, a senior Olympic official whose investigation last
week concluded that there was widespread wrongdoing in Salt Lake's
effort to get the Games. ``By the time we are through with
so-called Olympic agents, I doubt that it will be a profitable
business _ if it ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent revelations, Olympic bids were awarded by a
secret vote of the International Olympic Committee, which includes
more than 100 delegates from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   As they competed with each other, officials from Sweden, Utah or
South Africa found themselves pondering how they might sway an
Olympic official from Poland or Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists were not bashful about offering their services.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gatlin, executive director of Atlanta's successful effort
to host the 1996 Summer Games, recalled that local officials had
been besieged by so-called consultants. He said one offered to
deliver votes in exchange for a fee of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people swarming around after you become a bid city,''
Gatlin recalled. ``They are subtle. They say they can offer
introductions, get you to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the scandal erupted, el-Farnawani was prospecting for
clients who might want help with the 2004 Summer Games. His
description of what he was offering was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought he could help with influencing voters,''
said Chris Ball, chief of the Cape Town, South Africa, bid
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by a city competing to host the Games has been around
for a long time, but the use of outsiders paid large amounts of
money is a recent phenomenon, growing as the Games have become more
profitable for the cities.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who lives modestly in a Toronto suburb, is only
one of several plying the Olympics trade. Salt Lake City used at
least two other middlemen, a Kuwaiti and a Utah businessman.
Sydney, Australia, also had two other lobbyists, one of whom
handled Latin American nations, the other Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What the bid committee in Sydney called ``regional specialists''
included a Hungarian-born American, Gabor Komyathy, who was a
swimmer and tennis player and could speak a half-dozen languages.
He was sent to lobby the Eastern European delegations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Latin Americans, Sydney turned to Elizabeth Fox, a
Colombian who had emigrated to Australia. Her primary job ws to act
as an interpreter, and host parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a beautiful house, right on the water,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Pt. Piper, a Sydney suburb.
``We had wonderful dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not paid. ``I just believe in helping,'' she
said. Efforts to reach Komyathy, who lives in Southern California,
were unsuccessful. His home telephone number is unlisted and a fax
sent to his business number was not answered.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, el-Farnawani said he regards himself as a
legitimate lobbyist who uses his contacts and his cultural
expertise to advise competing cities on how best to make their case
to Arab-African members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by all this news,'' el-Farnawani said of the
scholarships and payments. ``I read it for the first time as
everybody read it. It was quite shocking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he advised Salt Lake and Sydney that when a Muslim
delegate was coming to their city, there should be a Koran and a
prayer rug in his hotel room, and no alcohol in the mini-bar.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges, however, that the cities were paying for more
than his insights on Muslim culture: They were buying his personal
relationships with Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his native Egypt, el-Farnawani was an accomplished
middle-distance runner and volleyball player, and after his
competitive days were over he coached the Egyptian national
volleyball team. His family was one of the wealthiest in Egypt, he
said, until Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power in the mid-1950s and
nationalized the family's textile business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though life was more difficult, he remained until the 1967
war with Israel. He then moved to Libya where he coached the
national volleyball team, a job that allowed him to travel, thus
continuing his contacts in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he fled to Canada after Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader, came to power. First he went to Montreal, where he was a
high school physical education teacher. Eventually he moved to
Toronto, and in 1983 he founded Sports &AMP; Trade Canada. When Toronto
began bidding for the 1996 Olympic Games, he worked as a volunteer,
hoping that if Toronto won he would get a license to sell trinkets
with the Olympic logo. Toronto lost to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And so when officials from Sydney came calling, he asked to be
paid. He signed a contract for $3500 a month, later raised to
$4000. He said he expected to get a license to sell his products if
Sydney won. According to documents released by Australian Olympic
officials, el-Farnawani was present at a Monte Carlo hotel in
September 1993 when the Olympic committee voted 45-43 to give
Sydney the 2000 Games. The night before, the documents show,
Australian officials met with two African delegates and promised
their respective Olympic committees a total of $70,000 in funds.
They confirmed their arrangement the morning of the vote in a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' read the letter, ``Mahmoud el-Farnawani is
meeting with you with full authority to commit me in respect to any
assistance you identify.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani said he could not account for the letter's content.
</P>
<P>
   After Sydney's close victory, el-Farnawani did not get a license
to sell sports souvenirs at the Games. He did, however, win a
recommendation that led to his being hired by the Salt Lake City
bid team. Again, his task was to lobby for the votes of the five
members from the Arab states of North Africa: Algeria, Libya,
Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those delegates have been caught in the unfolding
scandal. Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, from Libya, resigned after it
was divulged that his son Suhel had received a scholarship and $700
a month in expense money from the Salt Lake City bid committee. And
Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, of Sudan, was expelled after
investigators concluded that he received more than $25,000 from the
Salt Lake City bid committee for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani described both men as his good friends whom he had
known for many years. He denied that he had had anything to do with
the payments, and said that he had not even been aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   He said Suhel Attarabulsi had told him that the scholarship was
arranged in 1994 by Tom Welch, head of the Salt Lake City committee
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Welch did not respond to a telephone message asking for a
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' el-Farnawani said of the committee members,
``I knew them for a long time, so they will not do anything to hurt
their image before me. Nobody will dare to ask for anything like
that from me. And the bid city never asked me to do this kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani's lawyer, David Goodman, asserted that the agents
were being made scapegoats. ``It's like shooting the messenger,
which ought to be an Olympic 'no-no,'' said Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   And Goodman sees nothing wrong with a city's hiring agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big business,'' he said. ``If you're trying to sell a
product you hire the right people.''

TIM DWIGHT,   THE FALCONS ' DAREDEVIL AND FIVE-WAY THREAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Iowa, Colo., Ga.)   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Atlanta's little big man, the kick returner Tim Dwight,
likes to think of himself as a little crazy. He takes trips to
Mexico for cliff-jumping, leaping some 90 feet into the rolling
water. His friend tried once, but didn't quite have the kind of
body control that Dwight possesses. ``He landed on his back after a
jump,'' Dwight said. ``He had red marks all over it. It was pretty
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny to Dwight, whose sense of humor is out of the ordinary.
But maybe that's what it takes to do what he does. Dwight stands
only 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 181 pounds, and that's after eating
a five-course meal. He may be the smallest Falcon player, but he
has two speeds, Warp 1 and Warp 10, and because of that quickness
Dwight has become one of the most dangerous kick returners in the
National Football League. He may be a rookie but his skills, and
his fearlessness, have played a vital part in Atlanta's Super Bowl
season.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight likes to think of himself as a daredevil, and it
translates onto the field. If he catches the ball 5 yards deep in
the end zone, he will run it out, his skinny legs moving in a blur.
That's what happened early on in Atlanta's National Football
Conference championship victory over Minnesota, and it unnerved the
Vikings, who were used to return men taking a knee if the kickoff
sailed deep.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was a big underdog against Minnesota, but it was able to
use Dwight to send a message _ we're not here to be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing will very likely happen in Super Bowl XXXIII
against Denver. If Dwight catches a kickoff deep in the end zone,
he will run it out. ``No question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So call him a cocky rookie, or make fun of his bad haircut. Just
don't underestimate him. Players see how small he is, and they lick
their chops. They run downfield, on violent special-team sorties,
looking to crush Dwight on kickoffs and punts. But he sidesteps
them and _ whoosh! _ accelerates downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a feeling with some players that they think
they can break my bones,'' Dwight said. ``But most of the time I'm
too fast for them to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``People give me grief about my size. That's OK That
means less people can see me. I can squirt through holes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, Dwight found enough holes to rank third
in the NFL in kickoff returns, with a 27-yard average, and 21st on
punts, with an 8.5-yard average. No game defined just how good
Dwight, a fourth-round pick out of the University of Iowa, can be
than the contest against the Carolina Panthers on Oct. 4. He
returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown _ a feat that
won him honors as special teams player of the week _ threw a
22-yard pass to quarterback Chris Chandler, and had 7 yards rushing
on two carries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that was the game in which Coach Dan Reeves began to
expand Dwight's role. By the end of the season, his name could be
found in five categories _ kick and punt returns, rushing, passing
and receiving (four receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown).
</P>
<P>
   Dwight's versatility then carried over into the playoffs.
Against the Vikings, he lined up at quarterback, and ran for a
crucial first down late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I get myself on the field, it's great,'' he said.
``Taking a snap from under center, running a reverse, running a
kick back, it's all great.''
</P>
<P>
   He has always been a bundle of energy. In sixth grade, during a
track meet, he was so pumped up for the race he fell out of the
blocks. Still, he got right back up, and finished second. In
college, Dwight would challenge 300-pound teammates to wrestle.
He'd lose, then get up and start talking trash. He once jumped from
a third-story dormitory into a snowbank. Several years ago, he
jumped off a 90-foot cliff into a Wisconsin river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to test my courage a lot,'' Dwight said. ``Life is there
to be enjoyed, not spook you out. That's the way I've lived ever
since I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is method to this recklessness. On the field, he is
a smart player who uses his aggression to spark the Falcons. His
speed is outstanding, honed from a lifetime of running track,
especially at Iowa, where he set a number of school records at 100
and 200 meters. Dwight has a season of track eligibility left and
plans on running this spring while completing his sports-management
degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim has been a crucial part of this team,'' Reeves said. ``He
can do just about anything we ask of him. If we asked him to play
safety, he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves added: ``He's explosive on punts. A guy breaks free, and
he makes him miss. He has speed, great vision. And he's a tough,
hard-nosed receiver. He doesn't shy away from blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves always has believed that special teams can not only turn
around a game, but also change a season. So far, everything he sees
in Dwight has made him happy.
</P>
<P>
   What made Dwight happy recently was the barbed-wire tattoo he
got on his wiry left biceps. Why such a prickly portrait?
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects my attitude toward football,'' he said. ``Barbed
wire is tough, like me.''

MARKET PLACE: KITCHENWARES COMPANY TARGETED BY SHAREHOLDER ADVOCACY
PROJECT

 (ATTN: Wis.)  (Eds. note byline change from the Finfronts budget)

 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors can be forgiven for having never heard of National
Presto Industries. The Eau Claire, Wis., company is known for being
run more like a private company than a publicly held one. While
consumers may be familiar with its wares _ an assortment of
pressure cookers, corn poppers and microwave bacon cookers _ its
stock has been a lackluster performer. No Wall Street analysts
follow it.
</P>
<P>
   But National Presto, formerly known as National Pressure Cooker
Co., may be starting to feel a little heat. A group of analysts has
chosen the company as the subject of an educational project about
corporate governance and shareholder rights. The group, the New
York Society of Security Analysts, which is made up of local
analysts and money managers, plans to use National Presto as an
example of how investors may be able to benefit from shareholder
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   While the society has no plan to become a corporate raider _
analysts are hardly known for their derring-do, after all, and the
society is careful not to take a position on any company _ this
pilot project represents an effort to educate members about the
importance of corporate governance. The society is attempting to
get ``visibility and research focus on smaller companies,'' where
there may be shareholder concerns, according to Peter Brennan, one
of the founders of MidCap Investors in New York and chairman of the
society's committee for corporate governance and shareholder
rights. If the pilot is successful, the society plans to expand the
project to focus on other companies.
</P>
<P>
   National Presto is the analysts' case in point. The company,
which had 1997 sales of almost $110 million, is run by a
father-and-daughter team. Melvin S. Cohen, who was 80 years old at
the time of the last proxy filing, is the chairman and has been a
director since 1949. His daughter, Maryjo Cohen, controls more than
a quarter of the outstanding stock. Three of the six members of the
board of directors are company officers. The Cohens have been
criticized for making little effort to communicate with investors
except for their lengthy letter to shareholders in National
Presto's annual report. The stock has barely budged over the last
five years, gaining an annual average of about 2 percent from 1994
through 1998, despite the soaring stock market. It closed Wednesday
at $40.5625, down 31.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   National Presto had no comment despite repeated requests that
included detailed information provided to them by the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the contents of the story were not shared with us in
advance, we believe it would be inappropriate to comment,'' said
James F. Bartl, executive vice president and secretary for National
Presto. ``Had they been disclosed, we would have been delighted to
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the Cohens are refusing to make the most of the
pile of cash and marketable securities on the company's balance
sheet, some $216 million, or a little over $29 a share, and nothing
in the way of debt. Some believe that National Presto should
explore ways to increase the value of the stock, including using
the cash to pay a special dividend, take itself private or buy
other companies. Any company with a lot of cash raises concerns
about whether the company will make good use of it _ providing
market returns rather than frittering it away.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a shareholder proposal, submitted last year,
which called for the company to retain an investment banker to
consider ``a sale, merger or other restructuring'' to increase the
value of the stock. The proposal was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of companies like this,'' said Mario J.
Gabelli, whose fund group owns stock in National Presto. What
attracted him to the stock is how little value the market places on
its core business. The stock would benefit if one of the company's
new products proved a hit, as National Presto's SaladShooter and
TaterTwister did in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The stock certainly looks inexpensive. Subtracting the company's
cash per share, investors are paying less than seven times for the
company's 1997 operating profits per share. It's a classic value
stock, said Steven M. Bregman, president of Horizon Research Group,
an independent research firm in New York. But it could take time
before investors saw the benefit of buying on the cheap, he noted.
``A cheap asset can remain cheap for a long time _ and can become
cheaper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And National Presto has prospered in a fiercely competitive
industry where others, like Sunbeam, have had difficulty, say its
fans. ``They have not chased sales and forgone profits and a clean
balance sheet to do it,'' said Gary E. Stiens, director of research
for Ryback Management, which runs the Lindner funds and is another
large shareholder. Like Gabelli, Stiens describes himself as
willing to wait _ at least for a while _ to see if the stock
delivers on its potential. ``This is a cheap option on something
huge happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence of investor opinion on National Presto is one
reason the company was selected, according to Gary Lutin, a former
investment banker who is an adviser on the project, which is
expected to serve as a forum on questions over whether the company
is willing to address shareholder concerns and, if not, what
shareholders can do to exercise their influence. ``The purpose of
the project is to show members of the society how the process works
and to make investment decisions based on that evaluation,'' Lutin
said .
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not National Presto is pressured to take action, the
project does show how attitudes toward shareholder advocacy have
changed over the years. Once viewed as the principle domain of the
large state pension funds and some noisy investors, activism has
begun to gain acceptance as money managers and analysts take the
job of voting their proxies more seriously and companies make
shareholder concerns more of a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Activism, if not mainstream, is pretty close to it,'' said
Patrick S. McGurn, director of corporate programs for Institutional
Shareholder Services, which advises large investors on proxy issues
and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the analysts interested? ``The real focus on corporate
governance is to create shareholder value,'' Brennan said. And
making money, whether by pushing directly for change or benefiting
from others' efforts, is a subject that gets everyone's attention.

CLINTON'S LEGAL TEAM BLAMES GOP FOR PROLONGING TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The finger pointing Wednesday over who should be
blamed for prolonging the president's impeachment trial began even
before the mostly party-line vote to summon three witnesses for
depositions.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said defense lawyers may need weeks, if
not months, to prepare if the Senate is going to allow a fair
trial. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he
hoped to end the trial by the start of the President's Day holiday
weekend, Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward here, the country will understand that this
trial belongs to the Senate Republicans and the House managers and
that they alone are responsible for extending this process,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said before the votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 56-44, virtually along party lines, in favor of
House prosecutors seeking depositions from former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal. By an identical vote, the Senate
defeated a motion to dismiss the charges against the president and
adjourn the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate most Americans want the impeachment trial ended
quickly and oppose the president being removed from office. The
White House and Senate Democrats argued against House managers'
request for witnesses, contending it was unnecessary and would
prolong the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action now shifts the onus onto the White House if it
wants to call witnesses in defense of the president. Democrats had
threatened to summon independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Linda
Tripp, the woman who taped Lewinsky's telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer it is prolonged, the more risk to their client. If
another shoe drops, it's their fault, not ours,'' Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, said of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, the White House is not saying which witnesses it will
call, if any, but is demanding access to the 55,000 documents kept
secret by the House Judiciary Committee for five months.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart suggested it could take up to four or five weeks to
pore over the documents, the same amount of time the House panel
took.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not bluffing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want this over with, but we want it done in a way that's
fair. And to allow this kind of advantage for the prosecution and
the prosecuting managers over the president's counsel is not
fair,'' Lockhart said. ``But there comes a point where basic
fairness overcomes our desire and the country's desire to wrap this
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintained Clinton's attorneys would be unable to provide an
adequate defense until the playing field is leveled and they have
the same access to information that House prosecutors have had.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the votes made clear that Republicans lack the 67 votes
required to remove the president from office. The White House could
still opt to question only those witnesses being deposed by
Republicans and hasten the trial's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., contended Clinton's lawyers
should be limited to calling on witnesses who would rebut the
testimony of the House managers' witnesses. ``If they go beyond
that, then it will be the White House that is stringing matters out
and not reaching a conclusion,'' Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans maintain they can wrap up witness interviews rather
quickly and any lengthy delay would be the fault of the White
House. Senate leaders from both parties are attempting to craft an
agreement on how the Senate will proceed for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the White House would be allowed to engage in a
discovery process if administration officials wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Lott maintained the House witnesses could complete their
depositions by this weekend or Monday at the latest. White House
attorneys would be allowed to cross-examine the House witnesses
during the depositions. The Senate will have to take another vote
to determine which, if any, of the three witnesses it wants to
appear in person.

 &HT;    Denver defense know when to get hot
 &HT;    By Andy Clendennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Denver Broncos played reasonable defense in the
regular season, only to turn up the juice in the post-season and
win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Broncos played reasonable defense in the regular
season, only to turn up the juice in the post-season en route to
their second straight Super Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have allowed just 13 points in two post-season
games, and held the Miami Dolphins without a touchdown in the
divisional championship game.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Denver's defense so good in the playoffs and just
better than ordinary in the regular season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you just have to change gears at some point,'' Keith
Traylor said. ``In the playoffs, if you lose you go home. In the
regular season it's a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just knowing when to turn it up and what level to
turn it up to, and that all depends on what time of the year it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the Broncos have been in this situation before.
And a playoff-tested team knows more than a post-season newcomer
about when to shift gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's our time, it's our time of the year to
really step up when we need it,'' Neil Smith said. ``You have to be
very solid at the end of the season and in post-season play. Taking
nothing from our offense, our offense has really carried this
ballclub with their scoring and kept the pressure off of us
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a few games where we've actually had to come back
and win, but I think it's time because we just stepped up. We have
enough veteran guys on the team to make it happen. It was just a
matter of time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A bye week also helps the defense re-focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you tend to refresh yourself, especially when you have
a bye week,'' Harald Hasselbach said. ``I think this team has done
a great job fixing all the mistakes we had through the course of
the season, and I think everybody was eager to rectify some of the
wrongs we had established in the last few games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos will have a tough time keeping their 6.5 point
playoff average defensively intact against a solid Falcons offense.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recent past is any indication, expect the Broncos to
ride a defensive wave through the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's playoff time,'' Trevor Pryce said. ``This is our time of
the year when we step it up. There's nothing different, just go out
and play as hard as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that old saying, offense sells tickets and defense
wins championships,'' Maa Tanuvasa said. ``We just knew what we had
to do to get to this position and it worked out great for us.''

   Rotating eight linemen pays off
</P>
<P>
   By Andy Clendennen
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Sentinel
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Pity the Broncos defensive statisticians and the
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   While most teams spend the better part of a season _ or even
three or four seasons _ looking for four defensive lineman to rely
on, the Broncos have a rotating system in which they generally use
eight linemen in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Smith, Alfred Williams, Trevor Pryce, Keith Traylor, Marvin
Washington, Harald Hasselbach, Mike Lodish and Maa Tanuvasa have
all seen significant playing time this season, and their stats bear
that out.
</P>
<P>
   Only Lodish has fewer than 27 tackles, but he also has two
sacks. Every defensive lineman has at least two sacks, and Tanuvasa
and Pryce led the team with 8.5 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   All this while sharing time with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that the system works, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been here we've always had the rotation and it's
really worked out well for us,'' Tanuvasa said. ``Because at the
elevation level we play at in Mile High, it's pretty tough to have
four guys go all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like it this way and it's been an advantage for us, because
we've gotten far with the rotation we have.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith first came into the situation, he admits it took a
bit of getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Smith was accustomed to being one of the focal
points of a perennial strong defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me when I first learned about it,'' Smith
said. ``But I think it's an advantage really, because the offensive
line has to get prepared for two guys. The bottom line is every
team has to get ready for two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure two against one, we have the advantage to win
because it's not always the first guy in there that can get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no animosity among the linemen that could threaten
the cohesiveness of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been accustomed to starting. Then Tanuvasa took his
place, and Williams bears no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, Tanuvasa has played extremely well so far,''
Williams said. ``And I've been able to come in and give sparks, and
I think combined we've been able to do a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   As has the entire platoon system employed by the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this system as both a backup and a starter and
the roles are very similar,'' Hasselbach said. ``You get to come in
as a backup and get to play up to 50 percent of the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now as a starter I get to play a little more, but it's
essentially the same thing. It's a tremendous asset if you throw
different arsenals of weapons at an opposing team.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryce likens the platoon system to being a Catch-22 situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be in there,'' Pryce said. ``But when you get
tired you can go to your defensive line coach and say, 'Hey, I'm
tired, I need a break.' He doesn't have to say, 'No, you gotta keep
going.' That's when it's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when you're not tired and they take you out anyway because
they want you to be fresh in the fourth quarter, then it's bad. But
I see the good outweighing the bad, much more.''
</P>
<P>
   And the unity necessary to make a system like this work is shown
by Tanuvasa. The Broncos have employed four different starting
defensive fronts this year, but who starts and who doesn't isn't a
big priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' Tanuvasa said. ``I'm just happy to
get the opportunity to go out there and perform. We have a bunch of
unselfish guys on our team and it doesn't matter how many plays you
get or how many reps, we're all just happy to contribute.''

STRIPPED-DOWN STONES: TOUR OPENS WITH RARITIES AND ENERGY
TO  SPARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Next to the colossal Oakland Coliseum shows of
a year ago, Monday's Rolling Stones tour opener next door at the
New Arena seemed like a backyard barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the spectacle of their big stadium shows, the
Stones' current tour is a stripped-down, concrete-and-aluminum
affair focusing on the music. And for most of a well-paced two-hour
set, the music starred.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief, inoffensive power-pop set by opening act Bryan
Adams, the refurbished gymnasium shuddered with anticipation as the
overhead screens flashed a slo-mo video clip of the band's core
four _ Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Ron Wood _
striding purposefully through the bowels of a stage set, like
pretty boys with brass knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Richards then burst onto the sparse stage, bending his whole
pipe-cleaner body into the opening riff of ``Jumpin' Jack Flash.''
He assumed his splay-legged stance, an untucked zebra-print shirt
flowing from his leather jacket and a chain swinging between his
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, in the news for his mounting legal problems with his
estranged wife, Jerry Hall, seemed particularly eager to release
some pent-up energy. His face set in a granite stare, he threw his
shoulder playfully into Wood on the band's second song, ``Live With
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his recent personal developments, certain lyrics took on
extra heft: ``Get out of my life/ Don't come back,'' the singer
snarled on ``Respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girls give me children/ I never asked for those,'' he
sniffed several songs later, maintaining that the Stones had never
played that 1978 tune live before.
</P>
<P>
   Well-rehearsed and spunky, the band (including bassist Darryl
Jones, keyboardist Chuck Leavell, a four-piece horn section and
backup singers Bernard Fowler, Lisa Fisher and Blondie Chaplin)
still hit some rough patches.
</P>
<P>
   The barked vocal of ``Undercover of the Night'' made for a
set-list dud, and a gimmick involving Mick behind bars during ``Out
of Control'' was out of place in an otherwise gimmick-free set.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs were more likable near-misses: The lovely, lacy
``Sticky Fingers'' track ``Moonlight Mile,'' for instance _ another
live first-timer, Jagger claimed _ was a great choice searching for
its footing.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was his usual mechanical, vogueing self, Jagger seemed
engaged and at ease for much of the show, strapping on an electric
guitar for several songs and throwing himself into the hallelujah
chorus of ``Shine a Light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the retro show!'' he joked as the band plunged into a
loose, arm-in-arm version of ``Honky Tonk Women'' to conclude a
trio of small-stage numbers at midset.
</P>
<P>
   Performing at the end of a catwalk jutting into the floor seats,
the band reached back into the pre-Stone age for ``Route 66'' and
``I Just Want to Make Love to You,'' the very first cover songs
from their very first album, released in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the small-stage time warp, crowd favorite Richards
took over the controls for a pair of tunes. Rubbing his head and
slumping onto a wooden stool, the affable whiskey man wished his
adoring audience a belated happy New Year. ``Good for a couple more
days,'' he said with a shrug.

<P>
   ``On with the impossible,'' he muttered, then lurched into the
slide-acoustic blues ``You Got the Silver,'' which he introduced as
(set ital)``I(end ital) Got the Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   As the wonderfully unsteady rendition teetered to a finish,
Richards laughed. ``I don't think I've done that since I did it!''
he snorted.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the home stretch did the show take on the well-oiled
detachment of so many Stones shows. After such inspired song
selections, the band wrapped itself in old blankets.
</P>
<P>
   As Fowler and Fisher shimmied like kids on ``Shindig,'' Richards
and Wood cranked up the Chuck Berry riffs of ``It's Only Rock 'n'
Roll.'' For the set-closer, Jagger led the crowd in the big, dumb
``Brown Sugar'' sing-along (``I said yeah ... yeah ... yeah ...
Whoo!''). Both songs were set-list staples of the past world tour.
</P>
<P>
   For the encore, the Stones played two _ one too many. Whereas
the slow chugging and sudden downhill hurtles of ``Midnight
Rambler'' were a thrill, the ``Sympathy for the Devil'' finale was
a walk-through.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the euphoric grin on Richards' face as he kneeled with
his guitar said plenty. Too old to rock 'n' roll? Let him flail at
the strings until they lower him into the dirt.

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ Dividing almost precisely along
party lines, the Senate votes to summon Monica Lewinsky and two
other witnesses for depositions in the impeachment trial of
President Clinton. Minutes earlier, it voted against dismissing the
charges against Clinton. Although the Republicans prevailed, they
could muster nothing approaching the 67 votes required to convict
the president. Sen. Thomas Daschle, the minority leader, said the
44 votes demonstrate that ``the president will not be removed from
office.'' But the way forward is far from clear. By R.W. Apple Jr.

ROMANCING THE STONES: FANS GET WHAT THEY WANT _ AND NEED 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ When Mick Jagger flounced onstage in a black
leather jacket Monday night and propelled the Rolling Stones into
``Jumping Jack Flash,'' the first number of the first show of their
No Security tour, pandemonium erupted. Women hugged men; men hugged
men; parents hugged kids; and everyone jumped to their feet with a
roar that all but drowned out the band's massive speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Stones reached their third song,
``Respectable,'' the fans had calmed down enough to hear the music
_ just barely.
</P>
<P>
   They came from Japan. They came from New Jersey. They came from
Hillsborough, Calif., London and San Francisco. For all we know,
some of them came from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   This week Stones fans of every make and model have converged at
Oakland's New Arena to see their beloved band launch its American
tour. And to their credit, Mick and his merry men gave them a show
that, if not quite worth the $150-$300 price tag of the arena's
best seats, was still everything a Stones fan could desire: sex, no
drugs and lots of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, they played ``Moonlight Mile''; and,
according to Jagger, ``Some Girls'' was getting its first concert
airing. Keith Richards treated the audience to a sterling version
of ``You Got the Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most ardent followers boasted stage-side seats close
enough to catch Richards' sweat and count the lines on Jagger's
soon-to-be-divorced face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something special, something personal'' about the
connection between the Stones and the people who love them,
according to Steve Portigal of Palo Alto, Calif., founder of the
Internet's Undercover fan organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some it's sex, it's pure desire that Mick or Keith or
Ronnie spurs through voice, instrument and body language,'' he said
before the show. ``There's something that happens when those
individuals, with their conflicting styles, start rocking _ it
makes me jump up and down in a frenzy, it makes me sing, it makes
me close my eyes and be swept away.''
</P>
<P>
   Portigal wasn't the only one to admit being swept away by the
Stones.
</P>
<P>
   _ June Snowdon, 33, and Gary Malfatti, 47, of Hillsborough,
Calif., ``I've seen them 57 times since 1978,'' said a grinning
Malfatti, who came toting his personalized Stones license plate.
``All over the world: Paris, Barcelona, Toronto. Of course, it's
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Toru and Chie Fujiwara, 38 and 43 respectively, who traveled
from Osaka, Japan, and spent $600 for a pair of tickets. ``We met
because we were both such big fans,'' laughed Chie. ``The Stones
were like Cupid for us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mary Ellen Trendler and Randey(CQ) White, who met a year ago
through an online Stones chat room. She was in Philadelphia; he
lived in Sacramento, Calif. Now they live in Philly together but
came to Oakland to see their favorite band. ``This is my 46th
show,'' White said proudly. ``And the tour's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cat Paul from Eureka, Calif., and Shirley Birenz from New
Jersey, who sported Rolling Stones tongue logos lacquered on their
nails.
</P>
<P>
   Fannish dedication and star-crossed love stories aside, do the
Stones of '99 warrant the same attention as the Stones of '65 or
even '75? Can a bunch of guys with a couple of years on the average
Green Day fan's grandpa still rock? Their die-hard, financially
depleted fans think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can they still cut it? Absolutely! They're still the best
thing going in the business,'' insisted Tod Armstrong, who scored a
fourth-row seat on the arena's first level. ``They're an absolute
institution, the likes of which will never be witnessed again in
popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds hyperbolic, you haven't been to a Stones tour
opener. On Monday night, middle-aged men with their ties loosened
mixed with the typical _ albeit decidedly older _ blend of concert
fans wearing everything from blue jeans to tour jackets worth
hundreds of dollars. Together they cheered. And cheered. And danced
to all their favorite songs, many of them at least 20 years old.
When a smiling, still swaggering Richards cut into the opening riff
of ``Live With Me,'' the collective euphoria made the arena feel
like the interior of a helium balloon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rolling Stones' Peter-Pan parlance, one doesn't age; one
simply grows ever-more elegantly wasted. The Stones phenomenon
isn't so much about a middle-aged millionaire group as it is about
what that group has come to symbolize _ that you can rock 'n' roll
ad infinitum and not fade away.
</P>
<P>
   And watching the dizzy delight of the crowd when a wizened
Jagger shamelessly shook his booty, it seemed the most reasonable
proposition in the world.

LIVENT EXECUTIVES REFUSE TO RETURN TO U.S. TO FACE FRAUD CHARGES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, the two Canadians who
founded the Broadway theater company Livent Inc., said through
their lawyers Wednesday that they will not come to Manhattan to
face the criminal fraud charges brought against them by U.S.
prosecutors early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had asked the two men to turn themselves in
and confront charges that they had masterminded a scheme that
defrauded Livent's investors out of tens of millions of dollars
while lining their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward L. Greenspan, Drabinsky's lawyer, said Wednesday that
his client believed that it would be ``very difficult'' to get a
fair trial in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drabinsky has suffered a great deal by the charges leveled
against him _ charges brought after a very quick and rushed
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York,''
Greenspan said in a written statement. ``This is an essentially
Canadian matter involving Canadian citizens and, as a matter of
convenience and justice, should properly be dealt with before
Canadian courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court
Thursday morning. If they do not appear at the arraignment, the
judge will most likely issue a warrant for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said on Jan. 13
when she filed 16 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy against
each of the men that if they did not turn themselves in,
prosecutors would quickly file papers in Canadian courts to
extradite them. That process, however, has many steps and could
take months.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is also investigating the
case, but that inquiry is expected to take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Livent, which has produced such Broadway shows as ``Ragtime,''
``Showboat'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' is based in Toronto,
but was listed on stock exchanges in both the United States and
Canada. In June, a group headed by Michael Ovitz, the former
president of Walt Disney Co., took over the company, and two months
later, the new executives said they had discovered millions of
dollars of accounting problems in the company's books.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-month investigation, U.S. prosecutors and
securities regulators said this month that they had evidence that
Drabinsky and Gottlieb had conspired to hide the company's
extravagant spending and the resulting $60 million in losses by
directing Livent's accounting staff to keep two sets of books.
Prosecutors and regulators also said that in the early 1990s, the
two men had created a scheme in which contractors that had been
paid by Livent illegally moved about $7 million back to the two
men's personal accounts or to a company that Gottlieb owned.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have disputed the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said in an interview Wednesday night that Drabinsky
had met with prosecutors for one day in Manhattan late last year to
answer questions. When Drabinsky offered to come back to answer
more questions, Greenspan said, federal prosecutors declined and
instead filed charges.
</P>
<P>
   `` Drabinsky will avail himself of the legal protections
afforded him in his native Canada,'' Greenspan said. ``He will
vigorously oppose any extradition request by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb's lawyer, Brian H. Greenspan, who is Edward Greenspan's
brother, also issued a written statement, saying that his client
had also decided to oppose any effort made to extradite him from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision has been made both due to Gottlieb's abiding
belief in his innocence of the charges so hastily lodged against
him in the United States,'' Brian Greenspan's statement said, ``and
because he is convinced that, if at all, he should face those
charges only in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Livent, which filed for bankruptcy protection in November, is
now trying to reorganize its financial matters. While the company
has canceled many productions in Canada, the curtain continues to
rise on ``Ragtime'' and ``Fosse'' in New York.  &QL;

 &HT;    North Carolina bank to buy First Citizens
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BB&AMP;T of Winston-Salem, N.C., announced a deal
Wednesday to buy First Citizens, a Newnan-based banking company
with 13 locations on Atlanta's Southside.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would give BB&AMP;T a foothold in metro Atlanta and
its first presence in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent First Citizens' stock up $8.25 to $38.37 1/2. BB&AMP;T
shares, typical of those of an acquiring company, slipped $1.25 to
$37.18 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ``gets us into an area that we've wanted to be in
for a number of years, the metropolitan Atlanta area,'' said Bob
Denham, BB&AMP;T's vice president of public relations. ``It's a natural
extension of our Spartanburg and Greenville, S.C., markets that run
along the I-85 corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   First Citizens was founded in 1927 in Newnan. It has $421
million in assets, about 170 employees and operates offices in
Coweta, Fayette, Clayton, Troup and Henry counties. BB&AMP;T has $35
billion in assets and operates 534 offices in the Carolinas,
Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, First Citizens stockholders will receive 1.0789
BB&AMP;T shares for each share of First Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is subject to approval of First Citizens'
shareholders and banking regulators.
</P>
<P>
   BB&AMP;T Chairman John Allison will meet with First Citizens
employees at 7:30 p.m. today at the Wyndam Peachtree Conference
Center in Peachtree City.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ After Salt Lake City lost the 1998 Olympics to Nagano,
Japan, its Olympic organizers vowed to change their strategy for
the 2002 Games. One of their first moves was to hire a former
member of Egypt's national volleyball team who had close personal
contacts with athletic officials in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud el-Farnawani, a 65-year old sports-souvenirs salesman,
is part of a new breed of global lobbyists who have swarmed around
those who decide where to stage the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials had ample reason to believe
el-Farnawani could help them. After he had worked as a volunteer
for Toronto during its unsuccessful campaign to win the 1996 Summer
Games, the Australian Olympic Committee paid him $60,000 for
helping Sydney secure the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his biggest payday so far, $161,000, from Salt Lake
City for his efforts to garner votes from North African delegates,
work he compared in a seriesof interviews to that of a Washington
lobbyist astutely identifying the preferences of key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he happily married, or is he not?'' he said. ``How many
children does he have? Is he a religious person, or not? What kind
of food does he eat, what kind of subjects not to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Africans courted by el-Farnawani figured prominently
in the Olympic movement's recently released report on abuses by
Salt Lake City. A son of Libya's Olympic delegate received a
scholarship to a Utah university and $700 a month payments. A
Sudanese delegate received $25,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who is not currently working for any city, said he
did not know of these arrangements and was surprised to read about
them in press accounts. The Libyan resigned and the Sudanese was
expelled from the Olympic committee last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Olympic officials said they are determined to impose
much stricter rules on the lobbyists, who have proliferated in the
years since the games became a lucrative business for cities that
win the bid competition. The middlemen are at the center of the
worldwide scandal that focuses on whether Olympic committee
members' votes have, in effect, been bought over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into this issue of the so-called `agents' who
prey on the vulnerabilities and naivete of bidding cities,'' said
Richard Pound, a senior Olympic official whose investigation last
week concluded that there was widespread wrongdoing in Salt Lake's
effort to get the Games. ``By the time we are through with
so-called Olympic agents, I doubt that it will be a profitable
business _ if it ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent revelations, Olympic bids were awarded by a
secret vote of the International Olympic Committee, which includes
more than 100 delegates from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   As they competed with each other, officials from Sweden, Utah or
South Africa found themselves pondering how they might sway an
Olympic official from Poland or Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists were not bashful about offering their services.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gatlin, executive director of Atlanta's successful effort
to host the 1996 Summer Games, recalled that local officials had
been besieged by so-called consultants. He said one offered to
deliver votes in exchange for a fee of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people swarming around after you become a bid city,''
Gatlin recalled. ``They are subtle. They say they can offer
introductions, get you to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the scandal erupted, el-Farnawani was prospecting for
clients who might want help with the 2004 Summer Games. His
description of what he was offering was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought he could help with influencing voters,''
said Chris Ball, chief of the Cape Town, South Africa, bid
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by a city competing to host the Games has been around
for a long time, but the use of outsiders paid large amounts of
money is a recent phenomenon, growing as the Games have become more
profitable for the cities.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who lives modestly in a Toronto suburb, is only
one of several plying the Olympics trade. Salt Lake City used at
least two other middlemen, a Kuwaiti and a Utah businessman.
Sydney, Australia, also had two other lobbyists, one of whom
handled Latin American nations, the other Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What the bid committee in Sydney called ``regional specialists''
included a Hungarian-born American, Gabor Komyathy, who was a
swimmer and tennis player and could speak a half-dozen languages.
He was sent to lobby the Eastern European delegations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Latin Americans, Sydney turned to Elizabeth Fox, a
Colombian who had emigrated to Australia. Her primary job ws to act
as an interpreter, and host parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a beautiful house, right on the water,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Pt. Piper, a Sydney suburb.
``We had wonderful dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not paid. ``I just believe in helping,'' she
said. Efforts to reach Komyathy, who lives in Southern California,
were unsuccessful. His home telephone number is unlisted and a fax
sent to his business number was not answered.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, el-Farnawani said he regards himself as a
legitimate lobbyist who uses his contacts and his cultural
expertise to advise competing cities on how best to make their case
to Arab-African members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by all this news,'' el-Farnawani said of the
scholarships and payments. ``I read it for the first time as
everybody read it. It was quite shocking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he advised Salt Lake and Sydney that when a Muslim
delegate was coming to their city, there should be a Koran and a
prayer rug in his hotel room, and no alcohol in the mini-bar.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges, however, that the cities were paying for more
than his insights on Muslim culture: They were buying his personal
relationships with Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his native Egypt, el-Farnawani was an accomplished
middle-distance runner and volleyball player, and after his
competitive days were over he coached the Egyptian national
volleyball team. His family was one of the wealthiest in Egypt, he
said, until Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power in the mid-1950s and
nationalized the family's textile business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though life was more difficult, he remained until the 1967
war with Israel. He then moved to Libya where he coached the
national volleyball team, a job that allowed him to travel, thus
continuing his contacts in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he fled to Canada after Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader, came to power. First he went to Montreal, where he was a
high school physical education teacher. Eventually he moved to
Toronto, and in 1983 he founded Sports &AMP; Trade Canada. When Toronto
began bidding for the 1996 Olympic Games, he worked as a volunteer,
hoping that if Toronto won he would get a license to sell trinkets
with the Olympic logo. Toronto lost to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And so when officials from Sydney came calling, he asked to be
paid. He signed a contract for $3500 a month, later raised to
$4000. He said he expected to get a license to sell his products if
Sydney won. According to documents released by Australian Olympic
officials, el-Farnawani was present at a Monte Carlo hotel in
September 1993 when the Olympic committee voted 45-43 to give
Sydney the 2000 Games. The night before, the documents show,
Australian officials met with two African delegates and promised
their respective Olympic committees a total of $70,000 in funds.
They confirmed their arrangement the morning of the vote in a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' read the letter, ``Mahmoud el-Farnawani is
meeting with you with full authority to commit me in respect to any
assistance you identify.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani said he could not account for the letter's content.
</P>
<P>
   After Sydney's close victory, el-Farnawani did not get a license
to sell sports souvenirs at the Games. He did, however, win a
recommendation that led to his being hired by the Salt Lake City
bid team. Again, his task was to lobby for the votes of the five
members from the Arab states of North Africa: Algeria, Libya,
Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those delegates have been caught in the unfolding
scandal. Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, from Libya, resigned after it
was divulged that his son Suhel had received a scholarship and $700
a month in expense money from the Salt Lake City bid committee. And
Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, of Sudan, was expelled after
investigators concluded that he received more than $25,000 from the
Salt Lake City bid committee for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani described both men as his good friends whom he had
known for many years. He denied that he had had anything to do with
the payments, and said that he had not even been aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   He said Suhel Attarabulsi had told him that the scholarship was
arranged in 1994 by Tom Welch, head of the Salt Lake City committee
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Welch did not respond to a telephone message asking for a
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' el-Farnawani said of the committee members,
``I knew them for a long time, so they will not do anything to hurt
their image before me. Nobody will dare to ask for anything like
that from me. And the bid city never asked me to do this kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani's lawyer, David Goodman, asserted that the agents
were being made scapegoats. ``It's like shooting the messenger,
which ought to be an Olympic 'no-no,'' said Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   And Goodman sees nothing wrong with a city's hiring agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big business,'' he said. ``If you're trying to sell a
product you hire the right people.''

SENATE TOLD OF IMPENDING DEAL IN HOLBROOKE LOBBYING INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has notified members of
the Senate that Richard Holbrooke is close to a deal with the
Justice Department to settle conflict-of-interest allegations, and
that his nomination as chief American delegate to the United
Nations is likely to be sent to the Senate within days for
confirmation, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, they said, Holbrooke will pay a
penalty of a few thousand dollars to settle Justice Department
allegations that he violated federal lobbying laws in his contacts
with the American Embassy in South Korea in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said negotiations between the department and
Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 peace settlement in Bosnia,
were down to their final hours, with both sides close to the final
wording of a settlement. ``It's very close,'' said a Justice
Department official.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Holbrooke's, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that the veteran diplomat continued to believe ``he's done
absolutely nothing wrong.'' But the friend said he had agreed to a
settlement to put the seven-month inquiry behind him and to allow
the White House to move forward with his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had asserted that Holbrooke's contacts with the
ambassador in Korea, weeks after he resigned from the State
Department to join an investment banking firm, amounted to a civil
violation of laws that bar officials leaving the government from a
variety of lobbying contacts with their former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said administration officials had
informally notified Democratic members of the Senate that a deal
with the Justice Department was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told to be ready, and that none of the allegations
were serious enough to pose any threat to the nomination,'' said a
congressional official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another congressional official said that Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, would
doubtless call for a review of the information turned up by
prosecutors, but expressed the hope that ``we will probably be able
to deal with this fairly quickly and get him confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Helms said the senator had no immediate comment
on Holbrooke's chances for confirmation. The Justice Department and
a lawyer for Holbrooke had no comment on their recent negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Former senior diplomats have rallied to Holbrooke's defense.
</P>
<P>
   James Laney, a former ambassador to South Korea, has insisted
that Holbrooke did nothing wrong in asking for his help in 1996 to
set up an interview with South Korean leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The request, he said, was simply good manners, since Holbrooke
was well known and could easily have set up the meeting himself.

 &HT;    Delta, other firms tap Falcons euphoria
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Normally, an airline wouldn't want to be associated
with ``dirty birds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delta Air Lines, which for years has provided charter
service to the heretofore hapless Atlanta Falcons, is eager to play
up its links to the Super Bowl-bound team.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta is hurriedly preparing a special TV ad
celebrating the Falcons' success and featuring some fired-up flight
attendants showing their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably be doing the Dirty Bird,'' spokesman John
Kennedy said. ``It's a go-get-'em-type ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad, to air regionally during the Fox network pre-game show,
is just one way well-known Atlanta companies will get a little
marketing push from Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second Delta spot was in production Wednesday at New
York's Kennedy Airport, picked because time was tight and the
airline's ad agency, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, is in New York. The
employees appearing in it are from Atlanta and flew up to take
part.
</P>
<P>
   The ad may also be shown on Miami-bound jets this weekend and
could be re-used after the game on local television, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta wouldn't disclose what it's spending on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's NFL Experience
</P>
<P>
   Beverage giant Coca-Cola Co. is taking a pass on Super Bowl TV
ads of any type. But its name is splashed all over the NFL
Experience, a 20-acre theme park at Pro Player Stadium in Miami.
Coca-Cola and Sprint are co-sponsors, and more than 150,000 people
are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Classic is the official soft drink of both the Super
Bowl and the National Football League, so its marketing is
carefully evenhanded. ``Denver's a very important market,'' noted
spokesman Scott Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company is jumping on the hometown bandwagon as prime
sponsor of Atlanta's official welcome-home parade. And it will
issue a commemorative Falcons can for sale in the region next
month, Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will hold its co-title sponsorship through Super
Bowl XXXVI in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   New Chick-fil-A ad
</P>
<P>
   Chick-fil-A will debut a commercial during the game, showing it
during one 30-second segment of ``local spot time'' the Fox network
freed up recently.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, to be seen only by Atlanta area viewers, continues the
``Eat mor chikin'' theme. Chick-fil-A is spending $90,000 for the
spot time.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with the average $1.6 million price Fox is
charging advertisers for 30 seconds of full-market coverage, which
is expected to reach 128 million people.
</P>
<P>
   UPS maintains role
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service also is buying ``a few'' Fox local slots
to air new ads, spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said. They will
continue the delivery giant's ``Moving at the Speed of Business''
theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some new spots breaking in the next few weeks and
decided to take advantage of the chance to get them out there,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has been the official carrier of the NFL for the past five
years and as such has a shipping booth at the NFL Experience. Like
many corporations, it also will use the Super Bowl to impress
clients. Fifty or 60 will be UPS guests at the game, Rosenberg
said.

 &HT;    Atlanta defense can't overlook Denver passing game
 &HT;    Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Nobody's about to discount the importance of the Falcons
slowing Denver running back Terrell Davis if Atlanta hopes to win
the Super Bowl Sunday, but the Broncos' grouping of wide receivers
Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith and tight end Shannon Sharpe will also
present difficult matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Denver finished No. 7 in the NFL in passing, and there are
several reasons why, including the strong play of quarterbacks John
Elway and Bubby Brister.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey caught 64 passes for 1,053 yards and 10 touchdowns. He
also causes problems with his size _ 6-foot-5, 215 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Smith (6-0, 200) is the team's speed receiver, catching 86
passes for 1,222 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With McCaffrey, who is much bigger than starting Falcon
cornerbacks Ray Buchanan (5-9, 198) and Ronnie Bradford (5-10,
188), and Sharpe (6-2, 230), things could get tough for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe is more of an H-back, and he's very good at it with 64
catches for 768 yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're physical receivers who block probably a little better
than the Minnesota receivers,'' said Atlanta secondary coach Ron
Meeks.McCaffrey is a precision route runner with great hands and
determination. Rod Smith is a guy with the speed factor, and ...
Sharpe is a guy that is very, very difficult to game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got size and athleticism, (Elway) believes in him, and he
does a great job of holding, grabbing and pushing off. He's gotten
it to an art.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who is the team's
best cover linebacker, will spend some time covering Sharpe, as
will nickel back Randy Fuller and safeties Eugene Robinson and
William White.

 &HT;    FAA running routes for stadium aircraft
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falcons defensive backs won't be the only people trying to
control airspace over Miami's Pro Player Stadium this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, for the first time, will
have a control booth on top of the stadium to keep track of the
blimps, choppers and banner-towing planes drawn to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The glassed-in booth, built at the NFL's request and expense, is
atop the northeast side of the stadium. Its installation consumed
10 rows of seats in section 415.
</P>
<P>
   Five controllers will be stationed inside, playing a kind of
zone defense _ the zone being the airspace within 1 mile of the
stadium and up to 2,000 feet above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL had a growing concern, especially after the game in
San Diego last year, about the numbers of aircraft operations,''
said Wayne Boggs, special events coordinator at the FAA's regional
headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He said six blimps hovered over the game in San Diego, and
helicopters logged more than 400 flight operations near the
stadium. More of both are expected in Miami, he added. Already,
about 100 pilots have attended mandatory FAA briefings on weekend
flights around Pro Player.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, nearby airports cleared aircraft for flights over
Super Bowls, but most of the aircraft involved aren't equipped with
transponders to make them visible on radar. So the controllers
``basically had to hope everyone was doing what they were supposed
to,'' Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pro Player, controllers will eyeball the aircraft in stadium
airspace and will be in radio contact to ensure they don't stray
from assigned flight patterns and altitudes. Blimps are to stay at
1,700 feet, banner-towers at 1,200 and choppers at 700 feet or
below.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs said the FAA has used temporary towers at other sporting
events, including NASCAR races and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but
has never had a facility mounted on a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing extra protection against an accident,
Boggs said, the FAA presence could provide quick, safe clearance
for medical or security aircraft if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will reimburse the FAA for operating expenses, estimated
at about $6,125, Boggs said. The tower will operate both Saturday
and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The five controllers are from the Miami air traffic control
center. Three will be working at any given time, so they'll get a
chance to catch bits of the game while on break. But Boggs said the
controllers know their priority. ``They've been well briefed on
distractions and the importance of what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs will be there, too, but insists it's just a job. ``I'm not
even a football fan,'' he said, ``and that's the honest-to-God
truth.''

 STOCKBROKERS CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of stockbrokers has been charged with insider
trading in a scheme involving non-public information about upcoming
stories in Business Week magazine, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges allege that from June 1995 through January 1996,
Larry F. Smath, 42, a former broker for Renaissance Financial
Securities, paid an employee of a magazine distribution company
approximately $200 per week for advance copies of Business Week's
widely read `Inside Wall Street'' column, which frequently reports
on rumored acquisitions or the stock recommendations of money
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Smath then allegedly sold the information to four other brokers,
who shared the details with family members and clients. The
information was used as the basis for purchases of $8 million of
securities by the brokers, their family members and clients,
according to the SEC, which said that the trades produced $178,800
in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   The charges echo a series of cases from the late 1980s involving
the same column in Business Week, which is published by
McGraw-Hill. In those cases, at least 13 people were charged by the
SEC with insider trading based on advance copies of the magazine
that they obtained illegally from employees of a company that
printed the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, Business Week was aware of a pattern of
suspicious trading but did not write about it until a Dow Jones &AMP;
Co. wire service did so in July 1988. It subsequently tightened
access to the magazine prior to its release.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, however, Business Week published a story
reporting that it had again noticed a pattern of suspicious trading
in the stocks of companies mentioned in the column, which is
written by Gene Marcial, and that it had notified federal
regulators and stock exchange surveillance officials. That trading
was the subject of the civil and criminal charges announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Smath, of Levittown, N.Y., pleaded guilty to one
count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, according to Eric
Bernstein, an assistant U.S. attorney. On Wednesday, three
stockbrokers with whom Smath allegedly shared the information were
arrested on charges of insider trading outlined in a criminal
complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Hauppauge, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Those three men _ Peter L. Cohen, 33, of Plainview, N.Y.; Seth
J. Glaser, 29, of Levittown; and Joseph T. Falcone, 39, of
Farmingdale, N.Y. _ were released on their own recognizance
Wednesday after indicating they would enter pleas of not guilty,
Bernstein said. Smath has signed a cooperation agreement with the
U.S. attorney's office in association with his guilty plea,
according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bachner, an attorney who represents Smath, said
Wednesday that his client ``has led and continues to lead an
exemplary life.'' Smath is no longer employed in the securities
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bogatin, an attorney representing Glaser, said his client
``denies the charges against him and intends to vigorously contest
them.'' According to the SEC, Glaser was formerly employed at
Renaissance Securities in Mineola, N.Y., and is currently employed
at Fleet Enterprises, a securities broker in Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haley, a lawyer for Falcone, called the charges
allegations and said his client is ``entitled to the presumption of
innocence.'' According to the SEC, Falcone was a broker for
Prudential Securities in Melville, N.Y., in 1995 and 1996 and is
now a broker at Times Securities Services in Melville.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Defeis, a lawyer for Cohen, who also formerly worked at
Renaissance Securities, said his client denied the charges and
would plead not guilty. Cohen is a broker at J.B. Sutton Group in
Great Neck, N.Y., the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, as well as two others, also were charged in a
civil insider trading complaint filed by the SEC in federal court
in Brooklyn. Also named in the SEC's complaint were Frank J.
Zangara, 36, a stockbroker for Tasin &AMP; Co. in Hauppauge, and
Gregory R. Salvage, 43, of Levittown, a foreman at the Hudson News
Co., a distributor of newspapers and magazines including Business
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage did not return a phone call seeking comment on the
charges. Neither Zangara, who resides in Hicksville, N.Y., nor an
attorney representing him could be reached for comment. &QL;

HOUSE MANAGERS CHOSE WITNESSES TO BOLSTER CASE ON OBSTRUCTION
CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
   (See related stories: IMPEACH-TRIAL, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-CLINTON-LAWYERS, IMPEACH-FEINGOLD) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican prosecutors said on Wednesday they
chose three witnesses who could help them make the broadest and
strongest case that President Clinton obstructed justice, the
impeachment article that surprisingly has drawn the most interest
from senators of both parties.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the trial started three weeks ago, the House prosecutors
were sure that their best chance of convicting Clinton lay in
persuading the senators that the president had lied under oath
before a federal grand jury about his relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But since then, senators squeamish about the sexual aspects of
the perjury charge have focused on obstruction of justice, as the
article that most likely rises to the level of an impeachable
offense. The question now, in many senators' minds, is did it
happen?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us feel very strongly about the second count, and we
need witnesses to help on that,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon,
one of 56 senators, all but one of them Republicans, who approved
subpoenas on Wednesday for Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and
Sidney Blumenthal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction article charges Clinton with having encouraged
Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit and to conceal gifts he had given her. It
contends the president enlisted Jordan's help in finding Ms.
Lewinsky a job to buy her cooperation in the Jones suit, and it
accuses the president of attempting to influence the testimony of
his secretary, Betty Currie, and top aides like Blumenthal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators seem to relate the perjury charge to sex, and the
president's twisting definitions,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
the House manager who will question Ms. Lewinsky. ``It's an easier
sell job with obstruction of justice. It's about a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, the manager who will interview
Jordan, said, ``Obstruction of justice is extraordinarily
compelling, and goes to the heart of our judicial system.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Senate Republicans, the House prosecutors
pared their wish list of witnesses from 15, to 5, to 3. Like a
basketball team suddenly told on the eve of the championship game
they must cut their starting lineup, the House managers this week
weighed the strengths of potential witnesses right up to when they
presented their final list to the Senate on Tuesday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they left off the one witness that many Republicans
considered a secret weapon _ Mrs. Currie _ disappointing some
senators who believed she had the most potential to clarify factual
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of making judicious decisions as to which
witnesses would give us the best chance to try to convert people
into a vote for conviction,'' said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night in an ornate room off the Senate chamber, Rep.
Henry J. Hyde, the leader of the House managers, met four of the
other prosecutors to bless the final list of witnesses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after Hyde left, his colleagues tore up the list
and made a new one. That list lasted only a few minutes before the
managers scrapped it, too. The 13 House prosecutors did not approve
the final list until the next morning, moments before presenting it
to the Senate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is the managers' star witness and had a guaranteed
spot in the lineup. But the managers shuffled and reshuffled their
final two choices as they gauged and regauged both the mood of the
Senate and their own analysis of which witnesses could swing
wavering senators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They decided to drop Mrs. Currie, some managers said on
Wednesday, because the secretary's sworn testimony about statements
Clinton made to her about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky seemed
immovable. Mrs. Currie testified that the president, in a series of
questions, had suggested he and Ms. Lewinsky had, for example,
never been alone together.
</P>
<P>
   And they said that Ms. Lewinsky clarified in her weekend
interview with prosecutors the sequence of calls between her and
Mrs. Currie on the day that the secretary picked up the gifts that
were under subpoena by the lawyers for Mrs. Jones.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``While we would have liked to have had Betty, we just didn't
need her,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But privately, some said a reason Mrs. Currie was not called is
that the prosecutors, already reviled in many public opinion polls,
did not want to be seen as grilling a sympathetic, African-American
woman in the well of the Senate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine and Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, expressed surprise and disappointment that
the managers did not summon Mrs. Currie.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators accused the managers of disregarding their
pretext for calling witnesses _ to clarify conflicting testimony.
``The No. 1 witness you would want if there are factual
discrepancies is Betty Currie, who wasn't called,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think they have another game plan: To
get Monica Lewinsky to the floor of the Senate, which I think would
be undignified and unproductive.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors opted to summon Jordan instead of Mrs. Currie _
both considered friendly to the president _ to underscore what they
say were Jordan's efforts, at the White House's urging, to help
find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York and to buy her silence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the managers had to choose between Blumenthal and John
Podesta, the White House chief of staff, as to who would best
illustrate the accusation that Clinton lied to his aides about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In the president's conversation
with Blumenthal, Clinton described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``stalker,''
and said she ``threatened'' to tell people ``they'd had an
affair.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Blumenthal best represents those people the president spoke to
to perpetuate his fraud,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three witnesses told House prosecuters on
Wednesday that their clients would be available to testify by this
weekend. ``If we receive a subpoena,'' said Judy Smith, a spokesman
for Ms. Lewinsky, ``we will comply.''  &QL;

`FRASIER' TRIES TO PULL ITSELF OUT OF A FUNK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a reasonable decision. NBC put its best surviving comedy,
``Frasier,'' into the planet's best TV time slot, 9 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, life has been one rocky gravel pit. Tuesdays
imploded without ``Frasier,'' and then everyone seemed to notice
that ``Frasier'' wasn't the deft farce it used to be. ``Frasier''
was in a rut, a circumstance usually attributed to lingering
atrophy from last season's finale.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) did his usual
puff-breast act and got himself, as well as everyone else, fired
from KACL radio. He stayed fired for nine dreary shows _ well,
dreary by the lofty ``Frasier'' standards.
</P>
<P>
   There were other problems: Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and his
unresolved separation from his unseen wife, Maris; Roz (Peri
Gilpin) and the pregnancy that could kill any sophisticated sitcom;
and the diluted attention of the show's creators.
</P>
<P>
   David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee, who conceived and
produced ``Frasier,'' were diverted by their newer toy, NBC's
``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   So the celebrated sitcom that was supposed to pick up where
``Seinfeld'' left off found itself firing blanks instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier's'' ratings were actually up 25 percent from last
season _ moving to Thursdays made the difference _ but the show was
in a funk.
</P>
<P>
   The official story out of the ``Frasier'' camp these days is
that the low clouds have lifted and once again there's sunshine in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Frasier Crane is back at work, KACLing again. Roz had her baby,
but it seems mostly confined to the same dark nursery where the
Murphy Brown baby was sent some seasons ago. Niles' divorce went
through in December, meaning he'll no longer have to say ``roger''
to Maris. Viewers wanted no curtain calls from ``Encore! Encore!,''
which is a dead dud.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Paramount welcomed visiting critics onto the
``Frasier'' set for a casual get-together with the cast and crew.
The mood was upbeat, though it seemed a bit forced. The fridge is
actually stocked, and the high-rise's skyline backdrop looks
amazingly inauthentic when you see it in the flesh. ``I feel really
good about the back end of the (season) schedule,'' a chirpy
Grammer said to the asteroid belt of critics and reporters orbiting
him. ``We've shot some great shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's episode is a repeat, but ``Frasier'' is in sweeps
mode next week with a new episode and guest appearance by another
of Frasier's old ``Cheers'' buddies, Woody (Woody Harrelson).
</P>
<P>
   The story line involves Woody visiting Seattle to attend a
wedding and renewing old ties with Frasier, until it seems that the
two don't have so much in common, after all.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score, Harrelson is the fourth ex-``Cheers''
mate to pop in on ``Frasier,'' following Shelley Long, Ted Danson
and Bebe Neuwirth. Will Norm and Cliff (set ital)ever(end ital)
make their way west?
</P>
<P>
   There's also an episode, likely to be shown in the February
sweeps, guest-starring Christine Baranski (``Cybill'') and Piper
Laurie (``Twin Peaks'') as a vicious radio psychiatrist and her
equally viperous mother.
</P>
<P>
   In one breath, Grammer said, ``I haven't seen any slippage'' _
then, a few breaths later, seemed willing to pin criticism of the
show on his character's unemployment. ``In retrospect, maybe he
shouldn't have stayed out of work so long. I think it was difficult
to look at Frasier with a sense of humor while obviously he was
suffering so much ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier to see him fail in every other part of his
life when he's on top of his game at work.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good point, and from the man who should know Frasier
Crane best. But was Frasier's professional limbo really the prime
problem?
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, ``Frasier'' isn't in a single-season slump. It's in a
two-year creative slump, during which the writing has tailed off
from the show's first four brilliant seasons. Someone is tired.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that creative fatigue needn't be fatal. Other
great shows have recovered from their own doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' bounces up and down year by year. The consensus
is that ``Friends'' is having a fine year after a couple of
off-seasons. ``Seinfeld'' bounced back from a slump, though never
all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   Much rides on the mercurial fortunes of ``Frasier.'' NBC is
bleeding. For the first time, there are cracks in the walls of its
Thursday-night fortress. If Thursday crumbles, NBC's rivals will
tear it to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   For fans, for ``Frasier'' and for the network, February is the
perfect time for a rebound.

   WASHINGTON _ The husband and wife have lived in Washington for
quite a while and wanted a bigger place. Rather than move out of
the apartment they have grown used to they decided to buy the one
next door and tear down the wall. Presto, more space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've expected them to do that for years,'' Ruby Barnhard, a
real estate broker, said Wednesday. After all, what feels cozy in
the beginning may feel positively cramped later on.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are Bob and Elizabeth Dole, and the next-door
apartment they are acquiring in the Watergate complex was occupied
until recently by a young woman named Monica Lewinsky and her
mother, Marcia Lewis, who rented it from the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Dole used to be a Republican senator from Kansas, and his wife
was until recently president of the American Red Cross. Dole was
his party's candidate for president in 1996 and lost to President
Clinton, who in turn lost his hope for an easy second term because
of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mrs. Dole is considering whether to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Watergate was important before Ms. Lewinsky was even
born. A burglary there on June 17, 1972, helped bring down
President Richard M. Nixon and some top aides, including Attorney
General John N. Mitchell, who lived there.
</P>
<P>
   So did the late Sen. Jacob K. Javits of New York. Former Defense
Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger still does. ``They come and they
go,'' Ms. Barnhard said.

WSU HAS LONG-RANGE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's strength against weakness, and weakness
against strength tonight as the Bruins visit ninth-place Washington
State, where they haven't lost since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Of the myriad subplots _ there is no apparent big-picture
quality to this game _ two seem noteworthy: How will the tiny
Cougars handle UCLA's size and relentless rebounding, and how will
the Bruins contain Washington State's 3-point sharpshooters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars have no starters taller than 6-foot-7 and are the
Pac-10's worst rebounding team (minus-5.2 per game). Meanwhile,
UCLA is big, athletic and possesses two of the best rebounding
guards in the conference, Earl Watson and Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins small forward JaRon Rush averages 6.4 rebounds, more than
any Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do that well,'' Washington State guard Jan-Michael
Thomas said. ``We get outrebounded a lot. If we give UCLA a lot of
opportunities and second shots, we could be in a lot of trouble
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Bruins have not defended the 3-point shot well for
years, and Washington State is the best perimeter-shooting team in
the Pac-10, hitting 39 percent of its 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and forward Chris Crosby alone have made 97 3-pointers _
20 more than the Bruins. Thomas leads the Cougars in scoring (16.1
ppg) and is second in the conference in 3-point shooting (46
percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't need a lot of time,'' Washington State coach Kevin
Eastman said. ``He has a quick release and a shooter's mentality,
and he pretty darn has a dark green light (to shoot) with us. When
he goes up, you're surprised if he misses.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gadzuric update: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric is questionable
for tonight's game because of a sprained right ankle suffered last
week at USC. Freshman Ray Young will start at small forward, moving
Rush to power forward and Jerome Moiso to center.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric is probable for Sunday's game at Washington, which
possesses the Pac-10's best center, 7-foot Todd MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a blessing in disguise,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin
said. ``Dan is getting the necessary rest for his knees
(tendinitis) by being out with his ankle.''
</P>

   __ Index of leading indicators: Two quick and easy ways to tell
if the Bruins are playing well on offense:
</P>
<P>
   1) Number of 3-point attempts. If they're taking more than 10 or
12, it's a sign of impatience and (usually) stagnation. The Bruins
are shooting 29.7 percent from 3-point range, worst in the league.
</P>
<P>
   2) Number of shots for Moiso. He is UCLA's most efficient
offensive player and his involvement in the offense indicates a
smooth-running unit. Moiso's best games _ Kentucky and Arizona _
usually coincide with UCLA's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he shoots 15-20 times,'' Lavin said, ``we're in good
shape.''

ATT OFFERS SINGLE-RATE DIGITAL WIRELESS SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to build on the success of its ``one-rate'' plans for
digital wireless phone service, AT&AMP;T Corp. said Wednesday it would
package long distance, wireless, calling card, and personal 800
service on a bill for 10 cents a minute, plus a monthly fee of
$29.99.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, called AT&AMP;T Personal Network, is aimed at the
estimated 30 million US residential customers who spend nearly 2.5
times more each month on multiple phone services than the average
household but receive separate bills for each.
</P>
<P>
   To retain these lucrative customers AT&AMP;T is offering a flat
10-cent a minute rate for all wireless local and long-distance
calls made from within their home area, and long-distance calls
made from their conventional phones.
</P>
<P>
   The package will also include voice mail with text messaging and
caller identification for wireless service. Calls made using an
AT&AMP;T calling card will also cost 10 cents per minute. Calls made to
an AT&AMP;T personal 800 telephone number, which is aimed at families,
will also be 10 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to traditional domestic long-distance calls, the
Personal Network also includes 10 cent per minute calls to Canada,
Great Britain and border cities in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the confusion out of the market,'' said John
Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's president, in announcing that the new service starts
this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Not included on the AT&AMP;T single bill is local telephone service
offered in Massachusetts and most New England states by Bell
Atlantic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Personal Network was applauded as the first service to
combine wireless and traditional long-distance services from a
single supplier. However, the convenience of bundled services does
not lead to lower prices for each service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking for savings from it, you are barking up the
wrong tree,'' noted Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based
telecommunications analyst. ``If you pick apart the plan there
doesn't seem to be a savings to be realized except for the very
heavy, wireless user.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan maintains that while AT&AMP;T may keep its high value
customers and reduce ``churn'' _ price-conscious customers who
switch from one telephone carrier to another in search of lower
rates _ the Personal Network service will not be a revenue
generator.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom Inc. has been offering a similar service, called
MCI One, that packages on a single bill, long distance, calling
card, personal 800 number, cellular and until recently, Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   However, it does not offer comparable cellular telephone rates
or Internet access because the number two long-distance carrier,
which claims to have 10 million MCI One, customers, does not own a
wireless service like AT&AMP;T and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   And with its recent merger with WorldCom, MCI suspended Internet
access, but will add it shortly, a company spokesman said, adding
that the average MCI One bill is about $25 a month, albeit without
wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's stock closed down 1 19/16 at 85 5/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

 WASHINGTON: do so.

   Still, there are possible pitfalls for those trying to end this
trial. The White House will have to choose whether it wants to put
forward its own witness list and use its powers of discovery to the
fullest as it has threatened to do, or whether it wants to have a
swift conclusion, certain that Clinton will not be convicted if the
vote takes place now.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were suggesting that the questioning of Monica S.
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal would produce nothing
new, making it easier for the White House to skip ahead quickly to
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will have to decide whether to isolate their
conservatives and join with Democrats to block witnesses from being
summoned to the well of the Senate after the deposition process
ends. That, too, could depend on whether the questioning produces
anything new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you are bringing those three witnesses to the
floor unless in the depositions there is new significant dynamite
evidence,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schumer, New York's new Democratic senator and former
House member, already a veteran combatant from the House's own
impeachment struggle, was among those senators trying to negotiate
a conclusion to the trial. But he was cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've learned,'' Schumer told reporters, ``is
that this case has a way of unraveling beyond the expectations of
anybody.''

THE POPE AND THE AMERICAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II is the only spiritual figure who can fill a
stadium or dominate media coverage in any part of the hemisphere.
He has used his visit to Mexico and the United States to foster a
sense of connection among all Catholics of the Americas and to
extend their concern to those victimized by a world ``filled with
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our cry: life with dignity for all!'' he said in
Mexico City. ``For all who have been conceived in the mother's
womb, street children, for indigenous peoples and Afro-Americans,
for immigrants and refugees, for the young deprived of opportunity,
for the old, for those who suffer any kind of poverty or
marginalization.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul is afraid of neither difficult questions nor
unconventional means to get his message across. In exchange for
allowing the Vatican coat of arms to be printed on bags of potato
chips, the church got a subsidy to defray the cost of the visit and
invaluable publicity.
</P>
<P>
   While the medium was new, the message was not. Before a million
people in Mexico City, he said: ``This raceway, transformed today
into a great church, resounds with the words with which Jesus began
his preaching: `Repent, for the reign of heaven is at hand.' '' The
pope's homilies were enriched by quotations that reflected the
values of the New Testament shared by other Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Not all will agree with the pope in every particular, especially
his definition of when human life begins. &UR;  &LR; Wednesday he involved
himself in another controversy, the death penalty. ``The dignity of
human life must never be taken away,'' he said, ``even in the case
of someone who has done great evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The papal visit was not a time to dwell on divisions among
Catholics or with other denominations but to remember that the
church is capable of uniting hundreds of millions of people from
Canada to Chile. John Paul, no longer physically vigorous, is as
strong in spirit as ever. ``Christ is calling you; the church needs
you,'' he told young people in St. Louis and, through them, all
Catholics in the Americas. ``The pope believes in you, and he
expects great things of you!''

KENNEDY OPENS ATTACK ON PLAN BY CHIEF OF MEDICARE PANEL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Mass. La.)  By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Staking out a position for liberal Democrats, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy plans to criticize the work of a bipartisan
federal advisory commission that would give private health insurers
a much bigger role in running Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech prepared for delivery on Thursday, Kennedy describes
the commission's approach as ``the wrong prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   That approach, in a proposal drafted by the commission's
chairman, Sen. John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, is supported
by many Republicans and some Democrats but has not been formally
endorsed by the full panel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Medicare would offer a fixed amount of money
to each beneficiary, to purchase insurance from a private health
plan or from the government. While the government would subsidize
premiums, it would no longer pay separately for each hospital
admission or each visit to a doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission, created by Congress to recommend ways
of solving Medicare's long-term financial problems, has agreed to
use Breaux's plan as the framework for the recommendations it is
supposed to make in its final report, due by March 1. Kennedy, a
Massachusetts Democrat who often sets the tone for congressional
debate on health policy, will comment on the proposal in a speech
to the National Academy of Social Insurance, whose members include
experts on Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the commission must not take any steps that could
``privatize Medicare'' or reduce benefits, as he said some
Republicans tried to do in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux insists that his proposal would guarantee benefits at
least equivalent to those now promised the 39 million elderly or
disabled people enrolled in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy said that ``it makes no sense'' to reduce existing
benefits by raising the eligibility age, increasing some premiums
or charging new co-payments for services. Breaux would gradually
increase the eligibility age to 67, from 65; would charge higher
premiums to high-income people, and would require beneficiaries to
pay 10 percent of the cost of home health care visits; there is no
such co-payment now.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposal would intensify competition between the
original fee-for-service Medicare program and private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private plans,'' Kennedy said, ``could underbid
conventional Medicare, because quality of care is lower or doctor
choice is restricted, or because the market is manipulated to
attract only the healthy. As a result, premiums would rise steeply
for those who stay in conventional Medicare. Too often, they would
be the oldest and sickest beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is not a member of the commission. But Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV, who is a member, expressed similar concerns. He
said Breaux's proposal was ``not an acceptable starting point for a
Medicare reform plan'' because it was ``simply too risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the proposal, though bold, ``may
achieve little in the way of savings'' and does not specify
adequate protections for Medicare beneficiaries who are poor or
live in rural areas.

CHAT GETS REAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   c.1999 The Boston Globe   As a younger, dumber
man, I wasted hundreds of hours and dollars hanging around in chat
rooms on the CompuServe on-line service, typing messages in real
time to other users of the network. You paid a dime a minute back
then, and the massive CompuServe bills _ along with the massive
idiocy of on-line conversations _ soured me on Internet chat for
the past decade.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which is why I've left the issue of on-line chat pretty much
alone, until now.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since I gave up on chat. Cheap Internet access
lets you chat your life away for $20 a month on Internet Relay
Chat, a worldwide network used by tens of thousands every day. With
a piece of chat software, available for any kind of computer at
little or no cost, Internet users can plunge into thousands of
never-ending discussions of computers, politics, sports _ and yes,
sex, even sex. For more information, visit http://www.irchelp.org.
</P>
<P>
   My experiments with Linux software led me back to the universe
of chat. Desperate for help, I found an excellent IRC channel where
Linux users swap advice 24 hours a day. Those guys have bailed me
out on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But I've no idea who helped me, because IRC chatters are usually
anonymous. As a result, most IRC channels are filled with
trashtalk. While CompuServe and America Online chat rooms have at
least a few rules, IRC is like Chicago in the era of Al Capone.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional chat has a bad reputation among serious computer
users, but the technology is getting a second chance thanks to the
concept of ``instant messaging,'' a variation of chat which could
become an indispensable business tool.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging brings new precision and power to the concept
of chat, mainly because it introduces a concept called
``awareness'' _ the ability to know whether particular people are
actually connected to the network at that time.
</P>
<P>
   America Online made the first big move in instant messaging
three years ago. Its Buddy Lists would tell you if a friend was
connected to AOL at that moment, and let you pop him a message. But
the most dramatic success story comes from Tel Aviv. There a
company called Mirabilis Ltd. produced I, a system that allows any
Internet user on Earth to hunt up friends and colleagues for an
instant chat.
</P>
<P>
   A network of Icqservers is scattered around the Internet, and
members like me download a small piece of free software that runs
on my computers. (You want it? Go to http://www.i.com.) Whenever I
log onto the Net, my Icqsoftware tells the server I'm available.
Other Iusers can now message me, or I can block out everybody but
my friends and colleagues. You can set Iso that you're only visible
to people you want to hear from.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis hasn't advertised its product, instead counting on
word of mouth. That was enough. Over 25 million people worldwide
use I, 60 percent of them outside of the United States and Canada.
Last summer, AOL bought the company for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of people who live their life on the Web, and
Ibecame their product,'' said Fred Singer, chief operating officer
of AOL's Isubsidiary. Most are hobbyists, but a growing number use
Ias a powerful business messaging tool. Imagine knowing at a glance
whether a client or colleague is at his desk. Or being able to
round up several co-workers at a moment's notice for an impromptu
chat session about an important project.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is well past the hobby stage. Inow offers a
version designed for corporate networks. The company is also
looking at ways to let Internet retailers use Ito communicate with
customers. Millions of us get e-mail messages announcing bargain
airfares, but it may be hours before we see them. Send that same
message via I, and many customers will whip out their credit cards
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus Development Corp. foresees a bright future for instant
messaging inside the corporation. On Monday, at the Lotusphere
conference in Orlando, Fla., Lotus showed off SameTime, which lets
anyone on a corporate network locate and chat with anyone else on
the network _ wherever he or she is. Lotus CEO Jeff Papows told me
he used SameTime to collaborate with colleagues on his keynote
speech while zipping southward at 30,000 feet in the corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   Real-time communication about real work. It's enough to give
Internet chatting a good name.

NEW HOPE FOR EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement by Indonesia's foreign minister that his
government is preparing to offer independence to East Timor, the
territory Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed in 1976, comes as a
welcome sign that the long nightmare of the Timorese people may be
about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's repressive occupation of East Timor has taken a
terrible toll. Human rights groups estimate that 200,000 people
were wiped out _ more than a quarter of the indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
   If Indonesian officials are sincere in what they said Wednesday
about the government's new willingness to allow the Timorese to
choose independence in a referendum, their change of heart reflects
a timely appreciation of diplomatic and economic realities.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's financial implosion and the demise of Suharto,
the autocrat who ruled Indonesia as a family fiefdom for more than
three decades, Jakarta has become increasingly dependent on the
outside world for economic succor and diplomatic acceptance. In one
forum after another, Indonesian representatives have been hearing
that they cannot anticipate cooperation from abroad if they do not
recognize that the primarily Catholic population of East Timor is
never going to accept annexation by primarily Muslim Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Timorese leaders such Jose Ramos Horta, the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, have reacted skeptically to Jakarta's surprising change
of policy because Indonesian occupation forces have been arming
small Timorese militias that support Indonesia's presence in East
Timor. Such are the classic divide-and-rule tactics of other
colonialist powers, and Timorese leaders worry that Jakarta's
broaching of independence for East Timor may be part of a scheme to
demonstrate that the price for Timorese independence will be so
high that it will not be worth paying.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world should hold Jakarta to its word and stand
ready to assist in East Timor's transition to independence.

 &HT;    Atlanta defense can't overlook Denver passing game
 &HT;    Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _Nobody's about to discount the importance of the Falcons
slowing Denver running back Terrell Davis if Atlanta hopes to win
the Super Bowl Sunday, but the Broncos' grouping of wide receivers
Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith and tight end Shannon Sharpe will also
present difficult matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Denver finished No. 7 in the NFL in passing, and there are
several reasons why, including the strong play of quarterbacks John
Elway and Bubby Brister.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey caught 64 passes for 1,053 yards and 10 touchdowns. He
also causes problems with his size _ 6-foot-5, 215 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Smith (6-0, 200) is the team's speed receiver, catching 86
passes for 1,222 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With McCaffrey, who is much bigger than starting Falcon
cornerbacks Ray Buchanan (5-9, 198) and Ronnie Bradford (5-10,
188), and Sharpe (6-2, 230), things could get tough for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe is more of an H-back, and he's very good at it with 64
catches for 768 yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're physical receivers who block probably a little better
than the Minnesota receivers,'' said Atlanta secondary coach Ron
Meeks.McCaffrey is a precision route runner with great hands and
determination. Rod Smith is a guy with the speed factor, and ...
Sharpe is a guy that is very, very difficult to game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got size and athleticism, (Elway) believes in him, and he
does a great job of holding, grabbing and pushing off. He's gotten
it to an art.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who is the team's
best cover linebacker, will spend some time covering Sharpe, as
will nickel back Randy Fuller and safeties Eugene Robinson and
William White.

 &HT;    Rookie can't sit still, but, boy, can he return punts
 &HT;    By Ethan Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The barbed wire tattoo on Tim Dwight's left arm is residue from
a collegiate fad, when some University of Iowa teammates chose to
''get all kinds of things on their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   One was Ross Verba, a rookie left tackle for the Green Bay
Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. This year, the Hawkeyes' Super rookie
is Dwight, and one doubts the Falcons' 5-foot-8, 178-pound return
specialist really acquired the imprint by the conventional means of
needle and ink.
</P>
<P>
   More likely he tried to blast through a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Dennison, the Broncos' special teams coach, dubs him
''courageous.'' Broncos kick returner Vaughn Hebron calls him
''fearless. He plays with that kamikaze style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives with it too. Some look to literature for inspiration,
Dwight looks to Mountain Dew commercials. He has raced motorcycles,
jumped from a third-floor dorm window (''one guy bruised his heel,
and couldn't practice for three weeks; it was hilarious''), gone
cliffdiving off Porte Vierda, and Tuesday coaxed practice squad
Sherdrick Bonner into a jet ski excursion.
</P>
<P>
   His Iowa City High coach, Larry Brown, recalls when his star
football player helped him build a house. ''He would be walking on
two-by-fours about three inches wide from one side of the house to
another, and it didn't faze him,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there's a lot of guys in the X Games, who think this
Dwight kid, he's not so crazy,'' Dwight says.
</P>
<P>
   Iowans are crazy about him. ''The greatest player ever in the
state of Iowa,'' says Brown, who has coached several NFL players,
including Jay and Joel Hilgenberg, in 30 years. ''We wanted to take
him off the field to rest him, but he would never sit down, so we
figured we might as well leave him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing Dwight does surprises him. Not even that Willie Mays
thing in the third quarter of the NFC Championship_ fielding a
Mitch Berger punt facing his own goal line, and returning it 27
yards to the Falcons' 28. Or returning four kickoffs from at least
two yards deep in his end zone.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets one six yards deep Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's coming out,'' Dwight says. ''No question, it's coming
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough NFL scouts were skeptical when Dwight came out of the
college that the Falcons got him in the fourth round. Dwight led
the nation in punt return yards as a senior, returning three punts
for touchdowns, catching 39 passes, finishing seventh in Heisman
Trophy balloting, and drawing praise from now-retiring Iowa coach
Hayden Fry:
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the greatest competitor I've had ever had in 45 years of
coaching. He's the most exciting player I've had in 18 years
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals criticized Fry for not getting Dwight the ball, for
not running plays like the direct snap the rookie took around right
end for 21 yards against the Vikings. The hometown adulation is so
acute that Dwight concedes ''sometimes, it's annoying,'' and ''it's
gonna be worse now, because not too many people from Iowa have been
to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he backtracks and calls it ''a great relationship.'' He's
not exactly ripping his roots out, after all. He has another year
of eligibility in track and field, and will compete for the school
in the spring. And he doesn't sound much like a city boy when
describing the Falcons' preparation: ''All the hay's in the barn
already. We've just got to keep it clean and crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Might Dwight break clean for his first NFL punt return
touchdown, and the first in the Super Bowl? Or might it be the
Broncos' Darrien Gordon, who has the highest career punt return
average in history, and one of those Dwight has studied?
</P>
<P>
   He studies angles and distances and hang times. And yet,
according to Hebron, ''He tries to go for it every time. I've found
sometimes that can backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dwight has impressed Billy (White Shoes) Johnson, a
former Falcons and Oilers returner on the NFL's 75th anniversary
all-time team. ''He's excellent,'' Johnson says. ''He's
calculating. Everybody thinks returners are crazy, and he's got
some of that, but that's probably the rookie in him. He knows what
he's doing, he's got great field awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the Mays-like return?
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have done it,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   What Dwight does Sunday may depend on the scoreboard and
speakers. Guns and Roses ''jacked'' him in Minnesota. Perhaps a
certain hokey movie might in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like I'm Rudy, man,'' Dwight says. ''When he goes out
there, and they ask, 'Are you ready for this?' I've been ready for
this my whole life.'' MORE NOTES
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Randall Cunningham won an award here this week, if not
the one many expected.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham won the NFL Miller Lite Player of the Year award,
beating out Terrell Davis, Marshall Faulk, Steve Young, Doug Flutie
and Vinny Testaverde. Faulk, Testaverde and Cunningham were all
present.
</P>
<P>
   The six finalists were chosen from the pool of Players of the
Week by a media panel. Notable were those those not among the
nominees: Brett Favre, Barry Sanders and Jerry Rice. They were
replaced by three quarterbacks who resurrected their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he was ''honored'' and ''humbled,'' and spoke
often of religion's role in his life. Of the Vikings' 30-27 loss to
Atlanta in the NFC Championship, he said: ''There's not an empty
feeling. It wasn't our time. The year 2000 looks better for us.
It's a more complete year, and I think it will be a year of
completion for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the Super Bowl will be close, and relatively
low-scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Happy tourist: Falcons offensive tackle Bob Whitfield is fond of
Miami. ''Nice, beautiful city,'' he said. ''Beautiful women,
beautiful people. Sunsets, water. But I can't stay here all year
round. I'd be at the dang beach every day, running around in
flip-flops.'' end

 &HT;    Romanowski a true renegade
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE _ The timing couldn't have been better.
</P>
<P>
   As Mike Shanahan began to answer a question about linebacker
Bill Romanowski, a motorcycle roared by on a nearby street, causing
the Denver Broncos' coach to pause and wait for the noise to
subside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's a little crazy,'' Shanahan said. ``That motorcycle that
just went by ... that was Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   It, of course, wasn't Romanowski. But that image _ ``Romo''
riding by on a Harley _ certainly fits the one America has of him.
</P>
<P>
   He is the NFL's renegade.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Romanowski is more likely to be found on an
exercise bike than a motorcycle. Or that is a devoted father who
plays the guitar. An acoustic guitar, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   Images are hard to shed. And what if you don't want to
completely shed them? What if you want to hang on to part of them
for special occassions? Like Sundays?
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Romanowski. He is repeatedly referred to as a
``a throwback to the days of Dick Butkus'' _ which often is a nice
way of agreeing with the assessment 49ers running back Garrison
Hearst once made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirtiest guy I know,'' Hearst said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitting. Head-butts. Ejections. Fines. Trash-talking. All
Romanowski needs is a dozen tattoos and high heels and he'd be
Dennis Rodman with a helmet. Or so the image has it.
</P>
<P>
   And while Romanowski still is trying to shed some of the baggage
that piled up on the way to the last season's Super Bowl _ the
spitting on San Franciso's J.J. Stokes, the helmet-to-helmet hit on
Kerry Collins, the taunting of Kordell Stewart _ there is a part of
him that embraces the Bad Boy image.
</P>
<P>
   Take what happened Wednesday when he was asked about the
comparisons to players like Butkus and Ray Nitschke.
</P>
<P>
   First, he offered a humble response, saying how he wouldn't dare
consider himself in that category. Then he began talking longingly
about the era of those players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything went,'' he said. ``There's a part of that that is in
my game. It seems like back then they could spit on guys, they
could punch guys, they could rip helmets off. That was a part of
the game back then. Now that's not a part of this game. It's a
cleaner game. They don't want that stuff going on. They don't want
a bad image. And I respect that and I agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he wishes he could have played then, Romanowski
said: ``Absolutely. To me, that's when football really started
getting a name for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, the same correlation could be made with
Romanowski's career. He was a good player long before he arrived in
Denver in 1996. He helped the 49ers win two of their Super Bowls.
But it was the stuff that seemed to come
</P>
<P>
   _ the controversy of 1997 _ that really gave ``Romo'' a name
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully everybody out there doesn't know me for that act,''
he said this week of the spitting. ``I vowed to myself, my family
and the people around the world that it would never happen again.
And it hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with Romanowski you get the sense that at any moment
something could happen. Maybe it won't be spitting. Maybe it will
be a knee in the back. Maybe he will live up to the title Sports
Illustrated gave him: ``king of the stray forearm.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this feeling _ not the actual bending of the rules, just
the sense that it could happen _ that makes one think of Romanowski
as a throwback to another old-time athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, of course, worked with spit, too. He had a knack for
getting in batters' heads. Sometimes they spent so much time
worrying about whether he had or hadn't put a little something
extra on the ball that before they knew it they were headed back to
the bench. Another strikeout victim.
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski has been known to do this, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like the crafty catcher who's asking you about your
girlfriend as soon as you step in the batter's box,'' Denver
defensive coordinator Greg Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He messes with guys' heads,'' fellow linebacker John Mobley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Super Bowl XXXII, Romanowski has said, he messed
with the head of a fellow Boston College alumnus, Green Bay tight
end Mark Chmura. Romanowski's trash talking had Chmura so mad that
Chmura said, ``Romanowski, I'm going to kill you.'' Then Romanowski
and his teammates killed Chmura.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs this year, Romanowski got to Dolphins
quarterback Dan Marino. The two ended tangled after one play. There
was pushing and shoving and talking. Marino got in Romanowski's
face and ... Romanowski smiled.
</P>
<P>
   When Marino apologized after the game, Romanowski said that
wasn't necessary. He had what he wanted. He had gotten in another
player's head.
</P>
<P>
   He makes a point of insisting that he doesn't rely on mind games
or cheap shots, that his play comes from a work ethic that,
according to Shanahan, makes him one of the best prepared players
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that (reputation) affects their play, hey, great,''
Romanowski said. ``The bottom line is I try to beat people with
great technique. I try to beat people playing the game the way it's
supposed to be played. In the heat of battle, other things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes they backfire.
</P>
<P>
   When Romanowski walks onto a football field, he seems to be
forever working on the edge. You wonder if one of these days he
could fall over. You wonder if that day could be one like Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were an event that would seem capable of pushing
Romanowski into a Rodman-like explosion, it seems like it would be
the Super Bowl. Even he admits that ``when emotion is high, logic
is low.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Romanowski not only has survived three Super Bowls, he has
walked off the field as a winner each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to be a guy who pushes the limit every once in a
while,'' he said. ``But in this game, my focus has got to be on
playing good, clean football.''

ALBRIGHT TO VISIT HUSSEIN HEIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JORDAN) 
(JT) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ In a surprise change of plans designed to
put the U.S. seal of approval on King Hussein's heir, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright plans to drop in on Prince Abdullah of
Jordan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The visit, in the nature of a courtesy call, will show the
importance Washington places on Jordan as a pivotal ally. Albright
is to fly to Jordan after she spends a day in Egypt and Saudi
Arabia discussing the administration's next steps against Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving in Saudi Arabia from Egypt, Albright's
spokesman, James Rubin, said the secretary of state would be
explaining to the Saudis the administration's Iraqi policy of
``containment and regime change.'' The frank expression of
Washington's desire to topple Saddam was apparently designed to
embolden the Saudis to give whatever assistance they could.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin declined to elaborate on the brief statement of a policy
that has been expressed by the administration with increasing
frequency in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met Wednesday night with King Fahd, Foreign Minister
Saud Al-Faisal and Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The administration apparently believes the Saudi rulers are ripe
for bringing on board to their goal of toppling the Iraqi leader.
There was little expectation about support by the Saudis for any
plan to unseat Saddam but there was a need to build an
understanding, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis have been helpful to the Clinton administration by
offering a proposal on sanctions against Saddam in a way that is
more palatable to Washington than a plan put forward by the French.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis have called for retaining sanctions but abolishing a
limit on how much oil Iraq can sell and making other changes to
speed humanitarian deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi rulers expressed their animosity to the Iraqi leader when
a political commentator in the official Saudi news agency wrote
recently that ``the Iraqi pople deserve and need a revolution''
against the ``tyrant of Baghdad.''

 &HT;    Georgia senators follow party line in impeachment dismissal,
witness vote
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For three weeks, Sens. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) and
Max Cleland (D-Ga.) have kept mostly quiet about how they see the
impeachment evidence against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia's two senators broke their silences Wednesday in two
votes that spoke volumes about whether they believe Clinton should
be convicted and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting their respective parties, Coverdell voted against
dismissing the two articles of impeachment against Clinton and
voted for the motion to allow deposition testimony from Monica
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland voted to dismiss the charges and against the motion to
depose witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews after the votes, the two men offered differing
views of the Constitution and the issues at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he relied on Senate precedent in impeachment
trials and cast his vote in a way that would withstand the test of
history the next time the Congress impeaches a president.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said he wrestled mostly with the constitutional
standards for impeachment and sought, above all, to cast a vote
that put the best interests of the nation first.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also disagreed sharply over the significance of the
two votes and what they mean for the future conduct of the trial,
with Coverdell predicting a relatively speedy conclusion and
Cleland warning of long days and weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be around here for months and months because of this
agreement on witnesses,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a refrain mentioned frequently by Republicans,
Coverdell noted that no Senate impeachment trial has ever ended in
a dismissal and no case has never been tried without witnesses. Two
trials ended when the impeached defendant resigned rather than go
to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just no precedent for (a) dismissing and (b) no
witnesses,'' said Coverdell. ``This must be done correctly. ...
Just as we are going back 130 years to look at what was done,
somebody else will come back to this point and you have to be
mindful of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coverdell said he was withholding judgment on whether to
convict Clinton and remove him from office, Coverdell said a vote
to dismiss the case would have ``trivialized'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he did not know if the three witnesses requested
by the House would be able to add anything to his understanding of
the facts of the case, but he suggested that House prosecutors will
have to make a strong case that those witnesses should testify in
person in the well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a vote to have witnesses,'' said Coverdell. ``This
is a vote to find out whether or not the House managers can
demonstrate that they need witnesses or not. And then there will
have to be a decision on each one as to whether they did do that or
didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland effectively tipped his hand in how he will vote on the
articles of impeachment, saying categorically that he did not
believe the accusations against Clinton rose to the level of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard, this certainly doesn't rise to the level
that the Senate of the United States should, for the first time in
American history, remove a sitting American president,'' Cleland
said. ``Impeachment is basically reserved for a high crime along
the lines of bribery, treason and in effect selling the state out.
The state, not for virtually anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said he could conceive of cases where perjury and
obstruction of justice rose to the level of impeachment, but ``not
in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said he rejected the call for witnesses because he
believes witnesses will not add anything to the impeachment record.
He also questioned why the Senate should hear from witnesses, when
the House did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't call witnesses, and yet they come over and say our
case is incomplete unless we call these three witnesses,'' Cleland
said. ``I just don't see prolonging the ultimate judgment here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the vote to depose witnesses, Cleland said the Senate had
in effect given over control of the process to the lawyers and
entered a ``free-fall where nobody knows where it's going or how
it's going to end up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the Senate tell either side that they can or cannot
have a witness they believe is important to their case,'' he said.
``This thing is out of control now. One of the good things about
the Senate is that we were in charge, not the chief justice, not
the House managers, not the lawyers, not the press, not Hustler
magazine, but the Senate. But now it does not seem to me that the
Senate is (still) in charge. We have in effect given over to the
arguing parties the future of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell strongly disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is disputing that the Senate is conducting its business
in a very open, thorough, fair manner,'' Coverdell said. ``I don't
think anyone is challenging that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Coverdell and Cleland said they hoped for a bipartisan end
to the the trial, and both said they want an ending that leads to
an up or down vote on the articles of impeachment.

AT&AMP;T UNVEILS A PLAN WHERE 10 CENTS A MINUTE COVERS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas) (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Removing the price distinction between wireless and
traditional phone calls for the first time, AT&AMP;T Corp. on Wednesday
said it would offer long-distance and wireless service at a single
rate of 10 cents a minute on a single bill.
</P>
<P>
   The plan gives AT&AMP;T, the nation's No. 1 communications carrier,
a sharp new arrow in its marketing quiver as it struggles to remake
itself from the slow-moving Ma Bell of the past into a nimble
player in the fast-changing communications marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the plan will cost about $30 a month. Even so, the new
10-cent-a-minute price could yield big savings for people who make
even a fair number of wireless calls. AT&AMP;T is hoping that leads to
an acceleration in the already-exploding use of wireless phones.
And after AT&AMP;T completes its acquisition of Tele-Communications
Inc., the No. 2 cable-television provider, it intends to include
local telephone service _ using TCI's cable wires _ into the new
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is hoping that the simplified billing of the
plan, called AT&AMP;T Personal Network, will be a further inducement to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of communications services in recent
years, some U.S. households are confronted with as many as five
bills each month for services ranging from Internet access to
cellular calls, and each service often has its own complicated
price structure.
</P>
<P>
   Under AT&AMP;T's plan, calling a friend across the country from a
wireless phone would cost the same 10 cents a minute as an
identical call from a traditional phone.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, which becomes available Sunday, could reduce
AT&AMP;T's profit margins in the short run, but the company is counting
on the new program's breadth to help AT&AMP;T hold on to customers who
might be tempted to switch to another communications provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get my wireless phone, my long-distance phone, and I also
have an Internet access account with AT&AMP;T, and someone calls me up
and says, `Hey, I have cheap long-distance service,' the idea of
switching becomes much more of a hassle when I already have this
simple convenient plan with all the services from one company,''
said Eric Strumingher, a communications analyst for Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said it slowed down its marketing over the later part of
1998 to get ready to introduce the new plan. The company said the
new program would become AT&AMP;T's main marketing tool beginning with
a 60-second advertisement during the Super Bowl on Sunday. The
advertisement, with a soundtrack by Madonna, targets young
professionals and families with images of early-morning workouts,
jet-setting executives and children's football games.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T intends to offer the new service across the country, except
in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston _ big cities where AT&AMP;T
does not own a wireless network. The company plans to introduce the
Personal Network plan in Los Angeles within a few months but would
not announce plans for the other two cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it is AT&AMP;T leading the market,'' said Jim Suzansky,
a communications consultant for Arthur Andersen. ``It's a very
simple plan. Ten cents is something we can all count on our
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to the plan will be required to sign up for a
one-year contract with a base monthly fee of $29.99. Users will
then pay a flat rate of 10 cents a minute for all domestic
long-distance calls from home, at any time of day. The 10 cent rate
will also apply to calls to Britain, Canada and northern parts of
Mexico, though higher rates will apply to calls to other foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Local and domestic long-distance wireless calls will also cost
10 cents a minute, at any time of day, as long as the call is made
from the user's home calling area.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says that 82 percent of wireless subscribers make a vast
majority of their calls from their home area. For AT&AMP;T customers in
Manhattan, for instance, the home area includes all of New York
City and much of northern New Jersey. When subscribers to AT&AMP;T's
new plan ``roam'' and use their wireless phone from outside their
home area, the rate increases to 60 cents a minute, including
domestic long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the customer is not roaming, wireless calls to foreign
countries will cost more than 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T shook up the wireless market last year with a plan called
Digital One Rate that does not charge roaming fees. But that plan,
which begins at $89.99 a month for 600 minutes of service, is aimed
at wealthier users. The Personal Network plan is geared to the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to the Personal Network will also receive a personal
toll-free number for incoming calls and a calling card for use when
traveling. The rates for each those services will also be 10 cents
a minute. AT&AMP;T said potential customers would be able to call a
single customer service representative to discuss the different
services.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers will not be able to use the same number for their
wireless and home phones, but AT&AMP;T said Wednesday that it would
waive termination fees for customers who agreed to a wireless
contract with AT&AMP;T under an older plan and who now want to switch
to Personal Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big idea is that a call is a call is a call,'' said Daniel
H. Schulman, an AT&AMP;T executive vice president for marketing. ``It
breaks down the boundaries between the wireless and wired worlds so
you get a single low rate, a single bill, a single number for
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the highly competitive nature of the telecommunications
business, it seems unlikely that AT&AMP;T intends to use the Personal
Network as a tool to gain customers with the intention of
drastically raising prices later. Even though AT&AMP;T requires
customers to sign up for a one-year contract, users who feel
mistreated by AT&AMP;T are sure to find solace in one of the other
behemoth phone companies, a flexibility that AT&AMP;T is surely aware
of.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, neither the Sprint Corp. nor MCI Worldcom Inc.,
AT&AMP;T's two main long-distance rivals, offers anything quite like
AT&AMP;T's new plan.
</P>
<P>
   For $25 a month, Sprint offers unlimited weekend calling from
traditional telephones and a rate of 10 cents a minute during the
week. Sprint also has a big wireless operation that offers rates as
low as 10 cents a minute including long-distance charges for
customers who spend $99.99 a month. But Sprint, which does not
require a long-term wireless contract, charges a minimum of 25
cents a minute when users exceed their agreed-upon amount of time
and it has not integrated long-distance and wireless onto a single
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be customers who prefer to have it all on
one bill and there are some that may not,'' said Tom Murphy, a
spokesman for Sprint's wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, the No. 2 long-distance company, does not have a
wireless unit but it does resell cellular service from other
companies under a plan called MCI One. MCI One includes call
forwarding between home and wireless phones and it includes an
integrated bill, but it does not offer uniform flat-rate wireless
pricing because MCI Worldcom has to negotiate with the underlying
wireless carrier in each market.

KENNEDY TO OPPOSE MONEY-MANAGER ROLE IN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drawing battle lines in two of the largest debates in Congress
this year, Senator Edward Kennedy will call Thursday on lawmakers
to reject plans that would give private money-managers and
insurance companies a larger role in the nation's most popular
domestic programs, Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and lawmakers of both parties have agreed to
spend 60 percent of future budget surpluses to shore up the
financially troubled Social Security retirement program, but there
are bitter differences over how to design the fix.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers are divided over whether to divert 15
percent of future supluses into Medicare, the health insurance
program for the elderly, as President Clinton wants, or to use some
of that money for tax cuts, as Republicans have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Association of Social Insurance,
Kennedy, who is one of the most influential lawmakers on health
care issues, will endorse the idea of diverting surplus tax dollars
into Medicare. He says this will keep Medicare solvent until 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will reject a proposal from a fellow Democrat, Senator
John Breaux of Louisiana, to raise the age of eligibility for
Medicare and require higher-income beneficiaries to pay higher
premiums. Kennedy will also reject Breaux's proposal to have the
government offer each beneficiary a fixed amount of money to buy
health insurance, either from private insurers or from Medicare
itself. Kennedy predicts that private insurers would find ways to
attract the healthiest of the elderly, leaving conventional
Medicare with high costs and higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux is chairman of a federal advisory committee studying ways
to stave off impending financial problems in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will also back Clinton's call for Medicare to cover the
cost of prescription drugs, which he says will save the program
money by reducing the costlier treatments needed when seniors do
not take the proper medications. He will say that Medicare benefit
cuts are unwise, given that future medical breakthroughs are likely
to cut the cost of treatments in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will also endorse Clinton's plan to divert 60 percent of
future surpluses to Social Security. He backs the idea of allowing
the program's trustees to invest a portion of the surplus in stocks
and bonds, part of an attempt to boost the pool of money available
to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will reject the idea of allowing workers to divert some
of their Social Security taxes into privately owned, individual
retirement accounts, an idea generally favored by Republicans.

PENTAGON SEEKS MILITARY LEADER TO RESPOND TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (bl)  
By WILLIAM J. BROAD and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon has decided to ask President Clinton for the power
to appoint a military leader for the continental United States
because of what it sees as a growing threat of major terrorist
strikes on U.S. soil, Defense Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the military leader to be ready, if
necessary, to do such things as order thousands of doctors,
stretchers and emergency personnel quickly sent to stricken areas,
much as U.S. commanders abroad are now prepared to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which currently has no organization for such
crisis work, has quietly discussed the plan for about a year and
recently decided to press ahead and ask for presidential approval.
</P>
<P>
   Top White House officials have reacted favorably, characterizing
the proposed step as a relatively minor adjustment of the lines of
military authority and organization.
</P>
<P>
   But civil libertarians and some Clinton administration officials
fear that such military power could slowly expand to threaten the
privacy, liberty and lives of private citizens. Defenders of the
plan, including Pentagon officials, insist that it would do no such
thing and that the nation needs homeland defense to deal with
terrorists armed with deadly germs, chemicals and skills for
attacking the nation's key computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials added that they had no intention of usurping
civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only appropriate role is in support of civil agencies that
have the primary responsibility for law and order and emergency
response,'' said Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a senior Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, warned that a major terrorist attack had the potential
to be ``the most threatening event to civil liberties since Pearl
Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to how, after Japan's attack on the United
States in World War II, the U.S. military detained some 120,000
Americans of Japanese ancestry, an act that some historians have
characterized as reckless. The official said the current plan would
help prevent such an overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Defense Secretary William Cohen had
recently signed off on a plan to create a Joint Task Force for
Civil Support, whose commander would develop ways for the Army,
Navy, Marines and Air Force to aid federal agencies in time of
domestic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The step requires approval by the president. In an interview
last week with The New York Times, Clinton said he was carefully
weighing the issue and was deeply aware of the potential abuses of
expanded military power. And the next day, in unveiling his $10
billion program to build up anti-terror defenses, he emphasized the
importance of protecting personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential,'' Clinton told federal officials and military
officers gathered at the National Academy of Sciences, ``that we
don't undermine liberty in the name of liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans have a deep mistrust of the military. That
uneasiness is evident in ``The Siege,'' a recent movie in which
terrorist attacks prompt the declaration of martial law in New York
City and the Army general in charge turns out to be a loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Allusions to the Pentagon's new organizational plan emerged
quietly last year when Hamre of the Defense Department gave a
speech saying the appointment of a domestic military leader was all
but inevitable and would be essential in helping stave off chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a bonafide chemical attack in the subway system in
New York, it's going to quickly go beyond what the local police can
handle,'' Hamre told military officials. ``If there is a biological
attack, you can easily see regional governors calling out the
National Guard to quarantine the highways. It could get crazy very
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan say the risks of military help outweigh the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is in the inevitable expansion of that authority so
the military gets involved in things like arresting people and
investigating crimes,'' said Gregory Nojeim, legislative counsel on
national security for the American Civil Liberties Union, based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers are trained to kill, not to respect the nuances of law
enforcement, Nojeim added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe that a soldier with a suspect in the
sights of his M-1 tank is well positioned to protect that person's
civil liberties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, Nojeim said, already has the money, authority and
manpower to handle such crises.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Fred Ikle, an undersecretary of defense in the Reagan
administration, applauded finding ways for the military to deal
better with terrorism on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the armed services have the managerial and logistical
capabilities to mount the all-out defensive effort,'' Ikle said in
a report on homeland defense being prepared for the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a private policy group in
Washington.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   By law, the U.S. military cannot make arrests or act in civil
law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act, passed after the Civil
War to rein in the military, bars federal troops from doing police
work within U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   The division of powers that bars the military from domestic law
enforcement is similar to that between the FBI and the CIA. The
former does surveillance work at home and the latter abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Though venerable, the dominance of civil power under posse
comitatus (Latin for ``power of the country'') has seen a growing
number of exceptions. One, widely viewed as having mixed results,
concerns drug interdiction. Nojeim of the ACLU said that in 1997
that exception resulted in death when troops in Texas accidentally
shot a teen-age to death.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who specializes in national
security issues, said another exception became law during the
Reagan administration when Congress permitted posse comitatus to be
waived in the event of nuclear terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Congress later widened the exception, Nunn added. After the
Soviet Union fell apart and Western experts grew worried about the
possible spread of powerful weapons into unfriendly hands, he
helped sponsor a little-noticed provision that gives the Pentagon
power to step in domestically in the event of chemical and germ
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already have the authority,'' Nunn said of the armed
services in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The new question, he said, is whether the services will become
properly organized and trained and their actions well coordinated
in advance of any mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition on
anonymity, cast examples of the domestic work in strictly
humanitarian terms. Only the military services, the official said,
have the ability to transport 3,000 hospital cots, tons of clean
water or ``10,000 people who have been inoculated against anthrax''
to the site of a biological attack where civilians are sick, dead
or dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is how we organize ourselves to provide meaningful
support and not to threaten civil liberties,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aid work, he added, the Pentagon would report to the
Department of Justice, which has the lead not only in law
enforcement but in coordinating the domestic response to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the joint task force recently endorsed by
Cohen would, if approved by the president, have a high-level
commander.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Pentagon officials said the new post would probably
go to the U.S. Atlantic Command, which is based in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official said the domestic task force might in time
evolve into its own distinct command, joining the others by which
the Pentagon carves up its global duties. The task force is being
developed as part of the Pentagon's periodic review of its command
structure, any major changes to which require presidential
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Formal presentation of the plan to the White House might not
occur for months and a presidential decision might not be made
public until late summer, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent interview with The Times, Clinton said he was
keeping an open mind on the subject and called the issue of the
military's role ``the last big kind of organizational piece'' in
strengthening the nation's defenses against new kinds of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want us to do,'' he said, ``is everything within reason
we can to minimize our exposure and risks here, and that's how I'm
going to evaluate this Pentagon recommendation.''

U.S. DISCLOSES PLAN TO END FIGHTING IN KOSOVO; AIRSTRIKES
POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The Clinton administration formally
announced a far-reaching plan on Wednesday to end the fighting in
Kosovo that calls for NATO airstrikes if the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, refuses to accept a settlement granting Kosovo
autonomy. Talks between the two sides are expected to begin next
week in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If ethnic Albanian separatists who have been fighting for
independence resist the plan, NATO could impose a blockade on the
coast of Albania to cut off the flow of arms to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they wanted a political settlement
``within a matter of weeks'' or Milosevic would be bombed into
compliance. The plan is to begin with a series of escalating
diplomatic and military threats that have been orchestrated to be
carried out in the next several days among NATO representatives and
European and Russian foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The key elements of the plan were announced by the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, during a trip by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The plan differs markedly from an American-brokered cease-fire
effort last fall because it demands, under the threat of force, a
resolution of the political status of Kosovo, a Serbian province,
which has an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the British Foreign Office said Wednesday night
that the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair was in ``broad
agreement'' with the administration's strategy, including the
sequence of events Washington has sketched out for the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which has been less enthusiastic about
the threat of airstrikes, has not publicly endorsed the plan but
apparently signed on late Wednesday night. During Albright's visit
to Moscow on Wednesday, before she continued to the Middle East,
the Russians, who have the most influence on the Serbs, repeated
their opposition to the use of force but went further than before
in their support for a political settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration's plan was the toughest so far, it
appeared to be fraught with obstacles. It called for the imposition
of a political settlement on two sides who have not even met face
to face. Neither the Serbs nor the ethnic Albanians have come close
to nibbling at an autonomy plan that has been proffered to them in
the past several months by an American negotiator, Christopher
Hill, ambassador to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they believed they could persuade a ``critical
mass'' of ethnic Albanians to sit down at the negotiating table,
although the Albanian factions have been bitterly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Albright put pressure on the so-called contact group of six
nations overseeing the former Yugoslavia to agree to the
combination of force and diplomacy by saying she would not attend
the group's meeting on Friday unless it was followed by a NATO
authorization order for force.
</P>
<P>
   She announced here late Wednesday night that ``having achieved
agreement with our allies on a strategy,'' she would go to the
London meeting to help carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies have been propelled to act on Kosovo after the
massacre nearly two weeks ago of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serbian
forces broke the cease-fire there.
</P>
<P>
   Each side in the conflict, which erupted a year ago, has been
provoking the other in recent weeks with hostage taking,
intermittent fighting and targeted killings. The Serbian forces,
under the control of Milosevic and now in Kosovo well beyond the
numbers allowed under last fall's cease-fire, have been singled out
by the administration for most of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus also comes in part from the fear among NATO members
that fighting in the province, even though it is in a remote corner
of Europe, will prove embarrassing just as NATO is celebrating its
50th anniversary in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official with Albright alluded to the
specter of an embarrassing spectacle of fighting in Kosovo during
the NATO gala, saying, ``We have to take very firm and determined
action, or we're going to be sorry in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate steps laid out by the administration are scheduled
to culminate in a vote this weekend by the 16 NATO allies on
whether to authorize NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to carry
out airstrikes if the talks fail. The authorization for airstrikes
is what the administration has termed the necessary ``credible
force'' against Milosevic. Planes from the United States, Britain,
Italy and other NATO members are expected to participate in any
airstrikes on Serbian targets within and outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions for airstrikes _ such as when they might actually
begin _ were being negotiated at a closed meeting of NATO
ambassadors Wednesday night in Brussels, NATO diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was authorized to use NATO force last fall during
negotiations with Milosevic for a cease-fire in Kosovo, but the
authorization was suspended when the Yugoslav leader backed down.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, according to the outline of its strategy,
believes that under the weight of an authorization of NATO force
Milosevic is in the end likely to back off again.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the plan, Rubin declined to address the question of
whether American ground troops would be involved in either
enforcing a peace settlement or filling a vacuum after any
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, did not shut
the door to the participation by American troops in a NATO
peace-keeping operation in Kosovo. U.S. troops are part of a NATO
stabilization force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Office officials said on Wednesday that Britain
was willing ``in principle'' to contribute to ground forces in
Kosovo under the auspices of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could end up with the threat of airstrikes but the reality
of ground troops,'' a NATO diplomat in Brussels said on Wednesday.
The Russians, the diplomat noted, do not oppose NATO ground troops
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the plan is scheduled to take place in
Brussels on Thursday, when NATO is expected to issue a warning to
Milosevic, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was not expected to contain much muscle but was
intended, according to the NATO diplomat, to provide a
``psychomilitary environment'' for the meeting in London of the
contact group, which consists of Russia, the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy. It is possible that General
Clark will fly to Belgrade on Friday to deliver the warning
personally to Milosevic, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is the meeting on Friday of the contact group,
which is to oversee the talks between the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The plan echoes some aspects of the Dayton Accord, which ended
the war in Bosnia, by calling the two sides to a conference table
and demanding a settlement within a tight time frame.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Dayton, which was brokered by the United States, the
talks on a Kosovo settlement would be conducted under the auspices
of the contact group. The co-chairmen of the talks are expected to
be Hill and a European Union envoy, Wolfgang Petritsch from
Austria, an administration official said. The site for the talks
has not been decided, the official said, but suggestions have
ranged from Vienna to a remote United States air base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be offered at the talks would be some expanded
variation on the plan that Hill has been discussing with both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   This plan envisions giving the ethnic Albanians, who make up
more than 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, control of the
legislature, police, judiciary and other functions of government.
Kosovo would remain a province of Serbia, however.

HOUSE MANAGERS CHOSE WITNESSES TO BOLSTER CASE ON OBSTRUCTION
CHARGE

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican prosecutors said on Wednesday they
chose three witnesses who could help them make the broadest and
strongest case that President Clinton obstructed justice, the
impeachment article that surprisingly has drawn the most interest
from senators of both parties.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the trial started three weeks ago, the House prosecutors
were sure that their best chance of convicting Clinton lay in
persuading the senators that the president had lied under oath
before a federal grand jury about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But since then, senators squeamish about the sexual aspects of
the perjury charge have focused on obstruction of justice, as the
article that most likely rises to the level of an impeachable
offense. The question now, in many senators' minds, is did it
happen?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us feel very strongly about the second count, and we
need witnesses to help on that,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon,
one of 56 senators, all but one of them Republicans, who approved
subpoenas on Wednesday for Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and
Sidney Blumenthal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction article charges Clinton with having encouraged
Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit and to conceal gifts he had given her. It
contends the president enlisted Jordan's help in finding Ms.
Lewinsky a job to buy her cooperation in the Jones suit, and it
accuses the president of attempting to influence the testimony of
his secretary, Betty Currie, and top aides like Blumenthal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators seem to relate the perjury charge to sex, and the
president's twisting definitions,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
the House manager who will question Ms. Lewinsky. ``It's an easier
sell job with obstruction of justice. It's about a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, the manager who will interview
Jordan, said, ``Obstruction of justice is extraordinarily
compelling, and goes to the heart of our judicial system.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Senate Republicans, the House prosecutors
pared their wish list of witnesses from 15, to 5, to 3. Like a
basketball team suddenly told on the eve of the championship game
they must cut their starting lineup, the House managers this week
weighed the strengths of potential witnesses right up to when they
presented their final list to the Senate on Tuesday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they left off the one witness that many Republicans
considered a secret weapon _ Mrs. Currie _ disappointing some
senators who believed she had the most potential to clarify factual
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of making judicious decisions as to which
witnesses would give us the best chance to try to convert people
into a vote for conviction,'' said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night in an ornate room off the Senate chamber, Rep.
Henry J. Hyde, the leader of the House managers, met four of the
other prosecutors to bless the final list of witnesses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after Hyde left, his colleagues tore up the list
and made a new one. That list lasted only a few minutes before the
managers scrapped it, too. The 13 House prosecutors did not approve
the final list until the next morning, moments before presenting it
to the Senate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is the managers' star witness and had a guaranteed
spot in the lineup. But the managers shuffled and reshuffled their
final two choices as they gauged and regauged both the mood of the
Senate and their own analysis of which witnesses could swing
wavering senators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They decided to drop Mrs. Currie, some managers said on
Wednesday, because the secretary's sworn testimony about statements
Clinton made to her about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky seemed
immovable. Mrs. Currie testified that the president, in a series of
questions, had suggested he and Ms. Lewinsky had, for example,
never been alone together.
</P>
<P>
   And they said that Ms. Lewinsky clarified in her weekend
interview with prosecutors the sequence of calls between her and
Mrs. Currie on the day that the secretary picked up the gifts that
were under subpoena by the lawyers for Mrs. Jones.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``While we would have liked to have had Betty, we just didn't
need her,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But privately, some said a reason Mrs. Currie was not called is
that the prosecutors, already reviled in many public opinion polls,
did not want to be seen as grilling a sympathetic, African-American
woman in the well of the Senate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine and Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, expressed surprise and disappointment that
the managers did not summon Mrs. Currie.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators accused the managers of disregarding their
pretext for calling witnesses _ to clarify conflicting testimony.
``The No. 1 witness you would want if there are factual
discrepancies is Betty Currie, who wasn't called,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think they have another game plan: To
get Monica Lewinsky to the floor of the Senate, which I think would
be undignified and unproductive.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors opted to summon Jordan instead of Mrs. Currie _
both considered friendly to the president _ to underscore what they
say were Jordan's efforts, at the White House's urging, to help
find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York and to buy her silence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the managers had to choose between Blumenthal and John
Podesta, the White House chief of staff, as to who would best
illustrate the accusation that Clinton lied to his aides about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In the president's conversation
with Blumenthal, Clinton described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``stalker,''
and said she ``threatened'' to tell people ``they'd had an
affair.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Blumenthal best represents those people the president spoke to
to perpetuate his fraud,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three witnesses told House prosecuters on
Wednesday that their clients would be available to testify by this
weekend. ``If we receive a subpoena,'' said Judy Smith, a spokesman
for Ms. Lewinsky, ``we will comply.''  &QL;

ASTRONOMERS GET PHOTOS AS BRIGHTEST BURST IN THE SKY HITS   PEAK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Mich., N.M.)  (dal) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers for the first time have photographed the visible
glow of a gamma ray burst at the peak of its brightness, capturing
the most powerful cosmic eruption ever detected.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, operated in
Earth's orbit by NASA, first detected the burst of high-energy
radiation in deep space, in the vicinity of the constellation
Bootes. An Italian-Dutch satellite also recorded the explosion and
fixed its position much more accurately. Within 22 seconds, this
information was flashed to a telescope at Los Alamos, N.M., which
immediately took pictures of light from the burst just as it
achieved peak brightness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optical telescopes had seen the afterglow of a burst, but
never the burst itself,'' Dr. Scott Barthelmy, an astronomer at the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said in a NASA
announcement Wednesday. ``This observation will help us understand
the physical processes behind the bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   The observations by the Robotic Optical Transient Search
Experiment at the Los Alamos National Laboratory showed a starlike
point of light fainter than the human eye could see, but easily
visible in an amateur telescope. Within 8 minutes, the burst had
faded by a factor of 100 below its maximum brightness.
</P>
<P>
   ``At best, we expected something really dim optically, at the
limit of our sensitivity,'' said Dr. Carl W. Akerlof of the
University of Michigan, who led the team operating the Los Alamos
telescope. ``Instead we found a whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Gehrels, chief scientist of the Compton Observatory,
operated by the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.,
said the optical emission from the burst was about 10,000 times
brighter than ever observed, ``something you could see with a pair
of good binoculars.''
</P>
<P>
   Further observations and analysis, other astronomers said,
indicated that the new burst surpassed in power an exceedingly
energetic gamma burst observed last May, which at the time was
described as the most powerful cosmic event since the Big Bang at
the start of the universe. (Gamma bursts surpass any other cosmic
eruptions.) Scientists speculate that the sources of such powerful
eruptions could be mergers of black holes, extremely dense regions
with exceptional gravitational force; or of two neutron stars,
dense cores of exploded stars, or of a black hole and a neutron
star.
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers also caught sight of Saturday's burst. A team
from the California Institute of Technology used a 60-inch
telescope at the Palomar Mountain Observatory to observe the fading
light.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, a team from the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, observing at the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in
Hawaii, obtained spectrograms of the burst. From these data,
showing the effects of the expanding universe on light traveling
great distances over time, the astronomers estimated that the
distance to the burst was about nine billion light-years, more than
halfway to the edge of the observable universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this burst had originated in the Milky Way galaxy, it would
have lit up the night sky,'' said Dr. Alan Bunner, a scientist at
NASA headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For years scientists had argued over whether the mysterious
gamma ray bursts came from relatively nearby or from galaxies far
beyond. Obtaining pictures of the explosions or their afterglows in
the last year enabled scientists to estimate their distances, which
so far have all been well beyond the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   In its issue to be published on Saturday, Science News, a weekly
magazine, reported that ``if the burst emitted radiation equally in
all directions, its total output equaled the explosive energy of
2,000 supernovas,'' or exploding stars.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists suggested that the energy level of the
eruption could be less than it appears, either because the output
of energy is not equal in all directions or optical illusions made
the light seem much brighter than it really was. For example, Dr.
George Djorgovski of Caltech said it was possible that the mass of
a galaxy between Earth and the explosion could have been acting as
a gravitational lens, bending and focusing the light to make it
appear brighter than it really was. &QL;

 &HT;    Sights and sound at the Super Bowl

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be listening for the jock-talk hosts at WQXI/790-AM (''The
Zone'') to be referring to themselves as the ''official'' radio
station of the Atlanta Falcons anytime soon. The guys pushed the
envelope and got away with that handle for a few days last week.
</P>
<P>
   But producer Matt Edgar confirmed Wednesday they were hit with a
cease-and-desist order by the attorneys for WGST, the team's
flagship station.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was great while it lasted and, hey, most people think we
are the official station of the team,'' Edgar said. ''The other
guys (WGST) haven't done a thing to promote the team and we hear
some of their public relations people lost jobs over this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter country
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota wide receiver Cris Carter likely won't make any
friends in Atlanta with his remarks on HBO's ''Inside the NFL''
tonight. Carter is critical of coach Dan Reeves' move to have the
Pro Bowl players and 10-year veterans depart the team's charter
first on Sunday. ''Coach (Dennis) Green never would have
preferential treatment,'' Carter said before criticizing the
Falcons players for taking their grievances on the matter public.
Carter said that the Atlanta secondary will have to play more
man-to-man coverage than it did against the Vikings because the
defense will have to commit an extra body to stopping Terrell
Davis. ''If they don't,'' said Carter, who forecast a 34-24 Broncos
victory, ''he'll run for 300 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman conquests
</P>
<P>
   The sod at Pro Player Stadium for Sunday's game was supplied by
golfer Greg Norman, who counts a turf farm in Orlando among his
diverse holdings. Norman stopped by to survey the field earlier
this week before departing to Australia. For the record, the
Falcons haven't played a game on grass since their Nov. 8 victory
at New England.
</P>
<P>
   Getting antsy
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Atlanta players were eating up all the media
attention the first couple days in Miami, but by Wednesday a fog
started settling in on a few of them. It started to become clear
that two things are happening. First of all, all the fuss is
starting to get a little old, and the team is getting serious in
preparation for the game. Left tackle Bob Whitfield, who was all
chuckles at media day on Tuesday, was not thrilled about having to
be at an 8:15 a.m. press conference. ''I don't want to be doing
this,'' he said. ''I was watching 'Teletubbies' on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The perks
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves instituted a midnight curfew beginning
Tuesday, but coaches are not subject to it, and quarterbacks coach
Jack Burns was taking advantage of some free time well after 1 a.m.
Wednesday. The man who will call most of the offensive plays for
Sunday was out in front of the team hotel smoking a big cigar. He
said the time alone, in the quiet, helps him clear his head.
</P>
<P>
   Super shorts
</P>
<P>
   Movie star Cameron Diaz caused quite a stir when she wandered by
the media hotel on Wednesday. She's starring here in the Oliver
Stone movie ''On Any Given Sunday,'' and plays the general manager
of a team. . . . There are three massage therapists available in
the media lounge. . . . Ticket prices have dropped to about $1,250
for the cheap seats.

POPE TELLS 100,000 THAT DEATH PENALTY IS `CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert two new grafs after 10th graf, which ends

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Preaching consistency in moral values, Pope John
Paul II urged American Catholics Wednesday to extend the crusade to
protect human life to include murderers on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who are
unconditionally pro-life,'' the pope preached to 100,000 people in
the Trans World Sports Dome. ``Modern society has the means of
protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the
chance to reform.'' He called the death penalty ``cruel and
unnecessary,'' and said it was so ``even in the case of someone who
has done great evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has often urged an end to the death penalty, but
Wednesday's was the most explicit statement against capital
punishment he has made in the United States. In Missouri, which
executed a convicted murderer 12 days before the pope arrived and
delayed the execution of another, scheduled for Wednesday, until
after the pope returns to Rome, the pope's uncompromising message
had an uneasy resonance. Many American Catholics support the death
penalty. And even at Wednesday's Mass, some followers expressed
deep reverence for the pope _ and disagreement with his teachings
on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here because I really believe. I am a believing Catholic
and I love this pope,'' Araminta Rincon, a translator who arrived
at the dome at 3 a.m. from Green Bay, Wis., explained. But she,
like others, said she also believed in the death penalty. ``In some
ways, it's very sad. But there is no other way _some people are
just very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This 30-hour stop is the 78-year-old pope's fifth pastoral visit
to the United States, and once again, the pope finds himself
confronting one of the chief frustrations of his papacy: Many
American Catholics display a stubborn independence from Vatican
teaching. The pope, who stopped in St. Louis after an episcopal
meeting in Mexico to instruct Americans about their responsibility
to the world in the new millennium, also had to remind Catholics to
heed the basic tenets of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, the pope mentioned some of the moral issues which
divide Americans, and also many Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of God's gift of life
and love?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting St. Louis, the pope chose a metropolitan area that
is close to 55 percent Catholic. But his message was also aimed at
the nation at large, and before leaving St. Louis he held an
evening prayer service at the St. Louis Cathedral for about 2,000
people, including Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., and their wives.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told his audience that as the only surviving
superpower, the United States was a model for the rest of the
world. ``Radical change in world politics leaves America with a
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he preached.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, who was the first pope to apologize openly for the
failure of many Catholics to resist the Nazi policy of
exterminating Jews during World War II, has tried to make
ecumenicism and reconciliation with the Jews a hallmark of his
papacy. A rabbi, Robert Jacobs, executive vice-president of the St.
Louis rabbinical association, gave a reading about a prophecy of
the renewal of Zion _ Isaiah 35:1:6 _ at the vesper service, giving
the opening in Hebrew. The pope has visited synagogues, and prayed
with rabbis at interfaith services, but this was the first time a
rabbi had given a reading at a Catholic service officiated by the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   After vespers, the Pope walked out of the basilica and shook
hands with Rosa Parks, the civil rights heroine of the Montgomery,
Ala., bus boycott in 1955. Mrs. Parks, who will turn 86 in
February, rose from her wheelchair to shake the pope's hand.
</P>
<P>
   At a farewell ceremony in a hangar at Lambert International
Airport here, the pope had a private meeting with Gore. As the two
men posed for photographers, the vice president asked the pope
about the last time he visited St. Louis, in 1969. The pope
replied, ``The last time I was here, I was a cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the morning Mass, the pope asked his audience to ``put an end
to every form of racism, a plague which your bishops have called
one of the most persistent and destructive evils on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, at a youth rally of 20,000, the pope discussed
the less-privileged side of American society, decrying the
abandonment of the homeless, the proliferation of urban gangs,
sexual abuse and drugs, and implored his young audience to break
free of the secular society that surrounds them. ``Do not listen to
those who encourage you to lie, to shirk responsibility, to put
yourselves first,'' the pope said. ``Do not listen to those who
tell you that chastity is passe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ailing pope, whose voice is slurred as the result of
Parkinson's disease, was at times difficult to understand. In both
sports arenas, giant screens included captioned text of his
remarks. But he seemed buoyed by the wild enthusiasm of his
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tuesday's rock-concert-style rally, the pope was
presented with a hockey stick. As he rose from his armchair to
leave the podium, he briefly lowered his staff and used it to mime
the motion of a hockey pass _ winning roars of laughter and
applause.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the stadium, the fervor at times melted away. Though
there were some areas where the crowds were six people deep, other
sidewalks along his parade route Wednesday were empty, and the huge
crowds that had been anticipated in the center of town did not
materialize. Security was extremely tight _ acolytes who assisted
the pope as he celebrated Mass wore security badges over their
robes _ but security restrictions and traffic warnings were only
partly the reason for the thin crowds outside the events.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in the United States are less demonstrative than in
many poorer countries. ``We thought there would be 100,000 inside
and another 100,000 outside,'' Craig Rhodes, a St. Louis police
officer, said as he stared at an empty street where the
``popemobile'' had been expected to pass. ``We got the barricades
up but there is nobody there.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, however, the pope's message struck home with some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was for the death penalty,'' said John Magee, 34,
a branch manager of an electrical-supply company who attended the
Mass. ``I always thought pro-life was about abortion, not the death
penalty. I may change my mind.''

AMERICA ONLINE'S PROFITS INCREASE SHARPLY AS SALES NEAR $1 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online continued to show vigorous growth and improving
profitability in the latest quarter, earning $122 million on sales
of $960 million, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That profit included $33 million in tax breaks carried forward
from the company's earlier losses. Excluding those benefits,
America Online would have earned $88 million, or 17 cents a diluted
share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up 349 percent from $19.6
million, or 4 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. That
exceeded the 14 cents a share that analysts have been forecasting.
Revenue was up 62 percent from $592 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time this looks like a real company that
generates cash flow,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst with
BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``Everyone was expecting a big
quarter for AOL, and this was as big as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the most surprising aspect of the company's
results was that it was able to hold down its costs amid rapid
growth. As a result, the company's profit margin _ as represented
by operating earnings as a percent of revenue _ increased to 13.6
percent from 5.4 percent in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is delivering on its twin promises of predictable
revenue and improving operating leverage,'' said Shaun G.
Andrikopoulos, an analyst with BT Alex.Brown.
</P>
<P>
   America Online continues to maintain the lion's share of the
market for Internet access in homes and small business. In the
quarter, the company's fiscal second quarter, America Online
increased its subscriptions by 1.6 million, to 15.1 million. Its
Compuserve service stayed constant at two million members.
</P>
<P>
   Members spent an average of 48 minutes a month online in the
fourth quarter, compared with 41 minutes a year ago. The service
now handles one million simultaneous users at peak periods.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising continued to be increasingly important to the
company, although monthly subscription fees are still its biggest
source of revenue. Subscription revenue in the latest quarter was
$779 million, up 61 percent. Advertising revenue was $126 million,
up 133 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising represented $4.25 per subscriber per month, a sharp
increase from $3.10 per month in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Case, America Online's chief executive, said that he
expected advertising to be increasingly important to the company in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 1 percent of corporate advertising budgets are now spent
on the Internet,'' he said in an interview. ``With more and more
people coming on line and using it heavily, that is bound to
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America Online rose $10.50, to $165.50, with the
earnings released just before the close of trading. The company
also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strong financial position stands in sharp contrast
to its early years in which it largely spent money it did not have.
At the end of 1998, America Online had the equivalent of $1.5
billion in cash reserves. It added about $500 million in cash
Wednesday when it sold its 9.5 percent stake in Excite, the
Internet service that has agreed to be bought by an America Online
rival, the At Home Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Case said that this pool of cash, along with the company's high
stock price, would help it continue to buy related companies. It
agreed to purchase the Netscape Communications Corp. last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $2 billion in cash and our $75 billion in market value
clearly gives us the flexibility to do a lot of things,'' he said,
declining to be specific about the company's acquisition plans.
``The question is not what we can do but what we should do to
enhance our position.''

 &HT;    Chandler vs. Elway
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One was the first overall selection in the 1983 NFL
draft and already had accumulated such clout by the age of 22 that
a trade-me-or-else mandate brought an NFL owner to his knees. Bob
Irsay kicked and screamed, but, yes, he relented and traded the
rights to Stanford quarterback John Elway from Baltimore to Denver.
One franchise burns; the other is reborn.
</P>
<P>
   The other quarterback had two things in common with Elway. Chris
Chandler also had a nice career at a Pac-10 school, Washington, and
he also was drafted by the Colts who by then had moved west to
Indianapolis but were in their same rut. But Chandler was selected
75 spots lower than Elway and wasn't in a position to mandate
anything. He started 13 games as a rookie with mixed success and
was injured in his second season. Fans without a Triptik had to
struggle to follow his career: Tampa Bay, Phoenix, Los Angeles,
Houston, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``That usually happens to most people when you don't get drafted
high,'' Chandler said Wednesday, four days before his career
highlight, the Super Bowl start for the Falcons against Elway and
Denver. ``Teams usually aren't going to let you struggle for very
long. It's not just me. There are a lot of guys out there, given an
opportunity, who would be wonderful players in this league.
Unfortunately, an opportunity is the hardest thing to get. Playing
well at this level is the second-hardest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's career progress is reflected in the debate, by some
people, over which team has the better quarterback in Sunday's
game. Elway is a certain Hall of Famer, has won a Super Bowl,
played in four and is the centerpiece of an offense that set
franchise records for touchdowns and total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But he has come a long way from his rookie season, when he threw
twice as many interceptions (14) as touchdowns. His coach at the
time, Dan Reeves, now says: ``You always think a rookie
quarterback's going to struggle a little. But when I named him as
the starter, I didn't realize it would be as difficult as it was. I
wouldn't have started him if I had known he was going to struggle
like that. I think he also got butterflies.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvement was immediate but not dramatic. In his next two
seasons, Elway threw 40 touchdowns and 38 interceptions. No other
NFL quarterback could be so spectacular and also resemble a train
wreck, all on the same play. But Reeves wasn't about to make a
change. Elway could make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I stood there watching him,
thinking, 'No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes,''' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started him because I thought he was the best player who
gave us the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Given several chances to fail, Elway eventually spiraled into
the NFL's elite. For 16 years, he has played in the same city. In
11 seasons, Chandler has bounced around six times before landing
somewhere that is more than a stopover. Injuries might have played
a part in his early career problems. But Chandler also thinks that
he, like others, has had his development hurt by negative
perceptions, impatient coaches and general managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a lot of places where there wasn't much of a
supporting cast,'' Chandler said. ``And it just takes some time
before you can really become a good quarterback. Unfortunately,
with the win-now philosophy and free-agency, quarterbacks have to
play really well those first one or two years or they'll bring
somebody else in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to opportunity,'' he said. ``You have to be able
to make mistakes and learn from them. It took me 11 years to make
it to my first playoff game. The older a guy gets, the more
comfortable he feels and the quicker he makes decisions on where to
throw the football. Throwing the football isn't hard; it's learning
where to throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway can relate to Chandler's early struggles. But one key to
their contrasting developments is that Chandler started 45 games in
his first seven seasons and Elway started 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing a rookie quarterback is lacking is
experience,'' Elway said. ``You come out of college football, you
go into the preseason as a rookie, and you think it's not that big
of a jump between the college and pro level because the preseason
is very basic for everybody. But once you kick it off in the first
regular-season game, that's when you start seeing everything.
Defenses are a lot more complicated. All the athletes are as good
as the best athletes you played with in college. It just takes
awhile to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway also said, ``When I was younger, I relied so much on my
physical abilities to make plays. I would have loved to have been
in this offense that I'm in now for the last 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway and Chandler both have leaned on famous male family
members in tough times. Elway said that his father, Jack Elway, the
former Stanford coach and the Broncos' director of pro scouting,
``was always the guy I went to when I was struggling and had
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler has sought advice from his father-in-law, John Brodie,
the former San Francisco quarterback. ``He has a way of making me
feel good about what I can do on a football field,'' Chandler said.
``And I thought his career was good from Day 1, all 17 years worth.
I didn't know about (the 49ers) bringing in different quarterbacks.
He didn't bloom, either, until his late 20s or early 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler reacts to adversity far better now than he did early in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I was probably the worst guy at handling it,''he
said. ``Talk about being immature. I became the effect of things
that happened to me that were totally out of my control. As a young
guy, I said things in the media I shouldn't have said. I pouted. It
was the wrong way to handle it. But maybe that was part of my deal.
I had to go through that and learn how to handle it. Everything up
to that point had gone so well in college and everything. Maybe I
needed that slap in the face to grow up.''

STANFORD IS BIG TREE IN PACIFIC-10 FOREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pac-10 title race could be over before the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Not officially _ and certainly not in the worrisome world of
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery, who seems convinced the title won't
be won until the final buzzer of the final game on the final
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But to everyone else, Stanford could secure the crown this
weekend with a sweep of the Arizona schools and a UCLA loss at
Washington State (tonight) or Washington (Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   A desert sweep would push Stanford to 9-0 at the turn, with
Arizona a minimum of three games back. If the Bruins lose, they'll
also be three games back. Both teams make February visits to Maples
Pavilion, where Stanford is almost unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win both our games, it would still be a race,'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said of the Bruins' Washington trip. ``But
(Stanford) would go a long way towards helping (its) cause in
securing the Pac-10 by sweeping (Arizona).''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, tonight's Stanford-Arizona game (7:30, Fox Sports
West) is the most important of the season. It makes or breaks the
conference race and puts Stanford's drive to an unbeaten league
season in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wildcats cannot derail Stanford in Tucson, then who?
Where?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Stanford is playing, it will take 40 minutes of
someone's best basketball,'' said Washington coach Bob Bender,
whose Huskies lost to Arizona at the buzzer and to Stanford by
seven points. ``You have to be at optimum performance in every
aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Young or old, big or small, the Wildcats always play well in
McKale Center, and they usually save their best games for Stanford
and UCLA. In center A.J. Bramlett, burly forward Michael Wright and
point guard Jason Terry, Arizona is one of the few teams with
answers for Stanford's Big Three: center Tim Young, power forward
Mark Madsen and point guard Arthur Lee.
</P>
<P>
   More, Bramlett and Terry have unusual insight into Stanford's
psyche, since they were part of Arizona's unsuccessful 1998 drive
to go 18-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry and Bramlett know what Stanford's trying to do,'' Bender
said. ``It's a drama waiting to unfold. It should be a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Oregon coach Ernie Kent, who has faced both combatants: ``I
think (Stanford) has the advantage, even at McKale Center, because
of the maturity of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the nation: It doesn't get much easier for St. John's.
After an overtime loss to No. 2 Duke on Sunday _ the best game of
the season _ and a 75-70 victory at Syracuse on Wednesday, the Red
Storm faces No. 1 Connecticut on Saturday. Talk about a Hell Week.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   The Tank McNamara comic strip has named North Carolina freshman
guard Ron Curry as its annual ``College Sports Jerk of the Year.''
Why Curry? A Virginia native, he reneged on an oral commitment to
attend UVa. and signed with North Carolina. Apparently, Cavs fans
stuffed Tank's ballot box. . . .
</P>
<P>
   You heard it here first: Of the Big Six _ Duke, Connecticut,
Stanford, Maryland, Cincinnati and Kentucky _ Connecticut will be
the first to fall in March. Not enough up front. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Former Oregon State point guard Carson Cunningham made his first
start for Purdue on Saturday and scored 24 points in a victory over
Michigan. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Murray State is functioning just fine without coach
Mark Gottfried, the former UCLA assistant who spent three years
with the Racers. (He's now directing Alabama.) Murray State is 18-2
and has the nation's longest home-court winning streak, 39 games. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern center Evan Eschmeyer's 27 points, 12 rebounds and
10 assists last week marked the first triple-double ever recorded
at Indiana's Assembly Hall. . . .
</P>
<P>
   One fan's midseason All-American team: Duke's Elton Brand,
Miami-Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak, Connecticut's Richard Hamilton,
Arizona's Jason Terry and Auburn's Chris Porter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The nation's most overrated team? Try New Mexico. The Lobos
might be tough at home, but they're 1-4 on the road, their lone
victory coming in overtime at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the Pac-10: Oregon State has beaten Arizona and UCLA
in the same season for the first time since 1990, when Gary Payton
roamed the court. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's last five games have been decided at the buzzer, with
the Wildcats winning three (Washington, Arizona State and Oregon).
. . .
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's win at Louisville was the Pac-10's first road victory
over a top-25 team. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's last three opponents (UCLA and the Washington
schools) were 3 of 45 from 3-point range. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Washington center Todd MacCulloch missed his first shot at Cal,
then made 18 in a row (13 field goals, five free throws). ``I guess
I didn't come ready to play,'' he said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   USC's conference record (2-5) is even worse than it appears when
you consider the Trojans must make the Bay Area, Arizona and
crosstown trips in the second half. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Typical of this trying season, Cal guards Geno Carlisle and
Thomas Kilgore were late to a shootaround last week because their
car wouldn't start. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Oregon State is 4-0 at home and Oregon is 0-4. How
'bout them odds.

 &HT;    Falcons have full-pad practice
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was change-of-pace day Wednesday at the University of
Miami in Coral Gables, as the Falcons held their first full
practice of the week before playing the Broncos on Sunday..
</P>
<P>
   The team practiced for two hours and 15 minutes, and the first
75 minutes were in full pads _ one of the few times in the past
month and half the team has worked out with full contact.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the intensity level began increasing around the team
late Tuesday, as a midnight curfew went into effect for the first
time this week.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, coaches reviewed specifics of the game plan for the
first time with players, and then, after nine days of minimal
contact in the wake of a 30-27 overtime victory against Minnesota
on Jan. 17, the Falcons went full-bore _ minus tackling and
cut-blocking _ for roughly the first half of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was good we were wearing pads for the first
practice, and getting a little bit of hitting in,'' wide receiver
Tony Martin said. ``It's especially good for the linemen and
linebackers to kind of get back in the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Brian Kozlowski and defensive end Lester Archambeau,
who were held out of Monday's light practice for precautionary
reasons with an ankle sprain each, , went the distance, and
appeared fine.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said the team is changing its approach as the
first Super Bowl appearance in team history draws near. ``I thought
we practiced good,'' he said. ``The tempo was good, concentration
was good, all the things you look for were good. You got mistakes,
but that's what practice is for.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a different mood in the hotel lobby Wednesday evening.
Whereas on Sunday and Monday players were straggling in from
roughly 11:30 p.m. to 4 and 5 a.m., almost everybody appeared to be
in their rooms by about 10 or 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is doing a real good job, and we're going to follow his
lead ... getting our rest, eating well, just chilling,''cornerback
Ray Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   The team will follow the same schedule today, and then practice
in shorts, jerseys and helmets on Friday. There will be a brief
walk-through at Pro Player Stadium on Saturday.

NO LINK BETWEEN RADIATION AT NUCLEAR SITE AND THYROID
ABNORMALITIES, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By   MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An intensive study of 3,400 adults who grew up near
the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state, ordered by
Congress after revelations of huge radioactive gas releases there
during the Cold War, has found no difference in thyroid
abnormalities between those estimated to have received high doses
and those believed to have been spared.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are to be released Thursday at a meeting for people
who live near Hanford in south-central Washington state. The main
points of the study were described Wednesday by three people in
Washington who had been briefed on its results.
</P>
<P>
   Thyroid nodules and thyroid cancers, especially in people
exposed when they were children, are among the effects most closely
tied to radiation. A byproduct of nuclear fission is radioactive
iodine, which concentrates in the thyroid gland when humans are
exposed to it. Failing to find a link contradicts expectations that
were widely held when the study was ordered in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The research was independent of the Energy Department, which, as
the successor agency to the Atomic Energy Commission, operates
Hanford. It was performed by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, of
Seattle, acting as a contractor for the Centers for Disease
Control, part of the Department of Health and Human Services. It
was carried out from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   People who were briefed on the study said that researchers
recorded the names of 5,199 people born in the Hanford area from
1940 to 1944 and set out to find them. In the research, 3,441
people were studied intensively, with sonograms and blood tests.
Each subject was examined by two doctors on separate occasions.
Researchers tried to estimate the dose received by each person,
based on such factors as where they grew up and whether their
family grew their own vegetables or kept a cow. Radioactive iodine
decays rapidly, but vegetables picked fresh from areas with
fallout, or milk given by cows that grazed on contaminated grass,
would have higher amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated doses ranged from zero to about 280 rads to the
thyroid. In contrast, in case of civilian power plant accident, the
federal government advises consideration of an evacuation of the
population if the anticipated dose to the thyroid is 25 rads.
</P>
<P>
   People who question the accuracy of the results will probably
look first to the quality of the dose estimates, said Timothy J.
Connor, a leader of the Northwest Environmental Education
Foundation, a nonprofit group in Spokane, who was one of the first
to seek money from Congress for a study of the health effects to be
performed outside the Energy Department. Connor, who was named by
the Centers for Disease Control to an advisory committee that
helped oversee the study, said that he had confidence in the
independence of the researchers. But he said that no matter how
good they were, and how accurate was the earlier data they used,
their ``dose reconstruction'' would not be as precise as doses
recorded from other sources, like medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue, he said, is how the findings of this study would
affect a debate now in progress about a second study planned by
some researchers. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry, a sister agency of the Centers for Disease Control under
the Department of Health and Human Services, would like to monitor
about 14,000 people in the Pacific Northwest for signs of health
damage from Hanford, under a provision of the Superfund law.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department had said that the study's costs were not
justified, but later it proposed such a study to Congress. Congress
instructed the Energy Department to negotiate with the Department
of Health and Human Services on setting priorities nationally on
health worries around nuclear military sites.
</P>
<P>
   The study being released Thursday differs from most
epidemiological studies in its initiative. It was not an
enumeration of people who had been diagnosed with a health problem,
but an attempt to track down an entire population group and
evaluate the health of those in it, sometimes using biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, no military or civilian site is believed
to have emitted nearly as much radioactive iodine as Hanford. One
release was deliberate, in an attempt to study how the material
behaves in the environment and thus to draw conclusions about how
much the former Soviet Union was releasing, and therefore how much
fuel for nuclear weapons it was making. But most of the releases
were simply a result of the frantic haste to build nuclear weapons.
The scale of the releases was not clear until thousands of pages of
government documents were declassified in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The report also drew comparisons with the rates of thyroid
abnormalities for people outside the Hanford area. People briefed
on the report were vague about that finding and said it was not as
significant as the failure to find a correlation between thyroid
health and estimated radiation dose among residents of the Hanford
area.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D.-Ore., whose staff was briefed on the results,
said through an aide that he feared some people would try to use
the findings to argue for reopening a reactor at Hanford. ``I
remain deeply skeptical of the proposition that the world's largest
radioactive waste site does not pose a health risk to the people
that live around it,'' Wyden said.  &QL;

 &HT;    Pope asks for `end to every form of racism'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As Pope John Paul II prepared to serve Communion
with 110,000 faithful Wednesday, a black gospel choir sang out to
the high heavens ``God Gets the Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, the 78-year-old pontiff had gently hugged and
kissed grade-schooler Kristopher Holmes when his handsome black
family knelt to present bread and wine to the Holy Father.
</P>
<P>
   And in his homily, John Paul urged ``an end to every form of
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   After the six-hour Mass and ceremonies concluded and thousands
flowed from the TWA Trans World Dome and the Cervantes Convention
Center, the pope's remarks stirred discussion in the streets about
racism within America's Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we are welcome,'' said V'Ester Hughes, 56, a black
assistant church administrator in a St. Louis parish. ``But they
don't understand that our religion and their religion is the same
but different. We're more lively and some won't accept that kind of
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are really trying but it's hard to get them to open up.
We have to work on it from both ends because blacks carry their
baggage also. We have to meet each other halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 5:30 a.m. blowing of a Jewish shofar, solemn liturgical
organ music, beckoning cantors and soulful spirituals, the
diversity of worship styles in the papal Mass left an impression on
Aaron Henschel, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best Mass I've ever seen. I loved those black
gospel singers,'' said the 31-year-old St. Louis haberdasher. But
Henschel, who said his parish is predominately white, observed that
the church has work to do on race matters. ``I think the Holy
Father was definitely trying to get the point across that he
doesn't want racism in the church, that everybody's got to be
open-minded and your heart has got to be open to everybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Lane, a 54-year-old convert to Catholicism, expressed
pessimism. ``They invite us to their churches and we go and try to
feel we are a part of things,'' she said. ``But there's still
skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   As buses streamed into downtown to return the black and white
faithful to largely separate parts of the city and suburbs, Gerard
Hentrich, 40, a delivery truck driver, said changing racism in the
church is an undertaking that threatens deeply held beliefs. ``In
our church, people do have those basic prejudices. They grew up
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   During the papal Mass, two black priests and a bishop from the
St. Louis archdiocese were among the papal entourage of more than
100 priests, bishops and cardinals. The Rev. Joseph Kempf said the
St. Louis archdiocese of 530,000 registered Catholics has more than
17 a dozen parishes in predominantly black areas and eight
multiracial parishes. Dayton has two black parishes, soon to merge
as St. James Resurrection under the Rev. Freddie Washington. Of the
nation's 61 million Catholics, about 2.3 million are black.
</P>
<P>
   Kempf said the St. Louis archdiocese has several programs to
curb urban sprawl, a problem that also confronts Dayton. ``It's
because of huge exits from the city to the predominately white
suburbs. The Catholic Church is working hard to combat that and the
attitudes that lead to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Catholic schools have worked extremely hard not to
become havens for racism. We don't want people to go to Catholic
schools just because they don't want their kids in school with
blacks, Hispanics or other persons of color.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the Archdiocese of St. Louis made history when it moved
to desegregate Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   From his touchdown at Lambert International Airport on Tuesday
to a planned private meeting Wednesday with civil rights bellwether
Rosa Parks, the pope pointed to America's relentless race problem
more than many church leaders could ever recall. The meeting with
Parks was canceled due to a scheduling conflict, an archdiocese
spokesman said. John Paul left Wednesday evening to return to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The pope came to St. Louis by way of a mission of unity. He
stopped here on his return from Mexico City where he presented the
final document of the Synod for America, intended to guide the
Roman Catholic Church in the Americas into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Its goals: to evangelize based on the dignity of human life; to
increase relations between churches of the northern and southern
continents; and to foster social justice.
</P>
<P>
   The pope continued the theme of unity at his final ceremony
Wednesday evening at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, where
representatives of many faiths _ Judaism, Hinduism, Seventh-day
Adventists _ joined him in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   And as his fifth major U.S. visit came to a close, Midwesterners
of all hues expressed an awe and love for the man who leads their
common heritage of faith, a man who seemed greater than himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pilgrimage to be here with him and this many with
like views, from all different races, all different walks of
life,'' said Kathy Miller, 48, of Cleveland, Mo. ``But we all say
the same Mass. The pope is our leader, our guiding light.''
</P>
<P>
   People who had arrived as early as 1:30 a.m. to wait outside the
Dome stood blank-faced in the avenues, struggling to find a word to
express their spiritual experience, a Mass with the pope. They
never found it. So they settled for ``sublime,'' ``ultimate,''
``incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a connectedness of the community, being together
with our leader who is such a great leader,'' said Christopher
Dunn, 27, of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it. This is the essence,'' said Nancy Eaton, 40.
``This is the closest to God that you will ever get on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a bittersweetness that the aging pontiff, who
appeared weary throughout the day, leaning heavily on his staff and
coughing as he read prayers, might not pass this way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I believe he will lead us into the next
millennium. In my heart, I don't believe God is going to call him
home yet,'' said Jack Thompson, a retiree from Newburg, Ind. ``But
he won't be able to travel as much.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it may be farewell, John Paul.

<P>
   Sports has an odd way of sending people packing, and then
landing them on their feet. So six players who thought their
careers had stalled on the Jets find themselves in the Super Bowl.
Three play for the defending champion Broncos, three for the
underdog Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Bubby Brister, backup quarterback to John Elway, starting
linebacker Glenn Cadrez and backup defensive end Marvin Washington
are former Jets who play for Denver. Atlanta's starting wide
receivers, Terance Mathis and Tony Martin, along with backup
offensive lineman Adam Schreiber were also with the Jets. In
addition, Greg Robinson, the Broncos' defensive coordinator, and Ed
Donatell, who coaches their defensive backs, were Jet assistant
coaches under Pete Carroll, who was fired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was the only player in the group to experience the
1-15 season of 1996, which led to Coach Rich Kotite's departure and
the arrival of Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the inevitable question about learning from adversity,
Washington had a quick answer Wednesday. ``Yeah, you learn how to
lose,'' he said. ``It helps you not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington performed with the Jets from 1989 to 1996 and went to
the playoffs only once. He was among the first group of veterans
Parcells let go, but moved on to San Francisco in 1997 and to
Denver this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ring would validate some of the things I did,'' Washington
said of his long journey to a Super Bowl. He was a starter for the
Jets, but is a backup now at the age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed it worked out for both of us,'' he said of Parcells'
decision to cut him.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate, Cadrez, played for three Jet coaches in three-plus
seasons: in 1992 and 1993 for Bruce Coslet, then for Carroll, and
finally for Kotite. None of them made him a starter. ``New coaches,
new defenses, but the same result,'' Cadrez said. ``I was going to
be the swing guy. I wanted something more for my career.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish late in the 1995 season, when the Jets cut him.
Cincinnati wanted him, but he decided to wait for a better offer.
Finally, he decided to sign with Houston. En route to the Oilers,
the Broncos paged him. This season they made him the starting
middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be the first one to tell you I wasn't as good a player
with the Jets,'' he said. ``But I didn't have to be. I started from
my second game in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   And here is Brister, backing up Elway, whose appearance against
the Falcons will probably be his last game. If so, then Brister has
the inside track on taking over the Broncos' quarterback position
next season.
</P>
<P>
   For Brister, 1996 ``seemed like the end of the line'' following
the Jets' 1995 season of 3-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceived me and what the record was as one and the
same,'' he said of that season, his only one with the Jets. No one
called him in 1996, and he sat out the year. He used much of it to
be with his father, who has prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, Bill Romanowski, the Broncos' linebacker, called
Brister and told him there was going to be a backup spot available.
Brister tried out, made the team, and eventually moved from third-
to second-string. This season he even started four games when Elway
was injured _ and was the winner each time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Brister said, the season he spent with the Jets was useful.
``You can share it with young people, that they take the good with
the bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, charitably, ``I'm happy the Jets turned it around.''
He has his own agenda now. ``I'm going to prepare in this off
season as if Elway's going to retire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis started only one game for the Jets between 1990 and 1993.
He became a star receiver after becoming a Falcon, and he and
Martin each produced more than 1,000 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a big story to play the Jets in the Super
Bowl with Tony and I,'' Mathis said, ``but it became a bigger story
with Dan Reeves against the Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   Those four years in New York he describes as ``great,'' saying:
``I enjoyed it in the spring and summertime, and it gave me an
opportunity to prepare myself. I learned a lot of patience. Al Toon
told me just take your time. The opportunity will come. And as you
see, it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a fifth-round draft pick by the Jets in 1989,
converted from quarterback to receiver, and never got into a
regular-season game. He was cut before the 1990 season and became a
Bronco after playing for Miami and San Diego. He went to the Super
Bowl with the Chargers four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not making it on the Jets made me work harder,'' he said. ``It
made me think more about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning, looking out the window after he woke up, he said
he thought: ``I can't believe it. I'm in the Super Bowl again in
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schreiber, who sees action mostly as the long snapper on the
Falcons, his Jets years ``were just a stepping stone to the rest of
my career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a positive,'' he said. ``What I remember about
that 1988 season was that we played the Giants and we knocked them
off. I'm proud to say I was a Jet.''

SHANAHAN DOES CROSSWORD PUZZLES IN INK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Terrell Davis is splendid, John Elway is like fine wine
and Bill Romanowski leads a ferocious defense. But with the Denver
Broncos, they are chess pieces in Coach Mike Shanahan's head, to be
artfully used on game day.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Broncos' success since 1995 can be traced directly
to the hiring of Shanahan, who seems to be an all-in-one boss. He
is a distinguished offensive mind, but he also oversees the team's
defense, drafts players, makes trades and negotiates contracts.
</P>
<P>
   All with one pursuit in mind _ perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not late for meetings, we're not late for lifting
weights, we practice plays until we get them right,'' offensive
tackle Tony Jones said. ``Everything has to be dead on schedule or
Mike lets us know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bowlen loves the mind-set that Shanahan has created with his
players. As the Broncos' owner tells it, one of the team's charter
flights earlier this season was a minute late departing.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was mad.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who has been known to script his family's
vacations down to the minute of each day. While an assistant coach
at the University of Florida in the early 1980s, he would insist
that his quarterbacks redraw a diagram whenever they had the line
of scrimmage crooked.
</P>
<P>
   And he is never without felt-tipped pens, better to scheme up
yet another play or think of another slogan to post in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him the Mastermind,'' linebacker John Mobley said. ``He
always seems two or three steps ahead of everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran safety Steve Atwater even believes the ``genius''
label fits Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer I'm around him, the more I realize he's a guy who
knows football inside and out,'' Atwater said. ``If there's a
situation, no matter what it is, he knows how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The man with the icy glare has created distinguished offenses
everywhere he has been _ and particularly at Florida, in stints as
offensive coordinator with the Broncos and then the San Francisco
49ers and during the past three seasons as head coach at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are 43-10 during his tenure, including 16-2 heading
into Sunday's Super Bowl against the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan admits to having a risk-taking side. He has
bungee-jumped, experimented with hang gliding and this past
Christmas bought a motorcycle. But in his football work he tries to
take all the risk out of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run our plays in practice to be perfect,'' Jones said.
``It's no, `We'll get it next week' or `We'll get it next year.' We
run every play to be a perfect play. That's what makes our offense
so good. We go out there knowing that every play has to be like the
last play _ perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, the team's 38-year-old quarterback, said Shanahan won't
yell at him, possibly in deference to his distinguished career, but
often will use the offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak to get his
message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, `What's he thinking?' '' Elway said, chuckling softly.
Still, the quarterback calls Shanahan a players' coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't necessarily mean he has to be buddy-buddy,''
Elway said. ``A players' coach is a coach the players like, but
he's not buddy-buddy with anybody. He's the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who two years ago volunteered to begin having a buffet
breakfast served to his players before meetings after he saw too
many of them eating junk food, accepts the players' coach tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you do the little things for people, they know, and
they'll do them for you,'' he said Wednesday. ``In return, when the
game is on the line and you're asking them to do something they
might not want to do, then they want to do it for you because they
know you care about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got markedly easier for Elway after Shanahan landed a
standout runner in Davis and a much-improved defense, headed by
Romanowski, a linebacker, to stay in games.
</P>
<P>
   Add the coach's bent toward perfection and you have a possible
repeat Super Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants everything pure and crisp before we play a game,''
Mobley said. ``If it's not, believe me, he'll demand it.''

POPE URGES U.S. TO END DEATH PENALTY, RACISM 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Pope John Paul II called for Americans to do away
with the death penalty, end racism and uphold the family as the
foundation of society Wednesday, the final day of his six-day
pastoral trip to this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating Mass before 100,000 people, the pope said, ``Modern
society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively
denying criminals the chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made
most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death
penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics pilgrims, many of whom traveled hundreds of miles and
waited six hours to be part of the Mass, cheered and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Although fewer in number, the crowd seemed no less enthusiastic
than the 1 million people the pope attracted to a Mass in Mexico
City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, there are more than 3,510 people on death
row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. At 6 p.m.
CST Tuesday, just hours after the pope flew into St. Louis from
Mexico City, death row inmate Martin Vega was executed by injection
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a planned execution in St. Louis, which would have
occurred during the papal visit, was postponed by the Missouri
Supreme Court until Feb. 10 after officials realized the dates
coincided. A Vatican official called the postponement a
``mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Mass, John Paul II urged believers to envision the new
millennium as a time to preach ``the truth that the gospel of God's
love for man, the gospel of the dignity of the person and the
(Christian) gospel'' are one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of God's gift of life
and love?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The pope offered wayward Catholics, apparently including
divorced people, an olive branch, urging they return to the church.
``Christ is seeking you out and inviting you back to the community
of faith,'' he said, assuring even people who may be barred from
taking communion of ``God's love and mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the church ``looks forward to the millennium as a time
of far-reaching spiritual renewal,'' bringing ``a new springtime of
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   A buoyant, cheering crowd welcomed his arrival at the Trans
World Dome in the bulletproof popemobile. The overflow faithful
watched on jumbo television screens in adjoining halls.
</P>
<P>
   Concelebrating Mass with the pope were 1,000 priests and 200
cardinals and bishops who assembled on an altar stage located
beneath a 45-foot aluminum copy of the Gateway Arch, St. Louis'
famous landmark. Built in 1965, the 630-foot arch celebrates the
city's 19th-century role as a gateway to westward expansion.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 131,000 communion wafers, baked by local nuns, were
distributed. A large choir sang, backed up by an orchestra of local
symphony artists.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour service, considered among one of the largest indoor
Masses in U.S. history, included a colorful procession of vested
clergy, acolytes and banners. There was the pungent smell of
incense, the wide-eyed stares of toddlers and the tear-streaked
faces of young nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Lay people, including several women, read Scripture. A
multiethnic procession of African-American, Hispanic, Vietnamese
and Anglo families brought forth the communion elements, presenting
them to the pontiff. He blessed each presenter, reaching around a
father to ruffle the hair of one frightened little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Music echoing from many corners of Catholicism's culturally
diverse, 1-billion-member worldwide flock wafted through the Mass.
Especially upbeat was the pre-communion hymn by the Papal Gospel
Choir with a shoulder-swaying lead singer belting out, ``God Gets
the Glory!''
</P>
<P>
   Because the papal Mass was broadcast throughout the world, the
litany of prayers was offered in English, Spanish, German, French,
Vietnamese and Polish, John Paul II's native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims rose as early as 2 a.m. to gulp down breakfast and then
board buses to downtown St. Louis to the cavernous Trans World
Dome, which rises 204 feet high and covers 14 acres. Many came by
car or bus from other Midwestern states such as Illinois and Ohio.
Others drove even farther, determined to see the frail, 78-year-old
pontiff on what many believe will be his last visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the dome, eager, but hungry Mass goers had lined up 25
deep to buy bratwurst by 3 a.m. A vendor had sold 60 pounds by 9
a.m. and had another 180 pounds roasting to sell after the Mass
ended.
</P>
<P>
   On the corner of Tucker and Olive streets, just a few blocks
from the dome, 24-year-old Brian Decker had been waiting since 4:30
a.m. to fulfill somebody else's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandparents always wanted to see the pope and they died
before they got the chance,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was a factory worker, my grandmother was a
homemaker. Grandad was in the Knights of Columbus, my Grandma
cleaned the church, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   They had been trying to save money for a trip to Rome, Decker
said, but life always got in the way. And when his grandfather was
diagnosed with cancer, his treatment wiped out the travel fund.
Decker's grandfather died in 1994 and his grandmother followed him
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   So when the pontiff came speeding around the corner in the
popemobile _ almost a blur, but only 20 feet away _ Decker whooped,
his face flushed bright red, and he wept a little for George and
Anna Fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to fulfill the dreams of those who came before
you,'' Decker said. ``I'm here for them as much as myself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toni Turner is not a Catholic, and didn't have tickets for any
of the papal events, but was excited enough about the pope's visit
that she and her family stayed in a downtown hotel Wednesday night
to ensure they could get to the parade route in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you surprised there aren't more people?'' she asked.
``I think the media coverage (predicting gridlock) is a huge reason
people don't turn out for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the throngs who clustered in Mexico City for John Paul
II's motorcade, crowds were relatively sparse in St. Louis for the
pope's motorcade to-and-from the dome. Many city residents had the
day off from work, and the weather was so unseasonably warm _ a
balmy 58 degrees, 37 degrees higher than normal _ that one local
morning TV reporter kept urging residents to turn out for a glimpse
of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch with cardinals and bishops at St. Louis Archbishop
Justin Rigali's residence, John Paul II attended an evening prayer
service at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. Some 90
non-Catholic religious leaders were invited and a rabbi read a
Scripture passage.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic vespers service stressed the pontiff's continuing
commitment to interfaith cooperation, a theme emphasized here and
in Mexico, even though he also warned Catholics not to be wooed
away by evangelical Protestant sects.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff gave a brief address at the Cathedral Basilica of
St. Louis, thanking the city, the state and the nation for its
hospitality before traveling by limousine to Lambert St. Louis
International Airport. There he met briefly with Vice President Al
Gore, who also was present at the vespers service. At the airport,
Gore saw him off on his departure flight to Rome.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican and Democratic leaders met into
the evening on Wednesday with their top lieutenants as they tried
to hash out a bipartisan agreement that would map out the
questioning of witnesses in the coming days and perhaps pinpoint a
target date to conclude the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But by evening, after a day of swapping proposals back and
forth, the two sides were still wrangling over details, with at
least two major sticking points thwarting progress.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides planned to present the plan, even if it is
unfinished, to their caucuses on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were pushing for a specific date to end the trial,
while wanting some flexibility for the White House if it chooses to
call witnesses, and for videotaped testimony of witnesses, in lieu
of live appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans dismissed setting a specific deadline as too
rigid, especially since House managers have not yet deposed the
three witnesses on the list and do not know what they will say. And
they were hesitant to preclude the appearance of live witnesses,
preferring to vote on that separately after the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaping, said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., means that ``you
have another option, that's all that means.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, told
reporters in the late afternoon that he did not anticipate that the
trial would extend beyond Feb. 12, which is when the Senate is
scheduled to adjourn for a one-week break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to move forward and make good progress that
would lead us to an expeditious conclusion, but one that will give
us the facts that we need to get to what the truth is,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott indicated he would like to see the depositions of the three
witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal _
finished by Monday. The tentative schedule calls for Ms. Lewinsky
and Blumenthal to be interviewed on Sunday, and Jordan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the press briefing, Lott also mentioned that Republicans were
bandying about dates for a swift conclusion to the trial. But, in a
sign of just how fluid the negotiations proved to be, a short while
later Sen. Thomas Daschle, the minority leader, received back a
proposal that included no date for a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also made it clear early on that they would reject any
inclusion of a ``finding of fact'' resolution in the agreement,
said a Democratic leadership aide. Under that resolution, the
Senate would decide whether Clinton lied under oath and obstructed
justice, but would not formally convict him under Senate rules.
Then the Senate would move to a separate vote on whether to remove
Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have been promoting the proposal for several
days. ``We think there will be a very large group of senators that
would want to vote on that, regardless of how they are going to
vote on final passage,'' said Domenici, who is co-chairing a task
force to explore and write the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said on Wednesday that Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., was finalizing a censure resolution so that even if
Clinton were acquitted, senators would not be viewed as having
condoned his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding from Senator Daschle is that we will be
allowed to present a censure resolution at an appropriate time,''
Ms. Feinstein said, suggesting the proposal would be offered after
the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate leaders met on Wednesday, two proposals floated around
the Senate addressed the issue of depositions, one of them
sponsored by Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., another written by Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders worked on their own separate drafts, but were
considering some of the ideas in the two proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee's proposal includes giving the lawyers for both sides a
total of 6 hours, 3 hours each, to question witnesses, allowing one
senator from each side to sit in on the interviews and videotaping
the interview so that other senators can view them later.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, a second proposal, a bipartisan one, was
circulating on how to handle depositions, this one sponsored by
Brownback and Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   Under that proposal, the White House must state by 5 p.m.
Saturday whether it wants to question witnesses in response to the
House managers' depositions. It also calls for no live witnesses,
only video presentations of witnesses that would be made available
to senators on Feb. 1. A Senate vote on the two articles would
occur by 5 p.m. the following Friday, Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Those dates would be pushed back if the White House decided to
depose its own witnesses, and the trial would culminate in a Feb.
11 vote on the articles.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and a White
House ally, said that if the three witnesses make no new
revelations, then there was no need for Clinton's lawyers to pursue
their own witnesses or reams of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., agreed. ``We want to be fair to the
White House but this goal that has been stated ad nauseum for weeks
to finish it up quickly will be delayed if the White House decides
they want to have a bunch of witnesses,'' he said. ``But it's
really up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats and Republicans fail to reach agreement on the
depositions, Republicans could still move forward with their plan
by scheduling a simple-majority on it.

SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES BILL TO RAISE MILITARY PAY, INCREASE
BENEFITS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ga., Pa., Miss., Va.)   By ELIZABETH BECKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Challenging the Clinton administration in a bidding
war to give more money to the armed forces, a key Senate committee
Wednesday quickly approved a bill to raise military pay and
increase benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators, hitting hard on a theme that their leaders
say will be a major party issue this year, said this was an attempt
to stanch the daily resignation of hundreds of people from the
military services.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and the new chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, which approved the bill, said improving the pay
and benefits of members of the armed services was his first
priority for increased defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration proposal calls for a 4.4 percent
salary increase, while the Senate bill would provide a 4.8 percent
increase. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., promoted
his committee's bill at a breakfast speech Wednesday before the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, calling it a top Republican priority this
session.
</P>
<P>
   To show its commitment to the issue, the committee took it out
of a larger defense authorization bill and put it on a track to
reach the floor as soon as the impeachment trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we don't send a message, we're going to lose
people,'' Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said at a news conference
announcing the measure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the lineup of senators at the event demonstrated that they
were thinking of more than the disappointed members of the armed
services. No Democrat member of the committee was invited to
attend, even though the bill has bipartisan support and that its
the measures to improve educational benefits were first offered by
Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's announcement that he was ``not satisfied'' with the pay
and benefit increases offered by the Clinton administration came
one day before Secretary of Defense William Cohen was expected to
push the administration's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was unanimous support of all the Democrats on the
committee for the pay increase and benefits and the need to address
the issue up front and move on it,'' Cleland said. ``And believe it
or not, the administration proposal and this bill are very
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland protested that the procedure for moving on the bill
was highly unusual and belied the bill's bipartisan support. In one
day, without hearings, the Senate Armed Services Committee marked
up the bill and passed it out of committee without holding hearings
on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill at the center of this political tug-of-war would
provide a pay increase for all service members on July 1, 2000. It
would also provide merit pay increases of up to 10.3 percent for
mid-career noncommissioned and commissioned officers, the service
members whose departure for higher paying civilian jobs is of
special concern to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Like the administration proposal, the Senate bill would revamp
the retirement system and restore the 50 percent base retirement
pay for uniformed men and women that was reduced in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The new education benefits written by Cleland would eliminate
the $1,200 contribution required of military members who use the GI
bill and, if approved by the Defense Department, would allow
service members to pass their unused education benefits to a member
of their immediate family, much like frequent flier miles can be.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would also give service members a thrift savings
plan, which is not in the administration plan.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the bill would provide special help for the poorest
members of the armed services, promising a $180 increase in monthly
pay for families who are eligible for food stamps. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., deplored the fact that 11,000 military families
receive food stamps and said this provision was designed to end
that ``disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Another committee member, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said in a
statement that ``the Republican majority on the committee
incorporated many of the important provisions from the more
comprehensive bill introduced by Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But like his Republican colleagues, Robb said that the thrust of
the bill was to send ``a strong signal to our most important
military asset _ our men and women in uniform and their families.''

MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE DEFENDS FOLDING BROWSER INTO WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By STEVE LOHR   AND AMY HARMON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior executive of Microsoft Corp. delivered a
forceful defense of the company's actions in the Internet software
market Wednesday, saying it had acted mainly in the pursuit of a
``Holy Grail of software development'' by making its products more
powerful, easier to use and seamlessly integrated.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, James Allchin, the second company official to
appear as a witness at the Microsoft antitrust trial, also argued
that other software makers have done what the government says is
anticompetitive in Microsoft's case and presented a detailed
history of his company's product plans for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In his 139-page written testimony, Allchin repeatedly struck the
theme that the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft
are making an ill-advised effort to tamper with innovation and
product design in a leading high-technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a lawyer or an economist,'' Allchin wrote, ``but I do
not understand how a company's efforts to improve its products can
ever be `anticompetitive.'''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Allchin, a senior vice president in charge of
the technical development of the company's Windows operating
system, is a salvo in Microsoft's legal fight with the government
over how the lawsuit is framed, which is crucial to the outcome of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says its decision to bundle its Internet Explorer
browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system and
give the browser away free was a straightforward product-design
decision that benefits consumers. But the government alleges that
those moves represent the abuse of Microsoft's monopoly power to
thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   Most antitrust experts say that Microsoft's strongest defense is
to frame the case as a debate over its product decisions. Indeed,
in a related case, a federal appeals court ruled last June that
Microsoft has the right to bundle its browser with Windows, warning
of ``the undesirability of having courts oversee product design.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government views Microsoft's bundling decision as simply
one step in a pattern of what it regards as predatory business
practices intended to stifle competition. The prosecution case,
according to antitrust experts, is strengthened by framing the
courtroom debate around Microsoft's business practices and
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial on Wednesday, the government kept that focus in its
third day of cross-examining Microsoft's first executive witness,
Paul Maritz, trying to show that the company pressured the Intel
Corp. to stop developing technology that conflicted with
Microsoft's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is mainly a producer of the microprocessor chips that
serve as the ``electronic brain'' of most PC's, but it also
develops software. Microsoft's conflict with Intel in 1995 centered
on Intel's work on multimedia software called native signal
processing, or NSP.
</P>
<P>
   Intel wanted to distribute its NSP software to PC makers, but it
pulled back after protests from Microsoft. The government alleges
that Microsoft muscled both Intel and the computer makers not to
adopt any software that conflicted with Microsoft's plans.
Microsoft replies that Intel stepped back on its own, after
realizing that there were problems with its NSP software.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department pointed to internal Microsoft e-mail to
try to show that the big software maker did pressure Intel and the
industry. An Oct. 18, 1995, e-mail to Maritz, written by William H.
Gates, Microsoft chairman, said that Intel felt PC makers were
resisting Intel's software because of ``our NSP chill.'' Later,
Gates added, ``If Intel is not sticking totally to its part of the
deal, let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ask Mr. Gates, `What bargain are you talking about?
What deal are you talking about?''' David Boies, the Justice
Department's lead trial lawyer, asked Maritz.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz, the senior executive in charge of most software
development and marketing at Microsoft, replied that he had not.
But he maintained that Intel ultimately abandoned NSP because it
was technically flawed and would not work with recent versions of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In what Boies portrayed as another example of Microsoft
attempting to co-opt or pressure potential competitors, he also
questioned Maritz about the company's investment in Real Networks
Inc., a developer of software that allows audio and video to be
transmitted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz acknowledged that executives from Real Networks, then
known as Progressive Networks, told Microsoft in 1997 that if
Microsoft invested in the company, it would shift its business to
other kinds of software and services to avoid competing. But Maritz
noted that Real Networks continues to compete with Microsoft
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   A Real Networks spokesman said Tuesday that the company never
agreed to get out of the streaming media business. Microsoft is in
the process of selling its 10 percent stake in Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   In his lengthy written testimony, Allchin cited a series of
Microsoft e-mail messages from late 1993 and early 1994 intended to
show that the company was broadly planning to make access to the
Internet an integral part of its Windows operating system even
before Netscape had emerged as a genuine rival.
</P>

 &HT;    Party-line vote subpoenas 3
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky and two presidential confidants
will answer questions from House prosecutors in the latest phase of
President Clinton's impeachment trial, as party-line votes
Wednesday indicate the Senate is well short of the two-thirds
support needed to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 56-44 to subpoena Lewinsky, Washington lawyer
Vernon Jordan and Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal. It rejected,
44-56, a proposal to dismiss the two articles of impeachment that
charge Clinton lied to a federal grand jury and obstructed justice
in covering up his illicit relationship with the 25-year-old former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said he hoped
private, sworn interviews, or depositions, could take place this
weekend or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott forecast an end to the trial within about two weeks,
although many Democrats predicted a much longer trial now that the
Senate has opened the door to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate quit for the day without an agreement on how to
proceed, hung up on thorny issues such as who should conduct the
depositions, how long they should last and whether they should be
videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans tried to downplay the partisan outcome of
Wednesday's votes, characterizing them as reasonable attempts to
allow House prosecutors to make their case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) was the only senator to vote with
the opposite party on either question.
</P>
<P>
   To dismiss the case before witnesses would ``improperly
short-circuit this trial,'' Feingold said. He is one of several
senators who have indicated that the obstruction charges against
Clinton are more troubling than the perjury allegations.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Republicans and Democrats mainly jostled over
whom to blame should the trial drag on. Democrats insisted
Wednesday's votes demonstrated that Republicans were now
responsible for any delays, while Republicans said the pressure was
now on the White House to limit or even drop altogether any
requests to call its own witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many Republicans acknowledged the interviews
probably would not produce a ``lightning bolt discovery,'' as Lott
put it. Lack of such a bombshell will likely allow the Senate to
avoid the full-blown trial that the prosecutors _ 13 Republican
members of the House Judiciary Committee _ badly want.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho) said Republicans nonetheless wanted
to make sure they don't end the trial and then read the rest of the
story about Clinton in ``Monica's memoirs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this process has always been about is not getting votes,
but getting the truth,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats and the White House, pointing to the numbers in
the two votes, insisted the Senate would not remove Clinton from
office and questioned why Republicans are determined to pursue the
trial. Sixty-seven of the 100 senators would have to vote to
convict Clinton to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-four senators have now voted to dismiss the articles of
impeachment. The president will not be removed from office,''
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said. ``For the good of
the country, and in keeping with the Constitution, it is time to
end the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Striking a similar note, White House lawyer Gregory Craig said,
``Any proceedings from this date forward only serve to delay the
final resolution of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig's brief prepared statement omitted talk of a lengthy
delay Clinton's lawyers previously said they would insist on if the
Senate opened the trial to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors expressed optimism that they could persuade the
Senate to take the next step toward a full trial, calling witnesses
to the floor of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of hurdles to get over before we get
live witnesses, but I am hopeful,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.)
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) was one of several prosecutors who
complained the Senate hasn't given them enough leeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair? It is not a word that comes to mind,'' Barr said. ``To
say it is frustrating would be a gross understatement. The
limitations that are being placed on us every time you turn around
are clearly designed to thwart a true trial. There is no way that I
can explain why this is being done that makes any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the clear thrust _ on the Senate floor and in conversations
in and around the Capitol _ was to prevent the kind of partisan
rancor that plagued the impeachment proceedings in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republican senators, all of whom agreed to witnesses,
there was considerable skepticism they would learn anything new
from the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be shocked if anything of substance comes out of the
depositions,'' Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans and Democrats in the Senate harbored the
hope that Clinton's defense team would withhold its demand to
question potential witnesses who might help the president or to
pore over the 56,000 pages of unreleased material in independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's submission to Congress. Members of the
House had access to that material during the Judiciary Committee's
impeachment investigation and subsequent vote on the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what the White House is saying, they want this
trial to get over with, don't they?'' asked Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), one of the more outspoken opponents of
Clinton's impeachment, suggested the Senate would work out a speedy
end to the trial, despite Wednesday's party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to end this thing soon, within a certain period of
time,'' Harkin said. ``Everyone agrees on that. How to get there is
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks about procedure _ often as important in the Senate as the
outcome on an issue _ even extended to a Capitol Hill health club,
where Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) delayed an early morning squash
game to discuss a proposal with Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   The two senators have been working on a plan initially advanced
by Sen. John Chaffee (R-R.I.) to limit each deposition to six
hours, include a senator from each party in the questioning and
allow the interview to be videotaped. Senators would be able to
view the videotapes early next week.
</P>
<P>
   A separate proposal by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and other
GOP senators would allow a two-tiered final vote, using a
nonbinding resolution to state that the president lied to the grand
jury and obstructed justice, then voting ``up or down'' on the
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While several Republicans have expressed interest in this
approach _ recognizing a lack of support to convict Clinton _
Democrats were vehement in their opposition. ``It is so
unconstitutional,'' an exasperated Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to talk up a proposal to censure Clinton
once the trial ends. Republicans remained unenthusiastic about that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   When senators arrived at the Capitol on Wednesday, Republican
leaders were pushing hard for a Feb. 6 end to the trial. But Lott
said late Wednesday that Feb. 6 seemed unrealistic, since the
Senate's closing deliberations alone would consume nearly three
days. Each senator is entitled to speak for 15 minutes, under
Senate rules.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he hoped the trial could end by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   One senator who sat through last year's House proceedings as a
member of the Judiciary Committee cautioned against putting too
much faith in a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who believes they can predict how it will play out
hasn't looked at the history of the past six months,'' newly
elected Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said.

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The U.S. Olympic Committee, divided
about the future of Juan Antonio Samaranch, is exploring ideas
about the restructuring of the International Olympic Committee,
including recommendations for term limits and democratic elections
by outsiders, American officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   USOC officials have not called for the resignation of Samaranch,
president of the IOC, but neither have they given him an
unequivocal endorsement. Bill Hybl, president of the USOC, has said
Samaranch's future is a matter for the IOC to decide. Privately,
American officials are saying the IOC needs to be more accountable
and representative.
</P>
<P>
   One way to achieve that, said officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity, is to have IOC members elected for fixed terms by the
198 national Olympic committees worldwide, with input from
international sports federations.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, IOC members are recommended by Samaranch and the
IOC's 11-person executive board, and voted on by the entire
assembly of delegates, which numbers 106 after dismissals and
resignations in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. Several IOC
members serve for life, but most are bound to an age limit of 80.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, investigators said they had found no evidence
that Alfredo La Mont, who resigned recently as the USOC's director
of international relations, passed money along, as he said he did,
in exchange for information about the attitudes among Olympic
officials in Central and South America toward Salt Lake City's bid
on the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that La Mont told them he received money from
Tom Welch, president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, in the
early 1990s and passed it to a friend in Mexico in exchange for
information. Investigators said they were trying to determine
whether La Mont kept the money, which may have amounted to $20,000.
A person who answered at La Mont's home said he wasn't speaking to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charles Mukora of Kenya, one of six IOC members
ousted on Sunday, resigned rather than attempt to fight his
expulsion before the full IOC assembly in March.
</P>
<P>
   Mukora, 64, was accused of accepting $34,650 from Salt Lake City
Olympic officials for his personal benefit. He said Wednesday at a
news conference in Nairobi, Kenya, that the money was used for the
establishment of a high altitude training camp and that he did not
receive any funds for personal use. ``I have never been party to
any improper dealings in the last 40 years I have been involved as
a volunteer in Kenyan sports and sports management, or as an IOC
member,'' Mukora said.
</P>
<P>
   Hybl declined to speak Wednesday about Samaranch or
restructuring the IOC. Dick Schultz, executive director of the
USOC, did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   One USOC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Hybl
wanted Samaranch to resign but that it was too delicate politically
to call for that action. Another official said Hybl was not against
Samaranch, but rather had simply put out feelers about possible
restructuring of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Samaranch stuck around and major reforms took place, that's
a better scenario than Samaranch going and no reform taking
place,'' a USOC official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has the most powerful committees, and it is
the home of many of the corporate sponsors who support the Games. A
call by a senior USOC official for Samaranch to resign could
seriously damage his chances of riding out the Salt Lake City
storm. But the USOC has proved hesitant to take bold action in the
recent past, most notably in backing down and allowing Tonya
Harding to compete in the 1994 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas about restructuring the IOC will be discussed at an
executive board meeting of the USOC on Feb. 20, officials said.
They stressed that current discussions were preliminary and that
the USOC was attempting to position itself in case the IOC does not
ratify the expulsion of six dismissed IOC members in March or if it
begins to implode when ousted members begin pointing fingers at
their accusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the IOC is making a very solid attempt to get to
the bottom of the problem,'' a USOC official said. ``But if the
press and the public and the sponsors come back and say they didn't
do enough, we need to be prepared to say, `OK, how about this?'''

   ATLANTA _ Road Atlanta this week hosts the largest gathering of
female race-car drivers in history, 68 in all. They are competing
for clearance to drive in 16-car fields in the inaugural Women's
Global GT Series, started this year as part of the American Le Mans
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The tryouts, closed to the public, run through Friday.
Competitors include former NASCAR Busch Series pole winner Shawna
Robinson of Charlotte, N.C.; police officer Liz Holliday of San
Diego; figure skater and dance-team choreographer Sherry Blakely of
Greenville, S.C.; and local hopefuls Krista Baker Barr of Cumming,
Linda Sharp of Atlanta, Shana Callahan of Lawrenceville, Jean
Kinser of Carrollton and Tammy Jo Kirk of Dalton. Another session
is March 29.

Anniversary Trans Am at the season-opening NHRA AutoZone
Winternationals in Pomona, Calif., Feb. 4-7. Johnson's white
``Warbird'' is in striking contrast to the black and silver
Firebird that propelled him to nine victories and his fourth NHRA
championship last season. Johnson will campaign in the
limited-edition Trans Am for the first half of the 1999 season.
``I'm not superstitious about colors,'' Johnson said, ``but the

   With the recent and unexpected departure of Formula 1's sole
Argentinian driver, Esteban Tuero, from the sport, the race in
Buenos Aires, scheduled for March 28, has been canceled. Coupled
with the dropping of the Chinese Grand Prix, that leaves a gap in
the schedule from March 7 (Australia) through April 11 (Brazil).
With that in mind, the Asian race could be back on the books for
March 21.

   PEREIRA, Colombia _ Angered by delays in the delivery of food
and other assistance after one of the worst earthquakes here in
more than a century, residents in this town and nearby Armenia
looted supermarkets and stores Wednesday and threw stones at
soldiers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hungry, and the government has done nothing to feed
us!'' shouted a man in Armenia, the city most severely damaged in
Monday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 76,000 tons of food had been allocated for
distribution in the hardest-hit parts of west-central Colombia. The
quake left at least 721 people dead and 3,166 injured.
</P>
<P>
   But relief efforts were moving slowly and as rescue workers
continued to dig through the rubble of ruined towns in search of
victims, many survivors faced a third night without shelter and
electricity, and water and gasoline were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back walls of my house collapsed and as you can see, we're
living in the street now,'' said Javier Diaz here in Pereira. ``The
government is telling us we can't live here anymore, but nobody is
offering us somewhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana formally declared a state of disaster
for the region Tuesday, describing the quake as ``a grave wound''
to the well-being of the country. But the extent of the destruction
seems to have strained to the breaking point Colombia's capacity to
deliver emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analgesics, antibodies, you name it, we need it,'' said Jhon
Moreno, a nurse on the intensive care ward in San Jorge Hospital
here. ``We are also desperately short of orthopedic material, and
we have 20 patients for every trajection unit that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Others complained of a lack of security, as the hungry and
frustrated raided food and clothing stores. Hundreds of armed
soldiers patrolled the streets, and in some cases clashed with
looters. But residents and businessmen in several neighborhoods
said they were being overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had to keep a constant, round-the-clock watch on our
stores to prevent our goods from being stolen,'' said Jorge William
Orozco, one of a group of shoe and clothing store owners sitting in
chairs Wednesday afternoon in front of their businesses. ``It seems
like the police and the army have forgotten about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone communication between this region and the rest of
Colombia also remain a problem. To fill the gap, local radio
stations are allowing residents to go on the air to send messages
to relatives elsewhere in the country, stating their names and
announcing that everyone is all right or, in some cases, that
someone in the family has perished.
</P>
<P>
   The airport at Armenia, normally less than an hour's drive south
of here, is still closed to all but relief flights. But Colombian
airlines have added extra flights to Pereira which are filled with
anxious relatives of residents of both Pereira and Armenia who want
to check on their loved ones and are bringing them food, medicine
and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   As roads and airports are repaired, foreign assistance has also
begun arriving in Pereira for distribution throughout the entire
quake-ravaged region. Outside the Colombian Red Cross office here
Wednesday afternoon, volunteers were unloading donated food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Nestor Humberto Martinez estimated it would
cost at least $100 million to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The capriciousness as well as the destructiveness of earthquake
was evident in Pereira on Wednesday. Some buildings have been
reduced to piles of rubble and twisted metal, while those on either
side, while apparently identical in appearance, somehow managed to
withstand the shock.
</P>
<P>
   In a few unexpected corners, the quake has left especially
bizarre tableaux. Outside a damaged church, wooden statues of
saints and the Virgin Mary stand or sit on the sidewalk, their arms
raised as if imploring the heavens for help.
</P>
<P>
   The worst damage, however, appears to have been inflicted in the
downtown area. Whole blocks, including some dominated by banks,
shopping malls, government offices, libraries, museums, and other
modern buildings, are marked off with yellow and black police tapes
that proclaim ``Danger!''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, streets in the central business district remain
crowded during the day, as people cleaned up the mess and tried to
prop up weakened buildings with the trunks of palm trees. On the
pavement, huge piles of broken tile, splintered glass and shattered
brick awaited pick-up by garbage crews.
</P>
<P>
   As in other parts of the Andes, people here are used to
earthquakes and from an early age are taught what precautions to
take: seek shelter in a protected structure like a doorway, for
instance. As recently as February 1995, a temblor shook Pereira, a
city of some 250,000 people, but did little damage.
</P>
<P>
   This earthquake, however, everyone agrees, was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually they start off soft and gradually build up,'' said
Gildardo Cuellar, a store owner. ``This one was very rough from the
beginning, like an explosion that kept growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the earthquake that ravaged Mexico City in 1985,
Monday's temblor, which measured 6.0 on the Richter scale, and the
score of aftershocks that have followed were mild. Wednesday a
5.4-magnitude quake rocked the country's northeast but caused no
damage.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombian seismologists say the epicenter of the quake was
unusually close to the earth's surface, which, according to people
here, magnified its force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like being in a blender,'' said Alejandra Munoz, a
20-year-old housewife who was ordered to abandon her home Wednesday
after inspectors found cracked walls and a collapsed roof. ``And
every day since we've been feeling vibrations.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sandro Santacruz, 25, is another who was surprised by the
strength of the quake. He works as a light and sound technician for
discoteques throughout the region that bore the brunt of the quake,
and happened, to his misfortune, to be in bed taking a nap when the
shaking began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the tremor, awoke, got up and started to run, but all
the walls fell in on me,'' he recalled Wednesday afternoon from his
bed at San Jorge Hospital, where he was being treated for fractures
of his left leg and knee and a concussion. ``I was buried, and it
took my mother, my brothers, my nephews and some of the neighbors
to dig me out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next bed, Luis Alfonso Pena Velasquez was groaning from
pain. He has a fractured skull and broke his left leg and arm, the
result of being buried in rubble when the cafeteria where he was
eating lunch collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, there's nothing I can do, I feel so helpless,''
said his wife, Luz Alba Hurtado, who lost her modest business, a
street stand selling underwear, in the quake. ``The doctors here
are doing everything they can to help, but there's not enough
medicine to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Gloria Amparo Alvarez Cardona, expressed
amazement at her narrow escape from death. She was standing in the
doorway of the bicycle shop where she works when the ground
suddenly began to undulate under her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an earthquake,'' shouted a co-worker, grabbing her by the
arm and pulling her from the store just seconds before the second
floor of the building toppled to the street. As the women watched,
a huge pile of debris showered down on a passing taxi, burying the
vehicle in rubble and killing the driver instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alvarez, 38, who moved here from a coastal area barely a
year ago, is now out of a job, but nonetheless counts herself as
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just by a matter of inches that my two children did not
become orphans, like the children of that poor taxi driver,'' she
said Wednesday afternoon, still shaken, as the store's few
remaining undamaged bicycles were loaded unto a truck. ``It was
miraculous.''

&HT;    ANGRY QUAKE REFUGEES LOOT STORES IN COLOMBIA 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ President Andres Pastrana rushed to this
earthquake-ravaged zone late Wednesday to direct relief efforts
after hungry refugees broke into a handful of supermarkets and
picked them clean.
</P>
<P>
   Angry at the slow pace of relief efforts following an earthquake
that struck western Colombia on Monday and killed more than 800,
the looters used rocks, planks and pickaxes to break into grocery
stores.
</P>
<P>
   In Armenia, the city hardest hit by the quake, dozens of people
ran through the streets carrying bags of milk, bottles of cooking
oil and bags of rice. Riot police and a steady afternoon rain
eventually broke up the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hell,'' said one refugee. ``There are thieves all over
the place. They are breaking into the supermarkets and
warehouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Looting also occurred in the nearby town of Calarca. The Bogota
TV station Caracol broadcast images of police using their sticks to
chase away the crowds. ``We can't stand this,'' said one looter in
Calarca. ``We're all hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude-6 earthquake caused death and destruction
throughout Colombia's coffee-growing region. At least 879 people
were killed and 3,400 injured, according to the Colombian Red
Cross. Thousands more were made homeless.
</P>
<P>
   President Pastrana, who was visibly angry about the
disturbances, announced that $65 million would be set aside from
the national budget for food, water, drugs and housing supplies.
Millions of dollars in international aid is also on the way.
</P>
<P>
   But food, clothes, medicine and tents haven't found their way to
the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been delays in the distribution of food and
essential aid, and that has led to a wave of discontent,'' said
Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda. ``We hope to correct this
situation in the coming hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloreda called on earthquake victims to have patience and
pointed out that the government has airlifted 160 tons of food to
the region. The problem, he said, was due to bureaucratic snafus at
distribution centers in Armenia and Pereira, another city hit hard
by the quake. Attorney General Jaime Bernal Cuellar announced an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to determine why the (relief) committees in
Armenia and Pereira are not functioning,'' he said. ``There is a
roadblock in the distribution of aid that people need. We are not
going to allow it to be pilfered.''
</P>
<P>
   The grim task of recovering bodies from the ruins of downtown
Armenia brightened for a moment Wednesday when workers rescued a
youth who had been trapped beneath a crumpled apartment building
for 44 hours.
</P>
<P>
   David Andres Acevedo, 16, said he drifted in and out of sleep,
drank his urine to quench his thirst and shouted for help until
someone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize how precious life is and how beautiful it is to be
outside,'' said Acevedo as he lay on a hospital cot wearing a neck
brace shortly after he was rescued. ``It's like being reborn.``
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo was working as a doorman on the first floor when the
quake struck Monday at 1:20 p.m. Although the structure caved in,
he ended up in a tiny air pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Workers couldn't hear him because they were excavating with
heavy machinery. But Tuesday night, a downpour forced them to stop
and Acevedo's mother, Ligia Buritica, heard his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said it was impossible with four floors on top of
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vicente Villegas, a volunteer who helped rescue Acevedo,
said, ``We knew there were people in there, but we thought they
were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak, the volunteers moved in with pickaxes, crowbars and
blowtorches, cut through two floors and dragged Acevedo free. It
was delicate work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you move one thing, everything else could fall. It's very
risky,`` said Jaime Gomez, another volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo was prepared. He found a motorcycle helmet in his
crawlspace and covered his neck with his hands, a safety position
that he had read about in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   At other demolition sites, people weren't so lucky. Workers
pulled the blood-caked bodies of a woman and a small boy from the
ruins of a restaurant as a crowd of two dozen bystanders groaned.
</P>
<P>
   Excavation experts on the way from the United States, Japan and
France have yet to show up, thus most of the work is left to local
firefighters, civil defense committees, volunteers, street cleaners
and Boy Scouts. Some wore cowboy hats instead of helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuing people like Acevedo provides a tremendous lift to their
spirits, but workers predicted that most of the buried victims are
dead. How can they tell?
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell,'' said Jorge Forero, a firefighter from the city of
Cali.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Armenia residents wore surgical masks or scarves
over their faces as they walked through the ruined downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Becera combed a ruined hotel with a German Shepherd
trained to smell for bodies _ dead or alive. While the task might
seem futile, he said that finding cadavers gives survivors a sense
of closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get the bodies out in the best possible shape,'' he
said. ``We want people to be calm and for them to be able to bury
their dead.``
</P>
<P>
   As nurses wheeled him down the hospital hallway, Acevedo said
his near-death experience in the ruins makes him want to study
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, would help him ``find an equilibrium between man
and nature to avoid these tragedies.''

 &HT;    Beware, Tech: These Tigers are on the prowl
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Words of advice for Georgia Tech before tonight's game
with Clemson: Beware of a wounded Tiger. Because that's exactly
what's coming to Alexander Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   After five straight ACC losses, the latest in overtime to No. 4
Maryland, Clemson (12-8, 1-6 ACC) is a frustrated team looking to
take it out on somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that sooner or later, the breaks have got to
start going our way,'' senior guard Terrell McIntyre said. ``I know
I'm frustrated, and when you've had so many bad things happen, it
starts to wear on your confidence. Sooner or later, something good
has got to happen to this basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Maryland is just the latest in a string of tough
ones for a senior-laden team that, despite a coaching change from
Rick Barnes to Larry Shyatt, was considered certain to get its
fourth NCAA Tournament bid in a row. Four of Clemson's six ACC
losses have been by a total of 18 points. In the two other losses,
to No. 10 North Carolina (69-53) and No. 2 Duke (82-60), the Tigers
were within striking distance before being put away by a run in the
final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was one big thing we were doing wrong or we weren't
competing night in and night out, I'd be more worried,'' said
Shyatt, a former Clemson assistant who took over when Barnes bolted
for Texas. ``But we are competing well, and we continue to give the
effort in practice. I have to believe we are going to turn a
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has had problems off the court as well as on. Backup
center Mohamed Woni left the team and transferred to Hampton,
taking some extra quickness with him. A week ago, Shyatt suspended
senior guard Johnny Miller and junior swingman Vincent Whitt for
violating team rules. On Monday, Shyatt made those suspensions
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Whitt had started 11 games in row. Miller provided some of the
outside shooting to take the pressure off McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, teams now gear their defenses to stop McIntyre, the
team's leading scorer (16.2 points per game), without fear that
another player will make them pay. Clemson's inability to get
offense from the rest of the lineup has made for some ugly losses.
On Jan. 17, Clemson lost 65-58 at last-place Virginia (10-10, 1-7),
which dressed only six scholarship players. McIntyre was 1-for-9
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope for the second half of the ACC season. Clemson was
a smarter and more aggressive team in the losses to Duke and
Maryland. Junior Andrius Jurkunas is starting to find his 3-point
range, hitting 5 of 8 shots against Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Three freshmen _ Will Solomon, Dustin Braddick and Chucky
Gilmore _ are starting to make their presence felt. Solomon, from
East Hartford, Conn., had 19 points against Duke and seven assists
against Maryland. Gilmore, a bulky forward (6-8, 275), had six
rebounds against Maryland. Braddick, a 6-5 swingman from
Charleston, had 10 points against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   After barely getting out of town Sunday with a win against the
Tigers, Maryland coach Gary Williams is convinced that Clemson is
going to break some hearts in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started out slow, and that sometimes happens when you
have a new coaching staff,'' Williams said. ``But trust me. These
guys are going to be tough from now on.''

 The Red Cross Prepares for Y2K  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Year 2000 computer problem has fueled speculation that the
world will encounter anything from flea-sized inconvenience to
total Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   But warnings to start preparing _ which were easier to dismiss
when they came from profit-motivated Year 2000 consultants trying
to sell thousands of dollars worth of survival food and supplies _
have moved into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   None other than the American Red Cross recently released its own
Y2K survival brochure, with tips such as storing enough
nonperishable food to last three days to a week, having
alternative-fuel stoves in case there is no gas or electricity and
stashing extra cash away just in case ATMs and credit cards fail to
work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The Red Cross doesn't know for sure what's going to happen
January 1, 2000,'' said Russ Paulsen, the Red Cross senior disaster
manager for the Bay Area. ``But it's prudent for people to be
prepared for any disaster, whether it's a technological disaster
like Y2K or a natural disaster like an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And experts in disaster preparation say getting ready
shouldn't mean plunging deep into debt.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a family of four can assemble a basic 72-hour survival
kit for about $60 to $80 per person, said Bruce Webster, author of
a new book called ``The Y2K Survival Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how fancy you want to get or if you think you're
going to be roughing it,'' said Webster, who is also chief
technology officer for a Texas-based firm. The Y2K problem &LR;   &LR; stems
from a computer programing shortcut that may cause programs to read
the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic experts believe there will be at least
some trouble before and after New Year's Day since there is not
enough time left to fix the billions of lines of computer code or
track down all the embedded microchips that might contain a Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that because the world has become so dependent on
technology, there will be more long-term disruptions to power
supplies, food distribution systems, water sources or the economy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of Y2K28 (77289 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``What we're recommending is people have a least a week's worth
of food,'' Paulsen said. ``No one at the Red Cross is recommending
going out and paying thousands of dollars, but you should take some
moderate, prudent precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   So how much does preparation cost? That depends greatly on how
confident you are in the ability of governments, corporations,
grocery stores and power companies around the world to get a handle
on Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Red Cross offers 72-hour disaster kits costing
$32 for one person and $49 for four people. &UR;  &LR; A portable kit for
four people include flashlights, batteries, two blankets, two
ponchos, food bar rations, three two-gallon water bags, a portable
radio, a first aid kit, blankets and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthquake Survival Center in San Rafael offers more
elaborate 72-hour survival kits for $105 for one person, $230 for
four.
</P>
<P>
   But Y2K worriers can also assemble survival kits tailored to
their own needs by selectively shopping at big box retailers,
military surplus stores, camping supply stores and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest variable is the cost of food. One high-calorie food
bar for each meal would meet nutritional purposes, but won't be
very satisfying, especially if there are prolonged food shortages,
said Webster, a former Santa Cruz resident who has built a
six-month supply of food.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and other national
disasters, the Year 2000 problem isn't going to bring buildings
down and force people to evacuate. Instead, a home or apartment can
be gradually turned into a miniature warehouse stocked with enough
food and supplies to weather Y2K storms outside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Stocking up on extra six-packs of canned corn costing $3.75 or
even the six-pound, $2 can of beans from Costco won't disrupt a
household budget. One rule of thumb is to start spending an extra
10 percent of your weekly grocery budget on survival items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can build up a two-week supply of food, &LR; '' Webster
said. ``You can build up a good supply with a minimum amount of
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of Y2K28 (77289 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  There are also more expensive MRE, or ``made ready-to-eat''
foods, prepared meals that need no refrigeration or cooking and
have shelf lives as long as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skyler, co-owner of the Earthquake Supply Center, said
most people are still blase about quakes, but Y2K concerns have
caused a 30 percent increase for his business, which, along with
survival gear sells a prepackaged one-year supply of food for four
for $2,900.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet site advertises a one-year supply of prepackaged
food for four at $5,630, a 3-million calorie package five-pound
buckets of spaghetti, rice, oats and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, though, said shoppers need to discipline themselves to
only buy food they actually will eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to store what you eat and eat what you store,''
Webster said. ``If you have stored a half-ton of wheat and suddenly
you have to live off just that stuff, you're going to be
miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Water is another essential for survival. The Red Cross
recommends keeping a three-day supply of water on hand, at one
gallon per person per day, in case water supplies are disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Local Y2K community preparedness groups say saving tap water in
clean, plastic liter-sized soda bottles will work fine and costs
nothing extra, although you should add a preservative like a small
amount of chlorine to keep the water fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for longer term water shortages will cost more.
Skyler, for example, sells 55-gallon drums for $65 that store two
weeks worth of water if the normal supply is knocked out. He also
has water purification systems costing $70 to $125.
</P>
<P>
   If home stoves are unusable, Skyler said there are inexpensive
cooking devices costing between $5 and $25 that use Sterno or
burning tablets. Portable camping stoves fueled by propane or wood
can be found at any outdoors store for between $40 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Portable generators will keep some electricity on even if the
power grid is off. Skyler said generators costing $1,000 or more
will prove more reliable than $500 models designed for recreational
purposes. But he notes homeowners may have to pay an electrician to
make the correct hookups to the house.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of Y2K28 (77289 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  And Webster's book raises another costly problem. A 1,500-watt
generator running 12 hours a day for two weeks would requires 55
gallons of fuel that has to be safely stored in an approved tank.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen said all the uncertainties surrounding Year 2000 make
deciding how much to pay for preparing ``a little harder to
assess.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K disruptions ``may be as extreme as people say or may not be
as extreme,'' he said. ``People should be prepared no matter what
the disaster is.''
</P>
<P>

HEARST CLOSE TO BUYING INTEREST IN TINA BROWN'S NEW MAGAZINE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corp. is close to assuming ownership with
Miramax Films in Tina Brown's Talk magazine, which is scheduled to
start publication in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was presented to Hearst's board on Wednesday and could
be announced within a week, according to a person close to the
discussions. He said that Hearst would become an equal owner in the
publication and that Ms. Brown and the new magazine's publisher,
Ronald Galotti, would each retain the equity interests they
originally negotiated when they left Conde Nast Publications last
summer. Ms. Brown is the former editor of The New Yorker, and
Galotti was publisher of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would put financial muscle behind the idea hatched by
Ms. Brown and Miramax, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co. Ms.
Brown would lead Hearst's first foray into the general interest
magazine arena, teaming her up with the most formidable rival of
her old employer Conde Nast, which is a unit of Advance
Publications.
</P>
<P>
   The privately owned Hearst is the nation's third-largest
publishing company, after Time Warner and Conde Nast. Hearst has 19
magazines, most of which have circulations of more than 400,000,
led by Good Housekeeping with its 4.59 million readers. It also has
an impressive record for starting new magazines, including Country
Living, Victoria and Smart Money. But none of the publications are
aimed at a broad male and female audience as are Conde Nast's
Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's new magazine, which she had previously described as
``a cultural search engine'' that would sniff out articles suitable
for movie development, is still a work in progress. For now, she
and her team seem to have abandoned the idea of using articles as
the starting points for developing films and television programs.
The magazine's subtitle will be ``The American Conversation,''
reflecting, associates say, Ms. Brown's conviction that she can
sense issues that will ignite reader interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown is hoping that her magazine, like Vanity Fair, will
have robust newsstand sales and attract the younger readers that
advertisers covet, her associates said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But that will difficult. No major brand-new general-interest
magazines have been started in recent years, and advertisers are
increasingly content to push their products in the pages of
magazines with narrow demographic goals. Publishers in recent years
have chosen to start magazines specifically aimed at audiences like
beauty-conscious middle-aged women (the Meredith Corp.'s More),
golfers with a penchant for travel (American Express Publishing's
Travel and Leisure Golf) and celebrity-obsessed teen-agers (Teen
People, published by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner).
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal requires Disney's backing, the impetus for the
project has clearly come from the founder of Miramax, Harvey
Weinstein. Still, a Hearst-Disney alliance is a natural. When
Disney bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, it inherited an extensive
relationship between ABC and Hearst. Ten of Hearst's television
stations are ABC affiliates, and it owns 20 percent of ESPN, of
which ABC owns the balance. Hearst also owns a small piece of ESPN
magazine. And both ABC and Hearst are investors in two cable
services: Lifetime and Arts and Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The association with Hearst would give Talk magazine a huge data
base for subscriptions, influence at the newsstand and a universe
of existing advertisers. It would also remove from Weinstein some
of the burden of concentrating on the business issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although several industry experts put the price of starting a
new magazine at about $30 million, one person close to Miramax put
the figure at a more lavish $40 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax paid Ms. Brown a bonus for joining the company when she
left The New Yorker, according to one of her associates. It might
take many years for Ms. Brown to make money as an equity owner.
Under the deal with Hearst, she would receive a salary, and she and
Galotti would share in the profits or benefit from a sale only when
the magazine begins to make a profit and Hearst and Disney have
recovered their investment.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Brown and Weinstein first announced the project, they
did not say they were seeking a partner. Some industry experts said
they had thought the two would rely on other Disney publishing
operations, principally Fairchild Publishing, the parent of Women's
Wear Daily and a slew of trade papers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Brown and Weinstein had originally touted the new
magazine's ability to generate book, television and movie projects,
Miramax executives are now calling that mission an incidental
benefit and not the magazine's primary purpose. A person familiar
with the publication said that well-known writers would want to
retain the right to sell their articles to the movies or
television, but that the magazine might retain those rights in the
case of less-experienced writers.
</P>
<P>
   The team Ms. Brown is assembling is a diverse but relatively
young group. From The New Yorker, she brought David Kuhn, an editor
who also worked under her at Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Other editors include a former New York Observer editor, Lisa
Chase, whose mission is, in part, to bring thoughtful essays about
sex to the magazine. Gabe Doppelt, who was briefly the editor of
Conde Nast's Mademoiselle magazine before producing the cable
channel VH-1's fashion awards, will handle any television
production and development the company does decide to undertake.
The new magazine is also in the process of hiring staff writers.

 How to Get New AOL Screen Name  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Last year, a friend of mine became a subscriber to
America Online. He created a screen name for me and let me use his
account. This past summer, my friend died. I called AOL and asked
if I could become a subscriber with the same screen name. They said
no, I would need a new one. Because the name also was my Internet
address, it was known to all my contacts, and I don't want to lose
it. Can anything be done?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  AOL puts a six-month moratorium on the use of screen
names in accounts that are deactivated. The reason is that if the
user decides to reactivate the account during that period, he or
she can get the names back again. After six months, however, the
names go back in the pool and can be claimed by any subscriber.
That means you ought to be able to grab your name back any time
now. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF AOL: Several readers have asked if
there's any way to turn off the sound of an internal modem when
connecting to AOL. Version 4.0 of AOL's software offers a solution.
Here's what you do: Click Setup on the Sign On screen, then click
Expert Setup. (Don't worry, you don't have to be an expert to do
this.) Now, click the Devices tab, and double-click on your modem
in the list. This will display the Expert Edit Modem window. At the
right is a drop-down list labeled Speaker volume, which lets you
turn the sound off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't know if this will work on all modems, which can be
fickle when it comes to cooperating with the rest of your system.
But it can't hurt to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: Recently, I bought a Palm III. Prior to that, I kept all
my business contacts in Outlook 97. Is there a way to transfer the
addresses from that program to the Palm? It would save a lot of
time because I wouldn't have to manually enter all the information.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You've got a couple of options. The easiest is to export
the contacts from Outlook into a text file, then import them into
the Palm Desktop. (The Desktop is software that runs on your PC and
lets you transfer information to the handheld Palm III.) To export
your data, open the Outlook contact list, choose Select All from
the Edit menu, then use the ``Import and Export'' option in the
File menu. Save the file as a comma delimited text file. Then open
the Palm Desktop, choose Import and follow the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to use Outlook as the personal information manager
for your Palm III, you'll need software that lets you synchronize
the two. The leading program is Puma Technology's Intellisync 3.0
for PalmPilot, which has a street price of $50.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I have a Windows 98 computer, and it has a ``Print
Screen'' key. But when I press the key, nothing prints. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: The Print Screen key is a holdover from the days of DOS,
the operating system that dominated the PC industry in the days
before Windows. It still works ... but in a roundabout way. In
today's computers, Print Screen sends an image of the screen to the
Windows clipboard _ a temporary holding area for information that
you copy and then paste elsewhere. Once you've saved the screen
onto the clipboard, you can open up Word or another word processor
and paste it into a blank document. Then print the document.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I recently installed the beta of Internet Explorer 5,
with Outlook Express. The default type size is 10 points, which I
find too small when composing messages. Is there an easy way to
increase the size?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Sure. Go to Options in the Tools menu of Outlook Express,
then tab to Compose, where you'll find an option for changing the
type style and size.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Hey, all you iMac owners. If you're looking for something to take
the place of the floppy disk that your computer doesn't have,
consider the new Universal Serial Bus version of Iomega's popular
Zip drive. It's really fast _ in fact, in tests I conducted, it
rivaled the speed of a floppy or hard drive. And the cartridges
hold 100 megabytes of information apiece. List price for the latest
Zip is $150. And by the way, it also can be used with a Windows PC
that has a USB port.

 Linux's Popularity Sends VA Research's Star Rising  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
With large corporations like IBM, Oracle and Hewlett-Packard
embracing it, the Linux operating system now seems a sure bet to
challenge Microsoft for the hearts, minds and checkbooks of
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, which is freely distributed across the World Wide Web,
also promises to spawn a host of successful companies providing
packaged versions of it, application software, and hardware for it
to run on.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hottest prospects is VA Research, a privately held
Mountain View company that makes computer workstations based on
Linux. Infused last fall with financing from Sequoia Capital, it is
starting to gear up for a possible public offering later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is growing as fast as we can hire people,'' said
Larry Augustin, who started building Linux workstations in 1992
while a graduate student at Stanford University. VA currently has
about 40 employees. Augustin started the company in 1993 with a
Stanford buddy, James Vera, who today is a research staffer at the
university. Their initials constitute the VA in the company's name.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin said he was drawn to Linux for the same reasons it has
attracted millions of other users _ it's free, powerful and it can
be made to run on just about any kind of computer.
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student, he needed a powerful computer but
couldn't afford the $7,000 price tag of a Sun Microsystems
workstation. So he cobbled together a machine and put Linux on it.
``For about $2,000, I had a system that was nearly two times as
fast as a Sun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   VA Research today makes a range of workstations, from models
selling for $1,500 to high-powered servers going for more than
$200,000. All use Intel Pentium chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which counts among its customers McGraw-Hill,
Bloomberg and Southwestern Bell, has been profitable since its
incorporation in 1995. Lately, however, things have really taken
off, said Augustin, noting that revenues now are growing at a rate
of 15 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt, Augustin said, that VA Research is in the
right place at the right time. All around it, major computer and
software companies are scrambling to embrace Linux and push it into
the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, the giant database company, plans to make its software
work on Linux. IBM said recently that it will offer a Linux version
of Lotus Notes. And just yesterday, Hewlett-Packard and Silicon
Graphics announced plans to offer Intel-based computers with Linux.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of LINUX28 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Other applications that run on Linux also are starting to appear,
spearheaded by Corel, which has released a Linux version of its
popular word processor WordPerfect. In little more than month,
500,000 copies have been purchased over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an international project coordinated by Alexandre
Julliard, a young Swiss programmer, aims to develop a way to let
Windows applications, including Microsoft software, run on Linux
computers without the need for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   If the project, named Wine, succeeds, companies that now develop
programs for Windows would enjoy a brand new market _ one that,
significantly, isn't controlled by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited that we can get applications out on an operating
system that isn't dominated by any one company,'' said Derek
Burney, executive vice president of engineering for Corel of
Ottawa, Canada. ``Linux creates a level playing field for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Further eroding Microsoft's position would be a move by
computer-makers like Dell and Compaq to introduce Intel
workstations running both Linux and Wine. They wouldn't require
Windows, thus saving the computer companies millions of dollars
they pay in licensing fees to Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations also are developing Windows-like graphical
desktop interfaces for Linux that will position it as a true
alternative to Windows for home users.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Linux clouds are starting to gather on Microsoft's
horizon _ especially overseas. The government of Mexico, for
example, plans to install Linux in 140,000 school computer labs
around the country, giving students computer access that wouldn't
be affordable if the government had to pay for Windows licenses.
</P>
<P>
   As Linux continues to pick up steam, VA Research no doubt will
face increasing competition from other computer-makers eager to
cash in by putting Linux on their systems. But Augustin feels that
his company can more than hold its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in this business for five years, and we really
understand Linux,'' he said. ``We design systems for Linux from the
ground up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not well known in the mainstream computer
industry, VA Research is well-regarded by Linux experts. ``I think
they have a very experienced management team, they've got a good
solid line of solutions, and they understand the Unix market,''
said Sandra Potter, Linux analyst with the Aberdeen Group in
Boston.

 Gas Prices Expected To Soar  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Spurred by refinery production cutbacks and a slowdown in oil
imports, gasoline prices could rise as much as 15 cents a gallon
this spring, according to projections from the U.S. Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's anybody's guess what the actual price will be at
your local service station. Prices vary by as much as 25 cents a
gallon in Northern California, depending on where you buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts with the DOE's Energy Information Administration
indicated yesterday that the price of reformulated regular unleaded
gasoline could jump twice as much as usual this spring, from an
average price of $1.11 to about $1.25 on the West Coast.
Nationally, it could go from about 94 cents to $1.08 by May or
June.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bay Area drivers know, prices already are in the vicinity
of that higher price in many parts of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   In a monthly survey released last week, the California State
Automobile Association found prices averaging $1.25 in San
Francisco, $1.23 in San Mateo and $1.21 in Oakland for regular
unleaded self-serve gasoline. By contrast, they were $1.01 in
Modesto, $1.03 in Sacramento and $1.05 in Chico.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to geographic variations, there are the seasonal
ones. Gasoline prices often rise as much as 8 cents a gallon from
January until June, nudged upward by rising demand caused by summer
travel. This year, prices will rise more than that amount because
poor profit margins are causing refiners to cut back on gasoline
production, according to David Costello, an economist with the EIA.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the DOE's research indicates that slightly lower
refinery output, coupled with rising demand for fuels and decreased
imports, will push prices close to what they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That would put it in the vicinity of $1.37 in Northern
California, according to the CSAA.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute reported that refinery
operations fell by 3.8 percentage points to 91.7 percent of
capacity last week, the lowest level in three months.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GAS28 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  As a result, total gasoline stocks were down 1.1 million barrels
to end the week at 221 million barrels, according to EIA statistics
released yesterday. Stocks of reformulated gasoline _ what
California burns _ decreased 300,000 barrels to 46 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   On news that refiners have been cutting production, gasoline
futures rose 4 percent yesterday to 35.80 cents a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline inventories have dropped, and imports have slowed,''
said Neil Gamson, an economist who helps prepare the Short Term
Energy Outlook for the EIA. ``These are among the many factors that
affect prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Imports of gasoline to the United States totaled 237,000 barrels
per day last week, compared with 390,000 barrels a day at the
beginning of January, the EIA said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor affecting gasoline prices, of course, is oil
prices. The average price of imported crude oil for U.S. refiners
is expected to climb from around $9.25 a barrel in December to $13
by the end of this year. Crude oil makes up about 28 percent of the
cost of wholesale gasoline.

 Linux Fans Seeking Windows Refund Day  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hoping to spark a worldwide revolt, fans of the Linux computer
operating system plan to march down to the local Microsoft Corp.
office in Foster City on February 15 to demand refunds for unused
copies of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Their premise is that people who buy computers preloaded with
Windows 95/98 or NT are paying for the cost charged by Microsoft to
the computer maker. But customers who load Linux or another
operating software instead of using Windows are entitled to a
refund, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's end-user licensing agreement states that a computer
user who does not agree to the terms of the license can contact the
manufacturer ``for instructions on return of the unused product(s)
for a refund.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a Windows Refund Day surfaced just last week on an
Internet Linux discussion site, &LR;  www.slashdot.org, &LR;  after word
surfaced that an Australian Linux user, Geoffrey D. Bennett, had
used the provision in the licensing agreement to get a refund
because he doesn't use Windows. Bennett posted online messages
saying he received a $110 refund from his laptop manufacturer after
months of haggling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Windows Refund Day organizers say they are trying to cut the
red tape that prevents others from getting refunds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who get Windows involuntarily to be able to
exercise their claims promptly and conveniently,'' said Donald B.
Marti Jr., a San Francisco Linux marketing consultant who is
helping to coordinate refund day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``You'd be surprised how many PCs people buy and boot
straight into Linux and never run Windows at all,'' Marti said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Bay Area event say there are also plans for
simultaneous marches on Microsoft offices in Orange County, New
York and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Although 2,700 people have signed up for an Internet update
newsletter, organizers don't know how many people will actually
show up at each site.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moen, a Linux user and San Francisco computer network
consultant, said he was inspired to help organize the Bay Area
refund day after reading about Bennett's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Moen, who authored the refund newsletter available at
 &LR; http://zork.net/refund,  &LR; said February 15 isn't supposed to be a
``Bash Microsoft'' day, but simply a chance for Linux users to make
a point that not everyone wants Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers said that people seeking refunds should bring
proof that they haven't used Windows, or bring in their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said the company has not decided
how to handle the refund seekers, but said the license agreement
calls for refunds to come from computer manufacturers, not from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The standard end-user license is supposed to thwart software
piracy and is ``not really designed to be a referendum on Windows
or how manufacturers ship PCs,'' Sohn said. ``If you don't want a
Windows PC, you should buy a PC with whatever operating system you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. spokesman T.R. Reid said he did not know if
any Dell customers have sought Windows refunds in the past, but
said the vast majority of the firm's customers demand Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Dell would honor a refund request by having the customer return
the entire system, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   But eMachines Inc., a new Fremont company selling sub-$500
computers, this week agreed to refund $26 to a Bay Area woman who
loaded Linux without booting Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-makers ``are obliged to do the same thing, if the
consumer for whatever reason doesn't want Windows,'' said eMachines
marketing director Pattie Adams.

 BofA Promotion Restores Hierarchy Of Old NationsBank  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The new BankAmerica restored the executive pecking order that
existed before it bought the old BofA, giving retail banking chief
Kenneth Lewis back his title of president.
</P>
<P>
   As the No. 2 executive of the North Carolina bank, Lewis returns
to the front of the line to succeed chief executive Hugh McColl.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 51, is a 30-year veteran of NationsBank, which bought San
Francisco's BofA in September and took its name. The new BofA, with
$618 billion in assets, is the second-largest bank in the nation,
behind New York's Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Lewis has overseen the bank's sprawling branch
network and headed banking operations for consumers, and small and
midsized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had held the job of president from 1993 until NationsBank
took over BofA, when the title went to David Coulter, the chief
executive of the old BofA.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the 1990s, bank watchers handicapped Lewis,
manager of NationsBank's biggest and most profitable businesses, as
the most likely candidate to run the bank in the post-McColl era.
</P>
<P>
   But when NationsBank agreed to buy BofA last year, McColl
formally pledged that it was his ``present intention'' for Coulter
to follow him as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McColl fired the old BofA chief 16 days after the
takeover took effect, blaming him for hundreds of millions of
dollars in losses in a speculative investment portfolio managed for
the bank by the Wall Street firm D.E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   When NationsBank and BofA announced their deal, most analysts
scoffed at the notion that McColl would hand the reins to an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent meeting with reporters and editors of The Chronicle,
though, McColl insisted that he acted in good faith when he named
Coulter his successor. ``At the time that was said, that was our
intention,'' McColl said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewis's reappointment as president restores the
leadership team and succession arrangements as they existed before
NationsBank bought BofA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before BofA was ever in the equation, Hugh McColl was CEO, Ken
Lewis was president and Jim Hance was chief financial officer,''
said Edward Najarian, an analyst for First Union Capital Markets in
Richmond, Va. ``Those things are all now in place again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis usually is described as businesslike and friendly compared
with McColl, a human dynamo who hands out crystal hand grenades as
awards to employees.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Lewis has a hard edge.
</P>
<P>
   In August, NationsBank canceled more than 250 subscriptions to
the trade newspaper American Banker after the paper printed an
editorial by activists criticizing the bank's community-lending
record, people familiar with the matter said. The move came after
Lewis circulated a memo urging staff members to stop taking the
paper, declaring he was ``offended and angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a Mississippi native, grew up in Columbus, Ga., where his
divorced mother worked as a nurse. He worked his way through high
school selling shoes and was awarded a scholarship at Georgia State
University.
</P>
<P>
   He joined NationsBank in 1969 as a credit analyst but soon
attracted the attention of McColl, then a rising executive in
charge of the bank's national commercial accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After working for McColl as a sales executive, Lewis' career
advanced in tandem with that of his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   As McColl became NationsBank president in the mid-1970s and
chief executive in 1983, Lewis moved through a series of jobs,
culminating in assignments to run the bank's subsidiaries in
Florida and Texas. In 1990, he took over as top manager of
NationsBank's core banking operations.

 Gap to Launch 1969 _ New Jeans With an Old Look  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a departure from its focus on comfortable basics, Gap Inc. is
launching a trendy, vintage-style jean called 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The new jean, which has five-pockets, straight legs and is made
from a heavy, dark denim, closely resembles an early style of Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. jeans that has recently found favor among
fashion-conscious young people.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's spokesman Gavin Power declined to comment on the new Gap
line.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gap and Levi's are based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other fashion jeans-makers such as Diesel are also pushing dark
denim.
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 jeans, named for the year Gap was founded, will sell
for $69, a steep premium over Gap's other styles, which go for $36
to $48.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Richard Baum said profits are
not the goal of this product. ``It's more an image thing and less a
volume thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll grab peoples' attention when it's in the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap's 1969 jeans will appear in selected U.S. stores, European
locations and the company Web site ( &LR; www.gap.com &LR; ) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They will be available in limited quantities. Each pair bears a
unique serial number on a leather patch.

LAWMAKER SAYS AMERICORPS WORKERS CAN HELP WITH CENSUS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To help count Americans for the 2000 census, a
House Republican leader said Wednesday he would call on volunteers
from Americorps, the national service program that, as a favorite
of President Clinton's, House Republicans have tried to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was included in a package of measures that Rep. Dan
Miller of Florida, the census subcommittee chairman, said would
help insure an accurate count, now that the Supreme Court has ruled
that the census must reflect a head count, not statistical
sampling, for the apportionment of congressional seats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats disagree over whether the court ruling
allows for sampling methods to be used for other purposes, like
determining state legislative districts. The prospect of a second
count has led to the possibility that the census will produce two
different population numbers for some places.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a forum sponsored by the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
Miller said the Americorps volunteers would be part of an
additional 100,000 counters who should be hired to work in
communities where accuracy has been most difficult to achieve. For
the 1990 census, the government used more than 500,000 counters at
one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Republican proposes to expand the Americorps program,''
Miller said, ``you know something is different. But if we're going
to have Americorps, I can think of no better civic service than
helping count America.''
</P>
<P>
   Americorps was created in 1993 with $365 million from Congress
for its first year of operation, 1994, when 20,000 volunteers were
placed in jobs. Since then, the program has endured attacks from
many Republican House members who have favored ending the program.
But with Democrats joining Republicans who support it, Americorps
has generally emerged each year from the budget process in better
shape than before. The current appropriation, $435 million,
represents a third straight year of increases, and there are now
more than 40,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Wofford, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania
who is Americorps' chief executive, said in an interview that he
was ``delighted that Congressman Miller has joined the chorus of
people who were skeptical about Americorps coming to see its value
and need.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wofford acknowledged a paradox in Republicans seeking
Americorps workers for the census after passing legislation in 1966
that barred their securing positions from federal agencies. To have
them collect census data, he said, would require new legislation.
``I don't really want to be the one who says it's ironic,'' Wofford
said. ``I'm out fishing for more support to make national service
nonpartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   To insure greater accuracy in 2000 _ capturing people hardest to
find, including low-income families in urban and rural communities,
minorities and homeless people _ Republicans have favored improving
the head-counting techniques while Democrats have supported the use
of statistical sampling. Both parties believe the people hardest to
find tend to vote as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said his plan would go a long way toward achieving a
fuller and more accurate count. Besides enlisting Americorps
volunteers, he proposed allowing local leaders to review data,
expanding school programs that raise awareness of the census,
sending a second questionnaire to households that did not respond
the first time and increasing to 33, from five, the number of
languages in which census forms are printed.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he could not predict how much his measures would
cost. But ``if more is needed,'' over projections of $4 billion to
$6 billion, he said, ``I will support it all.''
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois said Hastert was ``totally supportive'' of Miller's
proposals but had not reviewed the plan's components. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush plan to cut taxes, spend more on education draws applause,
skepticism
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that the
state of the state is so solid that he can offer the kind of deal
that generally evokes skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Pay less, Bush said, get more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must meet basic needs, dedicate the lion's share of new
money to public schools, then send money back to the hands who
earned it _ the taxpayers of Texas,'' Bush said, drawing a standing
ovation from lawmakers gathered in the House chamber to hear his
third State of the State speech.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, echoing campaign-trail promises, called for $2
billion in property tax cuts, as well as cuts in taxes on diapers,
over-the-counter medicines, Internet access, small businesses and
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for $1 billion for school districts to use for
teacher pay raises, additional teachers or however they see fit.
Bush also wants money to pay for the remedial courses for children
who fail the state standardized test. Currently, many of those
children are ``socially promoted'' to the next grade with their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of plans that offer to do more and charge less, warned
Democrats who cranked partisanship up a notch by staging a news
conference immediately after the speech to offer their response.
Though common in Washington, it was the first of its kind here.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats warned against ``sound bites about tax relief,'' a
caution that takes on added political tones because of Bush's
potential presidential candidacy. Bush addressed his political
future near the top of the speech by redeclaring he is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking will I or won't I. ... The answer to the
big question is I really don't know yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats did not accuse Bush of playing presidential
politics with the state budget, they said his tax cut plan may be
more conservative than compassionate when measured against Texans'
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we have taken care of our responsibilities to the people
of Texas, then we should return funds to the taxpayers,'' said
Austin Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, chairman of the Senate Democratic
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is simple. Kids first, cuts second,'' said Sen.
Eliot Shapleigh (D-El Paso).
</P>
<P>
   Though it's shaping up as a largely party-line battle over
prosperity, even Senate Finance Chairman Bill Ratliff (R-Mount
Pleasant) said the jury is out on whether there is enough money for
Bush's tax cut and spend plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' he said when asked if the $2 billion
tax cut is doable. ``It's going to be very difficult, but nothing
about this job is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a close Bush ally, said a
``substantial'' tax cut is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think that is within the range of reality,'' he
said of the $2 billion figure.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have $5.6 billion more to budget for 2000-2001 than
they did for the current two-year budget cycle. This results from
projected increased revenues generated by the state's expanding
economy and surplus that will be on hand when the current budget
period ends Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a surplus in Texas because we have been good stewards
of tax dollars,'' said Bush, who will lay out specifics of his
budget proposal today. ``During times of plenty we must not commit
our state to programs we cannot afford in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his proposed $2 billion property tax cut would cut rates
an average of 13 cents per $100 of property value. Bush also made
light of his failure to win approval for his $3 billion property
tax overhaul plan in 1997. Instead, lawmakers passed a scaled-down
version that added up to $1 billion in property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``One piece of advice from one who knows,'' Bush said he told
Perry. ``Never yell 'Tax reform!' in a crowded Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats said Bush may be yelling it prematurely this
year. At their news conference, the Democrats offered up a laundry
list of issues that need more money before lawmakers consider tax
cuts, including teacher salaries, transportation, children's health
care and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know what member of the Legislature who would not
like to go back home and say, 'Yes, we cut taxes,''' said Sen.
Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo. ``But at the very same time, all of us
who are before you today say fund education, fund health and human
services, meet the needs of all the people who need our services
and let us put our money where our mouths are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carlos Truan (D-Corpus Christi) scoffed at the property tax
cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really that much,'' he said, estimating it at about
$300 per year. ``The $2 billion could be used to more adequately
fund a teacher pay raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Whitmire (D-Houston) said his constituents are telling
him, ``Please take care of our critical needs. Don't play politics
with modest tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen folks,'' he said, ``this is too serious just to be
giving sound bites about tax relief when in fact you and I know
there are some critical needs not being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 124 days before the session ends, Bush and the Democrats
will haggle over which needs are ``critical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During times of plenty,'' the governor cautioned during his
speech, ``we must not commit our state to programs we cannot afford
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush referred several times to the national spotlight his
potential presidential ambitions have trained on the Legislature.
``We begin this session with a national spotlight on us,'' he told
lawmakers. ``I have been asked about it. You have been asked about
it. You didn't ask for it, but it is here anyway. And we can either
view it as a distraction or seize it as an opportunity to show the
world what limited and constructive government looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it was an international spotlight, with a press
corps that included representatives from England and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A 140-day session every other year requires participants ``to
put aside posturing and politics,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican lawmakers said Wednesday that Democrats who
staged the loyal opposition response after the speech had violated
the bipartisanship lawmakers preach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that some have chosen to inject Washington
D.C.-style partisanship into Austin,'' said Sen. David Sibley
(R-Waco).
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a a cue from Washington, where presidents often
introduce special guests during their State of the Union speeches.
Bush introduced ninth-grader Adam Gonzales of Lubbock as a student
who overcame years of social promotion that put him on an
educational course to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Adam failed the eighth-grade reading and math TAAS, he
went to summer school and got one-on-one help,'' Bush said. ``He
now has reason to believe he can pass the test to achieve his dream
of being a United States Marine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also introduced Tillie Burgin of Arlington, a former
missionary now active in helping poor people in her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tillie is living proof of the importance of people putting
their faith into action,'' Bush said.

SENATE VOTES ALONG PARTY LINES TO HEAR WITNESSES IN CLINTON TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An immediate end to President Clinton's impeachment
trial vaporized Wednesday when the Republican-controlled Senate
voted along party lines to consider fresh, sworn testimony from
three witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of roll call votes, all 55 Republicans and one
Democrat rejected a motion to dismiss the charges against Clinton,
then approved House prosecutors' request to subpoena the witnesses
for closed-door interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The two roll calls, signaling for the first time that the Senate
is likely to acquit Clinton, revealed the partisan undercurrents of
the impeachment trial that convened three weeks ago. The votes also
pushed the Senate, conducting only the second presidential
impeachment proceedings in U.S. history, into uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Democrat, is accused of perjury and obstructing
justice in his effort to cover up a sexual affair with Lewinsky, a
former White House intern half his age. Removing Clinton would
require two-thirds of the Senate _ or 67 members _ to vote to
convict him.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team and Senate allies, pointing out that
44 senators, all Democrats, voted to end the trial immediately,
declared that ``the votes are not there'' to terminate Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to end this trial,'' said Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ``The president's behavior was
indefensible, not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators sitting in judgment of Clinton gather again at 1 p.m.
EST Thursday to consider guidelines and a timetable for deposing
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sydney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters that he was
hopeful of reaching an agreement Thursday that could lead to a
final vote on the articles of impeachment by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Lott predicted that the depositions, which possibly will be
videotaped, could be completed by Monday. ``Barring some bolt of
lightning discovery (during depositions) that we don't now see, we
would be through with it before the (President's Day) recess
period'' beginning Feb. 12, the Mississippi Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott left open the question of how the mid-February end-date
would be affected if Clinton's lawyers decide they want to call
their own witnesses, or once depositions are taken, if the Senate
votes to hear live testimony as part of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Also unresolved by Senate leaders is how the trial schedule
would be affected if Republicans attempt to push through a
so-called ``finding of fact'' resolution that would declare Clinton
guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice but would not seek to
censure or otherwise penalize him.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the resolution would send a
signal that Clinton's behavior in the Lewinsky affair was
inappropriate. A simple majority, or 51 votes, would be needed to
pass the resolution, which would be a salve to conservatives
angered over the likelihood that Clinton will not be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for ways to separate the issue of whether or
not the president committed offenses such as obstruction of justice
from the issue of whether or not the offenses are sufficient to
warrant his removal from office,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart accused senators of ``playing
constitutional gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop playing these games. I think the Senate
knows what they need to do. ...They should move forward in a way
that is fair and expeditious,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats on Wednesday were reviving their own resolutions
for rebuking the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., suggested a resolution to
``state the feelings of the Senate with respect to misconduct'' by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House Special Counsel Gregory Craig, a member of Clinton's
defense team, said the two 56-44 votes Wednesday ``make clear that
the votes are not there to convict and remove the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig added that ``any proceedings from this day forward only
serve to delay the final resolution of this matter and run counter
to the best interest of the Congress, the presidency and the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said dismissal of the
charges against Clinton ``would be unthinkable'' before witnesses
are deposed and possibly questioned on the Senate floor. ``It would
be absolutely wrong to short-change this process,'' Hutchison told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal should appear as
trial witnesses, Hutchison said: ``We need to take one step at a
time. We've done well taking issues as they ripen. This one hasn't
ripened.''
</P>
<P>
   The only senator to cross party lines Wednesday was Sen. Russ
Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who said his siding with Republicans
``should not be interpreted as a signal that I intend to vote to
convict the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To dismiss the case at this point, a senator should be of the
opinion that it is not possible for the House managers to show that
the president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors,''
Feingold said in a written statement. ``I simply cannot say that
the House managers cannot prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the 44 Democratic votes for dismissal was a sign
that continuing Clinton's trial was futile, Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla., said, ``I don't think it can ever be an exercise in
futility to try to find the truth. That's what this is about.''
</P>
<P>
   By calling witnesses, House prosecutors, who earlier had planned
to summon a dozen people to testify before the Senate, hope to
obtain evidence relating to their charge that Clinton sought to
obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the prosecutors are focusing on whether Clinton
engaged in an illegal cover-up by persuading Lewinsky to sign a
false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and by
giving his aides false information about his relationship with
Lewinsky, which they in turn took to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the vote, House prosecutors, all Republicans,
began immediate preparations for the depositions, which are
expected to be taken over the weekend and delivered to senators no
later than Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, a former federal prosecutor who is
on the House prosecution team, was assigned to handle the
questioning of Lewinsky. Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas will
question Jordan, and Rep. James Rogan of California will question
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica is very precise. I think you will find Ms. Lewinsky a
compelling witness,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, a Florida
Republican, who, along with Bryant and Hutchinson, met with
Lewinsky on Sunday to discuss her possible testimony.

DISNEY ANNOUNCES SLUMPING PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The long slump that had dragged down shares of
The Walt Disney Co. resumed Wednesday as the entertainment giant
reported worse-than-expected quarterly profits, particularly at
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Burbank-based Disney fell 4.6 percent by sliding
$1.625 to $32.9375, their lowest level since Jan. 7 and 22 percent
below the all-time high of $42.375 last May. Wednesday's decline
erased much of a rally two weeks ago that was sparked by interest
over its Internet portal site launch.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's earnings excluding one-time events declined 38 percent
to $470million, or 23 cents a share, for its first quarter ended
Dec. 31, or a penny short of the consensus estimate. Operating
income fell 8 percent to $1.38billion despite a 3.9 percent gain in
revenues to $6.59billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares, which dipped under $23 last fall, could fall further in
upcoming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to see estimates for this year's earnings
start to come down slightly in the next few weeks,'' said Linda
Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``Earnings should
start to improve in this year's second half and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting operating income plunged 48 percent to $265million
although revenues rose 7 percent to $2.21billion. Performance in
that division has been sluggish since Disney bought Capital
Cities/ABC in 1996 as viewers have turned off the Big Four networks
and turned on dozens of cable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Higher sports program costs, including $1.2billion for this
season's pro football rights in the first of an eight-season deal,
drove the decline. Disney also cited lower ratings at ABC News and
carry-over costs stemming from the Capital Cities/ABC merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney needs a new formula for running ABC,'' said Barry
Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``I don't have
any advice for them because none of the networks have yet figured
it out. The underlying assumptions for running a network no longer
work, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative content posted a 39 percent decline to $430million in
operating earnings due to sluggish results in merchandising and
home video, where the year-earlier period saw stronger offerings.
Declines were partially offset by the ``Simba's Pride'' video and
from solid box office for ``The Waterboy,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and
``Enemy of the State,'' with over $465million in combined domestic
gross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our creative content and broadcasting operating results
continue to reflect the challenges we began facing in 1998,
including rising programming and production costs,'' Chairman
Michael Eisner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Laguna Research Partners consultant Kevin Skislock said lower
sales at Disney Stores, particularly domestically, could signal a
further slowdown in the expansion of the 695-outlet chain. ``It's
worrisome because it may mean the brand is so overexposed that it's
not special anymore,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said creative content should post improved results in
coming quarters due to a solid lineup of video and theatrical
titles. ``I'm not disturbed by the creative content results and I
don't see it as a major problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks and resorts continued to post strong results, up 17
percent to $335million in operating earnings. Disneyland and the
four-park Walt Disney World complex in Florida saw record
attendance. ``Theme parks are still the shining light,'' Hyman
said, forecasting this summer's launch of a second cruise ship will
improve results.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock said it makes sense for Disney to emphasize its
theme-park business. ``It's what they do better than anyone else,''
he added. ``The challenge is they've diluted their uniqueness by
becoming so large.''
</P>
<P>
   Results included a one-time $345million gain from its
acquisition of a 43 percent share of Internet search service
Infoseek, which gave Disney earning of $622million, or 30 cents a
share, for the quarter.

 &HT;    Omission of higher education from speech raises eyebrows
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If higher education officials were hoping Gov.
George W. Bush would publicly embrace even part of their request
for $1.2 billion more for Texas colleges and universities, his
State of the State speech Wednesday probably left them feeling
unhugged.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't even mention higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caught my attention, too,'' said Rep. Irma Rangel,
D-Kingsville, who led the House Higher Education Committee in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been concentrating on public education ... but I wished
he would have touched on the lack of accessibility to higher
education in Texas for minorities and some of those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush's silence on higher education mean anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I did not read that as a signal,'' said Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just as Bush did not mention new college scholarships
for needy students, he also did not mention children's health
insurance, campaign finance reform or a proposed rewrite of the
state Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than make his speech a laundry list for everything, he
tends to focus on issues that he talked about during the
campaign,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. `` ... Higher
education traditionally does a good job of advocating its needs by
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Top officials with the University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M
University were not available for comment Wednesday. Higher
education officials have been optimistic that their schools would
get a share of a projected budget surplus. But in a legislative
budget proposed earlier this month, public colleges got only modest
increases overall.

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dividing almost precisely along party lines, the
Senate voted on Wednesday to summon Monica Lewinsky and two other
witnesses for depositions in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton. Minutes earlier, it had voted against dismissing the
charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The roll calls were identical, 56-44, with only a single
senator, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, a Democrat, breaking from
party colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans prevailed, they could muster nothing
approaching the 67 votes _ a two-thirds majority _ required to
convict the president. Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader, said that the 44 votes for dismissal demonstrated
that ``the president will not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way forward was far from clear. The procedural agreement
reached by the two parties on Jan. 8 brought the Senate this far,
but now they have reached the edge of the map. As the Senate
recessed until Thursday afternoon, senators broke up into clumps to
exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Then action shifted outside the chamber. Daschle and his
Republican counterpart, the majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, conferred at length by telephone and through their
aides, exchanging written proposals in an effort to reach a new
modus operandi.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement was at hand Wednesday night, but Lott said issues
had been narrowed. He hoped to have something solid when the Senate
reconvened, he said, with depositions beginning over the weekend
and concluding by Monday. The trial would be completed, the
majority leader suggested, before Feb. 12, ``barring some
bolt-of-lightning discovery that we don't now see.''
</P>
<P>
   That timetable would allow about 10 weekdays for the Senate to
review the depositions, for the White House to call any witnesses
it wished to, and for other motions, plus 15-minute closing
statements by each of the 100 senators. To meet it, things would
have to move along without many hitches.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries were jammed and silent for the roll calls. As the
clerk called their names, the senators stood, one by one, and
called out their votes, yea or nay. The clerk read each vote back.
The House prosecutors and the defense lawyers sat at their tables
in the well of the Senate, flanking the dais, and kept tallies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote authorized the issuance of subpoenas to Ms.
Lewinsky as well as to Vernon Jordan, Clinton's golfing partner and
confidant, and Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide. They will be
interviewed by the House prosecutors with other lawyers present,
and their testimony will be videotaped. The transcripts and the
tapes will then be shown to all the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be settled were the schedule and duration of the
depositions. Once they have been taken, the Senate will have to
decide whether to call the witnesses to the floor for ``live''
testimony. It also has to decide how much leeway to give the White
House counsels to call their own witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that lies the largest question: When will it all end?
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by impeachment arithmetic. The
Republicans have 55 votes, enough to keep the trial going and to
prevail on many major procedural issues. They could even muscle
through a timetable for the last phase of the trial, but that would
mar the bipartisan gloss they have worked to preserve. And they
lack the votes to control the final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he was confident that a compromise procedure could
be worked out. But this will depend on the stance of the White
House and on the willingness of the Democratic senators to go along
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful,'' Daschle said late Wednesday afternoon, ``that
we will have a procedural plan to offer to our caucuses at some
point tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials issued seemingly conflicting statements,
and a person with knowledge of strategy sessions there said
disagreements had developed between Charles F.C. Ruff, the White
House counsel, who reportedly wants to conclude as soon as
possible, and David Kendall, Clinton's main outside lawyer, who
favors a lengthy period of preliminary evidence-gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a special White House counsel, argued in a
statement issued on Capitol Hill that ``any proceedings from this
day forward only serve to delay the final resolution of this matter
and run counter to the best interests of the Congress, the
presidency and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, said the White House
deserved the chance to review 56,000 pages of evidence, still
secret, that the House collected during its impeachment
investigation. He asserted that Senate Republicans were ``trying to
put a blindfold on us'' and added, ``We believe we ought to have an
adequate chance to get prepared and to present a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Another roadblock to a procedural agreement, at least
temporarily, was the desire of some Republican senators to see the
result of the depositions before committing themselves to a date
for the end of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate
Republican, was one of the frameworks discussed on Wednesday by
Lott and Daschle. He suggested giving attorneys for each side a
total of three hours to question the witnesses, allowing one
senator from each party to sit in on the questioning, with the
interview videotaped for later viewing by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators suggested that this could be accomplished by
Sunday night, or Monday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second proposal was bipartisan, with support from Sens. Sam
Brownback of Kansas, a Republican, and Tom Harkin of Iowa, a
Democrat. It would require the White House to state by 5 p.m. on
Saturday whether it wished to depose witnesses. Videotapes of all
witnesses would be presented next Monday, and a final Senate vote
would be taken no later than Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House decided to call witnesses, the dates would be
pushed back, with the culminating vote scheduled for Thursday, Feb.
11. Friday, Feb. 12 is the start of the long President's Day
weekend, and the prospect of long weekends always tends to
concentrate the minds of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   There are two charges involved: perjury and obstruction of
justice. Several senators have suggested that they take the second
one more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Feingold, a 45-year-old maverick from a state
with a long-standing tradition of independence. A backer of
campaign finance reform, he ran for re-election last fall without
contributions from political action committees, against the advice
of his party leaders, and won handily.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a statement that he could not yet say that ``the
House managers cannot prevail,'' although he conceded that he found
serious problems with their case. He was unwilling to ``improperly
short-circuit this trial,'' he said, but this did not mean he would
vote to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's votes were expected by some of his party colleagues,
but everyone was shocked when Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., voted
against the motion of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia to dismiss
the charges and bring the trial to an immediate halt. She caught
herself in a matter of seconds and put a question to Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an appropriate time, I wish to state I made an error in my
vote,'' she said. ``I want to vote yes. May I do that now, or wait
until the end?''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist told her to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vote yes,'' Ms. Mikulski said, as laughter pierced the hush.
</P>
<P>
   While senators worked on a new road map, the House Republican
prosecutors made their assignments for the deposition. Ms.
Lewinsky, much the most important witness, will be questioned by
Rep. Ed Bryant, a soft-spoken Tennesseean. He was chosen, one
manager said, because he was the questioner Ms. Lewinsky disliked
least when she met with several of the managers last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas will interrogate Jordan, and
Rep. James Rogan of California will interrogate Blumenthal.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, emphasizing his familiar
pledge to make public education his No. 1 priority, on Wednesday
urged lawmakers to adopt a pilot voucher program, spend $1 billion
more on public schools and end so-called social promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I have high expectations for every child _ and we must
have high standards to match those high hopes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initiatives to improve Texas' more than 7,000 public
schools mostly drew thunderous applause _ and a standing ovation on
the issue of halting social promotions _ from Republicans and
Democrats. Bush wants to end the practice of advancing failing
students with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   But several lawmakers questioned whether the state budget could
afford both $2 billion in property tax cuts, as Bush is suggesting,
and an extra $1 billion to public schools without giving short
shrift to other state services. Others questioned Bush's plan to
end social promotions, create a pilot voucher program and give
school districts an extra $1 billion without specifically directing
that the money be used for a teacher pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we're less than overjoyed,'' said Donna
Haschke, vice president of the 60,000-member Texas State Teachers
Association. ``Our fear is teachers will be left without a decent
salary increase, and we won't catch up to the national average.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston and a member of the House Public
Education Committee, said he will closely follow Bush's plan to end
social promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he doesn't mean you can be 13 and in the third grade,''
Dutton said.

DISNEY ANNOUNCES SLUMPING PROFITS

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- The long slump that had dragged down shares
of The Walt Disney Co. resumed Wednesday as the entertainment giant
reported worse-than-expected quarterly profits, particularly at
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Burbank-based Disney fell 4.6 percent by sliding
$1.625 to $32.9375, their lowest level since Jan. 7 and 22 percent
below the all-time high of $42.375 last May. Wednesday's decline
erased much of a rally two weeks ago that was sparked by interest
over its Internet portal site launch.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's earnings excluding one-time events declined 38 percent
to $470 million, or 23 cents a share, for its first quarter ended
Dec. 31, or a penny short of the consensus estimate. Operating
income fell 8 percent to $1.38 billion despite a 3.9 percent gain
in revenues to $6.59 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares, which dipped under $23 last fall, could fall further in
upcoming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably going to see estimates for this year's earnings
start to come down slightly in the next few weeks,'' said Linda
Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``Earnings should
start to improve in this year's second half and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting operating income plunged 48 percent to $265 million
although revenues rose 7 percent to $2.21 billion. Performance in
that division has been sluggish since Disney bought Capital
Cities/ABC in 1996 as viewers have turned off the Big Four networks
and turned on dozens of cable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Higher sports program costs, including $1.2 billion for this
season's pro football rights in the first of an eight-season deal,
drove the decline. Disney also cited lower ratings at ABC News and
carry-over costs stemming from the Capital Cities/ABC merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney needs a new formula for running ABC,'' said Barry
Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``I don't have
any advice for them because none of the networks have yet figured
it out. The underlying assumptions for running a network no longer
work, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Creative content posted a 39 percent decline to $430 million in
operating earnings due to sluggish results in merchandising and
home video, where the year-earlier period saw stronger offerings.
Declines were partially offset by the ``Simba's Pride'' video and
from solid box office for ``The Waterboy,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and
``Enemy of the State,'' with over $465 million in combined domestic
gross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our creative content and broadcasting operating results
continue to reflect the challenges we began facing in 1998,
including rising programming and production costs,'' Chairman
Michael Eisner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Laguna Research Partners consultant Kevin Skislock said lower
sales at Disney Stores, particularly domestically, could signal a
further slowdown in the expansion of the 695-outlet chain. ``It's
worrisome because it may mean the brand is so overexposed that it's
not special anymore,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said creative content should post improved results in
coming quarters due to a solid lineup of video and theatrical
titles. ``I'm not disturbed by the creative content results and I
don't see it as a major problem,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks and resorts continued to post strong results, up 17
percent to $335 million in operating earnings. Disneyland and the
four-park Walt Disney World complex in Florida saw record
attendance. ``Theme parks are still the shining light,'' Hyman
said, forecasting this summer's launch of a second cruise ship will
improve results.
</P>
<P>
   Skislock said it makes sense for Disney to emphasize its
theme-park business. ``It's what they do better than anyone else,''
he added. ``The challenge is they've diluted their uniqueness by
becoming so large.''
</P>
<P>
   Results included a one-time $345 million gain from its
acquisition of a 43 percent share of Internet search service
Infoseek, which gave Disney earning of $622 million, or 30 cents a
share, for the quarter.

STRONG AMGEN EARNINGS EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- After a quarter in which it won a major
legal battle against competitor Johnson &AMP; Johnson, biotechnology
drug maker Amgen Inc. today is expected to report strong
fourth-quarter and year-end earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably do a little better than I expect,'' said
Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Eugene Melnitchenko, who anticipates Amgen
earning 80 cents per share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks-based Amgen, whose shares are sold on the Nasdaq
national market, is expected to report results after the close of
trading this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of 25 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
generated a mean fourth-quarter earnings estimate of 84 cents per
share, and $3.21 per share for the year. Those figures represent a
25 percent and 18 percent gain for quarter and year respectively,
on continued strong sales of Amgen's two blockbuster drugs, Epogen
and Neupogen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued success of the two drugs -- which promote
red and white blood-cell growth in patients receiving chemotherapy
and other treatments -- analysts have been critical of Amgen for
failing to develop or purchase rights to any new drugs for
near-term release. Indeed, Amgen has had little in its pipeline to
make up for the anticipated slowing in sales growth of Epogen and
Neupogen over the next one to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Then in mid-December a judge ruled in a dispute between Amgen
and Johnson &AMP; Johnson that a next-generation version of the drug is
not covered under J&AMP;J's license to distribute Epogen in the United
States for all purposes other than kidney dialysis patients.
</P>
<P>
   That means if and when the drug receives Food and Drug
Administration approval, Amgen can keep all the revenues itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's momentous for them,'' Melnitchenko said. ``(Amgen's)
doing some interesting research longer-term, but the real issue was
what they'd have over the next several years. This legal victory
bridges that gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen shares skyrocketed on the news, climbing from the $80
range to more than $100 in under a week, a trend that has continued
throughout January. Amgen shares closed up $3.125 Wednesday at
$115.875.

TRIAL BEGINS FOR 2ND SUSPECT IN TEACHER'S SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trial of a second man accused of torturing and
murdering Jonathan M. Levin, a popular public high school English
teacher, opened Wednesday with the defense saying that prosecutors
cannot link the defendant in any way to the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Eugene Hurley, the lead prosecutor, said that a confession
made to the police by the defendant, Montoun T. Hart, and a witness
who saw him withdrawing money from Levin's bank account proved
Hart's role in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Hart and Corey Arthur, a 20-year-old
former student of Levin's, planned to rob the teacher together on
May 30, 1997. Levin, the son of Gerald A. Levin, the chairman of
Time-Warner Inc., was tortured with a steak knife in his Manhattan
apartment until he gave up the access code to his bank card. After
Hart withdrew $800 from Levin's bank account, they said, Arthur
shot his former teacher execution style to prevent him from
identifying his former student to police.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur was convicted of second-degree murder in November and
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Hart, 27, faces the same
term if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Opening arguments were given in the case Wednesday in State
Supreme Court in Manhattan and revealed that the defense of Hart,
like that of Arthur, would focus on police conduct in the case.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, Hart's lawyer, said that his client was drunk when
he was questioned by police and he sought to cast doubt on his
client's alleged confession. ``The police were willing to do almost
anything to get statements out of him,'' Stern said. ``They were
prepared to lie to him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Hart confessed on June 7 only after
police detectives misled him. Hart first maintained that he did not
expect Arthur to rob Levin.
</P>
<P>
   But detectives falsely told Hart that Arthur had implicated him,
according to court papers. Hart then admitted planning the robbery
with Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the confession was properly obtained, and
Hurley promised to produce other evidence showing that the two men
were together that day.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley opened his case with the same dramatic evidence that he
did in the trial of Arthur. A medical examiner described Levin's
body, and a tape from Levin's answering machine was played,
beginning with a call from Arthur and followed by messages from
worried friends, and finally, the medical examiner's office asking
whether police officers had arrived.  &QL;

 &HT;    `Sales tax holiday' dies as revenue estimate falls
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While holding firm to his plan to cut local
school property taxes by $2 billion, Gov. George W. Bush is
dropping a proposed $100 million break in consumer sales taxes, an
aide said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander this month lowered the
estimated amount of money the state will have for the next two
years by $700 million, Bush said, ``The only conservative, fiscally
responsible response is for all of us to adjust our budget
proposals accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Bush will lay out his proposed state spending plans for
the next two budget years, which begin Sept. 1. While campaigning
for re-election, the governor had proposed $4.4 billion worth of
tax cuts and additional state spending. That included $2 billion in
school property tax cuts; $1.6 billion for teachers and schools;
$400 million in sales tax cuts; and $300 million in business tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the sales tax cut proposal, Bush wanted to grant
Texans a ``sales tax holiday'' _ a two-week period before school
during which no sales taxes would be collected on the sale of
school clothing or footwear.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor
will drop the tax holiday idea _ a $100 million proposal _ from his
spending package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We revised some of our proposals to reflect the new, lower
revenue estimate,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the governor did not have to cut much more from his tax
and school spending proposals because he never advocated spending
all of the money expected to be available.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rylander, the state will have $94.1 billion
available in the two-year budget period. That's $700 million less
than an earlier projection by former Comptroller John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant and chairman of the
budget-writing Finance Committee, has said it could be difficult to
pay for all of Bush's proposals. Even though the state will have
about $5.3 billion more in the next budget cycle than it has in the
current budget, much of that is consumed by the higher cost of
maintaining obligations such as education and prisons, Ratliff
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ratliff said he needs to see the details of Bush's
budget before he can say whether everything can be included.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of this whole session is the debate between
education and tax cuts,'' Ratliff said. ``Everything else is almost
miscellaneous. How much (more to) education and how much (in) tax
cuts?''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said lawmakers are likely to first increase the amount
spent on education before cutting any taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll put education above tax cuts, but how much for each
will be the story of the session,'' he said.

SUSPECT IN DRAGGING DEATH CLAIMS `SYSTEM IS TURNING AGAINST ME' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ As lawyers plodded through the laborious process
of picking the jury that will decide his fate, one of three white
men charged with dragging a black man to death behind a pickup last
summer lashed out at the citizens of Jasper in a letter to the
town's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why you are so eager to condemn me for this man's
murder when no testimony has yet been heard,'' John William
``Bill'' King, 24, of Jasper, wrote to Michael Journee, managing
editor of the Jasper News Boy, which published the letter
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   King faces a possible death sentence in the June 7 murder of
James Byrd Jr., 49. King's former prison buddy, Lawrence Russell
Brewer, 31, and home-town friend Shawn Allen Berry, 23, will be
tried later on capital murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is turning against me; but I still have law and
order in my heart,'' King wrote the twice-weekly newspaper in two
pages of neatly written script. He called the residents of Jasper
``hypercritical'' and wrote, ``I'm simply a victim of a judicial
conspiracy as well as the District Attorney's personal animosity
for a non-Christian, ex-convict whose (sic) adorned with skin art
mildly offensive to his and Jasperites, religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   King's many tattoos include a woodpecker peeking out from under
a Ku Klux Klan hood, a black man hanging and Nazi-like ``SS''
symbols. All were hidden under his clothes Wednesday. Barely
visible was a pentagram under the close-cropped hair on the back of
his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   King said he will ``not dwell on my suspicions nor argue on
innocence believed by few ... but there comes a time when legal
proceedings come in direct conflict with a town plagued with
political correctness and one's personal animosity.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended the letter: ``I only wish to leave the people of Jasper
with these few words: Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand; so
judge not lest thee be judged. ``My hands are clean; the stain is
on my heart ...'' _ Euripides.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs and Brack Jones said
they had no idea until the Jasper paper was published Wednesday
that King had written the letter. King gave the letter to Sheriff
Billy Rowles to deliver to the newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have advised him not to send letters,'' Jones said, ``but
he doesn't always follow our advice.''
</P>
<P>
   King wrote a letter to the Dallas Morning News last fall in
which he claimed that Berry dropped him off at his Jasper apartment
before Byrd was killed. King claimed Berry killed Byrd after a deal
to buy illegal steroids fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, have said that Byrd's blood was found on
the shoes of all three suspects and that other personal items and
DNA samples found at the scene implicate all three.
</P>
<P>
   King, who appeared in court Wednesday in a white turtleneck
shirt and dark jacket, seemed calm as he took notes while
prospective jurors were individually questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Around his waist he wore a device that can deliver a 50,000-volt
shock to his kidney area at the touch of a button on one of two
remote controls held by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers questioned 16 prospective jurors Wednesday as part of
the process of picking the 12 jurors _ and two alternates _ who
will hear testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on a case like this where we went through
jurors so fast,'' Cribbs said. ``The district attorney doesn't ask
them any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said a lengthy questionnaire
filled out by each of the 122 prospective jurors greatly speeds up
the process.
</P>
<P>
   One would-be panel member spent barely two minutes on the
witness stand. He told lawyers that he not only would never impose
the death penalty, but wouldn't convict anybody of a crime unless
he saw him commit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good seeing you,'' state District Judge Joe Bob
Golden quipped as he told the man he was exempted.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 13 are now on the short list of potential jurors _ six
white men, three white women, two black men and two black women.
Three white men, two white women and a black woman were excused
Wednesday because they were either sick or said they couldn't
impose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   As one white man, who appeared to be suffering from flulike
symptoms left the stand, Gray motioned toward Cribbs and quipped,
``breathe on that lawyer as you go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in those who made the potential jurors list was a black
man who said he used to hang out with Berry when they were about 18
to 20 years old and said he knew King in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Another prospective juror said Rowles once saved his life by
pulling him out of a wreck between his vehicle and a train. He
looked at King and said, ``I was once heading toward the same road
as that young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another to make the list is a Texas Department of Public Safety
officer headquartered in Orange who said he was a patrol partner
with Rowles for 13 years. He said that while he took no part in the
investigation of the Byrd case, he did help draw up security plans
for visits to Jasper by Ku Klux Klan and black militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs said just because the officer made it to the jury pool
doesn't mean he'll be on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said his former partner might not make such a good juror
for the prosecution. ``He'll make them cross all their t's and dot
all their i's,'' Rowles said. ``They'd have to prove everything to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers plan to certify at least 46 people for the pool. Each
side will be allowed to strike 16 names from the jury list. The
first dozen who aren't struck by either side will be on the jury
and the next two will be alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers had said Tuesday, when only three of 10 prospective
jurors were qualified for the pool, that they were concerned about
being able to certify enough jurors from the 122 called.
</P>
<P>
   Golden on Wednesday decided that if necessary, the group of 140
prospective jurors called for civil jury duty Feb. 1 will be added
to the pool for King's jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jones noted that Jasper County Judge Joe Folk and a justice of
the peace are on the Feb. 1 list.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, security at the 110-year-old Jasper courthouse
remains tight. Although officials said they've gotten no threats of
violence, FBI agents instructed courthouse workers Wednesday on
ways to detect mail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in King's trial is due to start in mid-February.

 &HT;    Austin judge inspires call for child aid
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Swayed by an emotional appeal from a local
judge, Gov. George W. Bush asked lawmakers Wednesday to pay for 380
new caseworkers for the state agency that investigates child abuse
and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the State address, Bush said the money is needed
so Child Protective Services can ``rescue children before they
become a tragic statistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, 176 children were killed by abusive parents or
caretakers. For every one who dies, countless others suffer in
anonymity. This breaks my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also called for more money for child care for
mothers on welfare, more money for transition benefits for people
moving from welfare to work, ``second-chance homes'' for unwed
teen-age mothers and approval of a ``Good Samaritan'' bill to limit
lawsuits against medical professionals who volunteer their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor's call for more Child
Protective Services workers was sparked by a petition from state
District Judge Scott McCown of Austin, who oversees placement of
abused and neglected children into safe homes. McCown in October
warned that agency caseworkers were overburdened and unable to
follow up on reports of children living in potentially dangerous
situations.
</P>
<P>
   A state study this month found that the number of Texas children
known to have died from abuse or neglect rose more than 70 percent
between 1997 and 1998, from 103 to 176 deaths.

<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ The Clinton administration formally
announced a far-reaching plan on Wednesday to end the fighting in
Kosovo that calls for NATO airstrikes if the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, refuses to grant Kosovo autonomy. Talks between
the two sides are expected to begin next week in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If ethnic Albanian separatists who have been fighting for
independence resist the plan, NATO could impose a blockade on the
coast of Albania to cut off the flow of arms to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they wanted a political settlement
``within a matter of weeks,'' as one put it, or else Milosevic
would be bombed into compliance. The plan is to begin with
intensifying diplomatic and military threats in the next several
days by NATO representatives and European and Russian foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The key elements of the plan were announced by the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, during a trip by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The plan differs markedly from an American-brokered cease-fire
effort last fall because it demands, under the threat of force, a
resolution of the political status of Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia that has an overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian
population.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the British Foreign Office said Wednesday night
that the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair was in ``broad
agreement'' with the administration's strategy, including the
sequence of events Washington has sketched out for the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which has been less enthusiastic about
the threat of airstrikes, has not publicly endorsed the plan but
apparently signed on late Wednesday night. During Albright's visit
to Moscow on Wednesday, before she continued to the Middle East,
the Russians, who have the most influence on the Serbs, repeated
their opposition to the use of force but went further than before
in their support for a political settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration's plan was the toughest so far, it
appeared to be fraught with obstacles. It called for the imposition
of a political settlement on two sides who have not even met face
to face. Neither the Serbs nor the ethnic Albanians have come close
to nibbling at an autonomy plan that has been proffered to them in
the past several months by an American negotiator, Christopher
Hill, ambassador to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they believed they could persuade a ``critical
mass'' of ethnic Albanians to sit down at the negotiating table,
although the Albanian factions have been bitterly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Albright put pressure on the so-called contact group of six
nations overseeing the former Yugoslavia to agree to the
combination of force and diplomacy by saying she would not attend
the group's meeting on Friday unless it was followed by a NATO
order authorizing the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   But she announced here late Wednesday night that ``having
achieved agreement with our allies on a strategy,'' she would go to
the London meeting to help carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies have been propelled to act on Kosovo after the
massacre nearly two weeks ago of 45 ethnic Albanians by Serbian
forces broke the cease-fire there.
</P>
<P>
   Each side in the conflict, which erupted a year ago, has been
provoking the other in recent weeks with hostage taking,
intermittent fighting and targeted killings. The Serbian forces,
under the control of Milosevic and now in Kosovo well beyond the
numbers allowed under last fall's cease-fire, have been singled out
by the administration for most of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus also comes in part from the fear among NATO members
that fighting in the province, even though it is in a remote corner
of Europe, will prove embarrassing just as NATO is celebrating its
50th anniversary in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official with Albright alluded to the
specter of an embarrassing spectacle of fighting in Kosovo during
the NATO gala, saying, ``We have to take very firm and determined
action, or we're going to be sorry in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate steps laid out by the administration are scheduled
to culminate in a vote this weekend by the 16 NATO allies on
whether to authorize NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to carry
out airstrikes if the talks fail. The authorization for airstrikes
is what the administration has termed the necessary ``credible
force'' against Milosevic. Planes from the United States, Britain,
Italy and other NATO members are expected to participate in any
airstrikes on Serbian targets within and outside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions for airstrikes _ such as when they might actually
begin _ were being negotiated at a closed meeting of NATO
ambassadors Wednesday night in Brussels, NATO diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was authorized to use force last fall during negotiations
with Milosevic for a cease-fire in Kosovo, but the authorization
was suspended when the Yugoslav leader backed down.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, according to the outline of its strategy,
believes that under the weight of an authorization of force
Milosevic is in the end likely to back off again.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the plan, Rubin declined to address the question of
whether American ground troops would be involved in either
enforcing a peace settlement or filling a vacuum after any
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   But the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, did not shut
the door to the participation by American troops in a NATO
peace-keeping operation in Kosovo. U.S. troops are part of a NATO
stabilization force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Office officials said on Wednesday that Britain
was willing ``in principle'' to contribute to ground forces in
Kosovo under the auspices of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could end up with the threat of airstrikes but the reality
of ground troops,'' a NATO diplomat in Brussels said on Wednesday.
The Russians, the diplomat noted, do not oppose NATO ground troops
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the plan is scheduled to take place in
Brussels on Thursday, when NATO is expected to issue a warning to
Milosevic, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was not expected to contain much muscle but was
intended, according to the NATO diplomat, to provide a
``psychomilitary environment'' for the meeting in London of the
contact group, which consists of Russia, the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy. It is possible that General
Clark will fly to Belgrade on Friday to deliver the warning
personally to Milosevic, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is the meeting on Friday of the contact group,
which is to oversee the talks between the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The plan echoes some aspects of the Dayton Accord, which ended
the war in Bosnia, by calling the two sides to a conference table
and demanding a settlement within a tight time frame.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Dayton, which was brokered by the United States, the
talks on a Kosovo settlement would be conducted under the auspices
of the contact group. The co-chairmen of the talks are expected to
be Hill and a European Union envoy, Wolfgang Petritsch from
Austria, an administration official said. The site for the talks
has not been decided, the official said, but suggestions have
ranged from Vienna to a remote United States air base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be offered at the talks would be some expanded
variation on the plan that Hill has been discussing with both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   This plan envisions giving the ethnic Albanians, who make up
more than 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, control of the
legislature, police, judiciary and other functions of government.
Kosovo would remain a province of Serbia, however.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   On running for president: ``The answer to the big question is: I
really don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the attention attracted by his potential candidacy:
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin this session with a national spotlight on us. I have
been asked about it. You have been asked about it. You didn't ask
for it, but it is here anyway. And we can either view it as a
distraction or seize it as an opportunity to show the world what
limited and constructive government looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   On how to spend the surplus: ``We must meet basic needs,
dedicate the lion's share of new money to public schools, then send
money back to the hands who earned it _ the taxpayers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   On the value of a property tax cut: ``It will encourage home and
property ownership that is the heart of the Texas dream, and it
will maintain the state's share of funding for our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   On improving public schools: ``You and I have high expectations
for every child, and we must have high standards to match those
hopes ... That goal requires good places to learn and good people
to teach. Our teachers are the lifeblood of our schools, so I ask
you to send 1 million additional dollars to local districts to
raise salaries or hire more teachers to reduce class size.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion: ``No matter where you stand on this next issue, I
believe we all want to reduce the number of abortions in Texas. I
look forward to working ... to pass a bill to involve parents in
major medical decisions for their minor daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   On what government cannot do: ``Government programs cannot solve
all our problems. People of good will must help, what I call the
little armies of compassion which are transforming our state one
heart, one soul and one conscience at a time.''

POPE URGES U.S. TO END DEATH PENALTY, RACISM

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Pope John Paul II called for Americans to do away
with the death penalty, end racism and uphold the family as the
foundation of society Wednesday, the final day of his six-day
pastoral trip to this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating Mass before 100,000 people, the pope said, ``Modern
society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively
denying criminals the chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made
most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death
penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics pilgrims, many of whom traveled hundreds of miles and
waited six hours to be part of the Mass, cheered and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Although fewer in number, the crowd seemed no less enthusiastic
than the 1 million people the pope attracted to a Mass in Mexico
City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, there are more than 3,510 people on death
row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. At 6 p.m.
CST Tuesday, just hours after the pope flew into St. Louis from
Mexico City, death row inmate Martin Vega was executed by injection
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a planned execution in Missouri, which would have
occurred during the papal visit, was postponed by the state Supreme
Court until Feb. 10 after officials realized the dates coincided. A
Vatican official called the postponement a ``mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Mass, John Paul II urged believers to envision the new
millennium as a time to preach ``the truth that the gospel of God's
love for man, the gospel of the dignity of the person and the
(Christian) gospel'' are one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of God's gift of life
and love?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The pope offered wayward Catholics, apparently including
divorced people, an olive branch, urging they return to the church.
``Christ is seeking you out and inviting you back to the community
of faith,'' he said, assuring even people who may be barred from
taking communion of ``God's love and mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the church ``looks forward to the millennium as a time
of far-reaching spiritual renewal,'' bringing ``a new springtime of
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   A buoyant, cheering crowd welcomed his arrival at the Trans
World Dome in the bulletproof popemobile. The overflow faithful
watched on jumbo television screens in adjoining halls.
</P>
<P>
   Concelebrating Mass with the pope were 1,000 priests and 200
cardinals and bishops who assembled on an altar stage located
beneath a 45-foot aluminum copy of the Gateway Arch, St. Louis'
famous landmark. Built in 1965, the 630-foot arch celebrates the
city's 19th-century role as a gateway to westward expansion.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 131,000 communion wafers, baked by local nuns, were
distributed. A large choir sang, backed up by an orchestra of local
symphony artists.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour service, considered among one of the largest indoor
Masses in U.S. history, included a colorful procession of vested
clergy, acolytes and banners. There was the pungent smell of
incense, the wide-eyed stares of toddlers and the tear-streaked
faces of young nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Lay people, including several women, read Scripture. A
multiethnic procession of African-American, Hispanic, Vietnamese
and Anglo families brought forth the communion elements, presenting
them to the pontiff. He blessed each presenter, reaching around a
father to ruffle the hair of one frightened little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Music echoing from many corners of Catholicism's culturally
diverse, 1-billion-member worldwide flock wafted through the Mass.
Especially upbeat was the pre-communion hymn by the Papal Gospel
Choir with a shoulder-swaying lead singer belting out, ``God Gets
the Glory!''
</P>
<P>
   Because the papal Mass was broadcast throughout the world, the
litany of prayers was offered in English, Spanish, German, French,
Vietnamese and Polish, John Paul II's native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims rose as early as 2 a.m. to gulp down breakfast and then
board buses to downtown St. Louis to the cavernous Trans World
Dome, which rises 204 feet high and covers 14 acres. Many came by
car or bus from other Midwestern states such as Illinois and Ohio.
Others drove even farther, determined to see the frail, 78-year-old
pontiff on what many believe will be his last visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the dome, eager, but hungry Mass goers had lined up 25
deep to buy bratwurst by 3 a.m. A vendor had sold 60 pounds by 9
a.m. and had another 180 pounds roasting to sell after the Mass
ended.
</P>
<P>
   On the corner of Tucker and Olive streets, just a few blocks
from the dome, 24-year-old Brian Decker had been waiting since 4:30
a.m. to fulfill somebody else's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandparents always wanted to see the pope and they died
before they got the chance,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather was a factory worker, my grandmother was a
homemaker. Grandad was in the Knights of Columbus, my Grandma
cleaned the church, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   They had been trying to save money for a trip to Rome, Decker
said, but life always got in the way. And when his grandfather was
diagnosed with cancer, his treatment wiped out the travel fund.
Decker's grandfather died in 1994 and his grandmother followed him
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   So when the pontiff came speeding around the corner in the
popemobile _ almost a blur, but only 20 feet away _ Decker whooped,
his face flushed bright red, and he wept a little for George and
Anna Fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to fulfill the dreams of those who came before
you,'' Decker said. ``I'm here for them as much as myself.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Toni Turner is not a Catholic, and didn't have tickets for any
of the papal events, but was excited enough about the pope's visit
that she and her family stayed in a downtown hotel Wednesday night
to ensure they could get to the parade route in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you surprised there aren't more people?'' she asked.
``I think the media coverage (predicting gridlock) is a huge reason
people don't turn out for these things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the throngs who clustered in Mexico City for John Paul
II's motorcade, crowds were relatively sparse in St. Louis for the
pope's motorcade to-and-from the dome. Many city residents had the
day off from work, and the weather was so unseasonably warm _ a
balmy 58 degrees, 37 degrees higher than normal _ that one local
morning TV reporter kept urging residents to turn out for a glimpse
of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch with cardinals and bishops at St. Louis Archbishop
Justin Rigali's residence, John Paul II attended an evening prayer
service at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. Some 90
non-Catholic religious leaders were invited and a rabbi read a
Scripture passage.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic vespers service stressed the pontiff's continuing
commitment to interfaith cooperation, a theme emphasized here and
in Mexico, even though he also warned Catholics not to be wooed
away by evangelical Protestant sects.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff gave a brief address at the Cathedral Basilica of
St. Louis, thanking the city, the state and the nation for its
hospitality before traveling by limousine to Lambert St. Louis
International Airport. There he met briefly with Vice President Al
Gore, who also was present at the vespers service. At the airport,
Gore saw him off on his departure flight to Rome.

EDITORIAL: SCRIPTING THE LAST ACT   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Senate definitely has established that it lacks the
votes to remove President Clinton, it owes the nation a swift
completion of the impeachment trial. The aggressive talk by the
House managers and their Republican brethren in the Senate about
further truth-seeking cannot change the fact that 44 Democrats
voted Wednesday to dismiss the case, leaving the Senate at least 11
votes short of the 67 required to discharge Clinton. The actions of
the Senate and the White House in the days ahead should be guided
by that granite fact.
</P>
<P>
   That places a burden on everyone involved to settle for an
endgame that falls short of their preferred strategy. For the House
impeachment managers, it means limiting the time and scope of their
questioning of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney
Blumenthal. For Clinton it may require forgoing some legal steps
that would rightfully be his due in a criminal trial but seem
unlikely to serve his interests in the final phases of this
political proceeding. The Senate, for its part, must put the trial
on a fast track and set a firm date for wrapping up.
</P>
<P>
   The makings of such a compromise seemed at hand, though Trent
Lott and Tom Daschle, the Republican and Democratic leaders, were
unable to close a deal. Lott predicted they would have one ready
for Senate consideration Thursday.. It is a particularly delicate
proposition for Lott, who wants to end the case as soon as
possible. But he cannot appear to be bullying or ignoring the
members of his own party in the Senate and the House who fervently
wish to see Clinton removed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the votes to extend the trial and to question the three
witnesses divided along party lines _ only the Democrat Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin broke ranks _ a spirit of bipartisanship
still seemed to be alive. Most senators appeared to favor a plan
that would hold the questioning of each witness to six hours or
less, evenly divided between the House managers and White House
lawyers. If so, the depositions, which may be videotaped, could be
completed by Monday and reviewed by the Senate early next week.
There should be no need for the witnesses to appear before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House cannot be expected to renounce its right to call
its own witnesses or to review undisclosed evidence that the House
managers seek to introduce during their questioning of Ms.
Lewinsky, Jordan or Blumenthal. But the need to exercise these
rights of due process would be greatly reduced if the Senate
restricted the examination of witnesses to the impeachment record
now before the Senate. Greg Craig, one of Clinton's lawyers, wisely
suggested after Wednesday's votes that the White House, despite
earlier threats, would work to speed rather than to impede
completion of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also needs to devise a plan for final action on the
impeachment articles that is consistent with the Constitution while
leaving room for the Senate to write an official condemnation of
Clinton's conduct. We continue to believe that the cleanest, best
way to do so is to vote on the two articles of impeachment _
acquitting Clinton of removable offenses _ and then strongly rebuke
the president in a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has outlined another approach that could produce a form of
censure supported only by Republicans. The plan may also be
constitutionally unsound. Lott would have the Senate vote first on
``findings of fact,'' affirming that Clinton committed the offenses
described in the articles. The Senate would then vote on the
articles, with acquittal meaning that the Senate did not consider
the offenses to be high crimes that would prevent Clinton from
finishing his term.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to think the trial can be completed by
mid-February, the goal set by Lott. All the parties, including the
House managers, now say they want to move promptly. The American
people most certainly would not object.

Exchange Commission about problems with stock trades on the
Internet, prompting the chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt Jr., to
urge that investors use caution.
</P>
<P>
   Online trading, which has been growing rapidly, has caused many
misunderstandings about the risks involved, Levitt said. And,
earlier this week, the National Association of Securities Dealers
recommended that brokerage firms begin to take steps to educate
investors and tell them of possible delays and other potential
problems.

in U.S. District Court Thursday to face criminal fraud charges that
they masterminded a scheme to defraud investors.

   STOCKS DECLINE ON PROFIT-TAKING
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for the first time in three sessions as investors
took profits. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 124.35 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 9,200.23. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
slipped 9.14 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,243.17. And
the Nasdaq composite index declined 26.27 points, or 1.1 percent,

<P>
   COMPAQ PROFIT BEATS FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer said its fourth-quarter results reached a record
$758 million, surpassing Wall Street estimates. But investors were
not impressed. Shares of Compaq fell $1.75, to $47.50, after rising
5.5 percent on Tuesday when the company announced that it planned a
public offering of a stake in Alta Vista, its Internet search
engine.

EDITORIAL: JORDAN'S NEXT KING   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 28:
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of potentially great consequence in the Middle
East. A week after returning home, King Hussein of Jordan
unexpectedly flew back to the Mayo Clinic for treatment of a
recurrence of cancer. Just before departing he overturned
long-established succession plans and named his eldest son, Prince
Abdullah, as crown prince and heir to the throne. The change
relegated Prince Hassan, the king's younger brother and
longstanding heir apparent, to a lesser role and exposed a bitter
family quarrel that could resurface after the king's death.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, senior statesman of the Arab world and Jordan's ruler
since 1952, has played an exceptional role in reducing Middle East
tensions. Future stability and peace in the region will rest in no
small measure on a smooth succession and on whether Crown Prince
Abdullah demonstrates the same commitment to reconciliation as his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Through secret contacts with Israeli leaders in the early 1970s
Hussein opened the first diplomatic communications between Israel
and the Arab world. By renouncing Jordan's claims to the West Bank
in the 1980s he helped make possible the Oslo peace agreements
between Israel and the Palestinians. In 1994, Jordan became the
second Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel. Since then
the king has intervened at critical moments, most recently by
leaving his sickbed last October to help President Clinton rescue
stalemated summit talks between Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling Jordan would challenge any leader. The country was
artificially created by the British Empire, lacks natural resources
and is divided between a native Bedouin minority and a restless
Palestinian majority. In recent years its economy has been hurt by
sanctions against Iraq, formerly Jordan's leading trading partner.
Hussein's personal strengths have held the country together.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Hassan is an aloof intellectual who inspired little
affection among ordinary Jordanians or politically important army
officers. He unwisely distanced himself from Jordanians of
Palestinian origin while Hussein preached conciliation. He
infuriated the king by acting as though the throne were already his
and maneuvering to insert his own son into the line of succession.
This prompted a sharp royal letter of rebuke made public this week.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah is popular in the army, where he has spent
his career, and has traveled internationally on his father's
behalf. He is 36 years old and has a Palestinian wife. But he is
untested in a political world where any stumble could fracture
Jordan's internal stability. If Israel and the Palestinians can
complete the peace they have begun, the violent conflicts that have
shaped the region for so long may subside. While he has the
strength, Hussein can help lead his neighbors to that goal. Then it
will be Prince Abdullah's responsibility.

DIGNIFIED CONCLUSION TO IMPEACHMENT TRIAL PROVES ELUSIVE FOR
REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans may have won Wednesday's vote summoning
witnesses to the impeachment trial, but they got no closer to a
timely, dignified conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, by mustering 44 votes to drop the case without
witnesses, Democrats now claim hardened proof that further trial
proceedings are frivolous because the GOP lacks the two-thirds
majority needed to oust Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any proceedings from this day forward only serve to delay
final resolution of this matter,'' White House counsel Gregory
Craig told reporters after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   For that majority of Americans who were hoping for a prompt
conclusion to the trial, the problem is now more evident than ever.
While the Senate's Republican majority controls the process, the
Democrats hold sway over the outcome, and neither party seems able
to entice members of the opposition into the breaking of ranks that
will be necessary to end the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's two votes _ one to continue the trial, and a second
to take depositions from three witnesses _ were almost strictly
along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   After the votes had been cast, neither party could claim
victory. Each side still lacked a graceful exit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best hopes for compromise had still not demonstrated
enough crossover appeal to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   These were the most promising plans to create a moveable middle
ground:
</P>
<P>
   _A proposal by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Carl Levin,
D-Mich., for a harshly worded censure resolution against Clinton.
The resolution would provide Democrats, and possibly some
Republicans, with enough political cover to acquit Clinton without
appearing to go easy on him.
</P>
<P>
   _A proposal by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, for the Senate to
approve ``findings of fact'' against Clinton. The vote, requiring a
simple majority, would determine that Clinton, in fact, committed
perjury or obstruction of justice, as charged. But this vote,
unlike the final impeachment verdict to follow, would lack the
power to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said many senators want to see Clinton held officially
responsible for covering up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, even
if the Senate acquits him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are very concerned about the message that would be
sent to the American public and to the White House if there is a
vote to acquit the president in the face of evidence that he may
have, in fact, committed some obstruction of justice,'' Collins
said. ``So we are looking for ways to separate the issue of whether
or not the president committed the offense . . . from the issue of
whether or not the offenses are sufficient to warrant his removal
from office.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats were skeptical. If Republicans are so eager to
follow the Constitution, they said, then why did Collins outline a
plan not contemplated under impeachment rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming weight of opinion among Constitutional
scholars . . . is that you cannot separate conviction and removal,
that the Constitution makes clear that if the Senate votes (with a
two-thirds majority) for conviction, that automatically means
removal from office,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the Constitution permits lawmakers to
pass ``sense of the Senate'' resolutions on an unlimited number of
subjects, including impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all of their disagreements, Republicans and Democrats
seem to want essentially the same thing: a way out.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's acquittal almost a foregone conclusion, each side
wants the trial resolved in the next few weeks in a manner that
demonstrates their concern about the president's poor conduct.
</P>
<P>
   So why can't the parties agree on a means to meet their common
goal?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in the fact that politics isn't about merely
trying to do the right thing. It's about trying to do the right
thing AND gain political advantage (or at least to suffer the
minimum possible losses) at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, both sides, while they may want a swift and just end to
the trial, can't help but examine how it's all playing out to the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   As much as they want to end the trial, they also want to be able
to blame each other if the outcome goes awry. Avoiding that is
virtually the definition of a graceful exit. &QL;

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S RETURN TO AUSTERITY   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 28:
</P>
<P>
   After coasting to re-election last year, Gov. George Pataki has
suddenly discovered that New York state is in a fiscal jam. Looming
budget deficits, he declared Wednesday, will require cuts in school
aid, college tuition assistance and payments to hospitals, nursing
homes and community health clinics _ not exactly the feel-good
message he delivered a few months ago. Pataki's new $73 billion
budget penalizes New York City, reversing his pledge to bring the
city up to its fair share of state school aid. It also fails
generally to address the underlying causes of the state's problems,
which are of Pataki's own making.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the governor and the Legislature increased spending by
8 percent, and Pataki was roundly criticized by business groups and
many conservatives. Now, in reverting to austerity, he is sending a
signal to the national Republican Party that he is back in the fold
and ready for the national ticket. But the governor is displaying
his credentials by punishing those least able to afford cuts in the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reductions are to be in Medicaid reimbursements to
providers of health care for the poor, the elderly and the
uninsured. A recent state audit found that hospitals are running
surpluses, but the hospitals themselves are warning that a cutback
will translate into layoffs and service reductions. The Legislature
must insure that any spending restraints do not sacrifice physician
training and health care for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks in these areas are especially unacceptable because the
governor wants to use most of the money from settlement of the
lawsuit against tobacco companies for long-term debt reduction
instead of health programs, a more appropriate recipient.
</P>
<P>
   As for education, the small school aid increase would go
disproportionately to the suburbs and upstate, keeping New York
City's share of state aid well below its fair share based on
student population. City Hall asserted Wednesday that the governor
was rescinding aid to reduce class size and help with early
childhood education that he agreed to last year. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani should demand that Pataki live up to his promises, and
Sheldon Silver, speaker of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, is
right to try to reverse the health and education features of the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In purely fiscal terms, Pataki adopted a cautious approach. He
wants to use most of the tobacco money to pay down skyrocketing
debts for which he was criticized in the campaign last year. He
also wants to use the $1.8 billion surplus in the current year for
a rainy-day contingency fund and to help close deficits two and
three years from now. That is far preferable to the Legislature's
desire to spend it for more tax cuts and additional programs in the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the state still faces multibillion-dollar deficits in the
years ahead because of the practice of enacting tax cuts and new
programs that will explode in size without identifying the
resources to pay for them. A more sensible approach would be to put
off the huge tax cuts already enacted until it is clear the state
can afford them.

SENATE VOTE INDICATES REPUBLICANS LOSING FIGHT TO REMOVE CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans got a clear signal Wednesday that they
are losing the fight to remove President Clinton from office, but
sought to extend the war with Democrats over the first impeachment
trial of a president in nearly 131 years by allowing further
testimony from key witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Voting along party lines, all 55 Republicans and a lone Democrat
voted to give House prosecutors one last try to keep alive their
perjury and obstruction of justice case against the president by
approving their request to take depositions from three witnesses to
help clear up discrepancies in the record.
</P>
<P>
   But the key vote of the day came on a motion to dismiss the two
House-passed articles of impeachment against Clinton offered by
Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Byrd's motion drew
support from 44 of the 45 Senate Democrats, indicating that the
all-Republican House prosecution team has virtually no chance of
collecting the 67 votes required to convict the 42nd president and
kick him out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will not be removed from office. For the good of
the country and in keeping with the Constitution, it is now time to
end this trial. It is time to move on,'' declared Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., just moments after the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a minute had passed after the votes were taken before
Republican senators were in front of television cameras explaining
why they want to take more depositions in a case where the same
witnesses have been questioned before.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and Susan Collins of
Maine said Republicans were simply trying ``to find the truth'' in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to travel the road wherever it leads, whether
it's to the conviction or the acquittal of the president. But in
order to do that, I need more evidence. I need witnesses and
further evidence to guide me to the right destination, to get to
the truth,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who has suggested that the House
has not met ``the burden of proof'' in his view, said he voted for
witnesses to ensure there would be a complete historical record of
the trial and to give House prosecutors a full hearing on their
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ... playing not just to today's Americans but
tomorrow's Americans. And we understand the judgment of history
will ultimately be rendered in part by how thorough a job we do,
what precedents we establish,'' Smith said. ``I believe we're
walking on sacred constitutional ground. And no one is more weary
of this issue than I am. I was not elected to do this. But it is
our duty now, and I think we should do it right and do it
thoroughly and do it conclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were still hopeful of coming up with a
bipartisan agreement to end the impeachment proceedings by
mid-February. But the votes on dismissal and witnesses made a sham
of the argument put forth by both Republicans and Democrats at the
start of the trial that the Senate impeachment process would play
out in a bipartisan fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Collins said it was her hope ``that now that these
two votes have been taken'' the Senate ``will once again come
together on a bipartisan basis to work to find a procedure to bring
this trial to an expeditious but fair conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agreed that there could be a bipartisan procedural
agreement to limit the time of the trial. But they said the votes
Wednesday showed that there would never be a bipartisan deal that
ends up convicting Clinton of the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, now there's something else that is out there that members
want to continue it for, and I think the American public are going
to ask why?'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``If ... for all
intents and purposes this process was set up to be a judgment about
whether this president's going to be removed from office, the
answer to that was very clear this afternoon. The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., accused the Republicans of
dragging the case out to appease the hard-line conservative wing of
their party, which has been trying to force Clinton from office
since he was first elected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence of partisanship has leaked over from the House''
impeachment proceedings to the Senate, he told CNN. ``I know they'd
like to keep this case going. But the country's tired of it, and
people want their senators to get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vote on witnesses, several Republicans have
indicated that they are likely to vote against convicting Clinton
unless House prosecutors can come up with new evidence or
compelling testimony to convince them otherwise. Recognizing that
fact, Collins has been floating a compromise proposal that would
allow senators to vote up or down on some ``findings of fact''
outlined by House prosecutors separately from the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are very concerned about the message that would be
sent to the American public and to the White House if there is a
vote to acquit the president in the face of evidence that he may
have in fact committed some obstruction of justice,'' she said.
``So we are looking for ways to separate the issue of whether or
not the president committed offenses such as obstruction of justice
from the issue of whether or not the offenses are
(constitutionally) sufficient to warrant his removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Collins has not been able to convince a
majority of Republicans to go that route, much less the Democrats.

SPORTS COLUMN: ONE EMPTY ENVELOPE, ONE EX-JET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One had not been a quarterback for four years, the other
was out of football during the 1996 season after the Jets released
him. Their combined ages total 80, but Steve DeBerg and Bubby
Brister each is now a fallen starter away from being the opposing
quarterbacks in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   If that scenario isn't whacky enough, consider that an empty
envelope might be responsible for DeBerg joining the Atlanta
Falcons as Chris Chandler's backup and that pro football's most
notorious linebacker, Bill Romanowski, recommended Brister to the
Denver Broncos as John Elway's backup.
</P>
<P>
   That empty envelope was addressed to Dan Reeves, but that's all
the Falcon coach received in the mail. DeBerg's letter somehow had
slipped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written to about 20 teams in June, saying I wanted to
play again,'' DeBerg recalled. ``The letter I wrote to Dan came
back to me in Tampa, just the letter. Two or three days later, Dan
called and said, `What's this empty envelope about?' When I told
him I wanted to play again, he was totally silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the letter had been in the envelope that arrived on
Reeves' desk?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' DeBerg said. ``Dan might not have bothered
to call me. He might have just wished me luck like all the other
teams did. Instead, he signed me.''
</P>
<P>
   And now DeBerg, at age 44, is the oldest player ever on a Super
Bowl roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coaching,'' he said, referring to his time as the
Giants' quarterback tutor under Reeves, ``I started thinking I
still had some skills. Just from playing tag football in Tampa
during the 1997 season, I knew I could still throw.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, DeBerg was an experienced quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is now so advanced, so technical,'' he said, ``the
old guy is more valuable than the young guy. Look at what Vinny
Testaverde and Doug Flutie and Randall Cunningham did this season.
The old guy can read defenses. The old guy knows not only what to
do, but what not to do.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg is completing his 18th season in a career that began in
1978 with San Francisco and wound through Denver, Tampa Bay, Kansas
City and Miami before Atlanta. He ranks 10th in National Football
League completions with 2,869 and 13th in passing yardage with
34,156.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're never too old to learn how to get better,'' he
said. ``Working with Chris Chandler, I've learned improved passing
techniques _ the grip on the ball, the angle of your wrist and your
shoulder, getting into the power position, the use of your eyes and
peripheral vision.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chandler sprained his left shoulder and bruised his ribs
against New Orleans, DeBerg hit 7 of 10 passes for 60 yards,
including an 8-yard touchdown, to complete a 32-23 victory. But as
the starter the following week, he was a blitzed 9 for 20 for 117
yards in the Jets' 28-3 rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team didn't understand how good a football team the Jets
had,'' DeBerg said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Chandler goes down Sunday, can DeBerg measure his
teammates for Super Bowl rings?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm here,'' he said. ``That's what I'm preparing
myself for.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the Broncos' Walter Andrew Brister III, nicknamed Bubby as
a little boy by his five older sisters. In his 12th season, at age
36, he spent seven years in Pittsburgh and two in Philadelphia
before joining the Jets that were 3-13 in 1995, Rich Kotite's first
season as coach.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it with those Jets?
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as it gets,'' Brister said. ``After the season Rich
called me and said: `I've got some bad news. We're going to have to
let you go.' I thought it was great news.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent the 1996 season at his native Monroe, La., home before
Romanowski, who had played with Brister on the Eagles in 1994,
recommended him to Coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Brister hardly played for the Broncos in 1997. But when Elway
was out this season, Brister completed 78 of 131 passes for 986
yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I helped us win five games,'' he said, proudly.
</P>
<P>
   If need be on Sunday, Bubby Brister hopes to help the Broncos
win another game. And if need be for the Falcons, Steve DeBerg will
be hoping to help them win.
</P>
<P>
   But if they happen to be out there together, just think of the
game as the Backup Bowl.

   SEAL BEACH, Calif. _ Take a stroll down any oceanside pier.
You'll find families sharing laughs and dangling lines to catch
their dinner. Newcomers fumbling with bait and fouling casts. Salty
old-timers swapping elaborate stories while never losing the
uncanny sense of detecting even the most subtle strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Southern California angling culture that hasn't changed
much since its heyday from the 1880s to 1930s, after piers were
built to receive lumber shipped from the Northwest and before the
advent of affordable charter boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than fishing,'' said Ed Ries, an angling historian
who as a teen-ager in 1930 cast his first line off the Santa Monica
Pier. ``It was a whole new world of outdoors activity and communing
with the sea, the birds, the fish and the people _ the same sort of
thing that draws us to it today. I spent every waking moment I
could on the pier.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mix the ease of gaining experience, that no fishing
license is required, that the initial cost can be a little as $50
for tackle and bait and that a great variety of species can be
caught with little effort and you have a activity that many can't
resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same way my father introduced me to saltwater
fishing,'' said David Anderson of Long Beach as he coached his sons
Mark, 5, and Sean, 8, during a recent outing to the municipal pier
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on fishes, fishes, come on fishes, fishes,'' Mark uttered
in hushed tones. ``The best part is you can catch fish,'' he said,
even though on this overcast morning they hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spoke of the other advantages he sees in wharf-fishing.
``You don't have to go very far from home. It doesn't have the
danger of being out in a boat. No seasickness, or having the boys
get bounced around in the waves or having to wear a lifejacket
that's not comfortable. It's a controlled environment; you can
leave any time. There's no commitment to an all-day boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Because tides and waves and salt air attract all walks of life,
public piers offer the uninitiated a glimpse at the sport of
angling. There is an opportunity to relax in a chair, read a book
and depart for a few hours from workaday stress _ all with the
possibility of catching a legal-size halibut, a tasty corbina or a
medley of croakers, perch and other surf fish, including sharks,
rays and skates.
</P>
<P>
   Children love to peek into buckets and find the surprise of a
lively catch. And even the most grizzled anglers, those seemingly
unapproachable old codgers hunched over their rusty tackle boxes,
warm to company after a while and are glad to share their
experiences and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to fish. I don't come to socialize,'' said William
Walker, 79, of Seal Beach, the morning's success measured by the
eight yellowfin and spotfin croakers in his bucket stationed on the
pier's wooden planks.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I don't think Walker is all business. After a few
seconds of prodding, he lets on: ``You get to meet a lot of real
nice people out here. It's just excellent company.''
</P>
<P>
   He owns a 17-foot Bayliner but prefers the wharf because there's
no gassing up or washing down to worry about. He'll talk about how
as a child in Iowa he and his brother lost a huge fish, probably a
carp, after getting it halfway up a dock. ``I still think I'm
trying to catch that fish.'' He doesn't like to eat fish; no, he
gives all his catches away. ``I've got my friends all loaded up.''
And he'll reminisce about an old acquaintance who used to bounce
bait off the bottom just up the pier a ways and regularly catch
legal halibut. ``I like it best right here, though,'' he said, and
that's where you'll find Walker at least twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to get caught up in fun, and experts like Andy
Menadier of Long Beach make the experience even more enjoyable when
they offer advice and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Have the bait right on the bottom, suggested the slender,
green-eyed guide who specializes in taking clients float-tubing,
surf-casting and pier-fishing. You want the drag tight enough to be
able crank your fish up to the railing of the pier. And keep the
line taut enough so you can feel the difference between the steady
movement of the tidal surges and the more jerky, frantic bites of a
fish: ``You want to be able to tell when you get rattled,''
Menadier said.
</P>
<P>
   He had tied strings of size No. 6 hooks with his skinny, fidgety
fingers. Bloodworms, ghost shrimp and mussels are the baits of
choice for most pier-anglers, and Menadier prefers ``blood'' and
``ghosties.''
</P>
<P>
   The action was slow upon our 6:30 a.m. arrival, but an hour
later we pulled four yellowfin croaker over the railing in quick
succession. Surf fish swim in schools; you can wait for hours for a
bite, then, just like that, they'll hit fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bye-bye, baby,'' Menadier gestured after releasing the last of
the bunch. ``Now we're cooking with gas.''
</P>
<P>
   We caught about a dozen croakers in four hours. Not many, but
there are times when I would gladly trade a higher fish count for
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   And since pier-fishing, like most angling, is a wait-and-see
proposition, there are ample opportunities to hone your skills and
take in the yarns spun by the characters you meet.
</P>
<P>
   Menadier reminded me to ``repair'' my bloodworm when it began
unraveling from the hook. And he told countless fish tales _ how he
once landed a 125-pound bat ray with a 5-foot wingspan but didn't
have a camera on hand and how he saw a dolphin give birth in the
surf. His fiancee won't accompany him to tackle shops anymore
because he gets so entirely lost in the storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Ries vividly recalls the regulars he meet on pier in
the early 1930s, when a big summer run of bonito would draw anglers
elbow to elbow but when more often than not herring, jack smelt and
perch _ bait and trash fish by today's standards _ would serve as
table fare. There was Corbina Man _ a loner who avoided
conversation but would catch corbina in profusion by using gobs of
fresh, juicy mussels tied onto the hook by thread _ and Earthquake
Lady _ who swore the 1933 Long Beach temblor was caused by hot
weather and who got very angry when Ries scoffed at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is more than fishing.

<P>
   SEAL BEACH, Calif. _ Recommendations to make pier-fishing an
enjoyable experience:
</P>
<P>
   __ Deeper water doesn't mean more fish. Many nearshore species,
such as croakers and corbina, prefer the surf line, swimming near
where the breakers hit the beach. Many species can be hooked at
pier's end, including mackerel, sharks, skates, rays and the
occasional halibut, but many of the best-eating fish are closer to
shore.
</P>
<P>
   __ Consult Pages 57-59 of the California Sport Fishing
Regulations handbook for health concerns pertaining to fish
consumption. When in doubt, practice catch and release.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tidal movement is key to nearshore fishing as it stimulates
feeding, and a high incoming tide is like a dinner bell to surf
species.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ask other anglers on the pier for tips on tides and other
fishing suggestions; many are more than willing to share their
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   __ Use a fairly stiff but sensitive 7-foot rod with a spinning
or bait-casting reel capable of holding 200 yards of 12- to
15-pound line.
</P>
<P>
   __ Match the size of the hook to the size of the bait: For
example, No. 6 hooks for bloodworms, Nos. 1/0 or 2/0 for large
ghost shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   __ A 2-ounce claw-foot sinker or other surf sinker tied at
line's end should keep the bait on the bottom, but add weight if
tidal surge demands it.
</P>
<P>
   __ Use only live ghost shrimp; they stay on the hook better and
seem to attract more fish. And the larger the better. Bait prices
(in Seal Beach): ghost shrimp, $3.25/dozen; bloodworms,
$3.25/half-dozen; mussels, $1.95/pound; razor clams,
$2.80/half-pound; frozen anchovies, sardines or squid,
$2.50/1-pound package.
</P>
<P>
   __ Some anglers us grappling-like hooks to scrape mussels off
pier pilings, where permitted. Added bonus: Fish apparently can't
resist the worms that make their homes among the mollusks. Another
way to make bait from the pier is by using bread crumbs or dog food
to lure smelt into butterfly or umbrella nets.
</P>
<P>
   __ While fishing licenses aren't required, anglers must follow
all other ocean-fishing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   __ Observe posted rules: At the Seal Beach Municipal Pier, for
example, no overhand casting is allowed, anglers can use up to two
poles at a time and all fish must be cleaned at the sinks.
</P>
<P>
   __ While underhand casting takes getting used to, it is
important to make casts of 20 feet or more so that there is enough
line out for the bait to be moved around by the tide.
</P>
<P>
   __ When casting, respect the surfers.
</P>
<P>
   __ If you have trouble detecting a strike, clip a bell on the
rod; it acts as a strike alarm. Bells are sold at tackle shops.
</P>
<P>
   __ Veteran pier anglers keep nets to land larger specimens,
especially when the halibut start swimming inshore in spring. Pier
offices also keep nets on hand. Know where to borrow one BEFORE
that big bruiser strikes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Throw back what you won't eat. Nothing is worse than killing
a skate or bat ray as a way to impart to passers-by, ``Look what I
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Have fun and relax. Many anglers spend as much time making
friends, swapping stories and reading books as they do actively
minding their lines.
</P>
<P>
   __ When you do leave your rod unattended, place it against the
rail as close to the tip as possible. If it rests at a spot lower
on the rod, a fish can pull the whole outfit over.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: HARD HITTER WITH ENOUGH CLOUT LEFT
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MIAMI  &UR; _  &LR;  The day before he left Denver for Super Bowl XXXIII,
Steve Atwater lounged on the carpet at home with his sons A.J., 6;
DiAndre, 4, and Paris, 2. Fun time, a frequent time, was about to
begin. Time for Dad to spout stories about his biggest football
hits once again.
</P>
<P>
   So, while his sons sat, enthralled, Atwater began, first by
drawing the plays into the carpet for visual effect, using his
fingers as imaginary pens. No matter how many times Atwater tells
these stories, his kids absolutely love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pass coverage is Cover 2!'' Atwater yells. ``Vinny drops
back to pass! The receiver crosses the field! Oooooohh! I come up
and get the hit! Boooyowl! Blam! The ball pops loose!''
</P>
<P>
   The kids tackle each other and scream. What a scream.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Atwater, the Denver free safety, can draw from 10 Denver
seasons when telling his sons frolicking, fanciful stories about
the time Dad knocked this guy silly or the time Dad knocked that
guy cold. Stories about when the ball popped loose. No National
Football League player over the last decade has been a harder
hitter than Atwater. He is 6 feet 3 inches, 217 pounds, and knows
it. Plays like it. He uses his body like a sledgehammer and the
offensive players he punishes quickly fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver practices, no Bronco relishes running his way and
getting smacked. In the last Super Bowl, Atwater tried to crush
anything that moved. In this Super Bowl, look for him to lock in on
the Falcons and offer more of his tingling blows. He can make it
happen. Turn a game.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but only last year, Atwater, 32, was viewed as a player
on the downside of his career who could no longer pump up the
volume. All those crunching hits were beginning to mount. The wear,
the tear. All those tackles, 1,358 in his career entering Sunday's
game, were taking their toll. One surgery on his right shoulder,
four on his left shoulder and two on his knees were making him
creaky. Peers and coaches said he looked slower, hit more softly,
that he missed too many games two seasons ago because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater says he does not pay attention to what others say. Never
has, he says. But he is true to himself. This is an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'll pop the film in and I'll look back at the 1989
season and I see some things, how I reacted a little quicker,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees how the Steve Atwater of 1999 cannot possibly be the
Steve Atwater of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it's out there that I've slowed down and I'm
getting old and numerous other things, and some of it may be
true,'' he said. ``I'm still playing, playing hard, so I don't see
these things. But in the film from then compared to now, I look and
I see the youth and the spring in my legs and how I was young and
thought that I would run forever without feeling a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, but now I feel it. There are mornings where I reach to
raise my shoulder and it won't go all the way over my head. There
are times I can only lift 90 to 95 percent of what I once did in
the weight room. I run now and one hip is higher than the other
one. Small things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The wear. The tear.
</P>
<P>
   But Atwater still rises. After the 1997 season, he was voted by
his teammates the most courageous Bronco. He missed the first two
exhibition games this season because of a calf strain. But he
played in the final two exhibitions and in all 16 regular-season
games and in both Denver playoff games, soaring to his eighth Pro
Bowl selection.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Louis and bred at the University of Arkansas, where
the wishbone run-oriented offense was then king, Atwater learned
early how to roam from safety and pulverize ball carriers.
Basically, he was a run stopper and hard hitter in college; he had
to learn the finer points of playing pass defense, and his initial
lessons came in a 55-10 pasting by San Francisco in Super Bowl XXIV
after the 1989 season. Atwater was a rookie then and Joe
Montana-to-Jerry Rice, continually splitting the Denver safeties,
tripping Atwater, was the order of that game.
</P>
<P>
   That embarrassing ``blooper,'' as Atwater calls it, humbled him.
It forced him to study and study some more and dissect film and
learn to take each opponent so seriously. It made him yearn for
another chance in the big show, and eight years later he got it,
against Green Bay in last year's Super Bowl. Atwater was ready. He
punished. Won the championship ring. Gained more stories to tell
his sons.
</P>
<P>
   He would like more stories to share, some straight from Super
Bowl XXXIII. Like his parents _ his mother, Jessie, who taught him
the art of responsibility, and his dad, Jeff, who taught him hard
work and offered long ``man-to-man talks on everything'' _ Atwater
wants to instill something extra in his sons. He wants to tell them
not only the stories about hard hits, but also about the hard
lessons he learned. About his stumble, fall and rise to the NFL
elite, and how he stayed there, amidst the doubt, enjoying
longevity and fruitfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that I don't just turn it on now just for big
games in my career, but that I have the same motor all of the
time,'' Atwater said. ``I try to go out and go, all the way, every
play. The Hall of Fame? I've never thought much about that. How
much longer will I play? Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I remember the first time. I was a kid playing sandlot
football in St. Louis and I was running with the ball! I was
moving! Really moving!''
</P>
<P>
   He was excited, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy pulled me down and I got up sore,'' Atwater continued.
``My shoulder was hurt. Bad. I ended up having to go home but there
was a problem: I wasn't supposed to be playing football. I got home
and told my mom a dog was chasing me and I was running from the dog
and ran into a lamppost and hurt my shoulder. It needed surgery. It
was years later, when I was in college, that I told her the truth.
She laughed and said she knew anyway, that there was no way that
was how I was hurt. We both laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Steve Atwater could tell a good story.  &QL;

NOTEBOOK: JET WITH A JET; MEDIA PREVAIL OVER PARCELLS; GOOD-LUCK
UNIFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo., Ga., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Vinny Testaverde, the New York Jet quarterback, said
Wednesday that he had enlisted another kind of jet for off-season
workouts. He bought a jet plane for commuting to the team's drills
from his home in Tampa, Fla., a move that should keep both player
and coach happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a great convenience for me to go back and forth,''
said Testaverde, who is here for Super Bowl week as a finalist for
Miller Lite's National Football League player of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season-workout regimen had been an issue in the early
renegotiating of Testaverde's contract. Coach Bill Parcells had
told the news media that he would not sign a player who did not
agree to the Jets' ``voluntary'' off-season program of 40 workouts.
Testaverde had contended that he had successfully worked out at
home over the years, and that at the age of 35, he wanted to spend
time with his family in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a helicopter business with my agent,'' Testaverde said.
``So now we're buying a jet as well, and I can use it to go from
Tampa to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde said that Parcells' threat, tying the workouts to
being signed, was ``a negotiating ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he thought I'd read it in the newspapers,'' Testaverde
said. ``But I never read the papers, so I heard about it when
reporters mentioned it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who worked out on his own in the off-season last
year and who was signed by the Jets in late June, added: ``I'm not
worried that if I'm not there, it's going to affect me. But I also
understand how Bill thinks it will affect his investment.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the contract talks as ``all coming together well''
and said he expected the deal to be finished after he returned from
the Pro Bowl, which will be in Hawaii on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   League Overrules Parcells
</P>
<P>
   The league has told Bill Parcells that his coaches working with
the American Football Conference squad for the Pro Bowl must be
made available to the news media. On Tuesday, citing health
considerations, Parcells pulled out of the game, but his staff,
headed by Bill Belichick, will do the coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had decreed that none of his coaches could talk to the
news media _ a policy he had instituted on the Jets. He also closed
Jets practices, except during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've informed the Jets and Bill Parcells that the same rules
apply in the Pro Bowl as the Super Bowl,'' said Greg Aiello, a
league spokesman. ``The coaches have to be made available to the
media. The practices will be open and the locker rooms will be open
before and after practice. Whenever the team practices, players and
coaches will be available before and after.''
</P>
<P>
   Is It the Jerseys?
</P>
<P>
   Since their uniforms were redesigned last year, the Denver
Broncos have never lost a game wearing their sharp dark-blue
jerseys with the orange piping. Twenty-one games. Twenty-one
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a pattern here? Quarterback John Elway hopes not. He's
not good about superstitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started getting superstitious about being superstitious,''
he said. ``As you get older, you stop remembering what it was
you're supposed to be superstitious about.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's Super Bowl against Atlanta, the Broncos have been
designated as the road team and will wear their white shirts.
That's the same color they wore when they suffered their only
losses this season, the last one in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Steve Atwater smirked at the suggestion that jersey
colors count. ``The uniforms are no big deal,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacques Lecoq, a mime, theater director and influential teacher,
died on Jan. 19 at a hospital in Paris. He was 77 and lived in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, according to his son
Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   As a mime, Lecoq was not as well known internationally as
Etienne Decroux and Marcel Marceau, a pupil of Decroux. He rarely
performed, or even spoke much about his work. But he was considered
an extraordinary teacher of mime, which he called corporeal
expression. ``Like Grotowski, Lecoq was a master,'' said Jack Lang,
a former French culture minister, in Le Monde last week, referring
to the theater director Jerzy Grotowski. ``He inspired others.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lecoq's celebrated Ecole Jacques Lecoq in Paris, which opened
in 1956 and is now run by his wife, Fay Lees Lecoq, students learn
silent improvisation, the use of masks and techniques of movement
to express ``what lies behind words,'' as Lecoq put it. Students
have included members of the Theatre de Complicite, which he helped
to found, and of the mime ensemble Mummenschanz, as well as the
actor Geoffrey Rush, the directors Ariane Mnouchkine and Steven
Berkoff, the dancer and choreographer Joelle Bouvier, the mime
Avner the Eccentric and the playwright Yasmina Reza (``Art''). His
students also included architects, psychoanalysts and a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   Lecoq became involved in mime in the mid-1940s when, in training
to teach physical education, he met Jean-Louis Barrault and
founding members of L'Education par le Jeu Dramatique, a movement
linked with Antonin Artaud. He worked with small but influential
theater groups, among them that of Jean Daste in Grenoble, where
Lecoq taught movement and gesture and learned about the Japanese
theater of Noh and the use of masks.
</P>
<P>
   Lecoq taught in Germany, moving on to Italy in 1948. In Padua,
the sculptor Amleto Sartori agreed to make commedia dell'arte masks
for him. Lecoq also became close to Giorgio Strehler, organizing
his Piccolo Teatro theater school, and worked at the Cinecitta film
studios with Dario Fo, the Italian comic, actor and playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Lecoq did not admire French mime trends of his time, believing,
he said, that it was important to move ``toward open mime and not
toward the mime which is enclosed in its own silence.'' He trained
his students with strenuous physical and emotional exercises, which
ranged from acrobatics to clowning. Struggling to make their
classmates laugh, students learned to be funny from within
themselves. Wearing masks, they learned how body movements could
turn facial blankness into expression.
</P>
<P>
   Mime, Lecoq taught, was not imitation or even virtuoso
technique. Though disciplined and stylized, good mime could be
spontaneous and even playful. It could ``liberate the body,'' as he
put it, and reveal innate cultural differences among nationalities.
``Now your job is to get over me,'' he told students graduating
from the two-year program.
</P>
<P>
   Lecoq performed a one-man show, ``Tout Bouge'' (``Everything
Moves''), in the 1980s and taught a master class, ``Le Corps des
Choses'' (``The Body of Things''), in Europe and the United States.
``Le Corps Poetique,'' a book of his writing on theater, was
published last year in France and he collaborated on a two-part
documentary, ``Les Deux Voyages de Jacques Lecoq,'' just before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Patrick and his wife, Fay, he is survived
by two other sons, Richard and Francois, and a daughter, Pascale,
all of Paris.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican prosecutors said on Wednesday that
they had chosen three witnesses who could help them make the
broadest and strongest case that President Clinton obstructed
justice, the impeachment article that has drawn the most interest
from senators of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial started three weeks ago, the House prosecutors
were sure that their best chance of convicting Clinton lay in
convincing the senators that the president had lied under oath
before a federal grand jury about his relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, senators squeamish about the sexual aspects of
the perjury charge have focused on obstruction of justice, as the
article that most likely rises to the level of an impeachable
offense. The question now, in many senators' minds, is did it
happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us feel very strongly about the second count, and we
need witnesses to help on that,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon,
one of 56 senators, all but one of them Republicans, who approved
subpoenas for Ms. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction article charges Clinton with having encouraged
Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit and to conceal gifts he had given her. It
contends the president enlisted Jordan's help in finding Ms.
Lewinsky a job to buy her cooperation in the Jones suit, and it
accuses the president of attempting to influence the testimony of
his secretary, Betty Currie, and top aides like Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators seem to relate the perjury charge to sex, and the
president's twisting definitions,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
the House manager who will question Ms. Lewinsky. ``It's an easier
sell job with obstruction of justice. It's about a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., the manager who will interview
Jordan, said, ``Obstruction of justice is extraordinarily
compelling, and goes to the heart of our judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Senate Republicans, the House prosecutors
pared their wish list of witnesses from 15, to five, to three.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they left off the one witness that many Republicans
considered a secret weapon _ Mrs. Currie _ disappointing some
senators who believed she had the most potential to clarify factual
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of making judicious decisions as to which
witnesses would give us the best chance to try to convert people
into a vote for conviction,'' said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But the witness list was a work in progress. On Monday night in
an ornate room off the Senate chamber, Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill.,
leader of the House managers, met four of the other prosecutors to
bless the final list of witnesses, managers who were present said.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after Hyde left, his colleagues tore up the list
and made a new one. That list lasted only a few minutes before the
managers scrapped it, too. The 13 House prosecutors did not approve
the final list until the next morning, moments before presenting it
to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is the managers' star witness and had a guaranteed
spot in the lineup. But the managers shuffled and reshuffled their
final two choices as they gauged and regauged both the mood of the
Senate and their own analysis of which witnesses could swing
wavering senators.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to drop Mrs. Currie, some managers said Wednesday,
because the secretary's testimony about the president's
recollections of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky seemed
immovable. Clinton's lawyers have repeatedly insisted that Mrs.
Currie testified that she did not feel pressured when Clinton
uttered a series of statements about Ms. Lewinsky in which he
claimed to Mrs. Currie that they were never alone. House
prosecutors have interpreted the president's actions as witness
tampering, saying Clinton was coaching Mrs. Currie about what to
say if she were ever called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also said that they did not need Mrs. Currie's
deposition because in their view, Ms. Lewinksy's testimony was
sufficient to support their accusations that Clinton had directed
Mrs. Currie to pick up gifts that were under subpoena by the
lawyers for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some said a reason Mrs. Currie was not called is that
the prosecutors, already reviled in many public opinion polls, did
not want to be seen as grilling a sympathetic, African-American
woman in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine and Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, expressed surprise and disappointment that
the managers did not summon Mrs. Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators accused the managers of disregarding their
pretext for calling witnesses _ to clarify conflicting testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors opted to summon Jordan instead of Mrs. Currie _
both considered friendly to the president _ to underscore what they
say were Jordan's efforts, at the White House's urging, to help
find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York and to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the managers had to choose between Blumenthal and John
Podesta, the White House chief of staff, as to who would best
illustrate the accusation that Clinton lied to his aides, in an
attempt to influence their possible testimony, about his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, long reviled by Republicans as championing the
``right-wing conspiracy theory'' against the Clintons, told the
grand jury that the president first described Ms. Lewinsky as a
``stalker,'' and said she ``threatened'' to tell people ``they'd
had an affair.'' Those descriptions also were used by some House
prosecutors to try to prove that the White House employed a
strategy using leaks or spreading negative stories about its
opponents or potentially damaging witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three witnesses told House prosecuters that
their clients would be available to testify by this weekend.

CHARLES LUCKMAN , ARCHITECT AND PRESERVATIONISTS' NEMESIS   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Luckman, an architect and businessman who had the
misfortune to design the building that replaced New York's Penn
Station but who also helped to create Lever House, the landmark
Park Avenue skyscraper, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles.
He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Though his buildings include such major projects as Madison
Square Garden, Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, and the original master
plan for the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Luckman
may well be remembered less for the buildings he designed than for
inadvertently spurring architectural preservation to become a major
national movement.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman was an American success story. Born in Kansas City in
1909, he graduated magna cum laude from the School of Architecture
at the University of Illinois in 1931. Since architectural
commissions were scarce during the Depression, Luckman took a job
as a draftsman in the advertising department of the
Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. His success at that firm brought
him an offer in 1935 to become sales manager of Pepsodent Co.,
where his marketing techniques were credited with quadrupling
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, at age 27, he was featured on the cover of Time
Magazine as the Boy Wonder of American industry. In 1946, three
years after Pepsodent was acquired by Lever Brothers, Luckman
became Lever's president.
</P>
<P>
   While at Lever Brothers, Luckman proved himself a distinguished
patron of modern architecture by masterminding the creation of the
company's new headquarters on Park Avenue. Designed by Gordon
Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Lever House was one of
the first glass skyscrapers to arise in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1956, the tower remains a landmark of the
International Style. Along with the Seagram Building, which opened
two years later, Lever House established the glass tower as a
symbol of corporate America and began the transformation of much of
Park Avenue from a posh residential address to a corridor of
corporate prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman's experience as a patron helped persuade him to return
to architecture as a practitioner. In 1950, he left Lever Brothers
to form his own firm, the Luckman Partnership. One of his early
commissions was to design a new headquarters for Seagram Brothers
on a site across from Lever House. The Luckman plan was rejected,
however, when Seagram hired Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip
Johnson to design the project.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Luckman had formed a partnership with the Los Angeles
architect William Pereira. Based in California, the firm
specialized in office buildings, airports and Air Force bases, and
also designed the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman brought to architecture his business acumen and flair
for showmanship. He once told a writer for The New Yorker, ``I am
firm in my belief that architecture is a business and not an art.''
This was music to the ears of corporate executives, government
officials, and civic leaders more accustomed to dealing with
businessmen than sparring with the artistically committed leaders
of the modern movement.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his work as supervising architect for the
University of California at Santa Barbara, Luckman commented, ``We
might recommend a building with three medium-size wings, instead of
one big one, so that three people could give the wings and have
them named after them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the architect's pragmatic approach did not endear him to
architecture critics or his own professional colleagues. In the
``AIA Guide to New York City,'' Elliot Willensky and Norval White
describe Luckman's design for the U. S. Pavilion at the 1964-65
World's Fair as ``an embarrassing _ but perhaps accurate _ symbol
for America. Razed in 1977. Hooray!''
</P>
<P>
   Though Luckman asserted that his buildings conformed to no
single architectural style, he adhered closely to the functionalist
creed of modern design. As such, his buildings highlighted the thin
line that separated good modern architecture from mundane obedience
to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Modern architects prided themselves on spare, restrained designs
that enabled them to exploit the esthetic potential of structure
and space. But this approach was easily mimicked by others who
lacked a firm grasp of the esthetic dimension. A good modern
building might look business-like. But to practice architecture as
business did not invariably produce good buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, when he was hired to design the new Madison
Square Garden Center for the site then occupied by Penn Station,
Luckman's corporate ethos set him on a collision course with the
burgeoning architectural preservation movement. His design for the
garden and adjacent office tower, without distinction in
themselves, brought discredit on modern architecture throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the public outcry against the station's
demolition, the Pennsylvania Railroad's president wrote a letter to
The New York Times asking, ``Does it make any sense to preserve a
building merely as a monument?'' But Ada Louise Huxtable, who was
then The Times' architecture critic, observed: ``We will probably
be judged not by the monuments we build, but by those we have
destroyed.'' Plans are now afoot to redevelop the Garden site.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the year the garden complex opened, Luckman went into
the development business. He sold his firm to Ogden Corp., a major
real estate developer in Southern California, and became president
of its subsidiary, Ogden Development. His projects included major
buildings in downtown Los Angeles, including the headquarters for
the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Luckman again dismayed preservationists when he
recommended a new building to replace the Los Angeles Public
Library, a downtown landmark designed by Bertram Goodhue in 1926.
But, by then, partly because of the Penn Station controversy,
cities had become more protective of their architectural heritage.
In 1993 the old library was renovated and expanded by the Los
Angeles office of Hardy Holtzman Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects designed by Luckman include the Prudential Center
in Boston, Broadway (now Macy's) Plaza in downtown Los Angeles, the
Arco Center Towers in Long Beach, Calif., the Civic Center in
Inglewood, Calif., the Phoenix Civic Plaza, the Forum in Los
Angeles, the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the Standard Service
Station at Los Angeles International Airport (now demolished), and
the original Los Angeles Convention Center, which was remodeled and
enlarged in 1993 by James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed and
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Luckman had a distinguished record of public service as director
of the Freedom Train, part of President Harry Truman's program for
rebuilding Europe after World War II. In recognition of this work,
he was awarded France's Legion of Honor, England's Order of St.
John, and Italy's Star of Solidarity. He was also a member of the
President's Council on Physical Fitness, chairman of the board of
councilors of the Brain Research Institute at UCLA, and president
of the Los Angeles Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Luckman dedicated the Charles and Harriet Luckman Fine
Arts Complex at California State University in East Los Angeles,
established with his donation of $2.1 million. He said at the
dedication: ``I felt there has been so much emphasis on the
business and down-to-earth approach to life that it was time to
take a deep breath collectively and remember what we established in
this country with a culture.'' Luckman's autobiography, ``Twice in
a Lifetime: From Soaps to Skyscrapers,'' was published in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Harriet; three sons, Charles, Jr.,
of Falbrook, Calif., James, of Ketchum, Idaho, and Stephen, of
Cochella, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Preaching consistency in moral values, Pope John
Paul II urged American Catholics Wednesday to extend the crusade to
protect human life to include murderers on death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who are
unconditionally pro-life,'' the pope preached to 100,000 people in
the Trans World Sports Dome. ``Modern society has the means of
protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the
chance to reform.'' He called the death penalty ``cruel and
unnecessary,'' and said it was so ``even in the case of someone who
has done great evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has often urged an end to the death penalty, but
Wednesday's was the most explicit statement against capital
punishment he has made in the United States. In Missouri, which
executed a convicted murderer 12 days before the pope arrived and
delayed the execution of another, scheduled for Wednesday, until
after the pope returns to Rome, the pope's uncompromising message
had an uneasy resonance. Many American Catholics support the death
penalty. And even at Wednesday's Mass, some followers expressed
deep reverence for the pope _ and disagreement with his teachings
on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here because I really believe. I am a believing Catholic
and I love this pope,'' Araminta Rincon, a translator who arrived
at the dome at 3 a.m. from Green Bay, Wis., explained. But she,
like others, said she also believed in the death penalty. ``In some
ways, it's very sad. But there is no other way _some people are
just very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This 30-hour stop is the 78-year-old pope's fifth pastoral visit
to the United States, and once again, the pope finds himself
confronting one of the chief frustrations of his papacy: Many
American Catholics display a stubborn independence from Vatican
teaching. The pope, who stopped in St. Louis after an episcopal
meeting in Mexico to instruct Americans about their responsibility
to the world in the new millennium, also had to remind Catholics to
heed the basic tenets of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, the pope mentioned some of the moral issues which
divide Americans, and also many Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of God's gift of life
and love?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting St. Louis, the pope chose a metropolitan area that
is close to 55 percent Catholic. But his message was also aimed at
the nation at large, and before leaving St. Louis he held an
evening prayer service at the St. Louis Cathedral for about 2,000
people, including Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., and their wives.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told his audience that as the only surviving
superpower, the United States was a model for the rest of the
world. ``Radical change in world politics leaves America with a
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he preached.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, who was the first pope to apologize openly for the
failure of many Catholics to resist the Nazi policy of
exterminating Jews during World War II, has tried to make
ecumenicism and reconciliation with the Jews a hallmark of his
papacy. A rabbi, Robert Jacobs, executive vice-president of the St.
Louis rabbinical association, gave a reading about a prophecy of
the renewal of Zion _ Isaiah 35:1:6 _ at the vesper service, giving
the opening in Hebrew. The pope has visited synagogues, and prayed
with rabbis at interfaith services, but this was the first time a
rabbi had given a reading at a Catholic service officiated by the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   After vespers, the Pope walked out of the basilica and shook
hands with Rosa Parks, the civil rights heroine of the Montgomery,
Ala., bus boycott in 1955. Mrs. Parks, who will turn 86 in
February, rose from her wheelchair to shake the pope's hand.
</P>
<P>
   At a farewell ceremony in a hangar at Lambert International
Airport here, the pope had a private meeting with Gore. As the two
men posed for photographers, the vice president asked the pope
about the last time he visited St. Louis, in 1969. The pope
replied, ``The last time I was here, I was a cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore walked hand in hand with the pope as he escorted him to his
airplane, which took off at 8:27 p.m. CST for the return flight to
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning Mass, the pope asked his audience to ``put an end
to every form of racism, a plague which your bishops have called
one of the most persistent and destructive evils on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, at a youth rally of 20,000 in the Kiel Center,
an indoor sports center here, the pope discussed the
less-privileged side of American society, decrying the abandonment
of the homeless, the proliferation of urban gangs, sexual abuse and
drugs, and implored his young audience to break free of the secular
society that surrounds them. ``Do not listen to those who encourage
you to lie, to shirk responsibility, to put yourselves first,'' the
pope said. ``Do not listen to those who tell you that chastity is
passe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ailing pope, whose voice is slurred as the result of
Parkinson's disease, was at times difficult to understand. In both
sports arenas, giant screens included captioned text of his
remarks. But he seemed buoyed by the wild enthusiasm of his
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tuesday's rock-concert-style rally, the pope was
presented with a hockey stick. As he rose from his armchair to
leave the podium, he briefly lowered his staff and used it to mime
the motion of a hockey pass _ winning roars of laughter and
applause.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the stadium, the fervor at times melted away. Though
there were some areas where the crowds were six people deep, other
sidewalks along his parade route Wednesday were empty, and the huge
crowds that had been anticipated in the center of town did not
materialize. Security was extremely tight _ acolytes who assisted
the pope as he celebrated Mass wore security badges over their
robes _ but security restrictions and traffic warnings were only
partly the reason for the thin crowds outside the events.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in the United States are less demonstrative than in
many poorer countries. ``We thought there would be 100,000 inside
and another 100,000 outside,'' Craig Rhodes, a St. Louis police
officer, said as he stared at an empty street where the
``popemobile'' had been expected to pass. ``We got the barricades
up but there is nobody there.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, however, the pope's message struck home with some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was for the death penalty,'' said John Magee, 34,
a branch manager of an electrical-supply company who attended the
Mass. ``I always thought pro-life was about abortion, not the death
penalty. I may change my mind.''

<P>
   They will rate merely a footnote this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl's shadow will loom large over The King, the
Gambler, the Stud and the Interloper, who will nevertheless yuck it
up for the television cameras in the sun of Hawaii's Kohala Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But with a pot of gold just a birdie or two away, serious
business lurks at the fringes of the mirth and merriment. Arnold
Palmer, Raymond Floyd, Hale Irwin and Jim Colbert, participants in
the Senior Skins Game, will be playing for $540,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, Floyd, who has been known to wager his
own cash on a round of golf, was the main money man. Winning any
tournament twice in a row is a noteworthy feat. Doing it five times
is a remarkable achievement, despite the Skins Game's limited field
and format which give luck and timing the edge. Given this, even
Floyd is amazed at what has transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that doesn't seem quite possible due to the
nature of it,'' he said of his streak.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is not referring to the lava and water that frame the
South Course at the Mauna Lani Resort. He is talking about the kind
of obstacles the rest of the field presents.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the way of a possible sixth title is the formidable
Irwin, a former college defensive back schooled in the art of
denial. Irwin has laid waste to the Senior Tour competition and is
the automatic front runner in any tournament he enters.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, coming off prostate-cancer treatment, is 69 but believes
his game is returning. Colbert is just darn glad to be there,
filling in for Jack Nicklaus, who dropped out to have
hip-replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd proved last year that he could still focus his game with
money on the line. He won 11 skins, earning $300,000. Irwin won
$210,000, Palmer $30,000, and Nicklaus zeroed out.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``A'' games will definitely be showing up in the tropics.
At last week's season-opening MasterCard championship, Floyd and
Colbert tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd knows all too well that being on top of your game does not
guarantee a win in the skins format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's not the best player or the guy who played the
best in a given competition, because anything can happen. A player
who played the worst can make a birdie at the right time or hole
out a shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, making his third appearance at the tournament, is someone
who has been making birdies at the right time and in bunches. He
won $2.8 million on the Senior Tour last year.
</P>
<P>
   He also follows a regular exercise routine, which includes
lifting weights, the Stairmaster and bicycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have been around the game long enough to know that
nothing comes easy and expectations can be dumped with a couple of
bogeys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Floyd is never one to underestimate the odds of the
long-shot coming in. That would be Colbert, the interloper. He
characterizes Colbert as a grinder, a competitor who found a new
life and riches on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You admire a guy like that,'' Floyd said of Colbert. ``He is a
guy you want on your side if you have a foursome for a few bucks.
The Senior Skins Game is right up his alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar with the mind-set of gamblers, Floyd always maintains a
healthy respect for luck.
</P>
<P>
   In this kind of event, it is usually the constant companion of
the winner.
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS: ANOTHER DAY OF CONFRONTATION AND NEGOTIATION

(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate convened on Wednesday for two
long-awaited showdown votes on whether to go on with President
Clinton's impeachment trial, the chaplain offered a prayer.
``Beyond party loyalties,'' the Rev. Lloyd J. Ogilvie said, ``those
on both sides of the aisle long to do what ultimately is best for
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back 56-44 votes against dismissing the case and for
calling witnesses quickly showed, however, that all the senators
except for one _ Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis. _ chose their party
position as the one best for the nation. That appeared to leave the
Senate as divided along partisan lines as the House was on the
bitter day in December when it impeached Clinton on charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate, by its own inclination, is not the House. And
the real message of the day was that there are nowhere near 67
votes for Clinton's removal from office _ the two-thirds that would
be required under the Constitution. ``This trial for impeachment
has ended,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That realization left the two parties with the alternatives of
working together to find a way to bring the trial to an end or else
bracing for endless bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   And so they chose negotiation. Sens. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, and Tom Daschle, the minority leader, traded plans and
ideas for how to depose witnesses and bring the impeachment
proceedings that have consumed Congress since September to some
kind of conclusion by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get to a conclusion that completes our
constitutional responsibility and carries out our duty to carry out
impartial justice,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the negotiations, the parties sharpened their partisan
messages just in case things go awry. Democrats said the day's
votes showed that the Republicans once again were the party driving
impeachment forward against the popular will. ``Those who vote to
extend this, this trial becomes their trial in a sense,'' said Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that any slowdown now would only come
about if the White House made good on its threats to carry out
extensive and aggressive discovery proceedings. ``I don't
understand the White House threats of scorched earth, drag this out
until next Memorial Day kind of strategy,'' said Sen. Bob Bennett
of Utah, ``because the White House has been the one insisting that
this ought to come to an end and this is nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   But these arguments seemed nothing more than political sport. By
nightfall the sides were still trading proposals for an endgame for
the trial. Daschle said he was optimistic, but cautioned, ``I've
been optimistic before and it's been shown that I was too
optimistic and that can happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the Senate has been so different from
the House on this issue is a matter of timing. When the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, sent his report to the House in early
September it was two months before the mid-term election and that
spurred both parties in the House to use impeachment to play to
their most ideological core voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats went out of their way to portray the Republicans
as unfair to spur their supporters to the polls. They particularly
sought to play to black Americans' suspicions of prosecutors and
police. And the Republicans, in what later came to be seen as a
blunder, ran television advertisments just before the election
obliquely and not so obliquely criticizing Clinton's behavior, to
appeal to conservatives in key congressional districts in the
South. Although the House did not finally vote on impeachment until
after the November election, it had already been thoroughly
polarized.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between the two chambers is that the House
needed only a majority vote, which made it possible for the
Republicans to impeach Clinton along party lines. The Senate needs
a two-thirds vote to convict Clinton and remove him from office,
and the Republicans, who hold control, 55-45, know they can never
assemble such numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are possible pitfalls for those trying to end this
trial. The White House will have to choose whether it wants to put
forward its own witness list and use its powers of discovery to the
fullest as it has threatened to do, or whether it wants to have a
swift conclusion, certain that Mr. Clinton will not be convicted if
the vote takes place now.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats were suggesting that the questioning of Monica S.
Lewinsky, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Sidney Blumenthal would produce
nothing new, making it easier for the White House to skip ahead
quickly to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will have to decide whether to isolate their
conservatives and join with Democrats to block witnesses from being
summoned to the well of the Senate after the deposition process
ends. That, too, could depend on whether the questioning produces
anything new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you are bringing those three witnesses to the
floor unless in the depositions there is new significant dynamite
evidence,'' said Sen &UR; . &LR;  Richard C. Shelby, R &UR; - &LR; Ala. &UR;  &LR;  Charles E.
Schumer, New York's new Democratic senator and a &UR;  &LR; former House
member, already a veteran combatant from the House's own
impeachment struggle, was among those senators trying to negotiate
a conclusion to the trial. But he was cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've learned,'' Schumer told reporters, ``is
that this case has a way of unraveling beyond the expectations of
anybody.''

YALE SHAKEN BY STUDENT'S MURDER IN WHICH LECTURER IS SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a 21-year-old Yale University senior was found slain Dec. 4
in a residential neighborhood of porticoed homes and ample lawns
two miles from campus, New Haven police invested the crime with an
intimacy that deepened its intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a random act of violence, detectives said. Suzanne
Jovin, stabbed 17 times in the back and neck and left to die in the
moonlight on a patch of grass, probably knew her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight weeks later, no one has been arrested. As the
grinding job of investigating Ms. Jovin's killing continues, police
have stopped talking about it in public.
</P>
<P>
   But their initial theory _ that danger lurks, not outside, but
within Yale's neo-gothic walls _ has indelibly shaped the campus
narrative of the murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Like any unfinished story, this one has its loose ends and
characters who may be central or may not belong in the story at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery has caused many people to ponder its possible
implication: that someone close at hand, someone nurtured in the
Yale culture of fellowship and decorum, could murder one of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disturbing to think that someone like us _ someone
who took the same exams and has the same good record, or in the
case of a professor, a better record _ could have done something
like this,'' said Adrian Delmont, a senior majoring in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week into the criminal investigation rumors began to
swirl around a popular Yale lecturer and former residence hall dean
who was Ms. Jovin's senior thesis adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the police confirmed publicly that the lecturer,
James Van de Velde, was ``in a pool of suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, 38, has insisted he had nothing to do with the
death of his student. The suggestion that he did ``is deeply,
deeply painful and outrageous,'' he said in a statement released
Jan. 12 through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned Van de Velde twice, right after the killing,
and have since conducted numerous interviews with his former
students and off-campus acquaintances. He lives a half mile from
where Ms. Jovin was found, in the same upscale East Rock
neighborhood favored by many Yale faculty members, and has
acknowledged seeing her on the day of her death when she turned in
her thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Grudberg, Van de Velde's lawyer, said the encounter took
place in the afternoon and was amiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a `Hi, how are you?' thing,'' Grudberg said. ``He was
in his office working. He had gone over the draft with her a couple
of days before. She had rewritten a portion of it and turned it in
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted less than a minute, Grudberg added. He would
not discuss Van de Velde's whereabouts at the time of the killing,
which police estimated occurred between 9:30 p.m. and 9:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, who has not been charged with anything, said his
life had become a ``nightmare.'' When his name surfaced in the
Jovin investigation, for instance, Quinnipiac College dismissed him
from the graduate journalism program that he was attending
part-time. Lynn Bushnell, a college spokeswoman, said he was
dropped for ``academic reasons,'' and declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But Les Gura, who was Van de Velde's journalism teacher at
Quinnipiac College and is the city editor of The Hartford Courant,
said he was ``a good student.'' Liz Grey, the vice-president for
news at WVIT-TV in Hartford, where Van de Velde worked as an intern
for credit at the Quinnipiac program, said he also completed the
assignment without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Since the killing, Van de Velde's time as a budding broadcaster
has come under scrutiny. A police investigator, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said detectives had taken statements from
two women at the station after hearing that they had complained
about his behavior. The Hartford Courant, attributing its
information to a police source, reported that one of the women said
Van de Velde had repeatedly phoned her after she broke off a
fledgling relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told this really involves one person that he had a
relationship with,'' said Grudberg, the lawyer. ``But he never did
any stalking or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his Yale position, university officials have said that
while they presume his innocence, he cannot teach as long as he is
a suspect. They said they would continue to pay him, but they
canceled his scheduled courses for the spring semester.
</P>
<P>
   His presence in the classroom, said Richard Brodhead, the dean
of Yale College, would distract students. The Suzanne Jovin murder
mystery, the dean added, ``is in the air as a matter of
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   THE COLLEGE: Shocks to a Culture Built for Intimacy
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, another undergraduate, Christian Prince, was
shot to death at the edge of the Yale campus. A New Haven teen-ager
was convicted of robbing him, but was acquitted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lesson was clear to Yale officials. Danger had
invaded from the gritty city beyond the university's carved stone
walls. More security guards were hired. Emergency phones were
installed all over campus. The security escort service was beefed
up. A program to rehabilitate New Haven's slums was established.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Jovin homicide, there does not seem to be
much that Yale can fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose a student, it's a shock,'' said Yale
president Richard Levin, ``but it could happen at any university.''
</P>
<P>
   While violence can strike any institution, it resonates deeper
and wider at Yale because of its carefully designed culture of
intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Yale's 12 residential colleges is a small village with
its own coat of arms, rituals, colors and hierarchy. The death of
Ms. Jovin, many students said, pained not only her friends but also
her college, Davenport. Similarly, the sudden notoriety of Van de
Velde touched not only his former students, but also hundreds of
others who have lived in Saybrook College, where he was the dean,
monitoring students' academic work, from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Ms. Jovin was killed, Saybrook was shaken by the
news that federal child pornography charges had been brought
against Antonio Lasaga, a tenured geology professor and Saybrook
College's master, or director of social activities. Lasaga is
awaiting a hearing on the federal charges, has pleaded not guilty
to state charges of child molestation and is on indefinite paid
leave from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as Van de Velde became an official suspect, we
thought, oh my God, Saybrook is doomed,'' said Lisa Hopkins, a
junior living in the college. ``The college system is incredibly
intimate and it felt personal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE TEACHER: Military Mystique And Class Tricks
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jovin, a political science major, met Van de Velde when she
signed up for one of his two courses last September. She chose
Strategy and Policy in the Conduct of War, and eventually asked Van
de Velde to be the adviser for her senior thesis on international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The lecturer had just returned to Yale after more than a year's
absence. But he already enjoyed a certain renown among the
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Van de Velde teach exotic subjects like
anti-terrorism tactics and intelligence analysis, he also engaged
his students with field trips to military bases and simulations of
diplomatic crises.
</P>
<P>
   One of his more attention-getting tricks was to pull a
realistic-looking gun out of a briefcase _ he told his students
later that it was not real _ to dramatize for students in his
seminar on diplomacy how a real-life extortion attempt might play
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened, no one freaked out,'' said Alison Cole, a
senior in the seminar who, like Ms. Jovin, asked him to be her
thesis adviser. ``We all walked out saying that it was so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Classroom tricks like that helped perpetuate a mystique around
Van de Velde. He sometimes referred to his experiences as an
intelligence analyst in the Naval Reserve Force. But perhaps he was
really working for the CIA, students wondered, especially after
stories circulated that he had strewn manuals marked ``CIA'' around
his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Saybrook College residents said no one got close enough to Van
de Velde to know for sure. They recalled him as a conscientious but
remote dean. ``He was a profoundly disciplined man,'' recalled Behi
Rabbani, a senior majoring in molecular biophysics and biochemistry
who lives at Saybrook.
</P>
<P>
   What is publicly known about Van de Velde's professional
background is less cryptic than some of his students might have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Connecticut, attended Yale as an undergraduate and
earned a doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and
International Relations at Tufts University in 1988. He went to the
State Department as a policy analyst until 1993, when he was hired
at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, according to Navy records, he also joined the Naval
Reserve Force and received two months of training to be an
intelligence officer. He now holds the rank of lieutenant
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's reservist duties have taken him frequently to the
Naval War College in Newport, R.I., and on occasional overseas desk
assignments, the records show. The latest was a stint as an
intelligence analyst, for the first four months of 1997, at the
Navy's Southern Command headquarters in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Yale, he finished the spring semester as
dean of Saybrook and quit. But after six months as director of the
Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, Van de Velde
returned once again to Yale. He told The New Haven Register that he
had missed teaching. The university hired him as a political
science lecturer on a one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Although his students liked him, Van de Velde was not embraced
by the political-science department. He did not attend affairs like
the graduate student lunches. Several of his fellow professors said
they found him frosty.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our sympathy for him is genuine, there is no sense that
here is one of us who is under the gun,'' said a senior professor
who knew Van de Velde but insisted on not being quoted by name.
``There is no sense of obligation to a fellow faculty member, to
think the best of him. There is just the obligation to a human
being to presume his innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STUDENT: Last Day Is Spent Helping the Disabled
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Jovin epitomized the ideal of the well-rounded Yale
scholar. She grew up in Goettingen, Germany, where her parents are
research scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical
Chemistry, and worked summers during her time at Yale at a
biotechnology company, Cerus, in California. During the school
year, she joined the German club and the Bach Chorus. She tutored
children in the New Haven public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other than her senior thesis for Van de Velde, friends said, her
most time-consuming project was coordinating the Best Buddies
program, which pairs university students with mentally retarded
people for conversation, friendship and a view into another way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her last day was spent with the Best Buddies. With other
volunteers from Yale, she brought pizza dough and toppings to the
Trinity Lutheran Church near campus for an end-of-semester party
for a group of about 30 mentally disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   They baked pizzas in the church kitchen, animatedly debating
foreign policy, recalled Rev. John Marschhausen, the church's
pastor. Then they played Big Band music for their disabled friends
and sang an old favorite, ``In the Good Old Summertime.''
</P>
<P>
   About 9 p.m., after helping scrub down the church kitchen, Ms.
Jovin returned a borrowed university station wagon. She was last
seen, the police said, in the heart of the Yale campus, walking off
alone, north on College Street. Within the next 45 to 50 minutes,
she encountered her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the murder mystery is most perplexing. How did Ms. Jovin
get from campus to the place where she was found? Conceivably she
could have walked. But to jog to that neighborhood takes at least
20 minutes in good weather, Yale students said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, she was driven there. But was the driver her
killer?
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Brian Sullivan of the New Haven police, at a press
conference a few days after the homicide, said the people at the
church pizza party had alibis, as did Ms. Jovin's longtime
boyfriend, who was on a train at the time of her death.
</P>
<P>
   Physical evidence also has proved elusive. For two weeks, police
unsuccessfully scoured the neighborhood looking for the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Jovin's death, The Yale Daily News published tributes.
``She exclaimed to me once how good she felt simply because she was
young, how much joy and optimism and wonder the sheer fact of youth
brought her,'' one friend recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde added his own tribute: ``She inspired me with her
enthusiasm and her interest in making a difference in the world,''
he wrote. ``She is someone I will always remember.''

NOMINATIONS OPEN FOR `WORST' TENANTS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN TIERNEY  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fine New York tradition of social justice and
investigative journalism _ specifically, The Village Voice's lists
of the city's 10 worst landlords _ nominations are hereby solicited
for a new list: The 10 Worst Tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Names may be submitted by landlords, neighbors or anyone else
whose blood pressure surges at the thought of the tenant.
Candidates can be nominated for breaking the law, for violating the
communal spirit of the city's housing regulations, or for just
being irritating.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know someone keeping a rent-stabilized apartment while
living elsewhere? A rich tenant alone in a penthouse while families
below squeeze into tiny apartments at quadruple the rent? A
horribly noisy or smelly neighbor? A building whose harmony was
wrecked by the arrival of that special someone? Judges will
consider any and all miserable situations.
</P>
<P>
   They're already, for instance, pondering the candidacy of Susan
Hefti, 40, a playwright who signed a three-month lease for a garden
apartment in the summer of 1995. She is still there, much to the
chagrin of Aurelia Brown, 73, the artist who has been displaced
from the building where she lived and painted for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The saga began when Hefti and her real estate broker were shown
the garden apartment by Elise Frick, the owner of the brownstone at
1455 Lexington Avenue. Hefti's broker, Jenifer Horn, of the
Feathered Nest brokerage, later described the meeting in an
affidavit filed in Housing Court. ``It was made abundantly clear by
the owner that Thistle Brown was the primary tenant of this
apartment,'' the broker said in the affidavit, referring to Brown
by her nickname, and would ``be returning in the early part of the
Fall.'' The affidavit described Hefti's subsequent conduct as
``inexplicable and highly disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefti signed a three-month lease that included a provision
giving her the option to extend it on a month-to-month basis at the
same rent, of $1,000. According to the landlady, Frick, that was
meant to let Hefti stay an extra month or two if Brown delayed her
return.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hefti, that provision gave her the right to remain
indefinitely. She denied, in legal papers and in recent interviews,
being told of Brown's right to return to the apartment before
signing the lease. At the end of the summer, Hefti refused to move
out.
</P>
<P>
   Brown returned to find herself homeless in New York, so Frick,
who lives in a town house next door to the building, gave Brown a
room in her own home. Their lawyers began trying to evict Hefti.
Ms. Frick estimates that legal bills have exceeded $100,000 so far,
much of which has been paid by the Feathered Nest brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Hefti estimates that she spent several thousand dollars on
lawyers before running out of money and taking over the case
herself. Although not a practicing lawyer, Hefti had a law degree,
and had been involved in legal disputes with a previous employer
and her previous landlord.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the garden apartment dragged on for three
years, involving not merely a protracted battle in State Supreme
Court but also a separate action that Hefti initiated with the
State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. She asked the
agency to rule that New York's tenant-protection laws entitled her
to the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Hefti lost on both fronts. She has been ordered to
move out of the apartment next week. ``It will be such a relief to
get back home,'' Brown said the other afternoon ``I've been away
from my things in there for nearly four years now. I'll never
understand how she can sit there and take an apartment from an old
lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefti said that she was the one who deserved sympathy. ``I'm an
idealist who fought for my rights and lost,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the notion that Brown, who suffers from angina and
hypertension, had been harmed. ``They say she's an infirm old
woman, but she looks healthy enough to climb a mountain,'' Hefti
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also, in a move that may further boost her candidacy for the
worst-tenants list, offered a suggestion: ``If Aurelia Brown is so
determined to winter in New York, why doesn't she just find another
apartment?''

AUTHORIAL POINT OF VIEW 
CIVIL RIGHTS AWARDS 
FLINCHING FROM MOZART 
THE TWO MIKE WALLACES

<P>
   Erik Tarloff _ the author of a novel about a president who
sleeps with an aide whose boyfriend also works at the White House _
says Kenneth Starr should not have told all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we have the right to know this stuff,''
Tarloff said. ``I'll certainly read it if it's out there, but I
don't want other people to know about my private sexual thoughts,
let alone my private sexual life. We need a zone of tolerance. You
can't unknow it once you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is no surprise that there is no scandal in his
book. ``It's an entirely private matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps it is no surprise that the host of a party for
Tarloff and his book, ``Face Time,'' on Monday was Roger Altman,
who resigned as deputy secretary of the Treasury after his
testimony at the Senate Banking Committee's Whitewater hearings in
1994 was attacked by Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Or that one of the guests was Richard Holbrooke, President
Clinton's choice to be the top American diplomat at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who headed the Council of Economic
Advisers during Clinton's first term, was also there.
</P>
<P>
   But she is also Mrs. Erik Tarloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was reading pages from very early on and was a real
booster,'' Tarloff said. ``She persuaded me to keep writing when
the Monica Lewinsky story first broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyes on the Prize
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the New York Board of Rabbis
and of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, recently completed
the manuscript of a book titled ``Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: A
Jewish Perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his 40th birthday, he met Martin Luther King III at
a ceremony at the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Schneier and Wade
Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, received 1999 Civil Rights Leadership Awards, given in
cooperation with the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said how moved I was that they had seen fit to honor an
Orthodox rabbi, in light of all the conflict within the Jewish
community and all the divisiveness and polarization,'' he recalled
Wednesday in New York. ``This is one more example of an issue that
transcends ideological and theological differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Or words to that effect. ``They just called me for a copy of my
speech,'' he said. ``I said, `It's all in my head.'''
</P>
<P>
   Haydn vs. Mozart
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to be an all-Haydn evening, with
trios and divertimentos by guess who.
</P>
<P>
   But James Keller, adviser to the Orchestra of St. Luke's Haydn
festival, flinched when he heard an oboe quartet coming from the
balcony at Lutece, the French restaurant on East 50th Street near
Second Avenue, where donors to the orchestra were enjoying a
reception and concert.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quartet by Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We armed them with all sorts of lighter Haydn,'' Keller said,
referring to the St. Luke's performers in the balcony on Monday
night. But they decided to mark Mozart's birthday a day early.
Mozart was born 243 years ago Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well,'' Keller said. ``Haydn and Mozart were best friends,
and Haydn would have been as happy as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Namesakes
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So Mike Wallace will not say ``Now here's Mike
Wallace'' after all.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace, an author of ``Gotham: A History of New York to
1898'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), is a consultant on a
10-part documentary on New York. And Mike Wallace, the
correspondent on the CBS program ``60 Minutes,'' said that Ric
Burns _ who produced the documentary ``The Civil War'' with his
brother Ken _ had asked him to narrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly realized, reading the manuscript, that I was going
to be introducing Mike Wallace,'' Wallace of CBS said, adding that
he had decided not to do the project.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace the historian said he was looking forward to being
on camera, talking about old New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls saying is this the Mike Wallace,'' he said. ``For
the first time, they're actually trying to reach me.''

DRUG COMBINATION SHOWS PROMISE FOR ARTHRITIS SUFFERERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the 2 million Americans who suffer from rheumatoid
arthritis, there is hope: Patients can ease pain and swelling
considerably when they combine a decade-old drug with a new one,
researchers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published today in the New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors found pain and swelling decreased noticeably in
71 percent of those who took the new drug, Enbrel, with
methotrexate, a widely used treatment that went on the market in
1988. By comparison, 27 percent of those who received methotrexate
and a placebo saw improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of patients are very excited,'' said Dr. Michael
Weinblatt of Boston, the study's lead researcher. ``I see a lot of
optimism and a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatoid arthritis, which mostly affects women, is a chronic
disease that attacks the joints and can cause permanent disability.
</P>
<P>
   The study brings good news, but local doctors said the high cost
of Enbrel -- and other new drugs that recently became available to
the public -- put it out of reach for most.
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel costs about $12,000 per year and isn't covered by
Medi-Cal, according to the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Another new arthritis drug that was not included in the study,
Arava, costs about $3,500 per year and also is not covered by
Medi-Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Medi-Cal covers methotrexate, which costs about $1,500 per year
for the average patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last year was the first time in 15 years that we've
received two disease-modifying agents for rheumatoid arthritis.
That's great news,'' said Dr. Steven Weiner, a rheumatologist in
the suburban Los Angeles community of Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   But Weiner said he has only a dozen patients on Arava and one on
Enbrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These disease modifying agents have one major problem -- the
cost,'' Weiner said. ``How many people have $3,600 per month to
spend on one of their drugs? Enbrel costs almost four times that.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys, Calif.-based rheumatologist Dr. Charles Weidmann said
he hasn't prescribed Enbrel yet, in part because most insurance
companies don't cover it but mostly because it's still
experimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have very good long-term data yet,'' Weidmann said.
``There's still a lot of unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Weidmann said the new drugs will have nowhere near the impact
that methotrexate had when it was discovered in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Methotrexate, he said, has been proven to halt the advancement
of rheumatoid arthritis, much like treatments using gold did before
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike methotrexate and Arava, Enbrel is genetically engineered
-- created through biologic research instead of synthetic. As
testing continues and competitors release similar drugs on the
market, doctors expect the prices to decrease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone is using it now,'' Weiner said. ``If the cost
goes down, there may be a different story.''

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton unexpectedly used his State
of the Union message last week to propose vast changes in the way
Social Security is financed, he touched off what may become the
hottest policy debate of the year.
</P>
<P>
   No other government program has ever been relied on by so many
people. Nor has one been so popular or so expensive. And probably,
no other measure affecting the general public is so complicated and
so misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   As a guide in following the debate, here is a primer describing
the basics of the program, its problems and its politics and
explaining what the president and the Republicans in Congress want
to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security And How It Works
</P>
<P>
   A payroll tax is imposed on almost all workers and their
employers _ 6.2 percent each on all wages below $72,600. (The
workers and employers pay an additional 1.45 percent each in
Medicare taxes and there is no income ceiling.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of the money is now used to pay monthly
benefits. Most of the money goes to retirees and their widows and
widowers. A much smaller amount is paid to the survivors of workers
who died before they retired and to disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Today's workers are taxed to pay retirement benefits for their
parents' generation. When today's workers retire, their benefits
will be covered by their children's generation. The principle is
different from an investment, an insurance policy or an annuity, in
which individuals pay premiums and the income from those premiums
is used to pay their benefits later.
</P>
<P>
   When, as is now the case, the government receives more money in
Social Security taxes than it must pay in benefits, the reserves
are credited to a trust fund. The money is invested in government
bonds. The interest on the bonds is credited to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund is no more than a bookkeeping entry, a collection
of government IOU's promising to pay benefits to future retirees.
This obligation will be fulfilled only to the extent that
politicians are willing to raise the necessary money through taxes
or borrowing. But as a political matter, it is an obligation that
would be hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the surplus in the trust fund has been used to meet
part of the operating expenses of the government and to offset part
of the overall budget deficit. But this is no longer necessary
because, for the next 15 years, the government is expected to run a
total budget surplus of $4.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Problem
</P>
<P>
   Despite today's surplus, the future is far from rosy.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of workers paying taxes to retirees drawing benefits
has been shrinking for years. In 1950, there were 16 workers for
each Social Security beneficiary. Today, there are slightly more
than three. By the second or third decade of the next century, when
most baby boomers will have retired, actuaries project that there
will be only two people at work for each person receiving benefits.
When that happens, unless changes are made, the trust fund will go
into the red.
</P>
<P>
   The latest estimate is that Social Security taxes will continue
to exceed benefits until 2013. Because of interest payments owed on
the bonds credited to the trust fund, the income in the fund will
be more than what is paid out until 2021. After that, the trust
fund will begin to shrink rapidly year after year until the money
runs out in 2032.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and politicians agree that the sooner the problem is
addressed, the less painful and abrupt the solution will be.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Proposal
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan would keep the Social Security tax and
benefit structure. He has proposed giving 62 percent of the budget
surplus over the next 15 years to the Social Security trust fund,
$2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion projected surplus. (The rest of
the surplus would be spent on Medicare, the military and other
programs.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the $2.7 trillion, Clinton proposed that the trust fund
invest $700 million in the stock market. The White House insisted
that steps would be taken to insulate the investments from
political tampering, but no details were offered.
</P>
<P>
   The other $2 trillion would be used to buy government bonds from
the public to lower the outstanding public debt _ the sum of all
the annual budget deficits over the decades _ from nearly $4
trillion to less than $2 trillion. As a proportion of the total
American economy, the national debt would fall from about 45
percent today to 10 percent in 2014, the lowest level since the
United States entered World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sees three advantages for Social Security in
this approach:
</P>
<P>
   _ Historically, the average return on stock investments over a
long period has been much higher than the return on government
bonds. The return on stocks is about 7 percent above the rate of
inflation, compared with about 3 percent for bonds. Over the next
50 years, based on the long-term average return of stocks,
investing $700 billion in the stock market instead of government
securities would extend the life of the trust fund by five years,
the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paying off $2 trillion in public debt over the next 15 years
should strengthen the economy by lowering interest rates and
opening the way for more productive private investments. A stronger
economy would increase the number of people working and the size of
their paychecks and make it less painful for workers to pay the
taxes needed to support Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   _ The interest on the $2 trillion in additional bonds would be
credited by the Treasury to the Social Security trust fund,
increasing the amount promised for retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   These proposals, the president believes, would extend the life
of the Social Security trust fund until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president would allow people ages 65 to 69 to
continue to work and receive full benefits. Under the existing law,
their benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 earned. And the
president would improve benefits for widows.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered no means of paying for these additional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Social Security, Clinton would set aside $500 billion
from the surplus to create what he calls universal savings
accounts. To encourage workers to save and invest, the government
would give low- and middle-income Americans seed money to invest in
their own accounts in financial markets. Then the government would
match a portion of people's own money that they invested, similar
to the way that many companies match their employees' contributions
to 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledges that the plan would not fix Social
Security's problems once and for all and that ultimately, in order
to keep the program solvent for the next 75 years, taxes will have
to be raised or benefits cut. But the president avoided dealing
with this question. For the present, his proposal would not require
any sacrifice by taxpayers or retirees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Position
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who control Congress, have not developed a
single proposal of their own. But they are united on three points:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government should not invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Social Security system should be overhauled so that
workers could themselves invest in financial markets some of the
money they now pay in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 62 percent of the surplus that the president wants to use
for Social Security is the proper proportion, but much or all of
the rest of the surplus should be used for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe that government investments in financial
markets would be a mistake as a matter of principle and as a matter
of economics. They say it would give the government too much
control over private companies. And they argue that the return on
investments would be reduced because politicians would not be
prevented from abandoning their fiduciary responsibility and
voting, for instance, to prohibit investments in companies that
make cigarettes or firearms or certain contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   One approach under consideration by Republicans would allow
workers to invest themselves part of what they now pay in Social
Security taxes. Guaranteed Social Security benefits would have to
be reduced accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican approach would be to maintain the current
Social Security tax and benefit structure but give workers an
income tax cut if they invested the money in retirement accounts.
This would eventually cause the federal deficit to rise again if
other taxes were not raised or spending cut to offset the
income-tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Politics
</P>
<P>
   Social Security was born in 1935 over Republican opposition, and
Democrats from Franklin Roosevelt through Bill Clinton have
trumpeted it to their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Republicans have tried to tinker with the system, they
have suffered politically. For instance, Republican support for a
cut in benefits was seen by many as a reason the party lost control
of the Senate in the 1986 elections. In the 1995 budget struggle
with Congress and in his 1996 race for re-election against Bob
Dole, Clinton made headway with his accusation that Republicans
wanted to cut Medicare, Social Security's close cousin, in order to
give a tax cut to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Republicans in Congress agree that sooner or
later a solution must be found and that it must be bipartisan. But
given this history of political mistrust and the added divisions
arising from the president's impeachment, it will be
extraordinarily difficult to reach an accord this year.

MAN LEAVES HOSPITAL WITH $2,000 HEART MONITOR ATTACHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANORAMA CITY, Calif. -- A 68-year-old patient at Mission
Community Hospital decided to discharge himself Wednesday, leaving
while still in his blue gown and attached to a $2,000, 6-foot-tall
heart monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here is pretty surprised,'' said Bill Daniel, the
hospital's chief executive officer. ``Patients leave all the time
and they take all kinds of things, but this one's just a little
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and police could not explain how the slow-moving patient
managed to escape detection as he walked away with the ungainly
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Even more odd, minutes after leaving, the man returned to take a
quick walk through the hospital avoiding both hospital staffers and
police who chased after him, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Police, nurses and security guards spent Wednesday morning
searching for the patient, who left the hospital at about 9:30 a.m.
-- shortly before he would have been formally discharged by
hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just walked out. He didn't want to stay any longer,'' said
Stacy Blodgett, a public service officer for the Los Angeles Police
Department's Van Nuys Division.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a missing-person report, a theft report also was filed
with the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the whole thing is strange,'' Daniel said. ``You
wouldn't think someone would get far with this 6-foot-tall
apparatus.''

`HILARY AND JACKIE' STRIKES DIFFERENT CHORDS AMONG CELLISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does ``Hilary and Jackie,'' the extraordinary biopic of cellist
Jacqueline du Pre, defile the memory of one of England's national
darlings, or is it an honest but sympathetic portrait of a genius?
</P>
<P>
   Ask different cellists and you'll get different answers.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Lloyd Webber, brother of the phantom of the musical
theater, Andrew Lloyd Webber, was so outraged by the film that he
has been leading picket lines outside the theater where it is
showing in London.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Emil Miland, a member of the San Francisco
Opera Orchestra and, like du Pre, a prodigy on the instrument, is
astounded by that reaction. He praises the film's insight into its
subject's life as a ``gift.''
</P>
<P>
   In certain respects, ``Hilary and Jackie'' is this year's
``Shine,'' the 1996 film about pianist David Helfgott's mental
deterioration and recovery, and it may attract as much attention.
It could do for the Elgar Cello Concerto what ``Shine'' did for
Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto. ``Hilary and Jackie's'' star,
Emily Watson, was nominated for a Golden Globe and is likely to
figure in the Oscar race.
</P>
<P>
   Cellist Lloyd Webber and Miland both identify personally with du
Pre, a phenomenon who was at the pinnacle of the musical world,
celebrated and married to pianist Daniel Barenboim, when she was
incapacitated by multiple sclerosis. Lloyd Webber said she inspired
him to take up the instrument, and Miland studied with her teacher,
William Pleeth, who is portrayed in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie,'' which stars Watson as Jackie, is based on
a biography by du Pre's sister, Hilary, and brother, Piers. It
depicts the cellist, who died in 1987, as emotionally vulnerable
and unstable. Jackie asked Hilary to let her sleep with Hilary's
husband _ and did. Details of her illness, such as losing control
of her bladder, are graphically presented.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber, in a letter printed in London's Daily Telegraph
and reported by Reuters, said Hilary, also a musician, was jealous
of Jacqueline's talent and fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Piers du Pre seem determined to wreak the ultimate
revenge on their sister by discrediting her while she lies _ unable
to answer back _ in her grave. They have no right to tarnish her
memory for the many who love her,'' Lloyd Webber wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Miland said he went to see ``Hilary and Jackie'' trying to find
things that were offensive, ``and I could not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that anyone would be so offended by this film.
For me, it was kind of a gift that Hilary gave us, the insight into
Jackie's life as a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was terrific the way they showed the challenges
and the intimacies and the complexities of a sibling relationship
and the way that traveled throughout life, from little girls to
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the sexual interlude with Hilary's husband, Miland said,
``I'm thinking to myself, `What is the big deal?' In the context,
you've got to remember this was in the '70s, a lot of sexual things
were happening in the '70s, it was a different era. These things
happen to people; we are human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, du Pre was desperately lonely. The film ``really
deglamorized the touring aspect of her career. The only time people
would talk to her was when she was in the spotlight. She said
herself, `I was kind of playing the cello, and then I was booked
for two years.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the indignities of her illness, ``I couldn't be offended
by that,'' Miland said. ``It gave me more compassion for the
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one aspect of Lloyd Webber's complaint that Miland
completely understands. ``She was a national hero,'' Miland said.
``She was somebody England fell in love with. It was kind of like
Our Dear Jackie. Then to see her say (in the film) `f_' in several
different languages is kind of hard for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to kind of allow them that. She was a direct hit with
the audience and with the music. It was just like, &LR;   &LR; (set
ital)boom.(end ital)''
</P>
<P>
   Miland said the best thing to come out of the film ``is the
light it sheds about what it is like to be a musician. It is a
tether around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away from this film thinking her siblings had shown us
the human side of her. She was still able to soar to this almost
divine level of expression and accomplishment.''

A STRAYING FISCAL CONSERVATIVE RETURNS TO ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In presenting a Spartan budget, Gov. George E.
Pataki sought Wednesday to reclaim his reputation as an unwavering
fiscal conservative and to expunge the memories of a spending surge
during his re-election campaign that caused some of his most
faithful supporters to grouse that he was as eager to sign checks
as any old Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican governors eyeing their national standing,
including Christie Whitman of New Jersey and George W. Bush of
Texas, are trying to make their marks in this year of good economic
times and swollen government coffers by advocating innovative
spending programs, particularly for education. But Pataki seems to
have concluded that he can cement his statewide popularity and
burnish his image around the country largely by promoting
tight-fisted fiscal practices, including significant tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a state where the guiding principle is respect for the
people,'' he said in his budget address Wednesday afternoon, ``big
government and big government taxation simply does not compute.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki may feel that he has to propose a lean budget, at least
if he wants to hold up his tenure nationally as a model of prudent
management that turned around a state many in his party thought was
foundering because of that liberal icon, Mario M. Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   In the current budget, spending is slated to rise by 8 percent,
an amount that left many conservatives cringing and questioning
Pataki's commitment to their beliefs. In the next one, which begins
April 1, he proposes growth of 1.8 percent, less than the rate of
inflation. He is also calling for Albany to keep in reserve a
current surplus that is expected to top $2 billion to insure that
the state's finances are not battered by an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   If the governor had again sought a large spending increase _
even before the Legislature pushed its own new programs _ he would
essentially be undoing the work of his first two years in office,
when he kept a tight rein over the budget. The signal would be that
last year was not an election-year aberration but a fundamental
shift in course. Pataki would also be raising the alarms not only
of conservatives, but also of many fiscal monitors, who contend
that the current rate of growth is unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   New York state has for decades had one of the worst fiscal
records in the nation, including the largest debt of any state by
far. Pataki is proposing a plan that would for the first time seek
to check the increase in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's returning to his fiscally conservative roots,'' said
Thomas Carroll, president of Change New York, an advocacy group
that had long backed Pataki, only to upbraid him over last year's
increases. ``He had a consistent record from his days in the
Assembly and Senate and his first two years as governor of being
very hawkish on keeping spending under control and cutting. In the
run-up to the election, that obviously was suspended. It is clear
that he is going back to positions that he has held a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor is taking pains not to flaunt his agenda as
overtly conservative, mindful that New Yorkers are generally
hostile to the style of Republicanism symbolized by the party's
southern wing. In his speech and in comments later Wednesday, he
rarely if ever referred to his policies in ideological terms or
used the word ``conservative,'' relying instead on phrases like
``achieving fiscal balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He also did not propose a budget that was as provocative to the
Legislature and some advocacy groups as his first one in 1995,
which called for sharp cuts and led to months of vitriol between
the two branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday about complaints from some lawmakers that
his proposal was too austere, he repeatedly noted that in the last
two years he had spearheaded sizable increases in education and
other spending. His aides gave reporters copies of charts that
showed that financing for education was at record levels and funds
for Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, was the highest
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were criticized because we provided so much more
help to local governments and schools,'' Pataki said at a news
conference. ``This year, they're saying, `Why didn't you do
enough?' Well, one of the reasons is that we have done so much last
year _ record school aid increases for the second year in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the governor's overall record, Democratic lawmakers are
certain to try to portray this new budget as part of an insidious
plan to court Republicans nationally by using the state as a
laboratory for archconservative policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever, we can see now that this is more of a national
political agenda than it is doing the right thing for New York
State,'' said Michael J. Bragman, a Syracuse-area Democrat who is
the Assembly majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The governor dismissed such criticism, though he declined to
address how the budget might play among the elders of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``My budget is guided by my view of the best interests of the
future of the people of New York,'' he said. ``It is focused on New
York. And that is the motivation, and that is what I hope the
Legislature focuses on, so that we can meet the needs of the people
quickly and move forward.''

TOBACCO-CONTROL INTERESTS IRED BY CELLUCCI BUDGET MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' tobacco-control lobby, long suspicious
of Governor Paul Cellucci's views on Massachusetts' antismoking
campaign, erupted in anger Wednesday when the governor unveiled a
budget plan they say slices $4 million out of the much-heralded
public health program.
</P>
<P>
   The diversion of the funds _ hidden deep in his fiscal 2000
budget plan _ will increase by 400 percent a current $1 million
program that pays local firefighters to visit schools to talk about
fire safety issues related to smoking. Some public health
specialists say research has shown such programs are not effective.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's proposal for diverting the funds from the antismoking
campaign to the SAFE (Student Awareness of Fire Education) program
follows lobbying by state fire chiefs who argue the program has
saved lives. They say they cited 47 ``young heroes'' in the last
four years who saved lives or protected property.
</P>
<P>
   The labor union, the Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts,
which represents the state's 12,000 firefighters, gave Cellucci a
crucial endorsement during his bid for governor last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $5 million, 16 percent of the total Department of
Public Health antismoking campaign budget, will go to pay
firefighters overtime for participating in the local programs, some
of which, a source familiar with the project said, only deal
tangentially with cigarette safety or smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci aides denied there was any connection to the union
endorsement and insisted they were persuaded by the fire chiefs
that the program is effective. They said they did not seek advice
from their own public health officials, who run the state's $31
million tobacco-control program, or other tobacco-control
specialists when they made the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday a national authority on cigarette-caused fires and
some antismoking leaders scoffed at the administration's
justification for the diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a total waste of money to have anyone go into a school
and talk about cigarette-related fires,'' said Andrew McGuire,
executive director of the Trauma Foundation at San Francisco
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire, who is considered a world authority on cigarette-caused
fires, said research done in Massachusetts 20 years ago ``showed
those kinds of programs don't work.'' He pointed to an article
published in the American Journal of Public Health in 1982 that
came to that conclusion after an eight-month study of
burn-prevention programs in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said he has long maintained that the best deterrence to
cigarette-caused fires are tobacco products that are designed to be
fire-safe because they will not ignite other material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci's fiscal aides strongly denied Wednesday that
politics had played a role in the decision to increase the
firefighters' program. But they could not point to any independent
evaluations of the program to justify the five-fold increase in its
budget. They said that they only relied on the firefighters to
justify the hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make decisions based on political endorsements,''
said Joseph Landolfi, a fiscal spokesman for the Cellucci
administration. The union endorsement of Cellucci was a key
political development for the Republican governor, because the
firefighters have traditionally backed the Democratic gubernatorial
nominee in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Landolfi said the administration found the fire chief arguments
to increase the funding ``compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This a program that works,'' Landolfi said. ``They came in and
made a strong case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cellucci move, meanwhile, produced strong reactions from
leaders in the state's tobacco-control movement, who said it
violates the pledge made in 1992 to voters who approved a 25
cent-per-pack hike in the cigarette tax to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge vowed that the money would go only to antismoking
efforts. The $4 million would be added to a current $1 million
program.
</P>
<P>
   But the anger also stems from the signals Cellucci and his
advisers have repeatedly sent concerning tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Cellucci deepened suspicions when he outlined
his plan for using the tobacco-settlement funds. None went to
antismoking programs, while huge amounts went to other
public-health projects.
</P>
<P>
   But he did propose spending $500,000 to study the effectiveness
of the Public Health Department's antitobacco program, an effort
that is held by national public health leaders and cancer
associations as a model because of its results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very troubling pattern,'' said Richard Daynard, a law
professor at Northeastern University Law School and chairman of its
Tobacco Products Liability Project. ``It is a pattern that must
make the tobacco industry very happy, but it is not in the interest
of the citizens of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been kicked twice by the governor in the last week,''
Daynard said, referring to the budget diversion and the governor's
plans for the tobacco settlement funds.

MCCAIN SET TO ANNOUNCE PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, is all
but certain to run for president, and he plans to convey that
message in private meetings with potential supporters in New
Hampshire on Saturday, according to a source close to the senator.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an interview Wednesday, would not go quite as far as
his associate, but said he is ``very far along in the process'' and
expects to make an announcement soon.
</P>
<P>
   A former Vietnam prisoner of war and Naval Academy graduate,
McCain established a presidential exploratory committee on Dec. 30.
But so far, McCain has not held any fund-raisers or any major
campaign-style events. His trip to New Hampshire is viewed by
advisers as the ``soft opening'' of the campaign, with little
advance publicity.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be escorted in the state by his friend, former
senator Warren Rudman, the New Hampshire Republican, who is slated
to introduce McCain to possible supporters at a series of private
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's move comes as the Republican presidential field is
beginning to take shape quickly. Thursday, former vice president
Dan Quayle plans to formally file papers with the Federal Election
Commission that will establish his candidacy, a move he announced
last week. Senator Bob Smith, the New Hampshire Republican, filed
his candidacy papers earlier this month. Other possible candidates
are moving closer to finalizing their plans, including Elizabeth
Dole, Texas Governor George W. Bush, former education secretary
Lamar Alexander, publisher Steve Forbes, and former Reagan aide
Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   With the New Hampshire primary less than 13 months away, and
activists beginning to choose their favorites, potential candidates
have been stepping up their effort to let people know they are
running. Some expected candidates, such as Alexander and Forbes,
have been campaigning practically since they lost the 1996 primary.
Bush, Dole, and Bauer have plenty of connections through their
political and ideological networks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, is searching for what might be called the
maverick constituency, which he perceives as a vast pool of voters
who would be attracted by his independence and his bipartisan work
for campaign finance legislation and tobacco regulation. McCain
aides said New Hampshire, with its libertarian and independent
streaks, is the ideal territory for finding such support.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Duberstein, a former chief of staff to President Reagan and
an informal adviser to McCain, said he thought the senator's
willingness ``to take on sacred cows and show his independence . .
. is quite attractive. I think people in New Hampshire will find it
compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate must raise between $20 million to $35 million
this year in order to run a credible campaign next year, according
to political analysts. Only two or three candidates are expected to
be able to raise enough.

FEDS PROBE AIRLINE MAINTENANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1995 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alaska Airlines mechanics may have failed to follow
strict maintenance procedures pertaining to throttles on some MD-80
jetliners, airlines and law-enforcement sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators involved in two federal inquiries of alleged
maintenance irregularities at the Seattle-based airline also are
trying to determine if records were falsified to hide improper
throttle work, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-80's throttle system is a key flight-control mechanism
that regulates fuel flow to the plane's two engines.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on throttles provides the first glimpse of what
prompted federal investigators to begin looking at practices at the
airline's Oakland, Calif., maintenance center, where it now appears
that a concerned union officer went to authorities late last year.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Wednesday if any planes were flown with
improper maintenance, but no evidence has emerged that any planes
were grounded or that the public was placed in immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, which are being investigated by a federal grand
jury and the Federal Aviation Administration, involve several line
supervisors and mechanics at the Oakland facility, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   No formal charges have been brought against the airline or its
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Cancelmi, Alaska's chief spokesman, said Wednesday that
Alaska's lawyers do not believe that throttle work is a major focus
of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But Cancelmi said the airline lacks a full picture of the
allegations and has had only limited contact with the FAA because
the investigation is ongoing. Alaska officials have said the FAA
has assured them the investigation is not related to air safety or
airworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official who asked not to be identified said record
falsification is the focus of the FAA inquiry and throttle
maintenance is related to that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury, sitting in Northern California, is investigating
whether maintenance and repair work was recorded as having been
done when it was not, according to sources. The grand jury also is
looking into allegations that unauthorized employees signed off on
maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors are separately investigating a small number of
Alaska Airlines workers who may lose their mechanic certificates.
The rare penalty is the most serious civil sanction that can be
taken against a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are reviewing records and repairs related to an
important FAA-mandated procedure called a C-check, according to
sources familiar with the federal inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   A C-check is a detailed inspection of a plane's engine and
components, flight controls and major internal mechanisms. Alaska
performs a C-check every 3,600 flight hours or at least every 15
months, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury and FAA investigations were triggered by a union
officer at Oakland, who took the concerns of some of the mechanics
he represents to federal inspectors, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   The officer described incidents that allegedly occurred in
November and December, prompting U.S. Transportation Department
investigators and FBI agents to seize maintenance records and
computerized information from Alaska's repair facilities in Oakland
and Seattle on Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Records relating to three of Alaska's 40 MD-80s were seized
during the raids.
</P>
<P>
   One incident alarmed employees late last year, when an MD-80
being rolled out of the Oakland maintenance center began smoking
after being certified as ready for flight, said a law-enforcement
source and a mechanic who described the incident. The plane was
returned to the hangar, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to determine the scope of the alleged
irregularities, including how long they may been occurring and who
in the company might have been aware of them, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury investigation is being conducted by the the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Oakland and the federal Department of
Transportation's inspector general. Officials of both offices have
declined comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 is a widely used midrange passenger
jet. The Boeing Co., which merged with McDonnell Douglas Corp., now
builds the jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear Wednesday what MD-80 throttle maintenance is
being scrutinized, but improper work could lead to minor problems,
such as excessive noise, or cause engine shutdowns, said Chuck
Eastlake, a professor of aerospace engineering and aircraft design
expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the throttles work correctly is a safety issue,''
Eastlake said.
</P>
<P>
   It is most likely that one engine would shut down, making it
more probable that an emergency landing would occur rather than a
crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether a faulty repair is a minor or major irregularity, he
said, ``falsification of records is a big deal that everybody
should be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires airlines to keep complete and accurate
records of all maintenance, and FAA officials say documentation is
key to the integrity of the airworthiness system.
</P>
<P>
   If maintenance workers are willing to falsify records on a small
repair, Eastlake said, the question is whether they would do it on
an important procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Several Oakland base mechanics defended the maintenance
procedures, although some said they had heard of possible
irregularities. Others said they don't believe the allegations are
true. All mechanics interviewed for this article asked that their
names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   One mechanic said the allegations involve a difference in
interpreting maintenance requirements. Alaska supervisors are
reevaluating whether procedures need to be clarified, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But another mechanic said the maintenance manuals set forth
specific tasks in minute detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like reading the Bible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska operates from 40 cities in the western United States and
Mexico, with 500 daily departures.

THE VOTES AREN'T THERE FOR OUSTING CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided Senate authorized subpoenas Wednesday for
Monica S. Lewinsky and two of President Clinton's allies, just
minutes after a vote that continued the impeachment trial but
demonstrated a lack of support for removing the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Only one senator, Wisconsin Democrat Russell D. Feingold, broke
party lines, as the Republican-controlled Senate approved the
subpoenas and rejected the motion to dismiss the case by identical
votes of 56 to 44.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, required to convict and
remove from office an impeached president, the two ballots showed
Clinton's acquittal is all but ``a foregone conclusion,'' according
to members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems now that the House managers, who are calling the
shots, ought to bring this trial to an end,'' said Senator Edward
M. Kennedy. ``The longer this trial continues, the more of a
travesty it is.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy spoke, the Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders
were privately negotiating a blueprint for the rest of the trial,
which both leaders agreed they want to complete by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The trial recessed on its 11th day after the two votes, as the
negotiations continued. The leaders said they expect to reach a
final agreement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring some bolt-of-lightning discovery,'' said the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, ``we could be through with the trial
before the Lincoln's Day recess,'' which begins Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my goal,'' said the Democratic leader, Thomas A.
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters was the vote to compel Lewinsky, Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., Clinton's close friend, and Sidney Blumenthal, a White
House senior adviser, to submit to depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of witnesses posed a dilemma for Clinton's lawyers,
who were torn between completing the trial swiftly and protecting
the president's rights, a potentially time-consuming effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday's events make clear that the votes are not there to
convict and remove the president from office,'' said Gregory B.
Craig, White House special counsel. ``Any proceedings from this day
forward only serve to delay the final resolution of this matter and
run counter to the best interests of the Congress, the presidency
and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, White House officials were wary of agreeing to time
limits even before the depositions are conducted. ``They're now
trying to put a blindfold on us,'' said Joseph Lockhart, the White
House spokesman. ``We believe we ought to have an adequate chance
to get prepared and to present a defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats were sympathetic to the White House concern, as
they negotiated the final framework. ``It's a very delicate thing
for Democrats to tell the White House to forgo the rights they may
have,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, shortly after
the votes.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, the White House was expressing a possible
willingness to yield its right to call witnesses unless the House
managers produce significant new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous snags remained in the negotiations, including a
demand by Democrats that Republicans agree not to call Lewinsky and
the other witnesses to testify in person before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were reluctant to make the guarantee, even
though many Senate Republicans said they hoped the videotapes of
the depositions would provide the final material they need to
decide the case, eliminating the need for any of the witnesses to
testify before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take something dynamite for me to want to hear
anything more'' than the depositions, said Senator Richard C.
Shelby, an Alabama Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leaders also were unable to resolve whether to
guarantee in writing when the final impeachment votes will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are scores of sticking points,'' Lott's spokesman, John
Czwartacki, said Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Under a highly tentative plan, the House managers and Clinton's
lawyers each would have three hours to question the witnesses, and
all three depositions would be completed by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which was subject to broad changes, calls for
videotaping the depositions, then playing relevant portions for the
full Senate on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said they sought the testimony to resolve
contradictions in the evidence. ``I am willing to travel the road
wherever it leads, whether it's to the conviction or the acquittal
of the president,'' said Senator Susan M. Collins, a Maine
Republican. ``But in order to do that, I need witnesses and further
evidence to guide me to the right destination, to get to the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins and Shelby are among six or more Republican senators who
are seen as leaning against voting to remove Clinton from office.
The others include Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and three
New England Republicans: Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, John H. Chafee
of Rhode Island, and James M. Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the House managers come up with something startling,''
said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican, ``it will probably
end with six Republicans going along with all the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is charged with lying under oath to a federal grand jury
and obstructing justice to conceal his sexual affair with Lewinsky,
a former White House intern. Clinton allegedly covered up the
affair to thwart a lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones filed against
him and settled last year for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The votes Wednesday represented the most significant passage yet
in the trial. ``Dear God, leadership has its defining days in which
crucial decisions must be made,'' the Senate chaplain, the Rev.
Lloyd Ogilvie, said in a prayer before the votes. ``In the quiet,
the senators wait to be counted. It's a lonely time.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the loneliest was Feingold, whose maverick votes drew
scornful looks from several senior Democrats. Feingold issued a
statement later that said dismissing the charges ``would, in
appearance and in fact, improperly `short circuit' this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I want to be clear that my vote not to dismiss this
case does not mean that I would vote to convict the president and
remove him from office. I have not reached a decision on that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The votes followed a final attempt to devise a short-term plan
for the trial and avoid the party-line votes, an effort that ended
in failure and anger. Senator John F. Kerry, a member of Daschle's
leadership team, said the talks failed after Democrats offered to
withdraw the dismissal motion and Republicans declined to yield on
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bipartisanship is a two-way street, but they aren't willing to
give up anything,'' Kerry said. ``I believe there are significant
politics at large here. I think the House managers and Ken Starr
and the right wing should not be managing the US Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Starr is the independent counsel whose eight-month
investigation of the Lewinsky matter led to the impeachment saga.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wasted no time after the votes to return fire on the
Senate Democrats and the White House. Countering early warnings by
Clinton's lawyers that the Senate could prolong the trial for
months by calling witnesses, Senator Robert Bennett, a Utah
Republican, denounced the warnings as ``scorched-earth threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the White House lawyers were running ``the risk of
offending some senators who are currently prepared to vote their
way.''
</P>
<P>
   If the final plan for the trial leaves open the possibility for
the House managers to call witnesses to appear before the Senate,
votes on whether to permit each witness to testify would be held
next week, most likely Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rules call for secret deliberations on the articles
of impeachment, with each senator given 15 minutes to speak. With
100 senators, the deliberations could last three days, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is acquitted, Senate Democrats plan to push a
resolution to censure him, over the objections of many Republicans.
``Nothing about this terrible national experience leaves me
comfortable,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut
Democrat. ``But an unequivocal, bipartisan statement of censure
would at least fulfill our responsibilities to our children and our
posterity to speak to the common values the president has violated
and make clear what our expectations are for future presidents.''

FORMER MODEL FOUND DEAD AND DISMEMBERED IN GREECE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Greece, N.J., Caribbean)  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A former model who had become something of a
local celebrity here was found dead and dismembered in a swamp in
Greece on Wednesday, and the Greek man she left New Jersey to live
with was charged with her death.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old former model, Julie Scully, unexpectedly moved
to Greece last month to live with a cruise-ship petty officer she
met on a Caribbean vacation in 1997, according to relatives in
Mansfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Her tempestuous romance with the officer, George Skiadopoulos,
24, grew so intense, they said, that Ms. Scully decided to leave
everything behind _ her home, her plans to get a college
engineering degree, even her 3-year-old daughter, Katie.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Ms. Scully frequently appeared, in bikinis,
in the ``Page Six Girl'' feature of Trenton's tabloid newspaper.
With her bright smile and credentials as a New Jersey native, she
and her swimwear grew so popular during the newspaper war of the
early 1990s that the owners of The Trentonian ran her photograph 10
different times and twice named her ``Girl of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's publisher even put up billboard advertisements with
her photograph, helping to revive The Trentonian's circulation and
make Ms. Scully a local celebrity who later worked to promote
national beer companies like Coors Light.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Scully became the subject of The Trentonian's front-page
headlines after she disappeared in Greece two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks away from her daughter, Ms. Scully grew
homesick and decided to leave her lover and return home, her mother
told the New Jersey state police.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pavlos Roubis, head of the Athens security police, said the
thought of losing Ms. Scully left Skiadopoulos ``blinded by his
passion.'' Skiadopoulos told Greek detectives that he grew so angry
that he strangled her during an argument on a deserted country
road, Roubis said. The police reported that Skiadopoulos said he
was forced to decapitate her so he could stuff her body into a
suitcase, which he then flung into the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scully's relatives said they had warned her to break off her
relationship with Skiadopoulos after he visited New Jersey last
fall and threatened to strangle her during an argument. Ms. Scully
told her mother, Julia Scully, that she could take care of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like an addiction,'' Julia Scully said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Scully's friends said they worried that Skiadopoulos
might be after her money because she had recently left her husband
and won a $600,000 settlement. In the offices of The Trentonian,
editors wrestled with the covering a sensational murder story about
a victim so closely intertwined with the paper's public persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said one staff member, speaking on condition of
anonymity, ``is a pretty sad day around here.''

A FOUL ODOR IN THE HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get this straight. The President of the United States can
commit adultery and perjury and a majority of voters consider it
largely irrelevant because what he chooses to do when he's not
keeping the world safe for democracy is his own damn business.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the off-the-field felonies of a linebacker who
redefined the position is highly relevant to a good many of the
voters who will decide on Saturday whether or not to keep the Pro
Football Hall of Fame safe from hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't reflect well on our society when Lawrence Taylor is
held to a higher moral standard than President Clinton. Or do you
find nothing twisted about a society that places the behavioral bar
higher for its professional athletes than for its politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's recreational drug use became a problem in 1985. We know
this not because he was tripped up by Linda, his ex-wife. He said
so himself on page 126 of his 1987 autobiography, ``Living on the
Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   As with Clinton, Taylor's reckless personal behavior didn't keep
him from earning high marks on the job. In 1985, his fifth year in
the NFL, he recorded 71 tackles and a career-high 12.5 sacks. In
1986, after a half-hearted stint in a drug-rehab center, Taylor
earned MVP honors after collecting 85 tackles and 20.5 sacks during
a season that culminated with a resounding win over Denver in Super
Bowl XXI.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 seasons with the New York Giants, Taylor averaged 10.6
sacks and appeared in 10 Pro Bowls. He turned a gritty position
into a glamorous one at the expense of the league's resident
glamourpusses. Indeed, quarterbacks would watch Taylor like a pilot
does his altimeter, so cognizant were they of how quickly he could
bring them down.
</P>
<P>
   Based solely on his Sundays, he's a shoo-in for the Hall of Fame
as a first-year inductee. Off-the-field behavior isn't supposed to
cloud the voting. In the bylaws it clearly states that a nominee's
achievements and contributions in professional football are to be
the sole criteria.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, that, because last time we checked, the 194
members included: someone who sat out a season for gambling on NFL
games; an accused murderer; a few slaves of the bottle; the
adulterous husband of a grating talk-show host and one guy who
admitted in his autobiography to having slapped women around (when
he wasn't sleeping with as many as four in one night).
</P>
<P>
   With heroes like those, who needs villains? For all we know,
Taylor had the truth in his grasp when he told reporters earlier
this week during a conference call, ``If we start worrying about
off-the-field stuff, then you'd have to kick out half the guys
already (inducted).''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, it must be a terrific burden to have lived as
righteously as the one voter who acknowledged the other day that
Taylor ``might have been one of the two or three greatest defensive
players who ever lived. But he just hasn't lived the kind of life
of the guy I'm going to put in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, as opposed to O.J. Simpson, who was inducted in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later the former USC star would stand trial for the
murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend, Ronald
Goldman. Simpson was acquitted by a criminal jury in a trial
cluttered with unsavory details of his past, held liable for the
deaths in the subsequent civil case and continues to be tried in
the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Or were the 36 Hall of Fame voters who'll cast their ballots on
the eve of Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami too busy soaking up
the free sun and suds in South Beach to notice the sand kicked up
by Simpson's selection by ESPN as one of North America's 50
greatest athletes of the 20th century?
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, 18 years after his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction,
another of the century's greatest athletes wrote a tell-all
autobiography that read like a supermarket tabloid. The Hall
monitors who are indignant about the possibility of having to
explain Taylor's induction to impressionable teens must have been
thrilled to read running back Jim Brown's accounts of hosting
``what most people call orgies.''
</P>
<P>
   Or his admission that he slapped a live-in girlfriend and a few
other women. Or his observation that elite athletes ``aren't
characters in a storybook. They will be weak and carnal and greedy
and confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to one of the latest NFL literary offerings,
``Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL.'' The book,
co-written by Jeff Benedict and Don Yaeger, hit the bookstores this
past October at roughly the same time Taylor was charged with
possession of crack cocaine after trying to buy $50 worth of the
drug from an undercover detective in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' research revealed that 21 percent of the 509
players in the NFL whose records they were able to cull had been
formally charged with a serious crime. Many of them were repeat
offenders. Given the climate Benedict and Yaeger described and the
priggishness of today's Hall monitors, we can expect the Pro
Football Hall of Fame to become a tougher place to crack than the
LPGA Hall of Fame was before it relaxed its performance criteria.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious, how some of the same media members who exalted
Taylor when he played with a shredded shoulder or gimpy knees are
now quick to condemn him. It would seem Sunday soldiers can earn
their medals of bravery and courage, so long as their truculence
doesn't spill over into the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But all too often it does. Julian Morrow, a New York-based
sports psychologist, recently told USA Today, ``What makes a player
successful on the field _ anger, risk-taking, limited impulse
control _ may not make him someone you want living next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a deadbeat dad and longtime drug abuser, is the ideal
neighbor if your address is 2121 George Halas Dr. NW, Canton, Ohio.

 &HT;    Raza president meets with minority Texas legislators
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The National Council of La Raza made a
star-studded Texas debut Wednesday, an event its president said was
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to share the gospel, the good news. We finally
realized that we should have been here a long time ago,'' said Raul
Yzaguirre, La Raza's president. ``We're the balance of power. But
it's not just the numbers. What really excites me is the quality,
the enormous amount of powerful, dynamic people in this room who
happen to be Tejanos, who happen to be Mexican-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The event went beyond a run-of-the-mill reception common during
legislative sessions to symbolize a fortification of growing
Hispanic political power in a state that will soon see Hispanics
become the majority in Texas. The Washington-based La Raza _ one of
the nation's most powerful Hispanic groups _ is shifting its
traditional focus on lobbying in the nation's Capitol to the
statehouse as Congress increasingly looks to the states to
implement its will, said Yzaguirre. Previously, most of the
groups's efforts locally concentrated on supporting social service
programs important to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start building alliances with people responsive to
Latinos,'' said Clarissa Martinez, who will lead La Raza's lobbying
efforts in Austin. ``This is not just a Latino agenda. It's a Texas
agenda as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, La Raza members held meeting with the
Mexican-American legislative caucus as well as individual
lawmakers. Yzaguirre said he did not meet with Gov. George W. Bush
Wednesday but hopes Bush _ who has assiduously courted the Hispanic
vote in Texas _ will attend La Raza's national conference in
Houston in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has a governor who's made a serious commitment to the
(Hispanic) community in last reelection campaign,'' said Lisa
Navarrete, a La Raza spokeswoman in Washington. ``It also has a
state legislature who's interested in (Hispanic) issues. It's an
important time for us to be there and empower our community.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception was host to a unique concentration of power,
talent and influence in the Hispanic community. Attending were
lawmakers from all levels of government from Austin City
Councilmember Gus Garcia to Austin U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, as well
as several state legislators. The event also attracted musicians
such as country singer Rick Trevino and Tejano music star Little
Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who works out of La Raza's San Antonio office, said
its daily agenda will consist of following pet projects such as
health insurance for children of working poor families and charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Austin Club, a handful of members of ADAPT protested
La Raza holding the event in a place that they claimed did not have
adequate access to the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, those attending the reception
revelled in the display of Hispanic powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such talent here, such a pool of resources,'' said
state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo. ``You can feel the
electricity here as we feed off of each other by networking.''

 &HT;    Florida athlete collapses, dies at pickup game
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A popular Palm Beach Lakes High School
football player and runner, headed to college on an athletic
scholarship, collapsed and died Tuesday night while playing a game
of pickup basketball with his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't get his heart started,'' his mother, Pearlie
Brown, said Wednesday. Investigators don't know what killed Tim
Brown, 17, who was pronounced dead at Columbia Hospital shortly
after 10:30 p.m. An autopsy was conducted Wednesday afternoon but
the cause of death has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brown had taken a physical exam in the summer to be cleared
to play football, and his mother said he had no history of medical
problems. He was feeling great Tuesday night when he left their
West Palm Beach home and headed for Dyer Park near the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a problem, it would have shown up,'' said head
football coach Brian Coe, who spent much of Wednesday trying to
comfort students shocked by the death of the defensive back. He was
aided by a team of counselors who had been dispatched to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a senior, had finally gotten things together in the last
year, Coe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``College was a distant thought a year ago,'' he recalled. ``But
(Tim) worked really hard to better his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off. He had played only one season of football and
caught four interceptions and was named an all-area honorable
mention his first year out. His academics improved, too. Several
colleges had talked to Brown and he was planning to play football
for the South Carolina State Bulldogs come fall, his mother and
coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone just loved him, adored him,'' said Pearlie Brown, who
gathers death notices as part of her job at the Palm Beach County
Health Department. ``He had a million-dollar smile _ and I'm not
just saying that because I'm his mother. He touched everyone in
different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The women who ownAt Pizza Etc. on Clematis Street, where Brown
had worked after school since October, the women who run the shop
were having trouble believing their favorite pizza maker was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the cutest, biggest-hearted, bald-headed football
player guy you'd ever want to meet,'' said Phoebe Reckseit,
co-owner of the restaurant. ``If you ever want to have kids, that's
what you want your kid to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his mother, Brown is survived by his father, Marvin
Brown Sr., his 23-year-old brother Marvin Jr., 23, and his
10-year-old younger brother, Sean, 10. Funeral arrangements have
not been made are incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just doesn't seem real,'' Pearlie Brown said.

PATAKI PROPOSES CUTTING HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION IN BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After a two-year detour into government largess,
Gov. George Pataki Wednesday returned to the conservative path of
his early years, proposing a $72.66 billion state budget with
substantial cuts in health care and education. He proposed
eliminating programs aimed at expanding prekindergarten classes and
lowering class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the state is flush with money, with a surplus expected to
top $2 billion, Pataki called for a spending increase of just 1.8
percent in the fiscal year that begins April 1. That follows a 13
percent increase in spending, in part on education and Medicaid,
during the two previous years, which helped enhance the governor's
popularity and propel him to a second term last November.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki proposed deep cuts in Medicaid, the health care program
for the poor, and in tuition assistance for low-income college
students. Anticipating a continued decline in welfare rolls, he
asked for a sharp drop in welfare spending.
</P>
<P>
   The governor called for an increase of barely 1 percent in aid
to schools, to $11.9 billion. He sought to back away from a 1997
budget agreement that called for several years of rising spending
to make kindergarten and prekindergarten classes available in every
community, and to reduce class sizes in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan chooses smarter government over bigger government,''
the Republican governor said in his annual budget address. ``It
commits to smart ideas that work. It better meets the needs of our
citizens. And it does all this at a cost the people can afford. Not
one nickel more.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, the opening salvo in the governor's annual budget
struggle with the state Legislature, drew venomous responses from
Democrats, who declared it dead on arrival, and from legions of
interest groups predicting dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, asserted
that the budget had less to do with New York than with Pataki's
ambitions for national office. He said the governor had tailored
his policies to appeal to conservative Republican primary voters in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one stroke of this budget, he eliminated everything that we
stood up for,'' said Silver, who was the chief sponsor of the 1997
deal to expand school programs. ``It's unacceptable, this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the largest part of the budget at $28 billion, has
long been the governor's favorite target for cuts. New York spends
far more on the program than does any other state, and its costs
have tended to rise faster than those of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital groups estimated the full impact of Pataki's latest
proposed Medicaid cuts at $727 million to $850 million, most of it
in lower payments to hospitals and nursing homes. Pataki contended
that when a tax cut for medical institutions that he is proposing
is included, they will lose less than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said: ``He's creating a dire fiscal situation for the
hospitals and nursing homes throughout New York. If these policies
go forward, there will be layoffs, service reductions and
significant reductions in the quality of the health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   In only a handful of areas would Pataki significantly increase
spending: the Office of Children and Family Services, a
much-criticized agency that is supposed to monitor and prevent
child abuse and run the foster care system; the state prison
system, which would get more operating money and a new
maximum-security prison, and school construction, which would
continue a strong three-year rise in state support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governor also proposed a $120 million increase, to $580
million, in state support for child care programs for the poor,
including people trying to leave welfare. And he would dedicate
$200 million to a new job-training effort for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Most areas of spending, like school aid, would essentially be
frozen, with increases too small to keep up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   As he promised, the governor's budget would not spend any of the
state's huge surplus, instead salting it away to help pay for tax
cuts that are already law, but have not taken effect. He also
mentioned two programs he had announced in recent days: steps to
rein in the state's rapidly growing debt, including using money
from the nationwide tobacco settlement; and almost $1 billion
annually in new tax cuts, most of which would not go into effect
for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pataki's fiscal policies have been like a roller coaster
ride, and the reactions have been no less head-swerving. In his
first two years, to close budget gaps and pay for tax cuts, he held
spending essentially unchanged by cutting health care and other
programs. He was widely excoriated as an unfeeling conservative,
and his popularity plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But as Wall Street boomed, the state found its coffers
overflowing with tax revenues. State spending rose more than $3
billion in 1997-98, then more than $5 billion this fiscal year,
even as the state continued to cut taxes. Pataki's standing soared,
and he cruised to re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget may be more restrained, but it is a reflection of
the last two years' free-wheeling ones. In addition to pouring
record sums into popular programs, the 1997 and 1998 budget deals
included tax cuts that have barely been felt yet, but whose sizes
would climb yearly, to almost $4 billion a year in 2001. It is
because of that combination of spending increases and promised tax
cuts that Pataki now feels that he must be more restrained.
</P>
<P>
   The governor scoffed at the notion that any plan that built on
those increases could be called austere. The spending increases are
small, he said, but ``one of the reasons is that we've done so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many independent analysts asserted that the last two budgets set
a course for fiscal collapse, but they praised Wednesday's plan as
a partial correction. ``We think that the governor deserves support
for standing up for fiscal prudence,'' said Diana Fortuna,
president of the Citizens Budget Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 budget agreement centered on one large trade. The
Republicans, including the governor, got a cut in property taxes
levied by school districts. It started at $700 million this fiscal
year and would grow to $2.7 billion in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Silver and the Democrats won a commitment to make
all-day kindergarten, and prekindergarten classes for 4-year-olds,
available in every school system in the state, and to lower class
sizes in kindergarten through third grade. It also included an
increase in aid for school construction. All told, the package
promised a series of increases, over and above any increases in
basic school aid, reaching $1.3 billion in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   Only the construction money would survive Pataki's budget. He
eliminated more than $300 million in promised increases for the
other parts of the program.
</P>
<P>
   The governor asserted that he would replace the program with
$200 million in block grants to school districts, but that money
could be used for almost any purpose. Not counting those grants and
the program they replaced, aid to schools would actually decline in
Pataki's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The governor called for a 21 percent drop in aid to poor college
students _ an area he has cut in the past _ to $501 million from
$633 million. He would reduce the amount that state grants would
cover for the poorest students, from 90 percent of tuition to 75
percent; he would cut aid to students who do not take a full course
load, and he would tighten eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called for bonuses for students who stay on a pace to
graduate in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's $11.9 billion school aid proposal set off a sharp
exchange between his aides and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's surrogates. Under the governor's plan, New York City
schools, with 38 percent of the state's public school students,
would get 12 percent of the additional aid.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Lhota, the city's deputy mayor for operations, drew a
link between the budget and the governor's appointment of a
commission last weekend to investigate mishandled school
construction contracts in New York City, and possible fraud in
reporting attendance figures at some city schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the commission is cover for the cut that they
want to have for the New York City schools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, and William C. Thompson Jr.,
the president of the Board of Education, released a joint statement
that said, ``The governor's proposed education budget confirms our
belief that he has little interest in the children of New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, Pataki's communications director, countered by
saying that state support for city schools has grown much faster in
recent years than the city's own contribution. ``We have been more
than equitable to the New York City schools,'' she said. ``I don't
know that you can say the same thing about the city's commitment.''

RARE BIRD IS BACK IN HAND AND SO IS SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was not your average Central Park pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this bird is a member of an endangered species.
Experts say the 3-year-old female thick-billed parrot is worth
about $20,000. Then there's the computer chip implanted in her
body.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was fitting that high-ranking city officials
postponed dinner plans Wednesday to announce her recovery, a month
after she was stolen from her cage in the Central Park Zoo, with a
news conference in the zoo's Tropic Zone, a sweaty enclave of
low-hanging trees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 24-year-old John Davilla of Brooklyn was arrested on
charges of burglary, grand larceny and criminal possession of
stolen property. (Birdnapping is apparently not specifically
outlined in the criminal code.)
</P>
<P>
   The parrot does not have a name, zoo officials said, and is on
indefinite loan from a zoo in Sacramento, Calif., along with a
mate, as part of a breeding program for endangered species. She was
identified by the computer chip, provided for precisely that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said the parrot was stolen from its padlocked cage
in an off-limits area of the zoo in the middle of the night on Dec.
16, probably taken through an adjoining, open cage. After receiving
a tip, detectives found the parrot Wednesday in Manhattan, with two
people whom Davilla had given it in exchange for some work, the
police said. They declined to provide details about the bartering
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes birds,'' Deputy Inspector Joseph J. Reznick said of
the suspect, whom he described as an aspiring model who once worked
in a pet shop. ``He's very familiar with birds.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he was taken downtown to Central Booking, Davilla stuck
out his tongue for the television cameras and declared, ``I wanted
to make stew out of that bird.''
</P>
<P>
   The bird is one of about 300 thick-billed parrots in captivity.
There are about 5,000 more in the wild in northern and central
Mexico, zoo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Originally native to the Southwest United States, the parrots
are mostly green, with red socks, gray legs and splashes of yellow
and red near the forehead. They grow to about 16 inches and live
about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Upon its return to the zoo, the parrot was placed in quarantine,
and was not available for comment. ``Unfortunately, the parrot was
not able to give any information about her captors,'' said Henry J.
Stern, the city's parks commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dan Wharton, the zoo director, said it was the first time an
animal had ever been stolen from the Central Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The parrot, he said, had been examined by a veterinarian and
appeared to be doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little weight loss,'' Wharton said, ``but otherwise it's
perky, it's active, it's eating.''

 &HT;    Nicklaus has successful hip surgery
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jack Nicklaus underwent successful total
replacement surgery of his left hip Wednesday. The one-hour,
45-minute surgery was performed by Dr. Benjamain Bierbaum, a
renowned expert in hip surgery, at New England Baptist Hospital in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went well,'' Bierbaum said. ``Fine-tuned. No
complaints. No surprises. I was pleased with how everything came
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirits are good. He did say he'd rather be one down in
the final round of the Masters and on the 18th fairway than where
he was today.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery instead has ended Nicklaus' streak of playing in 40
consecutive Masters, a tournament he has won a record six times.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who was unavailable for comment, is expected to be
hospitalized for up to six days. He will then return to his North
Palm Beach home before beginning rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 59, is hoping to return in time to play in the U.S.
Open June 17-20 at Pinehurst. Bierbaum said he estimates it will be
three months before Nicklaus can start hitting balls, which would
give him a little less than two months to get ready for the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be six weeks that are very restrictive as far as
activity and wwaiting for bone and soft-tissue healing,'' Dr.
Bierbaum said. ``After six weeks, he would start a strengthening,
flexibility and agility program. That would be at least another six
weeks. At that time, he might be about ready to start practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierbaum installed a state-of-the-art ceramic hip and joint in
Nicklaus, made possible only because Bierbaum is part of a study on
ceramic implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage is it's anticipated that the wear of the joint
will be minimal, and it is expected to be much longer-lasting than
the conventional hip of metal against plastic,'' Bierbaum said

TEXAS TAKES OVER 13 NURSING HOMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the largest ever nursing home takeover in
Texas, state officials said Wednesday they had assumed control of
13 homes accused of improper and excessive billing for federal
Medicare claims.
</P>
<P>
   The homes, which include four in Houston with 683 elderly
patients, are owned by Sensitive Care Inc. of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Suzanne Covington approved the takeover
Wednesday, effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement orders four trustees appointed by the state to
take charge of operations at the homes and clears the way for
Medicare payments to resume by Thursday, said Texas Department of
Human Services Commissioner Eric M. Bost.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order also allows state officials to tap $450,000
from a state trust fund to aid in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real important also to note that our primary concern is
for the safety and well-being of approximately 1,700 elderly
citizens,'' Bost said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they sought the takeover when they became alarmed
that vendors could demand cash up front for such essentials as
food, medical supplies, equipment and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A walkout of employees was a possibility, perhaps even likely,
in the event they realized they were not going to be paid or once
they realized their employer was in such dire financial straits,''
said Texas Attorney General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's office had filed a lawsuit Monday in behalf of the
Texas Department of Human Services, seeking the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sensitive Care's lawyers argued they were not in
financial danger and only needed time to talk with their bankers,
Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that proved to be a hollow statement on their behalf and
really just blustering,'' he added. ``I think what happened is the
harsh reality came to the front and they realized they didn't have
the money to keep operating these facilities without Medicare
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bost said the homes collected about $20 million annually from
Medicare, federal health insurance for the elderly, and $30 million
from Medicaid, federal health insurance for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive Care officials had said Tuesday that they only
received 15 percent of their revenues from Medicare. They also had
said they would ``vigorously contest'' the state taking control of
the chain.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, however, their lawyer, Carla Cox, said she was
``pleased to announce'' they had agreed on the trustees assuming
control and overseeing all operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensitive Care will continue to cooperate fully with the
Department of Human Services to ensure that residents continue to
receive high quality health care services,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the news was met with relief by Cecile H. Roberts,
who said she documented what she considered overcharges for her
late husband, an Alzheimer's patient, and had talked with two FBI
agents about the matter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Sacky, who said she had worked as a physical therapist for
the Harris County Hospital District's AIDS Clinic, complained of
inadequate investigations in the past when officials received
complaints about Sensitive Care facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were charging (AIDS) patients for medications when they
could have gotten them free from the county hospital district,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Sensitive Care facilities in Houston, she added, also
denied AIDS patients physical therapy, even when the county could
have provided it at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those indigent patients with AIDS, that meant they would
sit in their bed and rot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

BILL ATTACKING CRIME RATE OF DOGS WOULD DENY DUE PROCESS, PET
LOVERS ARGUE  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has trained his
quality-of-life sights on the city's dogs with a bill that would
increase fines for harboring dogs deemed to be dangerous, deny dogs
any consideration for being provoked into barking or biting, and
require the owners of pit bulls to obtain $100,000 in liability
insurance before being granted a dog license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious piece of legislation for a serious problem,''
said Colleen Roche, Giuliani's press secretary. ``If it can prevent
children or other New Yorkers from being maimed, disfigured or
killed, it will serve its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But word of the administration's proposals spread quickly among
dog lovers, perhaps at a pitch only they could hear. On Wednesday,
more than two dozen advocates for dogs attended a City Council
hearing on the bill to counter, point by point, every justification
that city officials provided for the drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's health commissioner, Neal L. Cohen, whose
department oversees pet regulations, testified that the current law
has ``failed to adequately protect the public from biting dogs.''
He presented statistics showing that the number of ``biting dogs''
seized by the city rose to 892 in the 1997 fiscal year from 693 in
the 1996 fiscal year. He added, in a third of those incidents, the
culpable dog was a pit bull.
</P>
<P>
   Existing law provides dogs with the defenses of ``provocation''
or ``excused behavior.'' In other words, a dog slapped in the snout
cannot be held responsible for biting, barking or otherwise
defending itself.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, if health inspectors determine a dog to be vicious or
dangerous, the department usually requires the owner to take steps
that might include muzzling it, paying for behavioral training or
even liability insurance. The owner can appeal that decision.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the investigators conclude that the owner will not
be able to control the dog, the owner has to demonstrate to a
tribunal _ sometimes called ``doggie court'' _ why the dog should
not be removed from the city or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen argued that the procedure in place is cumbersome and
ineffective, with the burden of proof unfairly placed on the city.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy such concerns, the mayor proposed to eliminate the
``provocation'' defense for dogs accused of being dangerous, which
officials said would allow the city to classify more dogs as
dangerous. The bill also calls for eliminating an owner's automatic
right to a hearing, although one would be scheduled on request.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it singles out pit bulls, requiring those who want
to own them to take out $100,000 in liability insurance. The bill
defines ``pit bulls'' as Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American
Staffordshire Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, and ``dogs
which have the appearance and characteristics'' of those breeds.
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Molbegott, a lawyer for the Humane Society, said the
mayor's proposal would take away ``the due process of people with
pets.''

 &HT;    Florida families could get back $96
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The average family would get back $96,
including a $50 rebate on its electric bill, under a tax cut Gov.
Jeb Bush proposed Wednesday that would be the largest in Florida
history _ more than $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The massive giveback, made possible by a strong economy and a
$13 billion tobacco settlement, would include a $480 million school
property tax cut. Bush insisted the money would come from an
oversupplied retirement account, not from school construction cash.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 companies and 170,000 individuals, including many
seniors, would save an average of $240 from a continued rollback in
taxes on stocks, bonds and other ``intangible'' property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses and families, especially Florida's seniors, should
be allowed to invest, spend and save their hard-earned money,''
Bush said. ``These investments are the best way to create jobs and
economic opportunity in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers unions protested Bush wants to squander money on a
``cute political ploy'' that could be used to reduce class size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're being penny-wise and pound-foolish,'' said
David Clark, spokesman for the FTP-NEA and FEA/United unions.
``We've got plenty of money to help our schools if we would just
put it to the best use.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Palm Beach County school board member agreed,
saying the money could have been put to better use hiring teachers
and building classrooms to reduce class size, or programs for
low-achieving schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he really wanted to do something for education and if it
was really his top priority, then he'd take all the money he could
find and it would go to education,'' said school board member Dot
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think $40 for an individual family is going to make or
break it,'' Montgomery said. ``Rather than give it back, let's put
it where it could do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the district set its tax rate at $9.68 per $1,000 of
taxable property value, so the average homeowner with a house
valued at $100,000 and a $25,000 homestead exemption paid $726.
With Bush's tax cut, that taxpayer would pay $672.37 in school
taxes, a $54 saving.
</P>
<P>
   District finance officers haven't had a chance to analyze Bush's
proposal yet, but it's possible that it won't adversely affect the
district's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 52 percent of the district's total revenues
came from local taxes. The state provided 36 percent of the money.
If the local share decreases, the state share might increase and
the district ends up with the same amount. The only thing lost is
the opportunity for even more money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's unclear whether Bush will win in the end, said
Vernon Crawford-Pickup, the district's legislative liaison.
</P>
<P>
   ``They firmly believe they have enough money for tax cuts,
enough money for schools, enough for transportation and prisons and
social services and health _ for everything,'' Crawford said. ``But
the proof will be in the appropriations bill on May 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Most legislators' reactions ranged from receptive to ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest dreams, I never would have thought that we'd
have this golden opportunity to offer this significant level of tax
relief to the citizens of Florida,'' House Speaker John Thrasher
said. ``Jan. 27, 1999, should go down in the books as a turning
point in Florida's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher said he believed local districts could survive the cuts
because they will not have to pour hundreds of millions of dollars
into an overfinanced state retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education folks always want more,'' Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Jack Latvala said that chamber would no
doubt have its own priorities regarding which taxes should be cut
and how much. ``A number of our members are very enamored about the
tax-free week'' on clothing, Latvala said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Buddy Dyer said his bloc of 15 Senate
votes also might have some disagreement about hiking the education
budget by only $600 million while cutting twice as much in overall
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably have 2-1 the other way around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush budget director Donna Arduin would not reveal details of
her plans, saying that ultimately, all the proposed tax cuts and
spending increases would match the money available. ``It will all
add up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal comes as legislators are set to consider
allowing a $5 a month increase in local phone rates, a move Bush
said he favors if it will bring competition. Attorney General Bob
Butterworth jokingly proposed having the electric company forward
the rebate directly to the phone company, thus cutting out the
middleman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West Palm Beach, praised Bush for taking
what was the Democrats' position last year in a Senate debate on
tax cuts _ spread it around to electric bills, including 2.2
million renters, and not just property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat refreshing to see a governor take a tax-relief
stance benefiting Florida families and not only the wealthy,''
Rossin said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cut totals could could exceed $1.3 billion with the
repeal of a liquor-by-the-drink tax worth another $100 million that
the late Gov. Lawton Chiles vetoed last year. Bush said he would
sign a repeal. That tax costs restaurant patrons 4 cents on a
12-ounce beer, 10 cents on 4 ounces of wine and 10 cents per ounce
of liquor.

GE'S COMMENTS ON DISPOSAL OF PCB'S DRAW OBJECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To many people in New York state's Hudson Valley, the scenario
is familiar: A stain of PCB's, toxic industrial chemicals, lies
buried along the river. Environmental officials and residents are
eager to dig it up, and General Electric presses to let the
contaminants stay where they are.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time is that General Electric had nothing to
do with this particular pocket of pollution, which is in a fenced
lot in Hastings-on-Hudson, a prosperous Westchester County village
15 miles from Manhattan. General Electric's factories, which
generated most of the PCB's in the river, are 150 miles upstream.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Hastings residents and some elected officials
complained Wednesday that the company was improperly interfering in
local affairs when it filed comments contending that the pollution
did not pose a significant environmental threat and opposing a
state plan to excavate the tainted soil.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Zimmerman, chairman of Hastings Waterfront Watch, a local
environmental group, called for a boycott of the company, saying
its intrusion was irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``GE should keep out of the Hastings waterfront cleanup process
and mind its own PCB's,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials defended the seven-page letter sent to the
state's Department of Environmental Conservation in November, which
criticized many aspects of the proposed $40 million cleanup plan.
David Warshaw, a spokesman for General Electric, said state law
allows anyone to comment on such an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that one portion of the public should in some way
be shut out seems to be at odds with 25 years of environmental
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has been engaged in costly PCB cleanups at its
plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edwards and faces as much as $1
billion in cleanup costs if federal officials order it to dredge
``hot spots'' downriver of the factories. That decision is due next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the company has repeatedly challenged
federal and state decisions to dig up polluted soil or river mud,
saying that in most cases the chemicals pose no substantial health
risk and eventually break down if left buried.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental officials say PCB's, or polychlorinated
biphenyls, are a probable cause of cancer and other ills in humans
and can harm wildlife. The chemicals were banned in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In Hastings, high levels of PCB's accumulated in the soil and
leached into the river during wire-making operations at a factory
owned by Anaconda Wire and Cable Co. from 1919 to 1978. Other
hazardous chemicals and heavy metals permeate parts of the 26-acre
tract. Once state officials settle on a cleanup plan, it will be
undertaken and paid for by the Atlantic Richfield Co., the current
owner of the property. Atlantic Richfield has not opposed the
cleanup plan.
</P>
<P>
   The current proposal calls for the excavation of six heavily
contaminated spots, with the material taken to hazardous waste
landfills. Other areas would be capped with clean soil or other
materials.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric said the PCB's could be permanently sealed and
stabilized where they are, eliminating the need for costly digging,
trucking and disposal. This echoes its position on the dredging of
PCB's in the upper Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw said the company felt it was obligated to share its
expertise and opinions, which had been gained over more than a
decade of studying and cleaning PCB contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Brodsky, the chairman of the Assembly Committee on
Environmental Conservation and a Democrat representing Hastings,
said General Electric had no right to file comments in the cleanup
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that they're casually offering an opinion just to
be helpful doesn't have any dignity,'' said Brodsky, who held a
news conference Wednesday to draw attention to the issue.
``Hastings is a pawn in the larger GE chess game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, said Wednesday that there were no
obvious legal barriers to General Electric's expressing its views
on cleanups that were not its responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The company filed similar comments last year when the state
agency proposed a PCB cleanup at a site owned by Georgia Pacific
Corp. on the shore of Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh, Sheffer said.
``We asked for removal,'' Sheffer said. ``GE thought the best
solution was containment, and we opted for removal.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ After Salt Lake City lost the 1998 Olympics to Nagano,
Japan, the Salt Lake Olympic organizers vowed to change their
strategy for the 2002 Games. One of their first moves was to hire a
former member of Egypt's national volleyball team who had close
personal contacts with athletic officials in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The former volleyball player, Mahmoud el-Farnawani, a
65-year-old sports souvenirs salesman, is part of a new breed of
global lobbyists who are playing an increasingly influential role
in decisions about where to stage the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials had ample reason to believe
el-Farnawani could help them. After he worked as a volunteer for
Toronto during its unsuccessful campaign to win the 1996 Summer
Games, the Australian Olympic Committee had paid him $60,000 to
help Sydney secure the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his biggest payday so far, $161,000, from Salt Lake
City for his efforts to collect votes from North African delegates.
In a series of interviews, he compared his work to that of a
Washington lobbyist astutely identifying the preferences of key
lawmakers. He explained, for instance, that he has used his
knowledge of committee members to counsel bidders for the Olympics
about how to use the information to their advantage. The
information is often personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he happily married, or is he not?'' el-Farnawani said,
offering an example of information he might provide about a
committee member. ``How many children does he have? Is he a
religious person or not? What kind of food does he eat, what kind
of subjects not to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   The backstage role in the Olympics played by people like
el-Farnawani has only recently come to light. Now Olympic officials
are scrambling to determine just how many of the so-called
consultants have been at work shaping decisions on where to award
the Games, and if they might have ever gone too far. To date,
investigations into Salt Lake City's payment of cash and gifts to
Olympic committee members have not accused el-Farnawani or other
similar lobbyists of wrongdoing, and neither has anyone else
accused them of breaking any laws or acting improperly.
</P>
<P>
   But the North Africans courted by el-Farnawani have figured
prominently in the Olympic movement's recently released report on
abuses by Salt Lake City. A son of Libya's Olympic delegate
received a scholarship to a Utah university and $700 a month in
payments. A Sudanese delegate received $25,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who is not currently working for any city, said he
did not know of these arrangements and was surprised to read about
them in news accounts. The Libyan delegate resigned from the
international committee and the Sudanese member was expelled from
the Olympic committee last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials said they are determined to impose much
stricter rules on the lobbyists, who have proliferated in the years
since the Games became a lucrative business for cities that win the
bid competition and hold the Games. The conduct of the middlemen is
one of the chief issues in the investigations into whether Olympic
committee votes have, in effect, been bought over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking generally of the lobbyists, Richard Pound, the senior
Olympic official who conducted the International Olympic
Committee's investigation into wrongdoing surrounding Salt Lake's
efforts, said he and others were troubled by their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into this issue of the so-called `agents,' who
prey on the vulnerabilities and naivete of bidding cities,'' Pound
said. ``By the time we are through with so-called Olympic agents, I
doubt that it will be a profitable business _ if it ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound's report on the Salt Lake bid, however, did not accuse
el-Farnawani of any specific wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent revelations, Olympic bids were awarded by a
secret vote of the IOC, which includes more than 100 delegates from
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   As they competed with each other, officials from Sweden, Utah or
South Africa found themselves pondering how they might sway an
Olympic official from Poland or the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists were not bashful about offering their services.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gatlin, executive director of Atlanta's successful effort
to stage the 1996 Summer Games, recalled that local officials were
besieged by middlemen. He said one offered to deliver votes in
exchange for a fee of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people swarming around after you become a bid city''
in advance of the voting, Gatlin recalled. ``They are subtle. They
say they can offer introductions, get you to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before the scandal erupted about the Olympics, el-Farnawani
was prospecting for clients who might want help with the 2004
Summer Games, which eventually went to Athens. His description of
what he was offering was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought he could help with influencing voters,''
said Chris Ball, chief of the unsuccessful Cape Town bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by a city competing to host the Games has been around
for a long time, but the use of outsiders paid large amounts of
money is a recent phenomenon, growing as the Games have become more
profitable for the cities.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who lives modestly in a Toronto suburb, is only
one of several plying the Olympics trade. Salt Lake City used at
least two other middlemen, a Kuwaiti and a Utah businessman.
Sydney, Australia, also had two other lobbyists, one of whom
handled Latin American nations, the other Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What the bid committee in Sydney called ``regional specialists''
included a Hungarian-born American, Gabor Komyathy, who was a
swimmer and tennis player and could speak a half-dozen languages.
He was sent to lobby the Eastern European delegations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Latin Americans, Sydney turned to Elizabeth Fox, a
Colombian who had emigrated to Australia. Her primary job ws to act
as an interpreter, and host parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a beautiful house, right on the water,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Pt. Piper, a Sydney suburb.
``We had wonderful dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not paid. ``I just believe in helping,'' she
said. Efforts to reach Komyathy, who lives in Southern California,
were unsuccessful. His home telephone number is unlisted and a fax
sent to his business number was not answered.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, el-Farnawani said he regards himself as a
legitimate lobbyist who uses his contacts and his cultural
expertise to advise competing cities on how best to make their case
to Arab-African members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by all this news,'' el-Farnawani said of the
scholarships and payments. ``I read it for the first time as
everybody read it. It was quite shocking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he advised Salt Lake and Sydney that when a Muslim
delegate was coming to their city, there should be a Koran and a
prayer rug in his hotel room, and no alcohol in the mini-bar.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges, however, that the cities were paying for more
than his insights on Muslim culture: They were buying his personal
relationships with Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his native Egypt, el-Farnawani was an accomplished
middle-distance runner and volleyball player, and after his
competitive days were over he coached the Egyptian national
volleyball team. His family was one of the wealthiest in Egypt, he
said, until Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power in the mid-1950s and
nationalized the family's textile business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though life was more difficult, he remained until the 1967
war with Israel. He then moved to Libya where he coached the
national volleyball team, a job that allowed him to travel, thus
continuing his contacts in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he fled to Canada after Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader, came to power. First he went to Montreal, where he was a
high school physical education teacher. Eventually he moved to
Toronto, and in 1983 he founded Sports &AMP; Trade Canada. When Toronto
began bidding for the 1996 Olympic Games, he worked as a volunteer,
hoping that if Toronto won he would get a license to sell trinkets
with the Olympic logo. Toronto lost to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And so when officials from Sydney came calling, he asked to be
paid. He signed a contract for $3500 a month, later raised to
$4000. He said he expected to get a license to sell his products if
Sydney won. According to documents released by Australian Olympic
officials, el-Farnawani was present at a Monte Carlo hotel in
September 1993 when the Olympic committee voted 45-43 to give
Sydney the 2000 Games. The night before, the documents show,
Australian officials met with two African delegates and promised
their respective Olympic committees a total of $70,000 in funds.
They confirmed their arrangement the morning of the vote in a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' read the letter, ``Mahmoud el-Farnawani is
meeting with you with full authority to commit me in respect to any
assistance you identify.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani said he could not account for the letter's content.
</P>
<P>
   After Sydney's close victory, el-Farnawani did not get a license
to sell sports souvenirs at the Games. He did, however, win a
recommendation that led to his being hired by the Salt Lake City
bid team. Again, his task was to lobby for the votes of the five
members from the Arab states of North Africa: Algeria, Libya,
Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those delegates have been caught in the unfolding
scandal. Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, from Libya, resigned after it
was divulged that his son Suhel had received a scholarship and $700
a month in expense money from the Salt Lake City bid committee. And
Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, of Sudan, was expelled after
investigators concluded that he received more than $25,000 from the
Salt Lake City bid committee for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani described both men as his good friends whom he had
known for many years. He denied that he had had anything to do with
the payments, and said that he had not even been aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' el-Farnawani said of the committee members,
``I knew them for a long time, so they will not do anything to hurt
their image before me. Nobody will dare to ask for anything like
that from me. And the bid city never asked me to do this kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani's lawyer, David Goodman, asserted that the agents
are being made scapegoats. Goodman said there was nothing wrong
with a city's hiring agents.

to stage the 1996 Summer Games, recalled that local officials were
besieged by middlemen. He said one offered to deliver votes in
exchange for a fee of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people swarming around after you become a bid city''
in advance of the voting, Gatlin recalled. ``They are subtle. They
say they can offer introductions, get you to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before the scandal erupted about the Olympics, el-Farnawani
was prospecting for clients who might want help with the 2004
Summer Games, which eventually went to Athens. His description of
what he was offering was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought he could help with influencing voters,''
said Chris Ball, chief of the unsuccessful Cape Town bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying by a city competing to host the Games has been around
for a long time, but the use of outsiders paid large amounts of
money is a recent phenomenon, growing as the Games have become more
profitable for the cities.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani, who lives modestly in a Toronto suburb, is only
one of several plying the Olympics trade. Salt Lake City used at
least two other middlemen, a Kuwaiti and a Utah businessman.
Sydney, Australia, also had two other lobbyists, one of whom
handled Latin American nations, the other Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What the bid committee in Sydney called ``regional specialists''
included a Hungarian-born American, Gabor Komyathy, who was a
swimmer and tennis player and could speak a half-dozen languages.
He was sent to lobby the Eastern European delegations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Latin Americans, Sydney turned to Elizabeth Fox, a
Colombian who had emigrated to Australia. Her primary job ws to act
as an interpreter, and host parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a beautiful house, right on the water,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Pt. Piper, a Sydney suburb.
``We had wonderful dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not paid. ``I just believe in helping,'' she
said. Efforts to reach Komyathy, who lives in Southern California,
were unsuccessful. His home telephone number is unlisted and a fax
sent to his business number was not answered.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, el-Farnawani said he regards himself as a
legitimate lobbyist who uses his contacts and his cultural
expertise to advise competing cities on how best to make their case
to Arab-African members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by all this news,'' el-Farnawani said of the
scholarships and payments. ``I read it for the first time as
everybody read it. It was quite shocking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he advised Salt Lake and Sydney that when a Muslim
delegate was coming to their city, there should be a Koran and a
prayer rug in his hotel room, and no alcohol in the mini-bar.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges, however, that the cities were paying for more
than his insights on Muslim culture: They were buying his personal
relationships with Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his native Egypt, el-Farnawani was an accomplished
middle-distance runner and volleyball player, and after his
competitive days were over he coached the Egyptian national
volleyball team. His family was one of the wealthiest in Egypt, he
said, until Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power in the mid-1950s and
nationalized the family's textile business.
</P>
<P>
   Even though life was more difficult, he remained until the 1967
war with Israel. He then moved to Libya where he coached the
national volleyball team, a job that allowed him to travel, thus
continuing his contacts in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he fled to Canada after Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader, came to power. First he went to Montreal, where he was a
high school physical education teacher. Eventually he moved to
Toronto, and in 1983 he founded Sports &AMP; Trade Canada. When Toronto
began bidding for the 1996 Olympic Games, he worked as a volunteer,
hoping that if Toronto won he would get a license to sell trinkets
with the Olympic logo. Toronto lost to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And so when officials from Sydney came calling, he asked to be
paid. He signed a contract for $3500 a month, later raised to
$4000. He said he expected to get a license to sell his products if
Sydney won. According to documents released by Australian Olympic
officials, el-Farnawani was present at a Monte Carlo hotel in
September 1993 when the Olympic committee voted 45-43 to give
Sydney the 2000 Games. The night before, the documents show,
Australian officials met with two African delegates and promised
their respective Olympic committees a total of $70,000 in funds.
They confirmed their arrangement the morning of the vote in a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' read the letter, ``Mahmoud el-Farnawani is
meeting with you with full authority to commit me in respect to any
assistance you identify.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani said he could not account for the letter's content.
</P>
<P>
   After Sydney's close victory, el-Farnawani did not get a license
to sell sports souvenirs at the Games. He did, however, win a
recommendation that led to his being hired by the Salt Lake City
bid team. Again, his task was to lobby for the votes of the five
members from the Arab states of North Africa: Algeria, Libya,
Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those delegates have been caught in the unfolding
scandal. Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, from Libya, resigned after it
was divulged that his son Suhel had received a scholarship and $700
a month in expense money from the Salt Lake City bid committee. And
Zein el-Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, of Sudan, was expelled after
investigators concluded that he received more than $25,000 from the
Salt Lake City bid committee for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani described both men as his good friends whom he had
known for many years. He denied that he had had anything to do with
the payments, and said that he had not even been aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' el-Farnawani said of the committee members,
``I knew them for a long time, so they will not do anything to hurt
their image before me. Nobody will dare to ask for anything like
that from me. And the bid city never asked me to do this kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Farnawani's lawyer, David Goodman, asserted that the agents
are being made scapegoats. Goodman said there was nothing wrong
with a city's hiring agents.

CLOUDS OVER FUTURE OF ALCOHOLISM CENTER NOTED FOR CELEBRITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid a swirl of court papers and bitter feelings, the
future of the Smithers Alcoholism Treatment and Training Center, a
Manhattan institution with a celebrity-studded patient roster, is
in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Smithers, the widow of the center's founder, said
Wednesday that she wanted her family's name removed from the
stately mansion on East 93rd Street if the current stewards of the
program, Continuum Health Partners and St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center, relocate the program to a wing of the hospital in
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we discover it is often harder to take our name off a
building than to put it on,'' said Mrs. Smithers, whose late
husband, R. Brinkley Smithers, had donated $10 million to develop
the center.
</P>
<P>
   Smithers spoke to reporters outside the recovery center
Wednesday because she said she no longer feels welcome inside the
wrought-iron-and-glass doors.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of the center shutting its doors, Mrs.
Smithers said her lawyers were in discussion with officials at
North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System about opening an
alcohol treatment and rehabilitation center on Long Island that
would be similar to the current center.
</P>
<P>
   She also said representatives of the Betty Ford Center and Lenox
Hill Hospital had expressed interest in the recovery program.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, Mrs. Smithers' family and St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital Center have been embroiled in a legal battle for control
of the recovery program and the multimillion-dollar endowment left
by the center's founder. ``An amicable divorce'' is what Mrs.
Smithers said she would like.
</P>
<P>
   Citing financial pressures, hospital officials in early 1995
announced their plan to move the treatment program, which has a
44-patient capacity, from the Carnegie Hill neighborhood to the
hospital's Roosevelt division, at 58th Street and 10th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the first step designed to ultimately get rid
of the program,'' said Mrs. Smithers' lawyer, Paul Levenson.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smithers said that the center was associated with a
treatment philosophy that includes a freestanding, homey
environment and that placing the program in a hospital setting
would destroy its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrity patients, John Cheever once roomed with a
ballet dancer, an insurance salesman, a deli owner and a tattooed
sailor, according to his daughter, Susan, who wrote about this in a
book about him. Other celebrities treated there have included
Dwight Gooden, Joan Kennedy, Darryl Strawberry and Truman Capote.
Patient stays are usually 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her concerns about the center's environment, Mrs.
Smithers has questioned whether St. Luke's-Roosevelt is trying to
use the center's resources to balance its books.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Mrs. Smithers' lawyer said the
building was bought for $1 million in 1973 from Smithers' donation,
and the hospital now has placed a $20 million price tag on the
structure.
</P>
<P>
   According to an agreement with the state attorney general's
office, the hospital intends to use the proceeds from the sale to
pay its debts, except for $1 million that would be put back into
the program, Levenson, the lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe Smithers gave $10 million to finance a real
estate investment,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, Brice
Peyre, said Wednesday that there would be no comment. ``We're not
going to be offering any formal comment while the litigation is
pending,'' he said. ``But I would like to stress that we are not
closing the program but moving it to St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Mrs. Smithers unsuccessfully sued in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan to stop the relocation of the center and sale of
the building. A judge had dismissed the suit, ruling that only the
New York attorney general could sue for breach of charitable gift
conditions. Last week, Mrs. Smithers filed an appeal to that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the program would be relocated to the
hospital. Mrs. Smithers' lawyer said the state has yet to
physically inspect what would be the program's new home within the
hospital. Levenson said he believed that the delay was because the
replacement center did not comply with minimum codes for a
substance-abuse center.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithers center has a training center and counseling
services at the Roosevelt division, and it housed an inpatient
detoxification unit there until November, when the unit was closed
down.
</P>
<P>
   But the 93rd Street house, once the mansion of Billy Rose, the
Broadway impresario, always has been the centerpiece of the
program. Within its secluded, tranquil environment, more than
10,000 people have been treated, with substance abusers sometimes
forging incongruous alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Once at Smithers, patients are randomly assigned to
dormitory-style rooms, with vaulted ceilings and french doors, and
to therapy groups, which are the heart of the treatment. Counseling
sessions are held in wood-paneled rooms. An outdoor stone terrace
offers a place to relax.
</P>
<P>
   John Imhof, vice president of behavioral health services for
North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, said Wednesday that
talks were under way with Mrs. Smithers about developing a
treatment program that could operate somewhat like the center on
the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been planning to move ahead, regardless of what
has been transpiring in the city,'' Imhof said. ``It would be an
outstanding and exciting collaboration.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PANAMA CITY, PANAMA _ In the Asis cafe in the heart of Panama
City's historic center, owner Pablo Lo Giudice sits proudly at a
table as the first customers come through the door. The Asis has
opened for business that morning and Lo Giudice, an Agentinian who
came to Panama in 1996 to work for U.S. mobile phone operator
BellSouth, is already talking of more branches. ``This country _
well, it seems a cliche to say it,'' he says, ``but this country is
a land of opportunity.''
 &HT;    Panama is hoping that other foreign investors, big and small,
share that view. The country's courting of investment has a simple
motivation: the impending withdrawal of the U.S. troops that have
been part of the picture here for nearly a century. Due to leave by
the end of 1999, their absence will mean a loss to the economy of
between US$227 million and $350 million, according to the U.S.
Department of Defence. But it is also creating an unparalleled
opportunity: the chance to bring investment into the massive
collection of land and buildings that U.S. forces built, developed,
and are now bequeathing to Panama. The countdown to the handover is
giving Panama its turn in the investment spotlight and it intends
to make it count.
 &HT;    The country is Latin America's odd man out in so many ways, born
with the United States as midwife and with an economy
three-quarters dependent on services such as its international
banking center and the Colon Free Zone _ not to mention the canal,
which also stays under U.S. control until the end of the year.
Furthermore, there is no doubting what most people here see as
their nation's biggest advantage _ a currency with George
Washington's face on the notes. The dollar is probably a more
valuable legacy of U.S. involvement than even the canal.
 &HT;    ``From an economic point of view we are more like a state of the
U.S.,'' says Montague Belanger, general manager of the Banco del
Istmo, one of Panama's largest banks. ``You have developing country
opportunities without developing country risk.''
 &HT;    Ten years ago, however, few would have touched Panama with a
bargepole as it lurched from crisis to crisis under General Manuel
Noriega. The United States imposed sanctions and billions of
dollars in bank deposits poured out.
 &HT;    Today, that dark period seems consigned to history. Democracy is
cemented _ as shown by President Ernesto Perez Balladares'
acceptance of his defeat in last August's referendum on
constitutitional changes. Voters threw out measures that would have
allowed him to stand for another term in office.
 &HT;    Praise. Despite being knocked back at the polls, Perez
Balladares, whose term ends in September 1999, has won plaudits
from the business community for his bold overhaul of Panama's
economy. To a negligible level of inflation _ barely over 1 percent
for the last 40 years _ his administration has added big
improvements to the basic business infrastructure.
Telecommunications have been privatized, bringing down
international call rates, and electricity charges will also fall
following the recent privatization of the state electricity
company. The road network has been expanded and top foreign port
operators brought in. The rewards are coming, with GDP growth of
4.4 percent in 1997 and a similar amount forecast for 1998, despite
the global slowdown.
 &HT;    ``Business in Panama feels that finally there is a strategy,''
says Felipe Rodriguez, president of the Panamanian Association of
Business Executives (APEDE). ``The present government has
implemented drastic changes to bring Panama into the world economy.
Previous governments let a lot of time pass without taking the
necessary measures, so now we have had to do it in a shock way to
catch up.''
 &HT;    At the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM), Richard Wainio,
one of the directors, says surveys show faith in Perez Balladares.
``Members this year compared with previous years have indicated
high confidence in the government. They are doing a creditable
job.''
 &HT;    And consumers, too, seem to feel good. Demand is buoyant,
fuelled by aggressive bank lending and by the government's sharp
tariff reductions to fulfil WTO entry requirements that have
slashed import prices. ``Every day you seem to see a new
restaurant,'' says AMCHAM president Rodrigo Moreno. U.S. stores
like Sears and Price Costco are expanding. Restaurant franchises
such as Bennigan's and Italianni's are arriving. AMCHAM director
Joseph Fidanque says: ``Just look at the cars, and the way people
are dressed, and the number of people out on a Friday night.
Everyone is out spending money.''
 &HT;    To maintain this growth and cut a sticky 12 percent unemployment
rate, the development of the former canal zone is central. In 1993
the government set up the Interoceanic Regional Authority (ARI) to
take charge of the U.S. legacy and put it to profitable use. ARI's
many detractors say it is struggling to handle the sheer quantity
of assets _ 100,000 hectares and 7,000 buildings _ that are coming
into its possession.
 &HT;    Certainly there have been setbacks, and not all the uses being
found for some buildings are bringing much for the economy _ many
government ministries, for example, have shuffled into the reverted
areas. But ARI's head Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a former president
of Panama and previously a vice president of the World Bank, points
to more than $1 billion in contracts in place already. He estimates
that more than 100 projects now under negotiation could bring in
another $300 million.
 &HT;    ``The whole idea is to create on the banks of the canal a much
larger international business hub, taking advantage of the canal
and the strategic location,'' he says. He puts the canal at the
heart of ``a web of synergies'' that also includes the
international banking center, the Colon Free Zone and the world's
biggest shipping fleet.
 &HT;    The canal is the keystone. More than 13,000 ships transit each
year, bringing unrivaled opportunities for trade and the provision
of maritime services. Yet the United States had little interest in
using the canal zone to exploit such services and even port
development lagged.
 &HT;    Shipping hub. As the canal zone is handed over piece by piece,
Panama is making up for lost time. The most obvious success has
been the amazing transition in the once inefficient ports. ARI's
aim, to create the No. 1 container trans-shipment center in Latin
America, is already becoming reality.
 &HT;    Two new container ports have appeared since 1994: Manzanillo
International Terminal, (operated by U.S.-based Stevedoring
Services of America) which was expected to handle 800,000 TEUs in
1998, and a terminal at Coco Solo (operated by Taiwanese shipping
line Evergreen), which opened in 1997 and will have capacity to
handle 400,000 TEUs in its first phase. Panama Ports, the local
operating arm of Hong Kong giant Hutchison Whampoa, won the
concession to run two more privatised ports, Balboa and Cristobal,
and has $100 million in investment under way. The predicted further
expansion in container operations by 2000 should bring an extra
$200 million into Panama's economy, according to Ruben Reyna, head
of the Panama Maritime Authority.
 &HT;    Such aggressive growth drives down port costs and opens up a
host of other possibilities, not least for the Colon Free Zone. The
free zone, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1998, boasts
some $12 billion a year in duty free imports and re-exports, making
it the hemisphere's biggest free zone and the single biggest part
of Panama's economy. Free zones are developing in other countries,
but the CFZ says it is still maintaining its competitive advantage,
not least because of tumbling port costs. Nidal Waked, president of
the CFZ Users' Association, says freight rates from Asia have
nearly halved in the past three years _ improving margins and
helping traders give customers lower prices.
 &HT;    The next step in the maritime strategy is to deepen provision of
services such as bunker fuel sales, chandlering, and ship and
container repairs _ taking advantage of the average 12 hours that
ships spend waiting to transit the canal.
 &HT;    ``Virtually all the boats of the world come through our waters,
so why not develop this opportunity?'' says Trade and Industry
Minister Raul Hernandez. ``There are all kinds of other service
that you can give to ships that previously Panama was not
experienced in, but which we are now beginning.''
 &HT;    Panama also hopes its location can become a selling point for
export processing zones, in their infancy here compared with the
maquila operations rolled out in Mexico or Honduras. High wage
costs _ the downside of the U.S.-influenced dollar economy _ have
not helped. But the Panexport zone in a suburb of Panama City has
seven firms operating from North America and Europe. ARI has also
developed an export zone at Fort Davis, vacated by the United
States and now home to eight Taiwanese companies.
 &HT;    Eduardo Quijano, vice president of Unesa, the owners of
Panexport, hopes the companies keep coming. ``The more the better.
One of the problems of Panama is that it is not known as a center
for industry. The more that come, the more it will attract.''
 &HT;    He adds the benefits of Panama's banking center to the list of
advantages in setting up export zones. ``Companies get loans at 11
percent _ loans at first world levels. You do not get that in all
of Latin America.''
 &HT;    Banks are ``key players'' in Panama, says Belanger of Banco del
Istmo. Growth in the banking center is coming mainly from domestic
banks, which began to fill the vacuum when foreign rivals pulled
out in the Noriega years. A reformed bank law, enacted by decree in
1998 by Perez Balladares, a former Citibank executive, has
tightened supervision and is expected to smarten up Panama's image
abroad. That should help its banks to keep growing by making it
easier to tap international capital markets.
 &HT;    Easy access. Alberto Pons, president of the industrialists'
union, says Panamanian firms have no problems with access to money
_ and nor do consumers, who have been the main beneficiaries of
fierce competition among the banks. Take out a loan and get a free
mobile phone is a typical bank offer. Several business people warn
that sooner or later a slowdown is inevitable.
 &HT;    For a good idea of where a lot of that credit is ending up, try
driving around Panama's traffic clogged streets. ``The main reason
that the auto sector is growing so fast is a the support we have
from the banks,'' says Jorge Batinovich, president of the car
distributors' association and a dealer for Japanese automaker
Mitsubishi. ``I would even say you do not even need to show your
income _ you just show up with an invoice. That's how easily you
can get financing in Panama.'' Batinovich, whose sales in the first
nine months of 1998 exceeded the total for 1997, reckons new car
sales were set to hit between 25,000 and 27,000 vehicles in 1998,
compared with 22,000 the previous year.
 &HT;    Tariff cuts have given a particular boost to sales of luxury
auto marques, as well as electronic goods, PCs, and household
goods. Henry Striem, whose Importadora La Selecta chain sells
mostly imported furnishings, says he is ``very satisfied'' with 10
percent growth in 1998. ``Tariff cuts have prompted customers to
buy more of the products that they always wanted but could not
afford,'' he says. Norman Arosemena, stores manager for Panama's
big Rey supermarket chain, says customers are getting more choice
and better quality _ and expect stores to compete to deliver it.
 &HT;    Trade Minister Hernandez claims that Panama is ``the most open
economy in Latin America,'' with tariffs averaging 8 percent.
 &HT;    The downside has been the jolt to domestic industrialists and
farmers who are being exposed to the rude shock of competition _
exacerbated by the government slashing tariffs in one go, instead
of phasing the cuts as originally negotiated with the WTO.
 &HT;    ``The shopkeepers and traders are the ones with smiles on their
faces,'' says APEDE President Rodriguez, who owns a tyre refit
business as well as cattle farms. ``The industrialists are looking
worried _ and the farmers are crying.''
 &HT;    Charlie Dawson, president of the Panama Exporters' Association,
agrees: ``A number of industrialists are not going to be able to
survive. They have not been given enough time to find a way, '' he
says. Part of the solution is the need to foster an ``export
culture'' in Panama, Dawson says. ``In Costa Rica everyone is
geared toward developing exports, realising that the market is too
small. Here in Panama, for so many years exports were not really
looked on as a necessity or a requirement, or even as something
feasible.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile Rodriguez believes tourism development is fundamental
to replace some of the jobs that will be lost in agriculture. ARI
agrees: half of its promised investments are in tourism, with the
showpiece the planned development of Amador, at the southern end of
the Panama Canal. Ecotourism facilities and canal cruise terminals
are also planned, with Ardito Barletta pointing out that in the
past some 300 cruise ships have transited the canal each year
without a passenger setting foot ashore or spending a cent in
Panama.
 &HT;    ``Cruise ships are expanding in the Caribbean, they are building
20 new ships and they are looking for new places,'' he concludes.
Yet ARI's tourism plans are among the most criticised aspects of
its operations and not everyone is sure the promised developments _
including a Korean-American group's $300 million hotel and leisure
complex _ will materialize. Meanwhile a boom in the construction of
luxury hotels in Panama City _ hardly geared for ecotourism _ is
already driving down occupancy levels.
 &HT;    Education. What tasks remain to boost the economic outlook?
Business people say the government's 10 year strategy to improve
education is very welcome. ``We do not have technical skills a I
would pay a good wage to a qualified technician, but there aren't
any,'' laments Varielo De Sanctis, owner of one of Panama's biggest
fish exporters. Unesa's Quijano says it is ``difficult to find
qualified people'' to manage the company's franchise diners such as
TGI Friday's.
 &HT;    AMCHAM Director Wainio says members are not worried by Panama's
past associations but do want red tape cut. ``I have heard a lot of
complaints from people who basically gave up trying to do business
because of various obstacles, but never because of a bad
reputation,'' he says.
 &HT;    Political uncertainty at the moment is of the healthy kind:
Panama is embroiled in a prolonged election campaign ahead of May's
presidential poll. Consumer sales have already taken a knock as a
result. APEDE's Rodriguez says Perez Balladares' successor must
follow through with reforms. ``The credibility of the country is at
stake,'' he warns.
 &HT;    Back in Panama City's colonial district _ where private
investment is quickly transforming a rundown neighborhood into a
smart address _ Pablo Lo Giudice has no doubts that Panama is the
place to be. His new coffee house is the only one of its kind for
miles around. ``Foreigners see the opportunities,'' he says. ``I am
not inventing the wheel here. But no one did it before.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PANAMA _ En el cafe Asis, en el corazon del casco historico de
la capital de Panama, su dueno Pablo Lo Giudice se sienta con
orgullo a una mesa mientras entran los primeros clientes. Lo
Giudice, un argentino que se mudo a Panama en 1996 para trabajar
con la division de telefonia movil de BellSouth, ya habla de abrir
mas cafes. ``Este pais, aunque decirlo sea un cliche, es una tierra
de oportunidades,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Panama espera que otros inversionistas extranjeros concuerden
con Lo Giudice. El afan de atraer inversion responde a una
motivacion simple: la inminente retirada de las tropas
norteamericanas que han formado parte del panorama local desde hace
casi un siglo. Los efectivos de EU deben retirarse a fines de 1999,
lo que significara una perdida de entre US$227 y US$350 millones,
segun el Departamento de Defensa de EU. Pero a la vez crea una
oportunidad sin paralelo: la ocasion de atraer inversiones a la
enorme coleccion de terrenos y edificios que las fuerzas armadas
norteamericanas urbanizaron y que ahora le dejan al pais. Esto le
da a Panama la oportunidad de situarse en el candelero del
escenario inversionista, y el pais no piensa desaprovechar la
coyuntura.
 &HT;    En muchos sentidos, Panama es un caso unico en America Latina:
nacio con Estados Unidos como partero y las tres cuartas partes de
su economia dependen de su condicion de centro bancario
internacional y de la Zona Libre de Colon, ademas del Canal, que
estara bajo control de Washington hasta fines de este ano. Ademas,
no hay duda de que los panamenos consideran que la mayor ventaja
que EU deja al pais es el dolar.
 &HT;    ``Economicamente, somos mas bien un estado de Estados Unidos,''
comenta Montague Belanger, gerente general del Banco del Istmo, uno
de los mayores de Panama. ``Tenemos las oportunidades de los paises
en desarrollo sin los riesgos de los paises en desarrollo.''
 &HT;    Hace 10 anos, los inversionistas se mantenian a distancia debido
a los problemas del general Manuel Antonio Noriega. Estados Unidos
impuso sanciones y miles de millones de dolares en deposito
escaparon del pais.
 &HT;    Hoy ese oscuro periodo es cosa del pasado. La democracia esta
cimentada: el presidente Ernesto Perez Balladares acepto su derrota
en el referendo de agosto de 1998 sobre cambios a la Constitucion.
Los electores rechazaron modificaciones a la Carta Magna que le
habrian permitido gobernar por otro periodo.
 &HT;    Elogios. A pesar de su derrota en los sondeos, Perez Balladares,
cuyo periodo presidencial concluye en septiembre de este ano, se ha
ganado el aplauso del empresariado por su audaz reforma de la
economia. A un insignificante nivel de inflacion (poco mas del 1
por ciento durante los ultimos 40 anos) su gobierno ha anadido
grandes mejoras a la infraestructura comercial basica. Las
telecomunicaciones se han privatizado, lo que ha bajado las tarifas
de las llamadas internacionales, y el costo de la electricidad
tambien bajara tras la reciente privatizacion de la empresa
electrica. La red de carreteras se ha ampliado y han llegado al
pais importantes operadores extranjeros de puertos. Las medidas ya
dan frutos: en 1997 el PIB crecio el 4,4 por ciento y para 1998 se
pronostico una cifra similar, a pesar de la desaceleracion
economica mundial.
 &HT;    ``Los empresarios en Panama opinan que por fin hay una
estrategia,'' senala Felipe Rodriguez, presidente de la Asociacion
Panamena de Ejecutivos de Empresa. ``El gobierno ha implementado
cambios drasticos para colocar a Panama en la economia mundial. Los
gobiernos anteriores dejaron pasar mucho tiempo sin tomar las
medidas necesarias, de modo que ahora tenemos que hacerlo de prisa
para ponernos al dia.''
 &HT;    En la Camara Americana de Comercio e Industrias de Panama
(AMCHAM), Richard Wainio, uno de los directores, dice que los
sondeos muestran que hay fe en Perez Balladares. ``En comparacion
con anos anteriores, este ano los miembros han indicado un alto
grado de confianza en el gobierno, que esta haciendo un trabajo
loable.''
 &HT;    Los consumidores parecen sentirse bien. La demanda es alta,
impulsada por generosos prestamos bancarios y por profundas
reducciones arancelarias dispuestas para cumplir los requisitos de
entrada en la Organizacion Mundial de Comercio (OMC). ``Uno tiene
la impresion de que todos los dias abre un restaurante nuevo,''
comenta Rodrigo Moreno, presidente de la AMCHAM. Tiendas
norteamericanas como Sears y Price Costco se amplian. Llegan
franquicias de restaurantes como Bennigan's e Italianni's. Joseph
Fidanque, director de la AMCHAM, dice: ``Basta con ver los autos y
las ropas, y la cantidad de gente que sale los viernes por la
noche. Todo el mundo esta gastando dinero.''
 &HT;    Para mantener este crecimiento y reducir una tasa de desempleo
del 12 por ciento, el desarrollo de la Zona del Canal tiene una
importancia vital. En 1993, el gobierno creo la Autoridad de la
Region Interoceanica (ARI) para encargarse de la instalacion y
mantener su rentabilidad. Los numerosos detractores de la ARI
afirman que el organismo tiene problemas para manejar la gran
cantidad de activos que pasan a su posesion: 100.000 hectareas de
terreno y 7.000 edificios.
 &HT;    No hay duda que ha habido problemas, pero el director de la ARI,
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, ex presidente de Panama y ex
vicepresidente del Banco Mundial, senala que ya hay mas de US$1.000
millones en contratos. Calcula que los mas de 100 proyectos en
proceso de negociacion podrian aportar otros US$300 millones.
 &HT;    ``La idea es crear en las riberas del Canal un centro de
comercio internacional mucho mas vasto, aprovechando el Canal y su
ubicacion estrategica,'' dice. Situa al Canal en el corazon de
``una red de sinergias'' que tambien abarca al centro bancario
internacional, a la Zona Libre de Colon y a la mayor flota mercante
del mundo.
 &HT;    El Canal es la piedra angular. Mas de 13.000 barcos lo cruzan
cada ano, lo que crea oportunidades sin paralelo de comercio y
servicios maritimos. Sin embargo, EU tenia poco interes en utilizar
la Zona del Canal para explotar esos servicios e incluso el
desarrollo portuario se estanco.
 &HT;    Centro naviero. A medida que la Zona del Canal cambia de dueno,
paso a paso, Panama recupera el tiempo perdido. El exito mas
visible ha sido la asombrosa transicion de los puertos, que antes
eran ineficientes. La meta de la ARI, crear el mayor centro de
transferencia de contenedores en America Latina, ya se hace
realidad.
 &HT;    Han surgido dos nuevos puertos de contenedores desde 1994: la
Terminal Internacional de Manzanillo, operada por Stevedoring
Services of America, de EU, que debe manejar 800.000 contenedores
en 1998, y una terminal en Coco Solo, operada por la linea naviera
taiwanesa Evergreen, que abrio en 1997 y tendra capacidad para
400.000 contenedores en su primera fase. Panama Ports, la filial
local del gigante Hutchison Whampoa, de Hong Kong, gano la
concesion para administrar dos puertos privatizados mas, Balboa y
Cristobal, y tiene en marcha una inversion de US$100 millones. La
planeada expansion adicional de las operaciones de contenedores
para el 2000 debe aportar unos US$200 millones adicionales a la
economia pa namena, segun Ruben Reyna, director de la Autoridad
Maritima de Panama.
 &HT;    Ese impetuoso crecimiento baja los costos y crea muchas otras
posibilidades, no solo en la Zona Libre de Colon, que celebro su 50
aniversario en 1998. La zona mueve US$12.000 millones anuales en
reexportaciones e importaciones libres de aranceles, lo que la
convierte en la mayor zona franca del hemisferio y en el mayor
segmento de la economia panamena. En otros paises se crean zonas
francas, pero los directivos de la Zona Libre de Colon afirman que
esta mantiene su ventaja competitiva, en gran medida debido a la
reduccion de los costos portuarios.
 &HT;    El proximo paso de la estrategia maritima es aumentar la oferta
de servicios, como venta de combustible, aprovisionamiento y
reparaciones a barcos y contenedores, aprovechando la espera
promedio de 12 horas de los barcos que cruzan el Canal.
 &HT;    ``Practicamente todos los barcos del mundo pasan por nuestras
aguas. Por que no desarrollar esta oportunidad?,'' comenta el
ministro de Comercio e Industrias, Raul Hernandez. ``Hay muchos
servicios que se pueden dar a los barcos en los que antes Panama no
tenia experiencia, pero que ya empieza a dominar.''
 &HT;    El pais tambien espera convertirse en punto de venta de las
zonas de procesamiento de exportaciones, sector que esta en panales
en comparacion con las maquiladoras de Mexico y Honduras. Los altos
salarios (efecto de una economia dolarizada) no han ayudado. Pero
la zona Panexport, en un suburbio de la capital, ya cuenta con
siete firmas de Norteamerica y Europa. La ARI tambien tiene una
zona de procesamiento de exportaciones en el Fuerte Davis, una
antigua instalacion de EU y ahora sede de ocho empresas taiwanesas.
 &HT;    Eduardo Quijano, vicepresidente de Unesa, propietarios de
Panexport, espera que la competencia siga llegando. ``Mientras mas,
mejor. Uno de los problemas de Panama es que no se le conoce como
centro de industria. Mientras mas industrias vengan, mas industrias
atraera``.
 &HT;    Quijano agrega los beneficios del centro bancario de Panama a la
lista de ventajas en la creacion de zonas de procesamiento de
exportaciones. ``Las companias obtienen prestamos al 11 por ciento,
a niveles del Primer Mundo. Eso no se consigue en ninguna otra
parte de America Latina.''
 &HT;    Los bancos son un factor clave en Panama, dice Belanger, del
Banco del Istmo. El crecimiento del centro bancario se debe
principalmente a los bancos nacionales, que comenzaron a llenar el
vacio que dejaron las instituciones de otros paises cuando se
retiraron en la epoca de Noriega. Una ley bancaria reformada,
promulgada por decreto en 1998 por Perez Balladares, que fue
ejecutivo de Citibank, ha hecho mas estricta la supervision y se
espera que mejore la imagen de Panama en el extranjero, lo que debe
ayudar a sus bancos a seguir creciendo.
 &HT;    Facil acceso. Alberto Pons, presidente de la union de
industrialistas, dice que ni las firmas panamenas, ni los
consumidores, tienen problemas de acceso a capital. Los
consumidores han sido los mas beneficiados de la competencia entre
los bancos. Tomar un prestamo y recibir un telefono celular gratis
es una oferta bancaria tipica. Varios empresarios advierten que
tarde o temprano es inevitable una desaceleracion.
 &HT;    Para ver a donde va a parar gran parte de ese credito hay que
dar una vuelta en auto por las congestionadas calles panamenas.
``La principal razon de que el sector automotriz crezca tan rapido
es el apoyo que tenemos de los bancos,'' dice Jorge Batinovich,
presidente de la asociacion de distribuidores de automoviles y
concesionario de la automotriz japonesa Mitsubishi. ``Incluso diria
que no es necesario ni siquiera mostrar lo que uno gana; basta con
una factura. Asi de facil se consigue financiamiento en Panama``.
Batinovich, cuyas ventas en los nueve primeros meses de 1998
superaron el total de 1997, calcula que las ventas de autos nuevos
en 1998 estaran entre 25.000 y 27.000 vehiculos, mientras el ano
anterior fueron de 22.000.
 &HT;    Las reducciones arancelarias han dado un gran impulso a las
ventas de automoviles de lujo, asi como de productos electronicos,
computadoras y articulos para el hogar. Henry Striem, cuya cadena
Importadora La Selecta vende mayormente muebles importados, dice
que esta ``muy satisfecho'' con el crecimiento del 10 por ciento en
1998. ``Las reducciones arancelarias han permitido a los clientes
comprar productos que siempre quisieron pero que no podian pagar,''
senala. Norman Arosemena, gerente de establecimiento de la gran
cadena de supermercados Rey, dice que los clientes reciben mas
calidad y mas opciones, y que espera que aumente la competencia
entre los establecimientos.
 &HT;    Hernandez, el ministro de Comercio e Industrias, afirma que
Panama tiene ``la economia mas abierta de America Latina,'' con
aranceles que promedian el 8 por ciento.
 &HT;    Pero los industriales y los campesinos han sufrido un trastorno
al quedar expuestos al impacto de la competencia, exacerbado por la
reduccion de los aranceles de un golpe, en vez de por fases, como
se acordo en un principio con la OMC.
 &HT;    ``Los tenderos y los comerciantes sonrien,'' dice Rodriguez, el
presidente de la APEDE, que es propietario de un negocio de
recapado de neumaticos y de varias haciendas ganaderas. ``Los
industriales se ven preocupados, y los campesinos lloran.''
 &HT;    Charlie Dawson, presidente de la Asociacion de Exportadores de
Panama, coincide: ``Cierto numero de industriales no va a
sobrevivir. No se les ha dado el tiempo suficiente para buscar una
forma de mantenerse,'' dice. Parte de la solucion es la necesidad
de fomentar una ``cultura de la exportacion'' en Panama, senala
Dawson. ``En Costa Rica todo el mundo se ha volcado hacia el
desarrollo de las exportaciones al darse cuenta de que su mercado
es demasiado pequeno. Aqui en Panama durante muchos anos no se vio
a las exportaciones como una necesidad, ni como un requisito, ni
siquiera como algo factible.''
 &HT;    Entretanto, Rodriguez cree que el desarrollo del turismo es
fundamental para reemplazar algunos trabajos perdidos en la
agricultura. La ARI concuerda: la mitad de sus inversiones
prometidas apunta al turismo, cuyo exponente mas notable es el
proyecto de Amador, en el extremo sur del Canal. Tambien se han
planeado instalaciones de ecoturismo y terminales de cruceros.
Ardito Barletta senala que en el pasado unos 300 cruceros al ano
pasaban por la via acuatica sin que un solo pasajero pusiera el pie
ni gastara un centavo en Panama.
 &HT;    ``El sector de los cruceros crece en el Caribe; estan fabricando
20 barcos y buscando nuevos lugares,'' concluye. Pero los planes
turisticos de la RI estan entre los aspectos mas criticados de sus
operaciones y no todo el mundo esta seguro de que las obras
prometidas (entre ellas un hotel y complejo de recreacion de un
grupo coreano-estadounidense, por US$300 millones) se hagan
realidad. Entretanto, el auge en la construccion de hoteles de lujo
en la capital (que muy poco tiene que ver con el ecoturismo) ya
baja el nivel de ocupacion de habitaciones.
 &HT;    Educacion. Que tareas quedan para mejorar el panorama economico?
Los empresarios dan una gran acogida a la estrategia del gobierno
de mejorar la educacion en un lapso de 10 anos. ``No tenemos
conocimientos tecnicos a Le pagaria un buen salario a un tecnico
calificado, pero no hay,'' se lamenta Varielo De Sanctis, dueno de
una de las mayores exportadoras de pescado de Panama. Quijano, de
Unesa, dice que es ``dificil encontrar a gente calificada'' para
administrar los restaurantes de franquicia de la compania, como TGI
Friday's.
 &HT;    Wainio, el director de la AMCHAM, comenta que a los miembros no
les preocupa el pasado de Panama, pero que si quieren reducir los
tramites burocraticos. ``He oido muchas quejas de personas que
suspenden sus planes de negocios debido a varios obstaculos, pero
nunca debido a una mala reputacion,'' dice.
 &HT;    La incertidumbre politica del momento es saludable: Panama vive
una prolongada campana electoral con vistas al sufragio de mayo.
Sin embargo, las ventas al consumidor han sufrido las
consecuencias. Rodriguez, de ADEPE, dice que el sucesor de Perez
Balladares debe proseguir con las reformas. ``La credibilidad del
pais esta en juego,'' apunta.
 &HT;    En el distrito colonial de Panama, donde la inversion privada
transforma rapidamente un barrio ruinoso en un sector prospero,
Pablo Lo Giudice no tiene dudas de que establecerse en Panama fue
acertado. Su nuevo cafe es el unico de su clase en varios
kilometros a la redonda. ``Los extranjeros ven las oportunidades,''
comenta. ``Aqui no estoy inventando la rueda. Pero nadie lo habia
hecho antes.''

IN HIGH-PROFILE RACE OF MAYBES, ADD TELEGENIC DISTRICT ATTORNEY
PIRRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ If I run,'' said Jeanine Pirro, ``the race
will be about me.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, after all, a good subject: popular Westchester County
district attorney who looks so glamorous on television that she
could play a district attorney on NBC's ``Law and Order,'' and
longtime friend of Gov. George E. Pataki, rising Republican star.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pirro is being talked about as a candidate for senator from
New York in 2000, along with just about everybody else. The wrinkle
here is that Raymond Harding, the state Liberal Party chairman,
happily stirred up trouble last week when he said that the governor
was pushing Pirro's candidacy to thwart the potential Senate
candidacy of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, who is not
a longtime friend of the governor at all.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the governor's office denied any Pirro promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one telling her what she should or shouldn't do,''
said the governor's communications director, Zenia Mucha.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the plot takes another turn with Pirro's
husband of 20 years, Albert Pirro Jr., Westchester County's most
successful real estate development lawyer, who was the subject of a
federal investigation after a former Yonkers official accused Pirro
of giving him a $5,000 bribe. (Albert Pirro denied the charge, and
the investigation has been closed.) In June, DNA tests revealed
that Albert Pirro was the father of a 15-year-old girl whose mother
was suing him for child support. In 1986, when Jeanine Pirro
dropped out as a candidate for lieutenant governor, questions were
raised about her husband's brief stake in a Connecticut garbage
carting company, an industry notorious for its mob associations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say she is married to someone she should be
investigating; Republicans say that she is an exceptionally
accomplished woman and that the voters, who elected her
overwhelmingly as district attorney in 1993 and 1997, don't care
about her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional woman,'' Pirro said in an hourlong
interview on Tuesday in her White Plains office. ``I've been a
judge and a prosecutor for almost 25 years. My husband is an
attorney, a very well-regarded attorney, who has his own separate
professional life.'' Pirro added that her equivocation about
running _ ``I don't close any doors, but I don't have any plans at
this time to actively seek the nomination'' _ had nothing to do
with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But she is telling him to be more careful in the future, yes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like _ `I'll kill you'?'' she said, then let out a big laugh.
Pirro lets out a lot of big laughs. But in two seconds, she was
serious again. ``He's a very bright guy, and he's the father of my
children, who I love desperately. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1994, Jeanine Pirro has been a
made-for-prime-time district attorney _ a tough, charismatic and
intensely ambitious crusader for victims of domestic violence and a
natural at the television sound bite. She was a regular on Geraldo
during the O.J. Simpson trial and also one of People magazine's
``50 Most Beautiful People'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were kidding,'' Pirro said. ``I kept thinking
they put me in there because they needed an older woman to balance
out all the young babes in there.''
</P>
<P>
   One might call Pirro, 47 _ ``Don't you dare write 48'' _ a babe
herself. (She won't mind.) She wears short skirts, high heels, and
works out every morning from 6 to 7 _ on the stationary bike, on
the treadmill and with weights _ in the exercise room of what is
always described in profiles as her ``Italianate mansion'' in
Harrison. ``I live in a nice house,'' she said. ``Just leave it at
that.'' She buys her clothes off the rack at department stores _
``I hit anywhere they have sales, like Neiman Marcus is going to
have last call next week'' _ and has given up the navy pinstriped
suits and white bow ties that she wore to court in the 1970s and
80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed,'' she said. ``I don't feel like I need to
look like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in Elmira, N.Y. Her father was a mobile-home
salesman, her mother a department-store model. (Her mother always
told her to look her best.) From the age of 6, Pirro wanted to be a
lawyer, an odd choice in 1950s small-town New York. But Pirro said
she was beaten up at the age of 5 by the school bully, a girl. She
never forgot how she felt. ``What remained with me was the thinking
that victims don't chose to be injured,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 17, she was volunteering after school in the office of John
O'Hara, the district attorney for Chemung County. On her 18th
birthday, O'Hara took her to register to vote. ``He said, `I'm
going to be in a primary,' and I said, `I want to vote for you.'
And he said, `Well, if you want to vote for me, you have to be a
Republican.''' Pirro's parents were Democrats, it was 1969, and the
Vietnam War was raging. ``I had my concerns like everybody else,''
Pirro said. ``But I was more interested in getting into law
school.'' That was Albany Law School, where she met her husband.
She describes him as ``the brightest guy I'd ever met.''
</P>
<P>

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Although the Mighty Ducks are only 5-11-5 on
the road this season, Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg says he's not
worried about his team's ability to win away from the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played a lot of great games on the road and didn't get
the win, he said. ``I'm not concerned with our road record. I'm
feel very comfortable that we can play well on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya thinks the Ducks just need to play a little smarter
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to cut down on our penalties and play more patient.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' record after 45 games was the best in team history,
but Kariya said the team needs to step it up in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the teams below us didn't have good starts and they
are going to get better, said the Anaheim captain. ``We can't
continue on the pace we are at or we aren't going to make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Winger Jim McKenzie returned to the Anaheim lineup after missing
five games due to a laceration above his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Backup goalie Dominic Roussel missed practice Tuesday to be with
his wife, France, who gave birth to the couple's third child, a
9-pound, 2-ounce boy Tristan.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long day for Roussel and his wife. They arrived at the
hospital at 6 a.m. and the baby was not born until 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel took part in the morning skate and was Guy Hebert's
backup on Wednesday night.

BRYN JONES, PRO-PALESTINIAN MUSIC INNOVATOR, DIES AT 38 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bryn Jones, who recorded dozens of CDs of experimental music
under the name Muslimgauze, died on Jan. 14 in Manchester, England.
He was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia derived from a rare fungal infection in
his bloodstream, said Geert-Jan Hobijn, who released Jones' music
on his Dutch record label, Staalplaat.
</P>
<P>
   Muslimgauze occupied a strange place in the musical world. He
was a powerful, prolific innovator, releasing albums that were
alternately beautiful and visceral, full of ambient electronics,
polyrhythmic drumming and all kinds of voices and sound effects.
The recordings earned him a devoted following in underground,
experimental and industrial music circles worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the albums' liner notes and titles were dogmatically
pro-Palestinian, a rarity among Western musicians in general but
especially unusual in one from Manchester who was not Muslim and
had never visited the Middle East. Some said Jones was aiming for
shock value, but those who knew him described him as a shy,
mysterious man who was serious in his political beliefs and never
wavered from his commitment to music.
</P>
<P>
   He began making music in 1982, Jones said, as a response to
Israel's invasion of Lebanon. Each album was inspired by a
political event, from massacres to peace accords. In the notes to
albums like ``United States of Islam,'' Jones wrote that ``support
for the PLO has been a source of influence upon the music of
Muslimgauze.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones recorded 92 albums with titles like ``Hamas Arc'' and
``Vote Hezbollah,'' references to militant Islamic groups. He
released some music only on DAT tapes and one album packaged with
table tennis paddles (a limited edition of 500, dedicated to the
Iranian female Olympic table tennis team), and he was known for his
provocative artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of an album from 1993 featured a close-up of Yasser
Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, clasping
hands after their historic peace accord with the album title
``Betrayal,'' emblazoned on Arafat's hand. As his career
progressed, Jones became more prolific, sending his record label
tapes for one album a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hobijn said he had enough material to release Muslimgauze albums
five more years.

SILVER CHARM FAVORITE FROM OUTSIDE POST IN DONN HANDICAP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Silver Charm, who won the Kentucky Derby two
years ago and the Dubai World Cup one year ago, made his appearance
at Gulfstream Park Wednesday after crossing the continent in his
new role as the horse who might ``save'' the racing business. But,
after his travels, the 5-year-old warrior drew the No. 12 post
position on the far outside for Saturday's $500,000 Donn Handicap
at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means,'' suggested his wise-cracking trainer, Bob Baffert,
``that you can get bumped out there from only one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside or not, Silver Charm was made the 8-5 favorite for the
Donn, the first in a sequence of 11 races billed by the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association as its championship series for
senior stars. The idea was copied from the American Championship
Racing Series started by Barry Weisbord early in the decade but
disbanded three years later after resistance from some race tracks
and some weary horses.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Donn shaped up as something of a campaign
event. The race was moved up one week so that it would fall into
the Super Bowl weekend hoopla on television, and Silver Charm was
cast as the superstar even though he hadn't won a Grade I race in
this country since the Preakness two years ago. Still, a police
escort was arranged from the airport to Gulfstream on Tuesday to
provide a welcome befitting a king.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's rivals conceded that Silver Charm looked like the
class of the field. Stanley Hough, who trains the 30-1 long shot
Hanarsaan, said, ``He is obviously the best handicap horse in the
country.'' And Scotty Schulhofer, who trains the 20-1 Willing,
said: ``What'll it take to beat Silver Charm? A very, very good
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert, who won the last two Kentucky Derbies with Silver
Charm and Real Quiet, implied that the decision to cross the
country and run his California horse in the East had been prompted
by Bob Lewis, the horse's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Lewis easily could have retired him this year,'' Baffert
said. ``But he's a big supporter of the NTRA, and he thought it
would be good for racing. He left it to me, but he twisted my arm a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's nearest rival in the early betting line was Sir
Bear at 4-1, followed by Puerto Madero at 6-1. Sir Bear ran third
in the Donn last year behind Skip Away, who is retired, and
Unruled, who was listed at 20-1 for this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm rose to his eminence as the leading man in the cast
after Skip Away, Awesome Again and other stars of last year left
the stage. He won the Dubai World Cup last year and ran second to
Awesome Again in the Breeders' Cup Classic, and earlier this month
won the San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been lazy,'' Baffert said. ``But he's happy, he's
filled out. The outside post position means he'll have to get into
position. But the good horses always get there.''

EXCLUSIVITY PILED AS HIGH AS SNOW AT RESORT
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As mountain resorts struggle these days with the vagaries of
modern life _ lift lines, crowded trails, ski-gear thefts, road
traffic, and now, even terrorism _ an oasis of tranquillity is
being offered the rich. But for a price.
</P>
<P>
   Set amid the pristine but rugged terrain of mid-Montana near
Bozeman is the Yellowstone Club, a 13,500-acre private resort
teeming with wildlife, fishing streams, and skiable slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The price of belonging to the club is $250,000, along with an
annual membership fee of $16,000. Organizers plan to limit
participation to about 850 families. Estimates project a maximum
impact of about 3,400 skiers if all 850 families showed up on the
same day. The mountain is built to handle 15,000 skiers
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   The wilderness playground is expected to become the first
private club with its own major ski trails in the world. The first
round of potential members are scheduled to visit the area on Feb.
1, and look at home sites where they might build.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity we have here is that it's all private land,''
Tim Blixseth, the club developer, said in a recent telephone
interview. ``Part of it was clear-cut for timber. Fortunately, most
of the destruction was in the area where we are putting ski slopes.
All we've had to do is take the stumps out. The rest of the land is
heavily forested.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in place at the club's 4,500-acre ski and snow board
area are three chair lifts, including two high-speed quads, and a
gourmet restaurant near the top of the 9,856-foot Pioneer Mountain.
One security gate allows access to the resort. Of the 18 trails
already cut, some are for expert skiers and beginners but more are
intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marriner, sales and marketing manager, said recently that
club founders have received queries from around the world. But
there has been noticeable interest from ski instructors and clients
at Vail, Colo., he said. It was at Vail that so-called
ecoterrorists were blamed for the destruction last October of a
large restaurant, chair lift and ski patrol building in a $12
million fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caused quite a few people to inquire because of what went
on over there,'' Marriner added. ``People said they moved to Vail
because they loved it, but Vail has changed. It now feels like a
city in the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellowstone Club is about 50 miles south of Bozeman, Mont.,
adjacent to Big Sky, Montana's largest commercial ski area.
Eventually, a chair lift will connect the two resorts, but will be
accessible to club members only. Other plans for the club call for
an 18-hole golf course, a fishing village, an equestrian center, a
cross-country ski touring area and a health spa.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Miller, the 74-year-old ski-film producer, plans to sell
his ski home in Vail and move soon to the Yellowstone site, where
he has been hired as ski director. Miller, who has produced more
than 500 films, said in a recent interview that he wants his
children and grandchildren to experience skiing on virgin slopes as
he did 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's elitism has perplexed some of the locals, however.
``It's sort of a mystery, frankly,'' said Russell DeRemer,
executive director of a home owners association from nearby Big
Sky, Mont. ``We haven't been well-informed about it. It's kind of
been raising eyebrows _ oh my gosh, a ski country club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellowstone Club property is part of a 164,000-acre parcel
of private land bought by Blixseth, a retired timber company
executive, in 1990. He said he has traded about 100,000 acres of
the property to the federal government as a wildlife habitat in
exchange for about 50,000 acres of nonenvironmentally sensitive
land that he might sell for timber harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   On March 20, the club plans to invite new members to a lottery
that will dole out the group's building sites in order of prime
location. Forty lots will become available, each from two to 10
acres, at a cost ranging from $750,000 to $2 million. To become a
club member, a candidate has to demonstrate a net worth of at least
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the facility will be free to family members and a limited
number of guests. This exclusivity is the club's chief marketing
tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-growth proposition,'' Jon Reveal, the mountain
manager said, ``850 families, forever, that's it.''
