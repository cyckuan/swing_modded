Malaysian braces for the watershed Anwar trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ When Malaysian dissident Anwar
Ibrahim goes on trial Monday, this Southeast Asian nation goes on
trial with him.
	   The outcome of the most sensational criminal trial in Malaysian
history could shape the country's political future and steer the
hearts of its people in new directions.
	   ``I think either way, whether Anwar is found guilty or innocent,
there will be a massive reaction,'' said Khoo Boo Teik, a political
science professor. ``Everything happening so far has been a buildup
to this.''
	   The trial represents a crossroads for Malaysia, one that pits
Asia's longest-ruling leader, who for 17 years has demanded
absolute loyalty in return for unprecedented progress, against one
of the region's rising political superstars.
	   It comes amid the country's first recession in more than a
decade and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's controversial
experiments with capital controls, which could further destabilize
Malaysia or help it become one of the first to bounce back from the
Asian economic crisis.
	   The trial also hits as Kuala Lumpur prepares to host 20 world
leaders for an Asia-Pacific trade forum. The presidents of
neighboring Indonesia and the Philippines threatened to boycott the
summit, and U.S. President Bill Clinton won't meet with Mahathir,
because their distress over the Anwar affair.
	   On the eve of the first gavel of the trial that could forever
change this nation, many wonder how Anwar, slated to be the next
prime minister, could have fallen so far, so fast.
	   The 51-year-old ousted finance minister and deputy to his
longtime mentor, 72-year-old Mahathir, today stands accused of
graft and sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   Mahathir, having lured Anwar from his conservative Islamic roots
into mainstream Malay politics, sacked him on Sept. 2, denouncing
him as morally unfit to lead.
	   Mahathir said he fired his deputy after holding private talks
with men and women who claimed to have had sex with Anwar. Though
Anwar vigorously denied the allegations, Mahathir allowed the
release of the sordid details on the front pages of the
government-controlled newspapers, shocking readers in this
straight-laced society.
	   When Anwar was arrested, thrown in jail and roughed up by
police, however, many began to dismiss the criminal allegations and
rally to Anwar's side. Last weekend, a demonstration in the capital
turned into a full-scale riot, the first in nearly three decades by
a normally placid people.
	   What pushed Mahathir to such extremes against the man he groomed
to perpetuate his Malay miracle? Had the two men veered that far in
political and personal ideology?
	   Political analysts say the two men have much in common and that
their relationship soured only recently. Both are devout Muslims
and devoted family men with six children each.
	   Though a generation apart _ Mahathir was fighting British
colonialism while Anwar was still a schoolboy _ both were rebels in
their youth, fought for Malay nationalism and were exiled, and in
Anwar's case detained, for their beliefs.
	   Anwar was a co-founder of the powerful Malaysian Muslim Youth
League, whose goal was to further ``Islamicize'' Malaysian society.
Its anti-government demonstrations in 1974 led to Anwar's detention
for 18 months.
	   So Anwarites felt betrayed when he ran for Parliament in 1982 on
a mainstream ticket of the United Malays National Organization.
	   Mahathir quickly nabbed the charismatic young politician and
began pushing him up the political ranks in Cabinet posts. He made
him his deputy and finance minister in 1993.
	   Behind the scenes, Anwar has always called for political
reforms, more press freedoms and government transparency, as
outlined in his 1996 book, ``The Asian Renaissance.''
	   But until recently, Anwar never publicly challenged his mentor's
authoritarian ways and showed him unstinting loyalty during several
political crises. He kept mum when Mahathir forced the resignations
of the pro-Anwar chief editors of Malaysia's two largest Malay
newspapers earlier this year.
	   It was widely assumed, especially after Mahathir put Anwar in
charge for two months when he took a leave in 1997, that his
protege would be the presidential candidate in an upcoming UMNO
election so Mahathir could retire as president of the ruling party
and as prime minister.
	   The president of UMNO, which has dominated Malaysian politics
since independence from Britain in 1957, has traditionally become
prime minister.
	   But two critical keys are believed to have unlocked Mahathir's
wrath: His conviction that Anwar had betrayed him politically by
trying to undermine his leadership; and morally by having sex with
men.
	   ``He identifies homosexuality as one of the most heinous sins of
the permissive way of Western life,'' said a Mahathir scholar who
asked not to be identified.
	   The two men had differed over economic policy since the Asian
crisis erupted last year. Mahathir, facing a 5 percent shrinkage of
the economy this year, ignored Anwar's calls for tighter monetary
policy and higher interest rates. Mahathir banned foreign trading
of the ringgit and insists lower interest rates and increased
public spending will jump-start the economy.
	   Yet even Mahathir said economic management differences had
little to do with Anwar's sacking.
	   ``His character does not qualify him to be a leader,'' Mahathir
said after having him expelled from UMNO.
	   When Anwar supporters gave anti-cronyism speeches at the UMNO
convention in July, Mahathir was enraged. The president of the UMNO
youth wing accused party bosses of misusing an affirmative action
program for Malays to enrich their friends and relatives with
lucrative government contracts.
	   After everything Mahathir had done for his protege, it appeared
to him that Anwar was too impatient for his turn at power and had
betrayed him.
	   ``The virulence and viciousness of the annihilation can perhaps
be best explained by the fact that Anwar was, all said and done,
Dr. Mahathir's protege,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a political
science professor.
	   Some powerful UMNO members who amassed great wealth under
Mahathir's patronage machine worried Anwar would not protect their
interests. The finance minister was reluctant to endorse some
massive government bailouts of large local corporations, including
one run by Mahathir's son.
	   Mahathir's cronies argue Anwar never cried for political reforms
during all his years in the government.
	   ``To be fair, one must say that when Anwar was in the
government, there were certain abuses he went along with to obtain
his position,'' Chandra said, including the ban on opposition
rallies and stifling of the press. ``But now that he's the victim
of that abuse of power, he's reacting.''

Tour boat captain allegedly tried to maroon passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ American tourists told Friday how
they overpowered and tied up the captain of a tour boat after he
threatened them with flares during a ``cruise from hell'' off
Australia's northeast coast.
	   Police were investigating claims by the tourists that Troy
Dallman, 29, tried to maroon them at sea and held flares to their
heads during a dive boat tour from the Queensland state resort town
of Port Douglas to Thursday Island, off Australia's northern tip.
	   ``Have you ever heard of the S.S. Minnow,'' Kati Donohue, of
Hawaii, told The Australian newspaper, referring to the boat lost
at sea in the TV series ``Gilligan's Island.''
	   ``Well, this was not a three-hour cruise, it was a 3,000 dollar
(U.S dlrs 1,800) cruise from hell,'' she said.
	   Donohue and her partner Dean Hall were two of six American and
two Spanish tourists aboard the 20-meter (-yard) Reef Explorer,
which departed for an eight-day trip on Oct. 19.
	   On the second day of the trip, the boat's power system failed,
knocking out navigational instruments, air-conditioning and cooking
facilities, Donohue said.
	   The crew used handheld compasses and flashlights to guide the
boat through reefs at night to Lizard Island, where it was laid up
for two days for repairs.
	   Donohue said that last Saturday Dallman had tried to weigh
anchor and sail off while the tourists were scuba diving from a
rubber dinghy away from the Reef Explorer.
	   A fierce argument broke out when the tourists returned to the
boat, with Dallman calling on the tourists to help him tie up the
boat's four crew members because he believed they were plotting
against him.
	   ``He's shouting ... `They're going to sink the boat. They're
going to sink the boat ... Tie up the crew,''' another passenger,
Frederico Farin, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``He held flares to our heads,'' Farin, from New York, said. ``I
said: `Oh my God, this is bad.' If it was a gun, maybe I would have
taken him out then because that's just one shot. But a flare ...
burns. Very dangerous.''
	   He said a female passenger tried to get Dallman to relax by
massaging his shoulders as the boat sped toward a reef with no-one
at the wheel.
	   When the boat hit the reef, passengers and crew jumped the
captain, wrestling him to the deck, Farin said. Dallman spent the
rest of the voyage trussed with rope and duct tape in one of the
cabins.
	   Dallman was released when the boat reached Thursday Island on
Sunday and checked himself into a hospital.
	   Thursday Island police sergeant Graham Burridge said the
incident was being investigated. The tourists have contacted a
lawyer and are considering legal action.
	   Earlier this month, the captain of a Port Douglas-based dive
boat was committed to stand trial on manslaughter charges after
American divers Thomas and Eileen Lonergan were left behind at sea
during a dive tour.

Survey: Majority support visit by emperor to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a sign of growing positive feelings toward a
former colony, a Japanese newspaper survey published Friday showed
more than half of respondents would support a visit to South Korea
by Emperor Akihito.
	   Fifty-three percent of 1,089 Japanese adults who responded were
in favor of such a trip, compared to only 13 percent against,
according to the nationally-circulated Mainichi newspaper. That was
in sharp contrast to a July 1997 survey which showed opposite
results, the Mainichi said.
	   The telephone poll was conducted Oct. 24-25. As in most other
Japanese polls, the Mainichi survey provided no margin of error.
	   An imperial visit to South Korea has long been a sensitive
subject here amid debate over how Japan should deal with its
colonial and wartime past.
	   During Japan's rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910-1945,
Koreans were treated as second-class citizens and many were brought
to Japan as slave laborers or sent to front lines as sex slaves.
Descendants of Koreans who have remained in Japan still face some
discrimination.
	   Though the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1965,
hard feelings remain as Japan has tended to defend its wartime
role, while Koreans have criticized it for a lack of remorse.
	   The two countries are also at odds over competing territorial
claims regarding a tiny island in the Sea of Japan.
	   The Mainichi said, however, that South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung's visit to Japan earlier this month may have boosted
positive feelings toward South Korea.
	   During Kim's visit, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made Japan's
fullest apology to date over the period of colonial rule and signed
an accord hailing the beginning of a new relationship between the
two countries.
	   The two sides also agreed to work toward a visit to South Korea
by Akihito, which would be the first-ever by a Japanese emperor.
	   The survey also showed that 39 percent of respondents support
such a visit before the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament, which
Japan and South Korea will co-host.
	   By age, support was highest among respondents in their 40s, 50s
and 60s, while support was lowest among those in their 70s, the
Mainichi said.
	   Interest in the issue was relatively low among people in their
20s and 30s, with nearly 40 percent having no opinion, the paper
said.

Stojko returns to competitive skating, crowd's welcome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM SUHR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ A day after admitting he liked to push his
sport's envelope, Elvis Stojko returned to competitive skating and
tried to prove his point.
	   The fact that the Canadian star tumbled trying a quadruple toe
loop _ allowed in a short program this year for the first time _
seemed to matter little to the three-time world champion, the Skate
America judges or the crowd.
	   Stojko still took home high marks _ even a near-perfect 5.9 by a
Japanese judge _ and enters Saturday's decisive free skate in
second place, shadowing reigning world champion Alexei Yagudin of
Russia.
	   Not bad for a guy who's been out the past eight months, trying
to mend a groin tear he aggravated en route to a silver medal in
February's Winter Olympics.
	   To Stojko, the performance felt ``really, really good.''
	   ``Because of the injury, you're thinking, `How's the muscle
going to be when I get out there?''' he said. ``The green light was
to go and if the quad was ready, I would fire.''
	   The move was a gamble, Stojko said, admitting he could have
opted for a simpler triple lutz, ``but we wanted to get some miles
on it, even if you miss it.''
	   ``You go for it,'' he said. ``That's the risk you take.''
	   The announced attendance of more than 2,200 fans embraced his
return, offering up the night's loudest applause. One woman's held
a sign exclaiming, ``Elvis, you're still the king.''
	   On Saturday, he hopes his free-skate routine to the ``Merlin''
soundtrack works some magic in overtaking Yagudin and fending off
American upstart Michael Weiss, holding third after an energetic,
flawless routine to a Van Halen medley.
	   Yagudin appeared satisfied with ``my first real competition this
season,'' what he called a primer to tougher competitions ahead. He
said his arsenal includes a quadruple jump tried by Stojko but one
the Russian wasn't ready to uncork.
	   ``But it's not my job what he's doing,'' Yagudin said. ``If he
wants to do like this, he can.''
	   Russia's Alexei Urmanov, himself battling back from a groin
injury in hopes of returning to the form that won him Olympic gold
in 1994, enters Saturday's free skate in fourth. On Thursday night,
he had skated to classical music but had problems, falling once and
salvaging his balance another time.
	   As the first event in the International Skating Union's Grand
Prix series, Skate America features Olympic-eligible skaters. The
series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks before
the world championships in Finland.
	   It's where Stojko wants to be, and he took a step that way on
Thursday night. So did Urmanov.
	   After edging Stojko for Olympic gold at Lillehammer in 1994,
Urmanov tore a groin muscle in the March 1997 world championship in
Switzerland, withdrew from that event and watched Stojko vault to
his third world title.
	   Urmanov missed all of last season _ including a chance to repeat
as Olympic champion _ but made his return a rewarding one, winning
a silver medal in last summer's Goodwill Games in New York. Stojko
hadn't competed since February, when he braved the injury and
captured silver at Nagano, Japan.
	   Earlier this year, Yagudin skated to the world title in
Minneapolis after Stojko and Olympic champion Ilia Kulik withdrew.
At 18, Yagudin became the second-youngest world champion, arriving
at the top at least a year ahead of schedule while building upon
his fifth-place finish at Nagano.
	   Weiss was second in the U.S. championships the past two years.
Now 22, the Virginian won the world junior championships in 1994
and finished seventh at Nagano. Earlier this month in a meet in
Florida, he was second, two spots ahead of Kulik.
	   Earlier Thursday, France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat
won the compulsories in ice dance and Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze won the pairs short program.
	   Anissina and Peizerat, second in this year's world championships
and Olympic bronze medalists in February, were followed by Russia's
Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh. Italy's Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Mariusz Margaglio were third, heading into Saturday's free skate.
	   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, the defending pairs world champions
and Olympic silver medalists, were followed by Canada's Kristy
Sargeant and Kris Wirtz and siblings Danielle and Steve Hartsell of
nearby Westland, Mich.
	   ``Tonight was just a good night for us,'' Danielle Hartsell
said, appreciative of the home ice, of sorts, and the friendly
cheers it produced. ``It was exciting for us because all of our
friends and family were here to see us.''
	   Friday's Skate America women's short program features world
bronze medalist Maria Butyrskaya of Russia and American Nicole
Bobek, the 1995 U.S. champion now trying to reestablish herself
after placing 17th at Nagano.
	   On Wednesday, Stojko described his past eight months as a series
of emotional highs and lows _ nothing compared to Bobek's run of
misfortune.
	   She hit her career's low point when her coach died of a heart
attack during the 1997 world championships, and then flopped at
Nagano while fighting bronchitis and a hip injury.
	   While practicing in Detroit two weeks ago, she crashed into the
boards, lost consciousness for several minutes and suffered a
concussion.
	   ``I'm OK now,'' Bobek said Thursday.
	   ``It was a certain era in my life like every competition has
been,'' she said. ``There's no need to dwell on the past. If I
dwelled on the past, I think I'd go berserk.
	   ``I feel I'm in control of my life.''
	   In bidding for a return to prominence, she again is training at
the Detroit Skating Club with Richard Callaghan, the coach who
helped make her the 1995 national champion and world bronze
medalist.
	   ``We're not all robots out there,'' she said. ``And I think it's
my time to bloom.''

Collapsed Japanese brokerage winds down asset refund operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yamaichi Securities, once Japan's fourth largest
broker, has decided to scale down asset refund operations set up
after the company's sudden collapse almost one year ago, a
spokesman said Friday.
	   The number of workers assigned to return funds to former clients
will be cut from 133 people to just 50 as their section is absorbed
into a larger caretaker department charged with closing the
brokerage, said the spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   Yamaichi went bust last November with some 3 trillion yen (dlrs
25.95 billion) in liabilities, in one of the biggest corporate
failures in Japan since World War II.
	   Of the roughly 15 trillion yen (dlrs 129.79 billion) in total
assets which had been entrusted to Yamaichi by its clients, about
4.8 billion yen (dlrs 41.53 m 7,500 people who worked at the brokerage lost their
jobs within a few months of Yamaichi's failure, but many have been
hired by other financial institutions, including Merril Lynch and
Co.

Traders and politicians appeal for weekend calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As police brace for another round
of weekly anti-government demonstrations Saturday, local traders
and politicians on Friday pleaded for calm.
	   With the trial of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim set to begin
Monday, tension has blanketed the capital. People are bracing for
another round of clashes between riot police and anti-government
demonstrators.
	   ``Violence in any form or from any quarter, whether by
demonstrators or police, must be deplored as violence can only
beget violence,'' the opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit
Siang, said Friday.
	   Local traders in the downtown Chow Kit shopping district, near
one popular spot for street protests, called on Anwar's supporters
to stay away.
	   ``Please take your demonstrations elsewhere,'' Chow Kit
community leader Mansor Yahya told the New Straits Times in Friday
editions. He said sales in the district have dropped by as much as
50 percent.
	   In weekly Saturday gatherings banned by police, thousands of
usually docile Malaysians have flocked downtown to demand justice
for Anwar after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired him as deputy
on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar faces 10 counts of corruption and sodomy.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades last Saturday, after riot police fired tear gas and water
cannons at a neighborhood mosque. Protesters at the Muslim house of
prayer retaliated by hurling stones and bricks.
	   ``The police can only take so much,'' said police spokesman
Yusuf Said. ``So don't force us to take stern action when the
situation is out of control.''
	   Yusuf said that police would again crack down on the crowds and
warned children could die if they were exposed to tear gas.
	   On Friday, human rights activists blamed the police for
instigating the violence.
	   ``My appeal to calm and tolerance would be to the police, who
are behaving like thugs instead of law enforcers,'' said Tien Chua,
a spokesman for the human rights group SUARAM.
	   ``We haven't seen any demonstrators assaulting bystanders, but
we've seen many bystanders being assaulted by police.''
	   Chandra Muzaffar, a political science professor, accused police
of ``engineering'' the fracas at the mosque.
	   ``People saw police burning tires,'' he said. ``Who brought all
the stones and sticks and left them at the mosque? It's not in the
interest of the Anwar supporters to do this. They've always been
urging people not to get violent.''

At least 60 killed in fire in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At least 60 people died early Friday
when fire raced through a building jammed with hundreds of
teen-agers attending an immigrant association's discotheque dance
in the city of Goteborg. About 190 others were injured, many of
them seriously.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building.
	   It was the deadliest fire in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20
people died in a fire in the town of Boraas.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson said on
national radio.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   But Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ``The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported that 190 people were taken
to hospitals with injuries from the fire, of which about 20 were in
intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured were taken by
helicopter to burn clinics in other cities throughout Sweden, the
report said.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association. The immigrant group
had organized a disco dance for young people to celebrate Halloween
and officials said the crowd was mostly aged about 13 to 18. The
dance was held in the building's second story.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked
out the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there
were about 400 people inside.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   Olin said the building had been inspected by the rescue service
in April 1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as
emergency exits and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Goteborg is Sweden's second-largest city, on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Thai mountaintop prime meteor-viewing spot

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's highest peak is being touted
as one of the best places in the world to view next month's meteor
shower, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The Nation said the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Agency
was recommending Inthanon Mountain in northern Thailand as a prime
spot and had sent two of its scientists to the area.
	   The Leonids meteor shower is scheduled to occur Nov. 14-22, with
Nov. 17 the best night for observing the celestial phenomenon.
	   The daily quoted Salin Weerabut, an expert at the Bangkok
Planetarium, as saying the shower would be as clear as a similar
one at Niagara Falls in 1833, but the number of meteors would be
less.
	   ``We will see a perfect meteor shower. We will see shooting
stars coming out from Leonids,'' Salin said.
	   The newspaper said accommodations had already been all but
booked out in the area of Inthanon, a 2,565-meter-high (8,415-foot)
peak about 670 kilometers (415 miles) north of Bangkok. The
mountain is located within a national park.

China central bank chief expects stable yuan in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The People's Bank of China governor Dai Xianglong
expects the Chinese yuan to remain stable in 1999, state media
reported Friday.
	   Dai, who made the remark in a meeting Thursday with European
Commission President Jacques Santer, said there was a ``sound
basis'' for yuan stability.
	   The central bank chief dismissed speculation that China's
economic problems could ignite another, more damaging regional
financial crisis, according to the China Securities News.
	   The purpose of a devaluation would be to boost sagging exports.
Economists say the move may be of limited use in China because
companies that manufacture goods for export are heavily dependent
on imported raw materials, which would be more expensive with a
cheaper yuan.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji in March said the yuan would not be devalued
in 1998. Officials have not said whether the pledge not to devalue
would be extended into next year.

After years of talk, economic reform getting new push
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Faced with a sharp drop in oil prices, the
government is reviving plans to drop some free services and
subsidies for its people and may even introduce a shocking idea for
Kuwaitis _ income taxes.
	   But the public, long used to pampering from oil wealth, is
responding angrily that the Cabinet should instead curb waste and
corruption.
	   It's not a new argument in Kuwait, but it's more urgent now.
Prices for Kuwaiti crude have dropped from dlrs 17 a barrel to dlrs
11 in a year, and some say the government is so determined to push
through economic reforms that Parliament could be legally dissolved
unless it acts.
	   The economic implications go beyond Kuwait, too. One demand by
the public and lawmakers is to halt the huge arms purchases made
under defense pacts signed with the United States, France, Britain
and Russia after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   To stress the government's view, Crown Prince Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah has twice this month made speeches saying
citizenship was a matter of ``give and take,'' responsibility as
well as reward.
	   ``There is no doubt that state income from oil is no longer
sufficient to cover the needs of the country,'' Sheik Saad, who
also is prime minister, old the 50-seat National Assembly this week
in urging economic reforms.
	   The government has not yet submitted its proposals, but in the
past it has urged introducing fees for such services as health care
_ now free even for treatment abroad _ and dropping heavy subsidies
on electricity and water.
	   Another past suggestion, income taxes, would be a big jolt to
Kuwaitis since neither they nor foreign residents pay income or
sales taxes. Kuwait's population is estimated at 2.2 million, less
than 800,000 of them nationals.
	   One idea already dropped after Parliament objected was doubling
the price of gasoline _ heavily subsidized and averaging 17 cents a
liter.
	   In fact, government plans consistently have been met by cries of
outrage and demands for battling corruption and cutting spending on
weapons and foreign aid.
	   ``Let them stop the thieves and ... they will not need to
collect taxes or fees,'' Abdul-Aziz Saleh, a 50-year-old jeweler
told The Associated Press.
	   ``As long as we have defense agreements, why are we buying
planes and weapons every day?'' he asked.
	   A front-page editorial in the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm blamed
Kuwait's economic troubles on government policies going back 40
years.
	   ``The state is now reaping what it sowed,'' it said, adding that
the government has turned Kuwaitis into a dependent people with a
guaranteed income whether they were productive or not.
	   More than 95 percent of working Kuwaitis are employed by the
government, and many see an undemanding public job as a right. But
it is ever more difficult to find jobs for the growing population.
	   In the fiscal year that started in July, the net shortfall in
Kuwait's budget is dlrs 6.35 billion, one of the highest since
Iraq's occupation ended. The budget also is based on a dlrs 12 a
barrel oil price _ and it's down to dlrs 11.
	   A dlrs 40 billion foreign investment has largely saved Kuwait
from borrowing to cover deficits. But economist Jassem al-Saadoun
says this portfolio would be seriously depleted if the government
keeps depending on it.
	   ``Our generation has enjoyed enough of the oil wealth, but the
future generations will pay dearly,'' he lamented.
	   Opposition lawmaker Adnan Abdul-Samad conceded that this time
Parliament will have to act, given economic realities. But he also
repeated demands for a government clampdown on wasteful spending.
	   The lawmakers have another fact to face. Kuwait's ruler, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, has the right to dissolve Parliament if he
judges it is not acting in the national interest.
	   Political columnist Shamlan al-Issa wrote this week in the
pro-government daily Al-Siyassah that a ``dissolution of Parliament
would not be unlikely'' if lawmakers do not pass economic reforms.

East Timorese asylum seeker can appeal application denial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ In a test case which may affect the
fate more than 1,000 East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia, a
man Friday won the right to appeal a government tribunal's decision
to deny his application for refugee status.
	   In the Federal Court, Judge Ray Finkelstein ruled that Lay Kon
Tji be allowed to appeal against the Refugee Review Tribunal
decision that he could not apply for asylum in Australia because he
is a Portuguese national and thus should apply in Portugal instead.
	   East Timor is a former Portuguese colony.
	   Representatives of the local East Timorese community who were
present in the court welcomed the decision, saying it gave hope to
about 1,300 other asylum seekers who have been denied refugee
status on the same grounds.
	   In his ruling on Lay's case, Finkelstein said the tribunal erred
in its findings of fact that the Portuguese nationality of the
applicant was an ``effective nationality.''
	   Finkelstein called on the parties in the case to negotiate the
terms under which it should return to the tribunal. If they did not
reach agreement, the judge would make orders on how the case should
return.
	   Lay's lawyer Karen Anderson said the tribunal had made a mistake
in deciding the applicant was Portuguese.
	   ``The finding that's important is that (Finkelstein) ... said in
practice that they're (the applicants) not Portuguese,'' Anderson
said.
	   The government has two weeks to appeal Friday's ruling.
	   Speaking through an interpreter, Lay Kon Tji said he was very
happy with the decision.
	   His wife, Kathy Lay, said she hoped the decision meant they
would be allowed to live in Australia.
	   Catholic Bishop and East Timorese activist Hilton Deakin said
the decision was good news for more than 1,300 asylum seekers.

Bomb attacks hit two cars belonging to Macau triad figure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ A bomb destroyed a parked car belonging to a
reputed triad figure early Friday, according to police who
attributed the second such attack in as many days to a gangland
turf war.
	   No one was hurt and no arrests were immediately made.
	   Authorities said the car belonging to Lai Tung-sang exploded
about 9:30 a.m. (0130 GMT) in a parking lot across from Macau's
Hotel Lisboa, the biggest casino in the Portuguese enclave 40 miles
(64 kms) west of Hong Kong.
	   Police cordoned off the area for an hour but found no more
explosives.
	   Another of Lai's cars was hit by a similar bomb on Thursday,
police said.
	   Macau has been plagued by recent gang violence, including
several murders and arson attacks, as triads fight over their take
from casino profits that have been slipping as gamblers bet less
amid Asia's financial crisis.

Honda plans to return to Formula One racing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Honda Motor Co., Japan's third largest
automaker, said Friday that it still has plans to return to Formula
One racing, but denied a local report it could re-enter the sport
by 2000 in partnership with Benson and Hedges Jordan of England.
	   ``We have yet to come up with final and detailed plans,'' said
Honda spokesman Hideo Sato.
	   Tokyo-Chunichi Sports newspaper, a Japanese tabloid, quoted
unidentified Honda officials in a report published Friday as saying
the automaker favors a proposed Jordan-Honda partnership in order
to share annual development costs of at least 18 billion yen (dlrs
150 million).
	   But Sato said the report was premature.
	   ``I understand Honda hasn't had any negotiations related to such
a partnership scheme with Jordan or any other Formula One teams,''
he said.
	   Honda decided to return to Formula One racing earlier this year,
six years after it had withdrawn from the expensive sport.
	   Last week, Honda president Hiroyuki Yoshino told reporters that
his company may stage a comeback as soon as next year and has
already begun preparations for trying out test models.
	   Yoshino said Honda's involvement in Formula One racing will help
its engineers polish their skills, something which could help the
company ride out recent economic turmoil in Asia by improving
efforts to tailor cars to suit local consumers.

Silva ready to win New York City Marathon again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As German Silva approached the finish of the
1997 New York City Marathon, he appeared to be heading toward his
third victory in the race.
	   ``With three miles (4.8 kilometers) to go, I was thinking, `This
is mine again,' '' Silva said. ``I was looking forward to getting
to Central Park (the finish line).''
	   Suddenly, Silva couldn't go very fast. He had severe dehydration
and his energy was completely sapped.
	   ``I almost did not finish,'' said the Mexican, who is among the
favorites for Sunday's New York City Marathon. ``I wanted to stop.
But I told myself I can't stop here. I decided to keep going at a
slow pace.''
	   So slow that Silva faded from second place to fifth. Even though
the 1994-95 champion ran his fastest New York race in four attempts
_ 2 hours, 10 minutes, 19 seconds _ he was bitterly disappointed.
	   He felt he could have beaten Kenya's John Kagwe, the winner in
2:08:12, the second-fastest time in the race's 28-year history, and
joined Alberto Salazar (1980-82) and Bill Rodgers (1976-79) as the
only men to win the race at least three times.
	   Silva became dehydrated because he did not drink enough water
along the punishing 26-mile, 385-yard (42.1-kilometer) course. It
was not always his fault.
	   ``Sometimes, people threw my bottle (off the table at the water
stations),'' he said. ``Sometimes I couldn't get the bottle at the
right time (because of a jam-up at the stations). I couldn't stop.
If you stop, it costs you about three seconds.''
	   Failure to drink sufficient liquids taught Silva a lesson.
	   ``I can't say, `I'm German Silva _ I will not drink water during
the race,''' he said.
	   This time, provided he gets enough water, Silva again figures to
be in the mix, along with Kagwe, Olympic gold medalist Josia
Thugwane of South Africa, 1997 runner-up Joseph Chebet of Kenya and
world champion Abel Anton of Spain.
	   ``If I win again, it will mean the same or more than the first
time,'' he said. ``The first time changed my life.
	   ``If I win, it will mean I have proved myself again. I am hungry
to win again. It's like a potion. I like to win. I have to win.''
	   Silva enjoys winning the New York City Marathon because of the
adulation he receives.
	   ``I like when you people (the media) are around, talking to me,
asking questions,'' he said. ``I like this environment. An athlete
has to be motivated. And I love the friendship I get from people
all around the world.''
	   Silva feels he is coming into this race well-prepared.
	   In his most recent marathon, he ran a career-best 2:08:57 in
placing sixth at Boston in April. In his most recent race, he
finished second in a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) event at San Diego
less than two weeks ago.
	   He also has run 1,500-meter track workouts in his fastest times
ever.
	   As usual, he has trained in altitude among the volcanoes of
Mexico and at sea level, adding in some cross-country workouts.
	   ``I have the same feeling as in 1994,'' the popular, charismatic
Silva said. ``I'm happy, and being happy gives you good luck.''
	   In 1994, Silva registered one of the most unusual victories in
marathon history. With about a half-mile to go, he veered off
course. He tried to head into Central Park at the wrong spot,
before a policeman got him turned back in the right direction.
	   He then rallied to beat compatriot Benjamin Paredes by two
seconds in the closest-ever New York City Marathon. He is confident
of regaining that wonderful feeling.
	   ``I feel very good now,'' he said. ``I'm very motivated.''

Indonesian military denies reports of East Timor troop build-up

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior military officer in East
Timor on Friday denied Australian media reports that troop numbers
in the disputed territory are far in excess of those claimed by the
Indonesian government.
	   The reports contradict Indonesia's claims that it has reduced
troop numbers as it tries to negotiate a U.N.-sponsored peace deal
with Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald reported Friday that records showed
there were more than 21,000 Indonesian troops and auxiliaries in
East Timor in August, including almost 8,000 ``penugasan,'' or
assigned troops.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the 8,000 were
combat troops, part of an overall military force of about 17,000 in
East Timor.
	   The Australian newspaper said that more than 100 pages of leaked
documents confirm the continued presence of units of the army's
elite special forces, Kopassus.
	   East Timor military chief of staff Lt. Col. Supadi told The
Associated Press that the number of troops in East Timor stands at
15,000 after about 1,000 were withdrawn in July and August.
	   This includes 5,000 personnel, including medical teams,
engineers and troops engaged in community development work. About
6,000 of the total were born in East Timor, he said.
	   He did not comment on the veracity of the documents that are now
being circulated in Australia by activists who want independence
for East Timor.
	   Supadi denied news reports that claimed Indonesian troops had
recently clashed with rebel guerrillas in the eastern part of Timor
Island.
	   ``It is very clear that there have been no armed or physical
contacts for the past five months with the guerrillas,'' Supadi
said.
	   Supadi said there have been troop movements in East Timor in
recent weeks, but these had been to distribute food and other aid
to poor areas on the island.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading the previous
year during a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize
Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island territory.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan this month called for an end
to military activity and urged Indonesia to withdraw many of its
troops from the contested territory.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Friday warned that
the revelations of troops numbers in East Timor could derail the
reconciliation process.
	   ``We've argued for two and a half years that an important
component of confidence building in East Timor is to reduce numbers
of troops,'' Downer told ABC radio.
	   ``We very strongly urge the Indonesian government to reduce the
numbers.
	   ``Remember, though, that the peace process, the reconciliation
process, is at a very delicate stage in East Timor and our concern
would be that if these reports are accurate, it won't help that
reconciliation process.''
	   Australia's opposition Labor party spokesman Laurie Brereton
said independent international observers should be allowed into
East Timor to monitor troop movements.

	   LA LIMA, Honduras (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch has been downgraded to
a tropical storm after pounding itself out on the Honduran coast.
But rising floodwaters have cut off communities from food, water
and medicine.
	   By Thursday at least 36 people had died and officials had no
word from hundreds of small towns cut off by the storms in Honduras
and neighboring Nicaragua. Honduran officials said at least 15,000
houses have been destroyed along the Atlantic coast.
	   More than 150,000 people had fled houses or hotels in the
region.
	   ``God save Honduras!'' said President Carlos Flores Facusse
after flying over parts of the vast disaster zone left by more than
two days of rain-charged hurricane-force winds.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard airplane on Thursday was searching off the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border for a yacht reported missing with 31
people aboard.
	   Mitch, which on Tuesday ranked among the century's most powerful
storms, weakened as it moved slightly inland of the Honduran
coastline on Thursday.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at 0600 GMT on
Friday, the storm was centered just inland, about 80 miles (130
kilometers) southeast of La Ceiba, Honduras.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (80 kph), down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday. The center said Mitch would probably
weaken if it remained over land, but could regain force if it
returned to sea.
	   On the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) off Honduras'
coast and popular with divers and beachcombers, at least 14 people
died and many houses were destroyed. There were few details because
the islands were cut off except for occasional phone service.
	   ``My God, this thing is getting ugly,'' said 13-year-old Juan
Padilla as he watched the swollen Chamelecon River sweep cars,
trees, cattle and pieces of houses down toward the Caribbean Sea in
La Lima.
	   In addition to the dead on the Bay Islands, Honduras reported
nine other deaths. Nicaraguan emergency officials appealed for
international aid Thursday, saying the death toll there had risen
to 12, with six still missing Thursday night.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome, a yacht with 31 people aboard,
was still missing, said the U.S. Coast Guard, which sent a C-130
transport plane to search for it.
	   The Coast Guard said it had not found the four-masted schooner
by late Thursday, but said it was too early to be alarmed.
	   ``This kind of thing happens often. We obviously don't have a
hurricane out there every day but we try not to make conclusions,''
said Assistant Duty Officer Chet Darby in Miami.
	   The Fantome, which is owned by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, was
on a six-day cruise through Belize and Honduras' Bay Islands when
the storm hit, said Windjammer spokesman James Canty.
	   He said the boat radioed Tuesday that it was heading east to
avoid the hurricane, and hadn't been heard from since. He said the
passengers were of various nationalities.
	   Honduran officials said more than 200 towns and villages had
been isolated, without power, telephones or clean drinking water in
areas where as much as 24 inches (60 millimeters) of rain fell
within six hours.
	   More than 72,000 people were staying in shelters, and countless
more were making do on their own.
	   With the weakening storm seemingly anchored just inland over
Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency measures
on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. More than 20,000
tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, leaving
hotels at about 20 percent of capacity.

Philippine lawmakers, human rights groups to monitor Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Five Filipino congressmen, including
opponents of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, are
joining observers from Amnesty International and other groups to
monitor the trial of ousted Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   The lawmakers say they are paying their own way so they can
personally judge the fairness of the trial, which begins Monday.
	   Anwar, arrested after he launched a reform movement against
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Asia's longest-ruling
leader, has denied the charges of corruption and sodomy.
	   His supporters have held a series of rallies for his release in
rare public criticisms of Mahathir's authoritarian rule.
	   ``We do not come with homespun biases,'' said Rep. Heherson
Alvarez, one of the Filipino legislators. ``We come because we
care, and we care to understand what's happening.''
	   Amnesty International and several other human rights groups have
said they also intend to send observers to the trial.
	   One problem the foreign observers have is language. Malaysia's
chief judge announced Thursday the trial will be held in the
Malaysian language, reversing a decision two weeks ago that it
would be in English.
	   During Marcos' 20-year strongman rule in the Philippines,
Alvarez was forced into exile and became a leading overseas
government critic. He served as environment secretary under
President Corazon Aquino, who helped topple Marcos in a 1986
``people's power'' revolt.
	   Among the other lawmakers going to the trial is Agapito Aquino _
brother of Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno Aquino, an opposition
leader who was slain during Marcos' administration.
	   Another is Loretta Anne Rosales, a former political detainee
under Marcos and a member of a group of human rights victims who
won a class-action lawsuit in Hawaii against the former dictator.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada has also called for a fair
trial for Anwar. He has said he hopes to visit Anwar in jail while
visiting Malaysia next month for a meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   Foreign observers and media will not receive special seats in
the courtroom, raising fears the government will pack the court
with plainclothes police to keep out reporters and observers.
	   Mahathir, a longtime detractor of the foreign press, has accused
recent coverage of bias against his government.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ It used to be that alcohol and scantily
clad women were essential ingredients for getting a deal done in
Taiwan's male-dominated world of politics and business.
	   But the once-widespread practice of inviting politicians to
lavish dinners accompanied by young ``hostesses'' is on the decline
_ and it's not just the flagging economy posing a threat to
Taiwan's macho style of doing business.
	   An anti-corruption drive is gaining momentum, and hundreds of
civil servants have been punished recently for ``extravagance and
debauchery'' on their visits to hostess clubs.
	   Even a close aide to Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bia _ who is running
for re-election in December on a clean government platform and has
been credited with closing more than 200 illegal sex clubs in the
capital _ has been touched by the scandal.
	   Ma Yung-cheng was forced to resign over allegations that
buinessmen had been picking up his expensive tabs at hostess clubs.
	   ``It was just one incident of the culture of wine and women
corrupting a brilliant young man,'' said Chin Li-fang, a deputy of
the Taipei city council.
	   The more luxurious clubs are divided into private compartments,
where young hostesses flirt with clients and drink cognac, with
each bottle costing up to dlrs 1,000. More modest and less
expensive are karaoke bars and restaurants with hostesses.
	   The women, wearing anything from miniskirts to elegant chipau,
the traditional Chinese dresses with long slits, take off their
clothes for tips and might accompany clients back to hotels for the
right price.
	   But an anti-corruption drive that started after Taiwan began its
transformation to democracy a decade ago is changing everything. In
the past two years, the governing Nationalist Party has seen its
share of popular votes fall steadily because of its corrupt image.
	   The list of cases goes on an on. A prosecutor was censured for
dining with the defendant's lawyer at a hostess club, and a judge
who frequented a dance hall was impeached after he got caught
trying to clear the hall's owner of a bribery allegation.
	   Two senior military officers were jailed for being entertained
at hostess clubs and taking bribes from a defense contractor. The
scandal surfaced when the businessman lost a bunker contract he had
been promised and then kidnapped and beat up the officers.
	   Nobody used to raise an eye when politicians visited the plushly
decorated hostess clubs.
	   In Taiwan's male-dominated society many businessmen hire
prostitutes for their clients and associates.
	   But Taiwanese have grown weary of corrupt public officials and
less tolerant of their taxes paying for such indulgences.
	   Women politicians, a growing minority in Taiwanese public life,
have seized the opportunity to bill themselves as being more
virtuous than their male counterparts.
	   Annette Lu, chief executive of Taoyuan County, said men often
reach business decisions at hostess clubs to the exclusion of their
female associates. She refuses to drink and urges her male aides to
abstain.

Japanese stocks drop, dollar lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks finished lower Friday amid continued
worries over weak Japanese corporate earnings, while the U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 104.21 points,
or 0.76 percent, closing the week at 13,564.51. On Thursday, the
index gained 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.84 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 0.52
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
level of 116.93 yen overnight.
	   Tokyo share prices initially responded positively to news that
Mitsui Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank, was to
withdraw from overseas banking.
	   Traders said sentiment later turned bearish, however, as many
investors sold major blue chips, including Sony Corp. Sony shares
ended the day at 7,400 yen (dlrs 64.35) per share, down 300 yen
(dlrs 2.61) from Thursday's close.
	   Sony, considered one of Japan's strongest companies, said
earlier this week that its group net profit for the full fiscal
year ending March 1999, will come to 170 billion yen (dlrs 1.48
billion), sharply lower than its earlier projection of 215 billion
yen (dlrs 1.87 billion) profit.
	   Traders said the weakness in Sony shares also pulled down other
blue chips, including Toyota Motor, TDK, Kyocera and Canon.
	   Many export-oriented Japanese companies have forecast declines
in earnings for the full fiscal year partly because of poorer
overseas sales caused by the yen's recent strength against the
dollar.
	   A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive
abroad, cutting into earnings of exporters.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.50 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,035.60. The
TOPIX rose 8.49 points, or 0.83 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 8,495.03 points in Thursday trading, up 123.06.
	   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar slid against the yen as
market players sold the U.S. currency to hedge against further
downside risk.
	   Market players had widely expected the greenback to find support
Friday from month-end demand from Japanese investors.
	   But when that failed to materialize, Japanese trust banks,
exporters and life insurers dumped the dollar against the yen,
triggering stop-loss orders to sell dollars further, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.820 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.870
percent, driving its price up to 108.73 yen from 108.25 yen.

 &UR; At least 60 killed in fire in Sweden

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ At least 60 people died early Friday
when fire raced through a building jammed with hundreds of
teen-agers attending an immigrant association's discotheque dance
in Sweden's second-largest city. About 190 others were injured,
many of them seriously.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building.
	   It was the deadliest fire in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20
people died in a fire in the town of Boraas.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson said on
national radio.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   But Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ``The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported that 190 people were taken
to hospitals with injuries from the fire, of which about 20 were in
intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured were taken by
helicopter to burn clinics in other cities throughout Sweden, the
report said.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in the
building of the local Macedonian Association. The immigrant group
had organized a disco dance for young people to celebrate Halloween
and officials said the crowd was mostly aged about 13 to 18. The
dance was held in the building's second story.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked
out the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there
were about 400 people inside.
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities and
the Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service
to help transport the injured.
	   Olin said the building had been inspected by the rescue service
in April 1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as
emergency exits and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ''Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg, with about 435,000 people, is on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Report: Singapore's Lee says technology undermines control over
</HEADLINE>
media

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew warned
that the control exercised over media coverage in many Asian
nations has been stymied by the Internet and other forms of modern
technology, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``Information technology is rapidly undermining whatever
monopoly control of the media governments might have had,'' Lee was
quoted by The New Paper as saying in a speech given Thursday in Los
Angeles.
	   ``Governments that try to fight the new technology will lose.''
	   Lee, who has loomed large in Singapore's control over its media
and has clashed repeatedly with the foreign press, added, however,
that it is important for governments not to abandon efforts at
disseminating official views through media outlets.
	   Many Asian countries _ especially China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Myanmar, North Korea, Singapore and Vietnam _ have implemented
varying degrees of control over the content of news and the
availability of information.
	   But the Internet and other advances in communications have
``made it impossible for inconvenient news to be suppressed for
long,'' Lee was quoted as saying, citing the proliferation of
unofficial information about recent political events in Malaysia
and Indonesia.
	   In the new global communications environment, Lee said that ``we
will have a cacophony of media voices'' instead of ``a clear and
consistent message.''
	   ``This will be bad for any society, democratic or otherwise,''
he was quoted as saying in the report.
	   Still, Lee predicted that leaders of all types of government
will eventually learn to use the new media technology for their own
purposes.
	   ``Information technology itself is neutral, neither for nor
against Western values and democracy,'' he argued.

South Korean car sales accelerate in Australian market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ South Korean automakers have achieved
strong growth in recent years in the Australian car market,
according to government figures released Friday.
	   The Australian Bureau of Statistics said Hyundai, the market
leader in the low price market category, recorded average growth of
37.2 percent a year between 1995 and 1997.
	   Another Korean maker, Daewoo, recorded average growth of 98.2
percent during the same period, the bureau said in a report.
	   The bureau said Australia has one of the oldest car fleets in
the developed world, noting that the average age of a car on
Australia's roads is 10.7 years. Roughly one in nine cars
registered in Australia is at least 20 years old, it said.

Rights group says China stopping publication of reform book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities have banned the printing of any more
copies of a popular book on the need for political reform in China,
a human rights group said Friday.
	   The book's publisher, Today's China Publishing Co., recently was
told to halt another printing of ``Political China: Facing the Era
of Choosing a New Structure'' because some of its articles
contained ``serious problems,'' the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said in a
statement.
	   A spokesman for the publishing company, who declined to give his
name, said further publication was ``under discussion,'' but copies
already in book stores were still for sale. A major bookstore
confirmed it had not been told to remove the book.
	   One of the book's editors, Shi Binhai, has been in detention
since September. But media and dissident circles believe other
activities got him in trouble with authorities.
	   Police have not revealed the reason for Shi's arrest.
	   The Information Center speculated that Shi was preparing to
interview Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party leader who was
purged for refusing to back a crackdown on student democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and lives under house
arrest. For many intellectuals and dissidents, Zhao has become a
symbol of tolerance and political change.

Report: Tibetan antelope on verge of extinction due to poaching
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An antelope found only on the high, desolate
Tibetan plateau is on the verge of extinction because poachers are
killing it for its fur, a Chinese newspaper reported Friday.
	   The extremely fine hair of the Tibetan antelope, or chiru, is
used in weaving a soft fabric called shahtoosh that fetches high
prices in the West.
	   A single shawl of shahtoosh sells for dlrs 11,000, according to
Friends of Nature, a Chinese environmental group that issued a news
release calling for protection of the rare antelope, the China
Daily reported.
	   More than 20,000 of the animals are killed each year on the vast
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, said Friends of Nature president Liang
Congjie said. The remote, rugged part of western China is 4,500
meters (15,000 feet) above sea level.
	   The population of chirus has declined to between 75,000 and
100,000, or one-tenth of what it was 100 years ago, Liang said. He
said that at the current rate of poaching, the animal will be
extinct in 20 years.
	   Poachers enter the unpopulated plateau during fierce winters,
when the animal is most valuable because its hair is thickest, the
report said.
	   Although protected under an international treaty and Chinese
law, the antelopes are poached because of strong demand for
shahtoosh made in India and sold in Great Britain and other
countries, Liang said.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire started by an explosion raced
through an upstairs discotheque jammed with hundreds of teen-agers
attending a Halloween dance early Friday in Sweden's second-largest
city, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 190 others,
many seriously.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building in
Goteborg, on the country's west coast and about 500 kilometers (300
miles) southwest of Stockholm.
	   The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978,
when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson said on
national radio.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ``The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported 190 people were taken to
hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in intensive care. Seven
of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter to burn
clinics in other cities, the report said.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in
building of the local Macedonian Association, which organized the
dance. The crowd in the second story of the building contained
mostly 13 to 18 year olds.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Olin said the rescue service inspected the building in April
1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as emergency exits
and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.

They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

Schumacher posts fastest time in practice for Japan Grand Prix

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ The season-ending Japanese Grand Prix
promises to prove whether the key to winning a Formula One
championship is a great car or a great driver.
	   The two contenders for the title, Mika Hakkinen in
McLaren-Mercedes' top-ranked car, and Michael Schumacher, widely
recognized as the best driver, joined the rest of the field on
Friday in two hours of practice for Sunday's showdown race.
	   Ferrari's Schumacher posted the top time, with a lap of 1 minute
39.823 seconds.
	   ``Of course I am happy to be on the provisional pole, but I do
not think today's result shows the whole truth and therefore I
expect qualifying to be very close tomorrow,'' said Schumacher.
	   Schumacher is four points behind Hakkinen and can claim the
championship only if he wins Sunday and someone other than his
Finnish rival finishes second.
	   Ferrari is counting on Schumacher's teammate Eddie Irvine to
fill that role.
	   Irvine was faster in practice than Hakkinen on Friday, turning
the day's fourth quickest lap. If he gets out in front of him on
Sunday too, he will try to block Hakkinen, thus depriving him of
precious series points.
	   Jordan Mugen Honda's Ralf Schumacher turned the second fastest
lap around the 5.864 kilometer (3.643 miles) Suzuka circuit on
Friday, 0.513 second behind the leader, while Hakkinen was fifth.
	   Hakkinen needs only a second-place finish Sunday to clinch his
first world title and claim the constructors crown for McLaren
which has set the technological pace this year.
	   The Finn said he was happy with his car after Friday's practice
laps.
	   ``The car ran reliably, it was strong and we completed a good
number of laps, so I am very pleased,'' he said.
	   And the McLaren-Mercedes team said the slow times for Hakkinen
and his teammate David Coulthard in Friday's practice were not due
to any problems with their cars, which have been technically the
best on the track.
	   ``Mika and David had to abandon their fast laps when (Jean)
Alesi and Irvine had an off. In the end Mika was under way with his
best split times when he was held up by traffic in the last
chicane,'' explained Norbert Haug, head of Mercedes-Benz
Motorsport.
	   McLaren cars finished first and second in three of the first
five races of the season.
	   Coulthard said how he and Hakkinen will do on Sunday all depends
on where they qualify, and where the Ferraris qualify.
	   ``Once all the teams are in the same condition for qualifying we
will know exactly where we stand,'' said Coulthard.
	   Ferrari's Schumacher has already won world championships in 1994
and 1995 and has predicted he will capture his third with a victory
Sunday.
	   He has good reason to be confident on the difficult Suzuka
course, having won the Japanese Grand Prix here last year and in
1995.
	   The German is also a good wet-weather driver, a talent that
could serve him well if the rain _ common in past races here _
comes again to Suzuka.
	   Rain fell on the course after the practice session ended Friday
afternoon and forecasters said there was a 30 percent chance of
showers for both Saturday's qualifying race and for Sunday's Grand
Prix.

Cathay Pacific wants management rights over Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways has completed
a study of ailing Philippine Airlines and is negotiating the terms
of a buy-in that would give it management rights, an official said
Friday.
	   ``There's still a gap in different areas, but both sides are
keen to try to close the gap,'' Cathay Pacific country manager Alex
Shum said.
	   He said Cathay Pacific has not yet submitted a formal offer but
plans to do so very soon. The Hong Kong-based airline wants
management control over PAL, but will not bring in a large number
of its own managers, he told The Associated Press.
	   ``We want a management contract. We want to have a decision on
all major issues in Philippine Airlines, on all operational
matters,'' he said.
	   ``That would not mean that we would have a lot of people
there,'' he added. ``Just a couple of people. There are many good
managers in PAL.''
	   Under Philippine law, a foreign company can buy up to 40 percent
of PAL's stock. There are also legal restrictions on foreigners
working for PAL, and Cathay Pacific managers might have to be
considered advisers instead of employees.
	   Shum said that issue is among those being discussed by the two
sides.
	   He declined to say what stake Cathay Pacific hopes to acquire,
or what differences remain between them.
	   Northwest Airlines of the United States has also expressed an
interest in buying into PAL, and its chairman visited the
Philippines several weeks ago to meet with PAL chairman Lucio Tan.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debt. It was devastated by a pilots' strike in
June and by Asia's currency crisis, which came shortly after it
launched an ambitious refleeting and expansion program.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after a union
representing ground personnel turned down a management-proposed
recovery plan that included a 10-year suspension of collective
bargaining in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown.
	   The airline resumed domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international
flights on Thursday.

Death toll from runaway rail car collision rises to 26
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a collision between five
runaway rail cars and a bus rose to 26 on Friday when two more
people died in a hospital, a news agency reported.
	   Seventeen people remain in the hospital, one in grave condition,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting doctors.
	   The accident occurred Monday at an unmanned railroad crossing in
Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers (3,800 miles) east Moscow.
	   Five rail cars carrying concrete panels and other construction
material broke away from a train, accelerated down a hill and
struck a bus, splitting it in half.
	   Transport officials said negligence was to blame and were
investigating the engineer of the locomotive that had pulled the
wagons.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS 2nd graf of Senators-Flyers with details on cuts;
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; St Louis Blues beat Red Wings 3-1

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Geoff Courtnall scored on a penalty shot midway
through the third period as the St. Louis Blues beat the Detroit
Red Wings 3-1 on Thursday night.
	   Courtnall broke free after a feed from Scott Young and was
bearing down on goalie Chris Osgood when Aaron Ward began hooking
him to throw him off. Courtnall nearly scored anyway with a shot
that banged off the goal post.
	   On the penalty shot, Courtnall beat Osgood with a wrist shot
that sailed over the goalie's left shoulder.
	   Scott Pellerin and Al MacInnis also scored for the Blues. Doug
Brown scored for Detroit.
 &UR; Senators 3, Flyers 1 &QC; 
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Andreas Johansson scored twice and Radek
Bonk added a goal in an injury-delayed first period as Ottawa beat
Philadelphia.
	   The final 4:47 of the period was played after the first
intermission because of a injury to Ottawa's Andreas Dackell. The
right wing sustained a concussion and two facial cuts that required
30 stitches to close in a collision with Philadelphia captain Eric
Lindros.
	   Dackell, cut by his own visor, was on the ice for about 12
minutes before being taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.
Lindros, who scored a shorthanded goal in the third period, was not
penalized on the play.
	   Damian Rhodes stopped 28 shots to help Ottawa end a 12-game
losing streak against Philadelphia dating to April 26, 1995.
 &UR; Canadiens 1, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   In Boston, Brian Savage scored a power-play goal with 41 seconds
remaining in the second period as Montreal tied Boston.
	   Steve Heinze had a power-play goal at 15:32 of the first period
for the Bruins, who routed the Canadiens 9-2 on Wednesday night in
Montreal. Heinze has three goals this season and 100 in his NHL
career.
 &UR; Devils 2, Islanders 1 &QC; 
	   In Uniondale New York, Bobby Holik and Dave Andreychuk scored
first-period goals and Martin Brodeur made 22 saves for New Jersey.
	   New Jersey, coming off a 4-0 home loss to Los Angeles on
Wednesday night, won for the third time in four games. Jason Dawe
scored for New York.
 &UR; Avalanche 4, Sharks 2 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Joe Sakic broke a tie midway through the third period
with his fourth shorthanded goal in five games as Colorado beat
winless San Jose.
	   Sakic, who tied it at 2 with 3:02 remaining in the second
period, beat Mike Vernon with a low wrist shot at 7:03 of the third
period.
	   Rene Corbet and Stephane Yelle added goals, and Craig Billington
made 21 saves. Dave Lowry and Andrei Zyuzin scored for San Jose
(0-6-2).

Remote Australian city prepares to light up for Glenn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The city of Perth will once again
transform itself into the ``City of Lights'' on Saturday to greet
astronaut John Glenn as he passes over Australia during his
historic return to space.
	   Lights at major stadiums, skyscrapers and thousands of homes
will be turned on in the early morning to recreate the view 36
years ago when Glenn looked out his spacecraft window as it passed
over Australia.
	   In February 1962, residents stayed up until midnight and turned
on every house light to send a welcome message to Glenn. Every
street lamp and neon sign was also lit.
	   According to Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw
clouds part to reveal ``an absolute mass of electric lights'' in
two groups, one in Perth, the other in the town of Rockingham to
the south.
	   ``The lights show up very well,'' Glenn radioed to astronaut
Gordon Cooper at a tracking station in Australia. ``Please thank
everybody for turning them on will you?''
	   Perth, 3,360 kilometers (2,100 miles) west of Sydney on the
Indian Ocean, has traded on its reputation as the ``City of
Lights'' ever since.
	   This time Glenn's flight path will take him farther north, and
his ability to see Perth will not be as good.
	   But this has not deterred residents or the state government,
which has asked everyone to turn on their lights.
	   The BP Oil refinery has also received permission from the state
government's Environmental Protection Department to light up its
gas flare.
	   Glenn is due to fly over Western Australia state about 530 miles
(850 kms) north of Perth, between 12:40 a.m. and 1:05 a.m. (1640
GMT and 1705 GMT). Most of the state's southwest is expected to be
visible to Glenn.
	   ``We won't see the shuttle, but he will see us,'' Dr. James
Biggs from the Perth Observatory said. ``We'll probably look like a
big glowing blob to him.''

National airline cuts routes to stem losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's flag carrier said Friday it
has stopped flights to Sydney and Amsterdam as part of a
restructuring to stem losses.
	   But Thai Airways International said it has increased domestic
and European flights for the peak tourism season, which begins next
month and runs until March.
	   Chairman Mahidol Chantrangkurn said earlier this year the
airline planned to restructure by closing down loss-making routes.
	   Thai Airways said it suspended its once-daily flights to
Amsterdam as of Oct. 25 and eliminated all three of its weekly
flights to Sydney. The Jakarta leg of the flight will continue, the
airline said.
	   Thai Airways also said it had temporarily suspended flights to
Surabaya, on the eastern coast of the Indonesian island of Java.
	   Flights to Los Angeles, which have also notched losses, will
continue to operate seven times a week, the airline said.
	   More profitable European operations have increased to 47 flights
a week from 39, while the airline plans to begin 64 more domestic
flights to meet the growing number of Thais taking vacations at
home.
	   Thai Airways said it will fly to Copenhagen, if it receives on
time a Boeing 747-400 scheduled for December delivery. The carrier
also plans to start flying to Stockholm in mid-1999.
	   In the third quarter of fiscal 1998 ending June 30, the airline
reported a loss of 4.32 billion baht (dlrs 118 million) against
310.3 million baht (dlrs 8.5 million) in the year-earlier period.
	   After a board meeting Thursday, the airline said it expected
restructuring would improve management efficiency and increase
revenue.
	   Thailand's Finance Ministry currently holds more than 90 percent
of Thai Airways shares, but the government is committed to selling
some of its stake in the airline under the terms of a dlrs 17.2
billion International Monetary Fund package to pull the country out
of an economic crisis.

2 killed in Sudan military helicopter crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A gust of wind slammed a military
helicopter to the ground as it prepared to land in southern Sudan,
killing two senior officials, a military statement published Friday
said.
	   The remaining 15 people on board escaped unhurt in Thursday's
crash in the town of Bor in the southern Equatoria region where
Sudanese forces are fighting Christian and animist rebels.
	   Those killed were Mohieddin Moussa, the governor of Jongelei
state, and an aide, state coordinator Sabit Abdul-Faraj, said the
statement published in Khartoum newspapers.
	   It said the helicopter was landing at the Bor garrison when it
was hit by a strong rush of wind. The aircraft lost control and hit
the ground on its tail from a height of 3 meters (10 feet), the
statement said.
	   This is the second crash of a military plane in southern Sudan
in less than a week. A plane went down on Sunday, killing the
pilot.
	   The site of Thursday's crash, Bor, is the birth place of John
Garang, the leader of Sudan People's Liberation Army, a guerrilla
group that is fighting for autonomy for the largely Christian and
animist people of the south.
	   The SPLA started its bush war against the Arabized government in
the north in 1983 from Bor, 700 miles (1,130 kilometers) south of
the capital, Khartoum.

Amnesty says Sri Lankan government is delaying probe into mass
</HEADLINE>
graves  &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government is delaying an
investigation into a soldier's claim that he helped bury hundreds
of Tamils killed by security forces, Amnesty International said in
a statement on Friday.
	   The government ordered an inquiry in July into the soldier's
account of a mass grave in the Tamil heartland of Jaffna, but the
probe has since made little progress.
	   Rights group Amnesty International said the government has
neglected to guarantee the investigators' safety.
	   The soldier made the claim while appealing a death sentence in
Colombo after his conviction in a rape and murder case. He is among
five soldiers and a policeman who were sentenced to death on July 3
for the rape and murder of a Tamil schoolgirl and her family.
	   The six said they were innocent of murder and merely buried the
girl, her family and many other bodies of people killed over
several months. They offered to show authorities the graves of
hundreds of other Tamil civilians they said were killed by security
forces.
	   The soldier did not say how the girl and her family died.
	   Earlier this week, Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission asked the
United Nations to send international experts to help in the
investigation.
	   ``Amnesty International welcomes ... the invitation to send
forensic exports to observe the exhumations ... but it warned the
operation was being held up by the government's failure so far to
provide assurances of full cooperation and security for all those
participating in the exhumations,'' the group said in the
statement.
	   ``The government of Sri Lanka must guarantee the safety of
forensic experts to enable international observers to participate
in the exhumations of the alleged mass graves,'' the group said.
	   Between 500 to 600 Tamil civilians have disappeared in the
northern Jaffna Peninsula since the military drove out rebels and
took control in May 1996.
	   The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for the
ethnic Tamil minority which they claim is discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese who dominate the government and the
military.
	   The area where the mass graves are allegedly situated is on the
outskirts of Jaffna and has been under the control of the Sri
Lankan army.
	   Jaffna town remained a stronghold of the Tamil Tiger rebels
until December 1995 when government forces beat them back after a
50-day battle in which 2,500 combatants on both sides were killed.
	   The area is about 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of the
capital, Colombo.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The French Embassy is giving dlrs 20,000
to victims of recent flooding in central Vietnam, local press
reported Friday.
	   This is the second time the French government has pitched in

drought-stricken provinces, said the Communist Party newspaper, the
People.
	   France over the past two years has provided emergency aid worth
over 3 billion dong (dlrs 215,000) to the victims of natural

Drug agency carried out 4,000 Australian tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's drugs in sport watchdog
carried out more than 4,000 tests over the past year, catching 42
athletes for testing positive to performance-enhancing substances.
	   The Australian Sports Drug Agency's (ASDA) 1997-98 annual
report, released Friday, showed the number of tests increased by 23
percent, with the majority conducted out of competition.
	   The agency said it was concerned about the use of undetectable
substances such as erythropoietin (EPO) and human growth hormone _
which are naturally occurring _ in elite sport.
	   The ASDA carried out 4,313 tests which resulted in 42 entries on
the Register of Notifiable Events and 12 positive tests returned by
non-Australian athletes.
	   The positive tests included high-profile rugby league players,
including Newcastle's Robbie O'Davis, who was hit with a 22-match
suspension earlier this year for returning an elevated testosterone
level.
	   Also included was Newcastle teammate Wayne Richards, banned for
22 matches for a positive test for the steroid stanozolol.
	   He was joined by Melbourne international Rodney Howe, who
received the maximum 22-match suspension after being found guilty
of using stanozolol and andriol.
	   Other entries included several in cycling for pseudoephedrine
and amphetamines, four cannabis offenses in motorcycling, several
anabolic offenses in weightlifting and bobsled and a two-year
suspension for a soccer player caught using amphetamines. (djp)

Russia's Kamchatka region appeals to U.N. for fuel aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Lawmakers on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula sent a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday asking for
urgent fuel aid to survive the winter, a news agency reported.
	   The chairman of the regional legislature, Lev Boitsov, called it
a ``gesture of despair,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Kamchatka cannot afford to buy fuel to produce enough heat and
electricity for homes and offices. Electricity is switched on only
four hours a day and heat has not yet been turned on for the
winter, even though it is already snowing in rural areas and
temperatures are -15 to -18 C (-5 to 0 F).
	   Kindergartens and schools have been closed.
	   The lawmakers asked Annan for 120,000 metric tons (35 million
gallons) of oil and 30,000 metric tons (45,000 tons) of diesel
fuel.
	   ``A real threat to the life and health of the citizens of the
Kamchatka region has emerged,'' they said in the letter.

Anwar's lawyers appeal judge's decision to refuse bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for jailed dissident Anwar
Ibrahim asked a higher court Friday to free him on bail after a
lower court refused to do so.
	   Attorney Sankaran Nair said they asked the judge for an early
hearing on the appeal.
	   On Monday, Anwar is to stand trial on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts, charges he says were trumped up by the
government to stem his rising popularity.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul, who will preside over the trial
starting on Monday, earlier rejected Anwar's request for bail. The
judge said the lawyers weren't able to prove that Anwar would not
tamper with witnesses if released on bail.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said the appeal filed on Friday
contained five principal grounds arguing that ``the learned judge
was wrong in law'' to refuse her husband bail. She didn't specify
what the grounds were.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under a special security law only
hours after organizing a mammoth rally in the capital. During that
protest, he called for sweeping government reforms and the
resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister and
finance minister after deeming him morally unfit to lead the
Southeast Asian country.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. communications and electronics giant 3Com
on Friday opened a dlrs 70 million manufacturing plant in
Singapore, the company's largest productions facility in the world.
	   Located in the island's industrial north, the plant will

	   ``Our aim is to develop Singapore into a key manufacturer of
communications equipment for the world market,'' Lee said.
	   He added Singapore is eager to promote the growth and upgrading
of the industry that employs a high percentage of skilled workers.
	   Singapore's economy has steadily slowed since the start of the
regional crisis. GDP grew 6.1 percent in the first quarter and 1.6
percent in the second. As the economy weakens, joblessness has
increased.

Jailed dissident calls for civil servant bonuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar
Ibrahim urged the country's leadership Friday to give low-paid
civil servants their regular annual bonus.
	   His comments, in a statement read by his wife, Azizah Ismail,
come just two days before the former deputy prime minister faces
trial on sex and corruption charges.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced last week, in
releasing the 1999 national budget, that government workers would
not get their annual bonuses in an effort to cut government
spending.
	   Anwar argued that while the government crafts plans to rescue
Malaysia's leading companies from the throes of the regional
financial crisis, Mahathir is forgetting the plight of the ordinary
people.
	   ``It is only fair and proper for us to listen to the appeal and
grievances of the people and the lower categories of government
staff,'' said Anwar, who was sacked last month as finance minister.
	   ``We shouldn't merely be looking after the interests of the
giant corporations, friends and relatives,'' he added.
	   Anwar said a provision for bonus payments of around 500 million
ringgit (dlrs 132 million) wouldn't hurt the government's finances.
	   Two weeks ago, plans were announced to help the ailing Renong
Bhd. conglomerate by issuing 10.5 billion ringgit (dlrs 2.7
billion) in government bonds to pay off the company's growing debt.
	   The deal has been criticized because of the conglomerate's close
links to Malaysia's ruling political party.
	   Anwar's comments appeared to be an attempt to stoke up support
among Malaysia's middle classes ahead of what's shaping up to be
the most dramatic court case in the country's history.

Langer promises hot time for England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Test player Justin Langer promises his
Western Australia side will do England no favors when it begins a
four-day cricket match Saturday at the WACA Ground.
	   England eked out a one-run victory in the traditional one-day
tour opener against an Australian Cricket Board XI at Lilac Hill on
Thursday in a game renowned for its festive atmosphere.
	   Acting state captain Langer, who returned from Australia's tour
to Pakistan on Thursday, said Western Australia wanted to make life
as difficult as possible for England in the tour match.
	   ``Winning is a habit and if we can stop England from having a
good preparation for the test series then we will have done our
job,'' Langer said.
	   ``We'll go out to play good, tough cricket and hopefully give
them a hard time.''
	   England captain Alec Stewart was Friday passed fit to be
wicketkeeper against Western Australia after not fielding against
the ACB side on Thursday because of back stiffness.
	   The England skipper said tour selectors were certain to prune
one batsman from the 12-man squad for the match.
	   Stewart said Thursday's victory further enhanced the spirit of
his charges.
	   ``People say it's only a festival game but we came here to win
it and if we had lost I would have been disappointed,'' he said.
	   ``The fighting spirit is good and improving all the time and the
other thing is we are learning how to win. Wherever a game is
played over here, I have said we have got to win it.''
	   The teams:
	   ENGLAND: Mark Butcher, Michael Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Alec
Stewart (captain), Graham Thorpe, Mark Ramprakash, John Crawley,
Dominic Cork, Darren Gough, Robert Croft, Angus Fraser, Alan
Mullally (12th man to be named).
	   WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Michael Hussey, Ryan Campbell, Justin Langer
(captain), Simon Katich, Brad Oldroyd, Michael Dighton, Rob Baker,
Sean Cary, Kade Harvey, Shane Jurgensen, Matthew Nicholson, Chris
Rogers (12th man to be named). (djp)

South Korea posts dlrs 3.68 billion current account surplus in
</HEADLINE>
September

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sharply falling imports helped South
Korea post a dlrs 3.68 billion current account surplus in
September, the central Bank of Korea said Friday.
	   September's gain _ the 11th consecutive monthly surplus _ pushed
the country's combined current account surplus for the first nine
months of the year to dlrs 31.17 billion, compared with a dlrs
12.13 billion shortfall a year earlier.
	   September's surplus was up from a dlrs 509.9 million deficit
during the same month last year. It was also an improvement from
August's dlrs 2.22 billion surplus.
	   Exports fell 3.9 percent to dlrs 10.88 billion in September, but
imports plunged 37.2 percent to dlrs 7.05 billion, leading to a
dlrs 3.83 billion surplus in the trade component of the current
account.
	   Imports have dropped sharply in recent months as businesses
slashed capital investment and consumers spent less amid the
country's economic crisis.

Report: Arafat plans to retire due to ill health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Citing poor health, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat plans to retire as early as February after the
implementation of the recent land-for-security agreement with
Israel, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The leftist Beirut newspaper, Al-Kifah Al-Arabi, said Arafat
told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last week that he wants to
quit because of ``poor health and extreme weakness.''
	   The newspaper quoted Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo, where the
two leaders met. Egyptian officials were not immediately available
for comment, and the Palestinians also did not immediately react.
	   Arafat, 68, has been dogged by persistent rumors of failing
health but has dismissed the speculation as subversive propaganda.
He has been variously reported to be suffering from Parkinson's
disease and depression, and is often seen on TV looking pale and
tired, his lower lip trembling and his hands shaking.
	   This is not the first time reports of his imminent resignation
have appeared in the Arab press.
	   Kuwait's Al-Watan Al-Arabi published a similar report on
Thursday and Egypt's government-owned Al-Gomhuriya said as far back
as in June that Arafat will hand over interim power after signing
the deal to Ahmed Qurai, head of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, or Salim Zaanoun, speaker of the Palestine National
Council.
	   In its Friday's report, Al-Kifah Al-Arabi suggested a similar
transition of power after the end of the implementation of the
agreement.
	   Under the accord signed in Washington Oct. 23, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The clock starts ticking Nov. 2. However, target dates on
Palestinian-Israeli agreements have proved elusive in the past as
implementation hit snags.
	   Arafat, whose name has become synonymous with the Palestinian
struggle for their national rights, plans to leave the Palestinian
self-rule areas and set up residence in Cairo and Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, the Al-Kifah Al-Arabi said. He will occasionally visit Gaza
and the West Bank, it said.

Yeltsin goes on vacation, aide says he will voluntarily cut his
</HEADLINE>
power &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An exhausted Boris Yeltsin prepared to leave for a
Black Sea vacation on Thursday, and a senior aide said the Russian
president would formally restrict his political powers early next
year.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday to receive treatment and recover from what doctors said was
extreme fatigue and unstable blood pressure.
	   The president's condition forced him to abruptly cancel a
scheduled trip to Austria, renewing concern about his ability to
serve the rest of his term ending in the summer 2000.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has remained largely out of public view since the
country was hit by an economic crisis in mid-August, and his deputy
chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev acknowledged earlier this week that the
president had turned control over the economy to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   On Friday, Sysuyev went a step further, saying that the
president would formally announce his reduced political role in a
speech to parliament early next year.
	   Yeltsin feels comfortable giving the new Cabinet responsibility
for day-to-day government affairs because it was formed with
parliament's support, the Financial Times of London quoted Sysuyev
as saying.
	   ``The political situation in Russia has changed,'' Sysuyev said.
``In the past, the president engaged in every aspect of running the
country.''
	   He added that Yeltsin would serve the rest of his term and must
preserve his constitutional powers to ensure that the next
presidential elections are democratic.
	   Communists and other Yeltsin opponents have demanded his early
resignation and immediate changes in the constitution to curb the
president's sweeping powers. The Communist Party leadership was
meeting on Friday to discuss their election strategy.
	   Several months before Yeltsin's latest illness and the economic
crisis, the Communist-led opposition in parliament has started an
impeachment campaign against the president. The campaign is widely
expected to fizzle like previous such attempts.
	   A poll by the independent Public Opinion Foundation found 75
percent of Russians supported impeaching Yeltsin, while 16 percent
opposed it.
	   The poll, conducted on Oct. 17 among 1,500 people throughout the
country, gave no margin of error.
	   Before leaving for a two-week vacations to the Black Sea resort
of Sochi later Friday, Yeltsin was scheduled to meet with Primakov
to hear his report about a European Union meeting in Austria, which
the prime minister attended Tuesday in place of the president.
	   Primakov told reporters he would also brief Yeltsin about his
talks Thursday with the leader of breakaway Chechnya and other
issues.

Indonesian mob kills man suspected of mysterious murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers on Indonesia's main island
of Java killed a man they suspected of involvement in a wave of
mysterious murders, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The mob beating Wednesday night was the latest in a string of
revenge killings for the murders of more than 150 suspected black
magic sorcerers and Muslim preachers.
	   The unidentified man was attacked in the western Java village of
Susukan, 270 kilometers (168 miles) east of Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital, the Kompas newspaper said.
	   The villagers reportedly believed the man was one of the
mysterious assassins, who are said to dress in Ninja-like black
clothing. Kompas said the crowd found a black cap in his pocket.
	   Mobs have lynched half a dozen other suspected murderers this
week on Java. Police say that in many cases, there has been flimsy
evidence to suspect the victims are guilty and that villagers are
quick to seek out scapegoats.
	   A man who was arrested in the eastern Java town of Bojonegoro on
Thursday admitted that he and three other men had been promised a
payoff if they killed a Muslim preacher, reported the Suara
Pembaruan, a daily newspaper.
	   The man, identified only as Samsuri, did not say who had offered
him a sum of 20 million rupiahs (dlrs 2,750) for the killing, the
newspaper said. Some Muslims suspect the murders are politically
motivated.
	   Many of the victims of the mysterious murders were Muslim
clerics and other members of Indonesia's largest Muslim group,
Nahdhatul Ulama.
	   The group, which has formed its own political party to run in
elections next year, has warned it will deploy its own security
forces if the military does not restore order soon.

U.S. team ahead in Nichirei International after first round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INA, Japan (AP) _ The U.S. LPGA team took a narrow lead over
Japan in the dlrs 702,000 Nichirei International tournament Friday,
winning five out of nine opening-round matches.
	   Pat Hurst and partner Hiromi Kobayashi on the American side hit
the day's low score of 10-under-par 62 at Tsukuba Country Club to
beat Fuki Kido and Mayumi Murai by five strokes.
	   Chris Johnson paired with Betsy King for a 64-66 victory over
Japan's Kaori Higo and Yuri Kawanami on the 6,294-yard course in
Ibaraki Prefecture.
	   The U.S. team won three other matches and lost four for a 5-4
lead in the three-day tournament.
	   Each squad is made up of 18 players. The first two rounds are
four-ball stroke plays where winning pairs earn 1 point for their
team while a tie earns each team one-half point. Sunday's final
round will feature individual stroke-play matches.
	   The U.S. team is trying for its 14th straight triumph in the
Nichirei tournament _ Japan's version of the Ryder Cup. The U.S.
squad has a 17-2 record overall since 1979.
	   Each member of the winning team Sunday will receive dlrs 25,000.

Judge orders more investigation into treason charges against
</HEADLINE>
Nikitin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian judge said that treason charges against
a retired naval officer accused of giving secret information to a
foreign environmental group were unclear and ordered prosecutors to
continue investigating the case, the Bellona environmental group
said Friday.
	   Judge Sergei Golets threw out all the evidence presented in the
indictment Thursday, Bellona said in a news release.
	   Retired naval officer Alexander Nikitin is accused of giving the
Norwegian Bellona Foundation information on how the Russian navy's
Northern Fleet handles its nuclear waste and reactors.
	   Prosecutors say the data constituted a state secret. Nikitin and
Bellona say the information came from public records, including
school textbooks.
	   Nikitin pleaded innocent when his trial opened in St. Petersburg
last week, more than three years after he was first charged. Most
of the hearings have been closed to all but a handful of observers.
	   ``This is a major victory for us and a defeat for the FSB
(Federal Security Service,'' Bellona quoted defense lawyer Yuri
Schmidt as saying. ``To have Alexander declared not guilty would of
course have been better, but we must understand the enormous
pressure against the judge.''
	   Thomas Nilsen, who co-wrote a report for Bellona using Nikitin's
information, said it was the first time a treason indictment had
been rejected by either a Soviet or Russian court. The decision
``is of historic value,'' he said.
	   Schmidt predicted that prosecutors may be forced to drop the
charges against Nikitin, saying there were no more facts for them
to investigate.
	   Nikitin was charged with seven counts of treason based on
Defense Ministry internal decrees that have never been published
and were shown to his lawyers for the first time when the trial
began.
	   The defense argued that under the Russian Constitution, criminal
charges cannot be filed on the basis of unpublished laws.

Tokyo share prices fall on worry over corporate earnings, dollar
</HEADLINE>
lower &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell Friday amid worries over
poor Japanese corporate earnings, while the U.S. dollar slipped
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 104.21 points,
or 0.76 percent, closing the week at 13,564.51. On Thursday, the
index gained 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 116.08 yen, down 0.28 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.93 yen overnight.
	   Share prices initially moved higher, responding to news that
Mitsui Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank, was to
withdraw from overseas banking as part of restructuring plans.
	   Sentiment later turned bearish, however, as many investors sold
major blue chips, including Sony Corp., traders said. Sony shares
ended the day at 7,400 yen (dlrs 64.35) per share, down 300 yen
(dlrs 2.61) from Thursday's close.
	   Sony, considered one of Japan's strongest companies, reported
earlier this week that its operating profit was down in the six
months ended Sept. 30, blaming the global economic turmoil and the
yen's recent rise against the dollar.
	   The electronics giant also said its group net profit for the
full fiscal year ending March 1999 will come to 170 billion yen
(dlrs 1.48 billion), sharply lower than its earlier projection of
215 billion yen (dlrs 1.87 billion).
	   Traders said the weakness in Sony shares also pulled down other
blue chips, including Toyota Motor, TDK, Kyocera and Canon.
	   Many export-oriented Japanese companies have forecast declines
in earnings for the full fiscal year partly because of poorer
overseas sales caused by the yen's appreciation against the dollar.
	   A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive
abroad, cutting into earnings of exporters.
	   Trading was moderate, with about 362 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Thursday's 295 million shares.
Declines outnumbered advancers 593 to 535, with 143 issues
unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.50 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,035.60. The
TOPIX rose 8.49 points, or 0.83 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 8,495.03 points in Thursday trading, up 123.06.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar slid against the yen as market players
sold the U.S. currency to hedge against further downside risk.
	   Market players had widely expected the greenback to find support
Friday from month-end demand from Japanese investors.
	   But when that failed to materialize, Japanese trust banks,
exporters and life insurers dumped the dollar against the yen,
triggering stop-loss orders to sell dollars further, traders said.
	   The dollar ranged between 114.92 yen and 117.10 yen in Friday's
trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond settled at 0.820 percent, down from Thursday's finish of 0.870
percent. Its price rose to 108.73 yen from the previous day's
108.25 yen.

Naval gunboats repulse Tamil rebel attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Sri Lankan military censors deleted significant portions of
this story. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Naval gunboats fought off a Tamil
Tiger guerrilla attack on a military sea convoy off Sri Lanka's
northeast coast Friday, military officials said.
	   One naval gunboat and more than 10 rebel speed boats were sunk
in the fighting off the rebel town of Mullaittivu, said the
officials, who asked not to be named. Each rebel boat usually
carries a 4-member crew.
	   The convoy was passing Mullaittivu when more than 20 guerrilla
boats attacked, and fought a two-hour battle with escorting
gunboats. One gunboat blew up after it was rammed by a rebel boat
packed with explosives.
	   The area is 280 kilometers (170 miles) northeast of the capital,
Colombo.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils, who claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese who
dominate the government and military. More than 56,000 people have
been killed in the fighting which began in 1983.

Algerian suspect extradited from Switzerland, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ An Algerian suspected of being a leader
of an Islamic fundamentalist group has been deported from
Switzerland nearly a year after he slipped into the country to seek
asylum, a Swiss official said Friday.
	   Ahmed Zaoui was flown from Switzerland to an undisclosed
destination Thursday evening, Jean-Rene Fournier, state councilor
of the southern canton of Valais, confirmed. He told The Associated
Press that Switzerland had found a country that would accept Zaoui.
	   Swiss officials had previously said they would like to deport
Zaoui, formerly a Brussels-based spokesman for Algeria's now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front political party. But they were reluctant to
send him to Algeria because he might be tortured or mistreated
there.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front released a statement late Thursday
protesting the deportation, saying that Zaoui was expelled
``without taking into consideration his wife's sickness or the
infancy of his four children, who were also deported with him to an
unknown area.''
	   Fournier gave no further details.
	   Zaoui had been allowed to remain in Switzerland while his appeal
for asylum was pending. He entered Switzerland from Belgium last
November. He has been charged in France with membership in a
terrorist organization.
	   Last May French judge Roger Le Loire questioned Zaoui in the
presence of Swiss prosecutors, said Juerg Blaser, an official in
the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office.
	   Zaoui is accused by France of using false documents and illegal
trafficking with French identity papers on behalf of the radical
Armed Islamic Group. In 1995 he was convicted in Belgium of playing
a prominent role in a criminal association.
	   French authorities also have accused Zaoui of storing electronic
parts that could have been used to make explosive devices.
	   Last spring Swiss authorities said they were increasing
restrictions on Zaoui, claiming he was using the Internet and other
means to promote violence.
	   Police confiscated his fax machine and forbade him to use the
Internet.
	   In a letter to the Swiss Cabinet, Zaoui claimed he has no links
to violence, but sought an ``honorable political solution'' for
Algeria.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in fighting between
Islamic militants and security forces in Algeria's nearly six-year
insurgency.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government called
off a January 1992 election that the Islamic Salvation Front was
expected to win.

U.N. envoy says Cambodian government receptive to rights reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Human rights abuses in Cambodia
remain serious, but strongman Hun Sen's government has shown a new
willingness to address the problem, the U.N. human rights envoy
said Friday.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's special
representative for human rights in Cambodia, said after an
eight-day visit that Hun Sen and other senior government officials
had agreed in meetings to a review of the Cambodian legal system by
international experts.
	   A positive atmosphere prevailed in the meetings, Hammarberg
said, a marked change from past discussions with Hun Sen's
administration on human rights.
	   ``I felt the response from the authorities was better than
earlier. There were no negative reactions,'' he said. ``They stated
clearly that they are very concerned and that our analysis of the
situation is correct.''
	   Their analysis proved severe as Hammarberg released the United
Nations' latest report Friday about the violence that swept Phnom
Penh when antigovernment demonstrations protesting election results
were broken up by Hun Sen's police.
	   The report details 34 killings investigated by U.N. human rights
workers in August and September. Two were confirmed to be
protesters killed in the police crackdown and 24 were characterized
as part of ``a surge that coincided with the suppression of
opposition protests by security authorities.''
	   ``No direct link can be established between the majority of
these cases and their involvement in the demonstrations,'' the U.N.
report cautioned. ``However, observations of the bodies by (U.N.)
staff and the description of the others based on eyewitness
accounts show that most bear signs of violent death.''
	   The report also stated that 77 protesters were injured in the
crackdown, including 16 who sustained gunshot wounds, 50 people
were arrested by security forces and 53 people have gone missing
since the demonstrations were dispersed.
	   Eighteen of the injured were Buddhist monks who played a
prominent role in the demonstrations, and at least two of the dead
were believed to be monks.
	   Opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
led a slow exodus of opposition lawmakers to Bangkok in the weeks
after the crackdown and have refused to return to Cambodia until
their security is guaranteed in writing.
	   The situation has stalled talks on the formation of the next
government. Hun Sen's party narrowly won the election but needs the
opposition's cooperation to attain the two-thirds vote in
parliament necessary to approve a new administration.
	   Hammarberg was reluctant to comment on the opposition's
concerns, stating only that that he agreed ``it is difficult for
those who want to voice their opinions openly'' inside Cambodia.
	   The U.N. human rights envoy said he would submit a detailed
report to the U.N. General Assembly next week on the human rights
situation in Cambodia.

Officials rule out sabotage as cause of fatal gas explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Authorities ruled out sabotage or
terrorism Friday as the cause of an explosion at a car repair shop
that killed nine people.
	   Oxygen and gas tanks exploded while welding was taking place at
the shop near Kutaisi, Georgia's second-largest city, on Thursday,
said Interior Ministry spokeswoman Maya Musidze.
	   ``A subversive act can be ruled out completely,'' she said.
	   The explosion was so powerful that it damaged dozens of nearby
cars and broke windows in homes, ITAR-Tass said. Eleven people were
injured.
	   Violence flares from time to time in Georgia, mostly in the
separatist region of Abkhazia but also in other areas involving
opponents of President Eduard Shevardnadze.
	   Mutinous soldiers led a one-day revolt against the president on
Oct. 19.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with Tutu criticizing ANC, warning
wrongdoers; RECASTS to raise attacks on report, more on
recommendations; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG (AP) _ The release of a long-awaited report that
was supposed to help heal deep wounds caused by apartheid has
instead caused divisiveness, with both former liberation fighters
and apartheid's main party attacking it.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday published
one of the most important reports ever produced in this nation's
tortured history, laying bare abuses committed during the era of
white minority rule.
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki _ who will likely be elected
president next year _ criticized the commission for failing to
include in its report the African National Congress' response to a
detailed condemnation of abuses it committed while fighting
apartheid, including the torture of dissidents and killing of
civilians.
	   With Mbeki's backing, the ANC unsuccessfully sought in court to
block the report's release.
	   The move angered retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the
anti-apartheid champion who chaired the Truth Commission.
	   ``I didn't struggle in order to remove one set of those who
thought they were tin gods to replace them with others who are
tempted to think they are,'' he told reporters in Pretoria Friday.
	   The National Party, which ruled during apartheid, blasted the
Truth Commission's ``failure to achieve reconciliation.''
	   Compiled after 2 1-2 years of hearings, that is the report's
goal.
	   ``If reconciliation and unity are to become a reality in South
Africa, the energy and commitment of all its people will be
required,'' the 2,750-page report concludes. It urges South
Africans to ``reach out to fellow South Africans in a spirit of
tolerance and understanding.''
	   The report says the president should call a national summit in
1999 to ensure all sectors of society are involved in considering
its recommendations, which include the teaching in schools of human
rights, specifically about racism, gender discrimination and the
rights of children.
	   The report also recommends:
	   _ That the government consider establishing human rights bureaus
in ministries.
	   _ That restitution ``for those who have suffered from ...
apartheid discrimination'' be provided, possibly through a one-time
levy on corporate and private income, or with each company listed
on Johannesburg Stock Exchange making a one-time donation of 1
percent market capitalization.
	   _ That liberation movements apologize to those whose human
rights were abused by those movements while in exile.
	   ``Reconciliation is a process which is never-ending, is costly
and often painful. For this process to develop, it is imperative
that democracy and a human rights culture be consolidated,'' the
report says.
	   But it also calls on the government to consider prosecuting
human rights violators who don't seek amnesty.
	   ``Reconciliation is not saying a wrong has not happened,'' Tutu
said Friday. ``The world is watching and I hope that people are
aware of what happened to (Gen. Augusto) Pinochet.''
	   Spain has sought the former Chilean dictator's extradition from
England to face charges of murder, torture and kidnapping of
political opponents.
	   Tutu conceded wrongdoers could escape justice if deadlines on
prosecution expire.
	   ``They may get away from the judicial (system). They will never
get away from themselves,'' Tutu said.
	   As expected, the report lays the heaviest burden of guilt on
white governments that made non-whites second-class citizens and
ruthlessly crushed dissent.
	   The report, contained in five hard-cover volumes, is sometimes
difficult to read. It gives accounts from thousands of prisoners
who were beaten, given electric shocks and raped during apartheid.
	   Some wounds may be too deep to heal.
	   ``The only thing that really made me break was when they
threatened to kidnap my 4-year-old nephew, Christopher, bring him
to the 13th floor and drop him out the window,'' anti-apartheid
activist Zahrah Narkedien is quoted as testifying in one of the
commissions hearings, which were held across the country.
	   Narkedien said she will never recover from her seven months in
solitary confinement.
	   ``I was damaged. A part of my soul was eaten away as if by
maggots .. and I will never get it back again,'' the report quotes
her as saying.
	   President Nelson Mandela conceded the report would not produce
instant reconciliation.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' said
Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid.
	   Furthermore, some whites will think it is a witch hunt launched
by the black majority now in power, with some blacks seeing it as
an escape route for the minority that oppressed them for so many
years.

Top banks in Japan's Mitsui group plan sweeping restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details on restructuring; ADDS byline;
NOTE Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. takes an ampersand. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest banks announced drastic
restructuring plans Friday, calling for massive job cuts at Sakura
Bank Ltd. and a withdrawal from overseas operations for Mitsui
Trust and Banking Co.
	   Sakura, the core bank of the powerful Mitsui industrial group,
said it will slash 3,000 jobs, or 20 percent of its total work
force, within three years.
	   The cost-cutting move comes as Sakura and many other Japanese
banks scramble to secure funds to write off huge loads of bad loans
amid the country's worst recession since World War II.
	   Less than two months ago, Sakura asked Toyota Motor Corp. and
other Mitsui group members to shore up its eroded capital base with
an emergency infusion of more than 300 billion yen (dlrs 2.59
billion).
	   Kyodo News agency reported Friday that Toyota President Hiroshi
Okuda indicated his company would not necessarily provide the
funds, saying any decision would depend solely on the
attractiveness of the return on its investment.
	   Also Friday, Mitsui Trust said it will close down its overseas
banking operations to focus on domestic asset-management and
retail-trust businesses. Bank branches in Hong Kong, London and New
York will be shuttered by next March, it said.
	   Investors appeared to welcome the news. Shares of Sakura rose
4.30 percent to close at 290 yen (dlrs 2.50), while Mitsui Trust
shares soared 11.8 percent to 152 yen (dlrs dlrs 1.31).
	   In announcing its move, Mitsui Trust officials said they may
seek public funds recently earmarked by the government for
bolstering capital reserves at banks, but said the details of any
request remain undecided.
	   The bank is just the latest Japanese lender to stage a retreat
from foreign markets. Last week, Daiwa Bank Ltd. announced a
similar pullout.
	   Others include a number of regional banks and the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which the government recently
decided to nationalize.
	   Many Japanese financial institutions have been haunted by soured
loans extended before a speculative asset price bubble burst
earlier this decade. The slump in stock and real estate prices was
accompanied by an overall economic downturn which has become
increasingly severe.
	   In addition to the burden imposed by bad loans and falling
profits, Japan's banks also face a challenge from increased
competition as the government carries out promised deregulation of
the financial industry.
	   As part of its restructuring, Mitsui Trust plans to speed up
previously announced job cuts and begin talks with its union to
slash semi-annual bonus payments to bank employees. The salaries of
top executives were trimmed by 10 percent as of this month, it
said.
	   Mitsui Trust has also agreed to link up with Boston-based State
Street Bank and Trust Co. in the field of custody contracts and is
considering expanding the partnership into other areas such as
asset management.
	   At the same time it moves to close its foreign banking
operations, the bank said it may move to set up investment advisory
affiliates in New York and London in line with its new emphasis on
asset management.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
huddled with his security chiefs early Friday to chart the next
stage of a crackdown on Islamic militants that Israel says is a
precondition for a timely West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   In a first response to Thursday's suicide attack on an Israeli
convoy, dozens of activists in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups
were detained, including senior leaders. Security officials said
arrests had continued throughout the night.
	   The founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
remained under house arrest Friday morning. Officers sealed off the
sandy slum streets near Yassin's house in Gaza City and questioned
passers-by. Police informed journalists that they were barred from
speaking to him by telephone.
	   Yassin's telephone was busy throughout the morning and it was
not clear whether security forces had interfered with the line or
whether the Hamas leader was in constant contact with the outside.
	   Arafat ordered the arrests in response to the suicide attack at
a busy Gaza junction in which an Islamic militant rammed an
explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep escorting a
red-and-white bus carrying Israeli school children.
	   The 40 students on board were saved _ not a single one was hurt
_ but the car bomb killed an Israeli soldier in the jeep, a
19-year-old immigrant from Ukraine now being praised as a fallen
hero. The assailant also died, and his identity remained a mystery.
The car was registered to man from the Gaza Strip town of Khan
Yunis who said he had sold it a day before the attack.
	   Political reverberations from the first suicide attack on
Israelis in six months were swift.
	   Coming only six days after the signing of a land-for-security
agreement in Washington, it was a destabilizing new factor in what
is already a highly delicate prelude to implementing the accord.
That process is to start next week.
	   Blocking the pact is the avowed goal of Hamas, which bitterly
opposes any peace with Israel. Hamas has carried out attacks that
have killed scores of Israelis.
	   Israel's government said it was too early to judge Arafat's
campaign against Hamas. ``If this is a harbinger of a new policy,
then we would certainly welcome it. If it's a repeat of short-term,
sporadic activity against Hamas, then we still have a very severe
problem,'' said government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   Fogel said Palestinian security forces must confiscate illegal
weapons and dismantle the infrastructure of the Hamas military
wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Arafat that the
Palestinians would have to wage all-our war against terrorists if
they wanted Israel to withdraw troops in the West Bank, as
stipulated in the agreement.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu indefinitely postponed a Cabinet
session that was to ratify the peace agreement. Officials in his
office said Friday that it was not clear whether the regularly
scheduled weekly Cabinet meeting would take place on Sunday.
	   However, there were some signs that Thursday's bombings had not
harmed the fragile new relationship between the Netanyahu
government and the Palestinian Authority too badly.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet next week with
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, in what Israel radio described as
the beginning of negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, confirmed that the meeting
was planned, but said that ``we won't label it the beginning of
final status talks.''
	   The negotiations were formally launched in May 1996, but were
suspended when Netanyahu took office later that month.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Arafat and his security chiefs met
until early Friday to map the next stages of their campaign. Arafat
is walking a fine line between trying to save the peace agreement
with Israel and risking a Palestinian civil war.
	   The decision to put Yassin under house arrest was a stunning
move by Arafat, who in the year since Yassin's release from an
Israeli jail has bent over backward to avoid open conflict with
him.
	   Yassin, who has a relatively small but extraordinarily devout
following, customarily disavows direct knowledge of actions by
Hamas' military arm and tries to play down any rivalry with Arafat.
	   Earlier in the day, he said the group did not want a bloody
confrontation with the Palestinian Authority.
	   However, a Hamas official in the West Bank said the group saw
itself targeted by the new peace agreement, which calls on Arafat
to crack down hard on Islamic militants. In launching attacks, the
official said, Hamas feels it has nothing left to lose.

Report: Chinese coal mine accidents kill 157 in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Accidents in Chinese coal mines killed
157 people in October, state media said Friday.
	   Three accidents killed more than 30 miners each, and three more
killed at least 10 people, newspapers and the official Xinhua News
Agency said. They did not say where the accidents occurred or give
any other details.
	   Deaths are common in Chinese coal mines, many of which have only
rudimentary safety and ventilation equipment. Their fatality rate
is reported to be much higher than in comparable mines in other
countries.
	   The deaths in October prompted Chinese officials to issue an
urgent message calling on mine operators to adopt stringent safety
measures, the news reports said.

Congolese rebels say they infiltrated key government camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila said on Friday they had penetrated the southern
government air base and military camp at Kamina.
	   ``We have infiltrated the town. Our troops are fighting,'' said
rebel military spokesman Bob Ngoy. He offered no details, and the
report could not be confirmed independently.
	   If true, fighting for Kamina, 960 kilometers (600 miles)
southwest of eastern rebel stronghold at Goma and deep inside the
copper-rich Katanga Province, would prove a major blow for
government's efforts to stop rebel advances.
	   On Thursday, rebel military commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said
difficult terrain and huge distances in Africa's third largest
nation were the only obstacle to rebel movements.
	   Since they took up arms Aug. 2, the rebels have made steady
advances in eastern Congo but were defeated outside the capital,
Kinshasa, by Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
	   Katanga is Kabila's home province, but many rebel troops and
commanders are from that area too.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels,
accusing them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. Both
countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern
Congo, and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Rwanda has also accused Kabila of training at Kamina at least
10,000 former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who were responsible for
the genocide of more than 500,000 minority Rwandan Tutsis in 1994.

Philippine Long Distance Telephone may announce buy-in shortly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hong Kong-based First Pacific Co. is
in talks with Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. over the
purchase of a stake in the Philippines' largest telecommunications
company, an official said Friday.
	   ``Discussions are going on, but we haven't crossed the line
where we have to disclose anything,'' PLDT spokesman Antonio Samson
said.
	   Several Manila newspapers, quoting unidentified sources,
reported Friday that PLDT is close to finalizing negotiations for
First Pacific to acquire a large stake in PLDT that would give
First Pacific management control.
	   Samson said the newspaper reports were based on speculation.
But, pressed further for comment, Samson acknowledged that they
``have the right names.''
	   The reports also said PLDT president and chief executive Antonio
Cojuangco has agreed to resign and that First Pacific would buy his
10 percent stake in the company. ABS-CBN television said
Cojuangco's severance package was one of the few remaining issues
to settle.
	   Asked if a foreign bidder plans to take over PLDT, Samson
replied: ``I don't know if takeover is the right word.'' He
declined to elaborate.
	   Samson said PLDT plans to make an announcement on the issue over
the next two weeks. The company earlier said that an announcement
would be made in the next four to six weeks to bring to a close
several weeks of takeover speculation that have boosted PLDT's
share price.
	   PLDT's shares have swung wildly since it launched in early
September a ``poison pill'' plan to deter a hostile takeover, which
was abandoned earlier this week.
	   PLDT closed at 965 pesos (dlrs 23.83), down 20 pesos (50 cents)
from the previous session's close. The stock reached an intraday
high of 1,000 pesos (dlrs 25.70) before profit-taking set in.
	   PLDT chief finance officer Edgardo del Fonso in an earlier
interview said the company was also talking to other foreign
companies interested in a buy-in, among them Southwest Bell Corp.
of the United States.
	   PLDT and its cellular phone unit, Pilipino Telephone Corp., are
the only local telephone companies that haven't taken foreign
partners since the government liberalized the industry in 1993.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Citing poor health, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat plans to retire as early as February after the
implementation of the recent land-for-security agreement with
Israel, a newspaper said Friday.
	   The leftist Beirut newspaper, Al-Kifah Al-Arabi, said Arafat
told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last week that he wants to
quit because of ``poor health and extreme weakness.''
	   The newspaper quoted Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo, where the
two leaders met.
	   Arafat, 68, has been dogged by persistent rumors of failing
health but the Palestinians have dismissed the speculation as
subversive propaganda.
	   Hassan Asfour, a top negotiator, repeated that response Friday.
	   It is ``illogical'' to say that Arafat will quit because of
health problems since he was fully fit during negotiations with the
Israelis at the Wye Plantation, Asfour told The Associated Press.
	   ``He was in better shape than all of us. And remains to be,'' he
said.
	   Arafat has been variously reported to be suffering from
Parkinson's disease and depression, and is often seen on TV looking
pale and tired, his lower lip trembling and his hands shaking.
	   This is not the first time reports of his imminent resignation
have appeared in the Arab press.
	   Kuwait's Al-Watan Al-Arabi published a similar report on
Thursday and Egypt's government-owned Al-Gomhuriya said as far back
as in June that Arafat will hand over interim power after signing
the deal to Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, or Salim Zaanoun, head of the Palestine National Council.
	   In its Friday's report, Al-Kifah Al-Arabi suggested a similar
transition of power after the end of the implementation of the
agreement.
	   Under the accord signed in Washington Oct. 23, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The clock starts ticking Nov. 2. However, target dates on
Palestinian-Israeli agreements have proved elusive in the past as
implementation hit snags.
	   Arafat, whose name has become synonymous with the Palestinian
struggle for their national rights, plans to leave the Palestinian
self-rule areas and set up residence in Cairo and Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, the Al-Kifah Al-Arabi said. He will occasionally visit Gaza
and the West Bank, it said.

Hong Kong share prices surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KIONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Friday, with
the key index rising 2.3 percent on the back of an overnight rally
on Wall Street.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng index rose 223.48 points to 10,154.94,
its highest close since May 5. On Thursday, the index had slipped
4.4 points.
	   Turnovever amounted to 8.73 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.1 billion), little changed from Thursday's 8.59 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.0 billion).
	   Brokers said the index surged through the 10,000-point barrier
shortly after the market opened in reaction to Thursday's gains on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 123.06
points _ or nearly 1.5 percent _ to close at 8,495.03.
	   Local shares were also boosted by expectations of further cuts
in interest rates in the United States and Hong Kong, brokers said.
	   After the market closed, the Hong Kong Association of Banks
announced that it was leaving interest rates unchanged.
	   Leading Hong Kong banks lowered their prime lending rate by 0.25
percentage point to 9.75 percent earlier this month.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 3.25 Hong Kong
dollars to 54.00, and Cheung Kong rose 75 cents to 53.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 2.00 dollars to
177.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.50 dollars to 67.00.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 3.30 dollars to 41.10, and
Hutchison Whampoa rose 2.50 dollars to 55.50.

Kenyan injured milking elephant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A farmer who tried to milk an elephant was
hospitalized Friday with two broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder.
	   The elephant, which had been browsing with her calf, was angered
Thursday by the unwanted attentions of Peter Baraza, 21, the Daily
Nation reported.
	   After Baraza had managed to collect a pint of milk, the elephant
tossed him away, knocking the wind out of him.
	   Baraza struggled to escape by climbing a nearby tree, but the
elephant used her trunk to uprooted it with one violent tug, then
shook the tree while the farmer clung to a branch.
	   Finally, the elephant flung the tree _ and Baraza _ to the
ground, then stomped off to protect her calf, which had been
surrounded by women who were screaming frantically to distract the
mother.
	   The incident occurred in Nyahururu, 150 kilometers (95 miles)
northwest of the capital.

	   ``He was in better shape than all of us. And remains to be,'' he
said.
	   Arafat has been variously reported to be suffering from
Parkinson's disease and depression, and is often seen on TV looking
pale and tired, his lower lip trembling and his hands shaking.
	   This is not the first time reports of his imminent resignation
have appeared in the Arab press.
	   Kuwait's Al-Watan Al-Arabi published a similar report on
Thursday and Egypt's government-owned Al-Gomhuriya said as far back
as in June that Arafat will hand over interim power after signing
the deal to Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, or Salim Zaanoun, head of the Palestine National Council.
	   In its Friday's report, Al-Kifah Al-Arabi suggested a similar
transition of power after the end of the implementation of the
agreement.
	   Under the accord signed in Washington Oct. 23, Israel is to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   The clock starts ticking Nov. 2. However, target dates on
Palestinian-Israeli agreements have proved elusive in the past as
implementation hit snags.
	   Arafat, whose name has become synonymous with the Palestinian
struggle for their national rights, plans to leave the Palestinian
self-rule areas and set up residence in Cairo and Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, the Al-Kifah Al-Arabi said. He will occasionally visit Gaza
and the West Bank, it said.

Police break up protest outside Beijing's city hall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A small but determined group of protesters
shouted for Beijing's mayor to come out and hear their pleas Friday
in another of the increasingly frequent public displays of
dissatisfaction over housing in the Chinese capital.
	   About 30 people, many pushing their bicycles, gathered outside a
government complaints office and then moved from there to Beijing's
city hall before police made them leave.
	   Protesters complained that they were forced to move into new
apartments in distant suburbs after their traditional
courtyard-style homes in the city were demolished more than a year
ago to make way for redevelopment.
	   ``It takes three to four hours just to get the children to
school,'' said one disgruntled middle-aged man who did not give his
name for fear of official reprisals.
	   ``Let's go Tiananmen,'' a woman proposed to fellow protesters,
referring to the square in the city's heart that was the site of
massive pro-democracy protests in 1989.
	   ``Tiananmen's our home, we don't have any other home,'' she
said.
	   Despite the risk of arrest for violating a ban on public
dissent, there have been increasing numbers of protests in recent
years, often over housing or over wages or pensions left unpaid by
bankrupt state-run factories that are being closed down.
	   Outside the arched gates of Beijing's city government offices,
the protesters shouted about three or four times for Mayor Jia
Qinglin to come out and meet them.
	   They milled outside the gate for about 15 minutes, slowing but
not stopping passing rush-hour traffic, before dozens of police in
green uniforms formed a belt around them and cajoled them politely
but firmly to move on.
	   ``They don't take any notice of us,'' one woman grumbled as she
walked away pushing her bicycle.

Marseille bus drivers strike after new attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Bus drivers in the southern part of
this port city walked off the job Friday to protest a lack of
security following a new attack on a driver.
	   On Thursday evening, a driver was beaten by a passenger who was
demanding to get off between regular stops.
	   There was virtually no bus service in the southern part of
Marseille Friday morning, but service was normal in other parts of
the city.
	   A number of French cities have experienced similar strikes in
recent weeks, as drivers become increasingly angry over what they
see as a lack of support from the government in the face of
worsening youth violence.
	   The rising crime is blamed on youths from working-class suburbs,
who've been hit hard by double-digit unemployment. While the
national jobless rate is 11.7 percent, the rate can top 50 percent
in some neighborhoods.

Yeltsin goes on vacation, aide says he will voluntarily cut his

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin leaving for Sochi after meeting with
Primakov, CORRECT day in lead. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An exhausted Boris Yeltsin left for a Black Sea
vacation on Friday, and a senior aide said the Russian president
would formally restrict his political powers early next year.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday to receive treatment and recover from what doctors said was
extreme fatigue and unstable blood pressure.
	   The president's condition forced him to abruptly cancel a
scheduled trip to Austria, renewing concern about his ability to
serve the rest of his term ending in the summer 2000.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has remained largely out of public view since the
country was hit by an economic crisis in mid-August, and his deputy
chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev acknowledged earlier this week that the
president had turned control over the economy to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   On Friday, Sysuyev went a step further, saying that the
president would formally announce his reduced political role in a
speech to parliament early next year.
	   Yeltsin feels comfortable giving the new Cabinet responsibility
for day-to-day government affairs because it was formed with
parliament's support, the Financial Times of London quoted Sysuyev
as saying.
	   ``The political situation in Russia has changed,'' Sysuyev said.
``In the past, the president engaged in every aspect of running the
country.''
	   He added that Yeltsin would serve the rest of his term and must
preserve his constitutional powers to ensure that the next
presidential elections are democratic.
	   Communists and other Yeltsin opponents have demanded his early
resignation and immediate changes in the constitution to curb the
president's sweeping powers. The Communist Party leadership was
meeting on Friday to discuss their election strategy.
	   Several months before Yeltsin's latest illness and the economic
crisis, the Communist-led opposition in parliament has started an
impeachment campaign against the president. The campaign is widely
expected to fizzle like previous such attempts.
	   A poll by the independent Public Opinion Foundation found 75
percent of Russians supported impeaching Yeltsin, while 16 percent
opposed it.
	   The poll, conducted on Oct. 17 among 1,500 people throughout the
country, gave no margin of error.
	   Before leaving for a two-week vacation to the Black Sea resort
of Sochi, Yeltsin met with Primakov to hear discuss the European
Union meeting in Austria, which the prime minister attended Tuesday
in place of the president.
	   Primakov also briefed Yeltsin about his talks Thursday with the
leader of breakaway Chechnya and other issues, the Interfax news
agency said.

Russia collects more taxes in October
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government collected more taxes in
October than in September, a rare bit of good news for a country
struggling to overcome an economic crisis, the tax chief announced
Friday.
	   Russians _ many reluctantly _ paid 13 billion rubles (dlrs 812
million) in taxes so far this month, up from 9.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 581 million) in September, said Georgy Boos, head of Russia's
Federal Tax Service.
	   Boos said that was well over his October target of 9.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 593 million).
	   Collecting taxes has been a chronic problem for the Russian
government. But it's been even tougher in the past few months
because of the financial crisis that erupted in mid-August and
lower revenues from Russian oil companies due to a drop in world
oil prices.
	   One of Russia's big oil companies, Sibneft, disclosed Friday
that it suffered a loss of dlrs 60.4 million in the first half of
this year, compared with a net profit of dlrs 13.7 million a year
ago.
	   Sibneft said it could not count on a rebound in oil prices ``to
restore profitability'' and laid off 5,468 employees _ 10 percent
of its workforce _ to cut costs.
	   The Russian government has been counting on further installments
from an International Monetary Fund loan to help cover its budget
shortfall.
	   The IMF froze payments on the dlrs 22.6 billion loan after the
crisis hit. It says it wants to study the government's plan to cope
with the crisis before releasing any more money.
	   The plan, presented to an IMF delegation on Wednesday, calls for
greater government involvement in the economy.
	   It includes such things as tighter currency controls, price
controls on medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help
the country through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to
compensate Russians for rising inflation.
	   It would also lower some taxes, but tighten the rules in hopes
of making more people pay.
	   The government insists it will not face food shortages this
winter, although the agriculture minister said Thursday that Russia
was holding ``consultations'' with the United States about
humanitarian aid.

Algerian suspect extradited from Switzerland, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 5th, 6th grafs with official confirming Zaoui's
family deported, Switzerland to pay part of his living costs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ An Algerian suspected of being a leader
of an Islamic fundamentalist group has been deported from
Switzerland nearly a year after he slipped into the country to seek
asylum, a Swiss official said Friday.
	   Ahmed Zaoui was flown from Switzerland to an undisclosed
destination Thursday evening, Jean-Rene Fournier, state councilor
of the southern canton of Valais, confirmed. He told The Associated
Press that Switzerland had found a country that would accept Zaoui.
	   Swiss officials had previously said they would like to deport
Zaoui, formerly a Brussels-based spokesman for Algeria's now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front political party. But they were reluctant to
send him to Algeria because he might be tortured or mistreated
there.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front released a statement late Thursday
protesting the deportation, saying that Zaoui was expelled
``without taking into consideration his wife's sickness or the
infancy of his four children, who were also deported with him to an
unknown area.''
	   Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Viktor Schlumpf confirmed that
Zaoui was deported with his family on a charter aircraft.
	   He also declined to identify the destination, but said
Switzerland committed itself to paying part of the family's living
costs.
	   Zaoui had been allowed to remain in Switzerland while his appeal
for asylum was pending. He entered Switzerland from Belgium last
November. He has been charged in France with membership in a
terrorist organization.
	   Last May French judge Roger Le Loire questioned Zaoui in the
presence of Swiss prosecutors, said Juerg Blaser, an official in
the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office.
	   Zaoui is accused by France of using false documents and illegal
trafficking with French identity papers on behalf of the radical
Armed Islamic Group. In 1995 he was convicted in Belgium of playing
a prominent role in a criminal association.
	   French authorities also have accused Zaoui of storing electronic
parts that could have been used to make explosive devices.
	   Last spring Swiss authorities said they were increasing
restrictions on Zaoui, claiming he was using the Internet and other
means to promote violence.
	   Police confiscated his fax machine and forbade him to use the
Internet.
	   In a letter to the Swiss Cabinet, Zaoui claimed he has no links
to violence, but sought an ``honorable political solution'' for
Algeria.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in fighting between
Islamic militants and security forces in Algeria's nearly six-year
insurgency.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government called
off a January 1992 election that the Islamic Salvation Front was
expected to win.

Two U.S. servicemen in custody in another hit-and-run on Okinawa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two U.S. servicemen were arrested in Okinawa on
suspicion of injuring a man in a hit-and-run accident Friday, just
weeks after a U.S. Marine was charged in an accident there that
killed a teen-ager.
	   A Marine corporal and an Air Force staff sergeant were driving
an official military van that allegedly hit a man on a moped Friday
morning, said spokesman Capt. Bret Curtis.
	   The man suffered a bruised hand, but no serious injuries.
	   The two servicemen, accused of fleeing the scene of the accident
in Naha, Okinawa's capital, were later arrested by Japanese police,
Curtis said. Naha is 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   The accident comes amid an edgy political climate on the
southern island since the death of 18-year-old Yuki Uema on Oct. 14
from injuries stemming from the earlier accident.
	   U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Indiana,
has been charged with hit-and-run and drunken driving in the Oct. 7
accident. His trial has been set for Nov. 18.
	   Residents of Okinawa, where most of the American troops in Japan
are stationed, have long resented the U.S. military presence, and
crime is an especially touchy issue.
	   ``We are offering our regrets. This is a serious incident,''
Curtis said. ``This is not the way Marines behave.''
	   The man hurt in Friday's accident, Hitoshi Nakaoji, 27, a bank
employee, suffered a bruise on his left hand when his small
motorcycle turned over, Okinawa police spokesman Katsuya Matayoshi
said.
	   The van also crashed into two parked cars and was later found
abandoned in a parking lot a kilometer (half a mile) away, Curtis
said.
	   Hiromu Nonaka, Japan's chief government spokesman, was quoted by
Kyodo News service as making a request to U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Foley to ensure that the U.S. military enforce stricter discipline
to prevent such accidents.
	   Foley has expressed condolences for the earlier hit-and-run and
met with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.

Silk factory worker dies in operating loom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A silk factory worker trying to fix a
thread was dragged into a loom and killed, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   The 36-year-old employee at the Darnytsia silk factory in Kiev
died from suffocation when her chest was squeezed by the machine's
parts, the daily Fakty reported.
	   The accident apparently occurred after the woman decided not to
wait for another worker to bring the required tools to put the
weaving thread in the right position, and tried to fix it manually,
Fakty said.

Prosecutor: Yavlinksy could be charged with libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky is
being investigated on possible libel charges for alleging the
present Russian Cabinet is just as prone to corruption as its
predecessors, the country's chief prosecutor said Friday.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said he has ordered a
preliminary investigation, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Yavlinsky was quoted Wednesday as telling the London Daily
Telegraph that ``corruption can determine who gets what position,''
in Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government. ``My people inside
the government tell me you can buy offices for money.''
	   He gave no names. But in similar comments to reporters in Moscow
he did mention First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, a
Communist Party member and a staunch defender of the
military-industrial complex, and Deputy Prime Minister Gennady
Kulik, a defender of state farms.
	   Yavlinksy did not directly accuse either official of corruption,
saying he simply wanted the public to be aware of the problem.
	   The prosecutor general said Yavlinksy would be summoned to his
office to explain his remarks.
	   ``If real facts are presented, we will start a criminal case and
an appropriate legal evaluation will be made,'' Skuratov said. ``If
the facts are not proven, we will have to assess Yavlinsky's
remarks legally.''
	   ``Such statements must be made carefully, especially by
politicians,'' Skuratov said.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, is one of Russia's leading politicians and a
presidential hopeful. He was the one who first suggested Primakov's
candidacy for prime minister after the latest economic crisis hit
in August, leading to the previous Cabinet's ouster.
	   Maslyukov's office rejected Yavlinksy's comments as ``malicious
lies'' and Primakov's chief of staff, Yuri Zubakov, said the prime
minister is bent on eradicating corruption.
	   Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov also called on Yavlinsky
to give specifics _ or face a possible lawsuit for libel.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ At least 60 people died early Friday
when fire raced through a building jammed with hundreds of
teen-agers attending an immigrant association's discotheque dance
in Sweden's second-largest city. About 180 others were injured,
many of them seriously.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' rescue
service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing the
sight when rescuers entered the building.
	   It was the deadliest fire in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20
people died in a fire in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases produced by the
inferno. The injured toll was lowered slightly to 180, including
seven people who were taken to burn treatment centers for emergency
care.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the two-story brick
building. The dance was on the second floor.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. The 60th
victim died at a hospital.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause was not immediately known. ``What we know is that
there was an explosion,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson
said.
	   Olin said there were signs the fire was set. ``The fact that it
spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,'' he said.
	   By 10 a.m., forensics experts were already sifting through the
charred building in search of clues.
	   Apparently the Macedonian Association allowed the building to be
used for the dance, police said, but did not organize it
specifically as an activity for its community.
	   The dance was for young people to celebrate Halloween and a
holiday weekend. The crowd was mostly aged about 13 to 18.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told the national Swedish news agency TT that he
was on the dance floor when the blaze started.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``It was chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people
trampled on each other on the way to the exit.... Others kicked out
the windows and jumped out,'' said Fawz, who estimated there were
about 400 people inside.
	   Olin said the building was inspected by the rescue service in
April 1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as emergency
exits and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg, with about 435,000 people, is on the country's west
coast about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.

Criminals try to blow up TV center in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ An explosion in Georgia's breakaway
region of Abkhazia was an attempt to blow up a TV center, a duty
officer at the Interior Ministry said Friday.
	   Someone tried to blow up the Sukhumi TV center late Thursday,
but the explosion went off nearby instead, the duty officer said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Another blast went off 10 minutes later, the duty officer said.
	   No one was hurt, but a bus was seriously damaged.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province, declared independence after
driving out Georgian government forces in 1993 following the end of
a 13-month war. Despite the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in
1994, sporadic violence continues.

Cabinet may debate on Wye accord Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet will vote on the new peace
accord with the Palestinians on Sunday if the Palestinians submit
their security plan to the United States by then, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Friday.
	   If the plan is not ready by Sunday, the peace agreement will not
be discussed by the ministers, but the Cabinet session will be held
in any event, according to the office of Netanyahu's spokesman,
Aviv Bushinsky.
	   Hassan Asfour, a top Palestinian negotiator, said Friday the
Palestinian plan would be presented on Monday as scheduled. ``There
are no problems on security arrangements,'' he said.
	   The security plan is to cover efforts by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority to stop extremists from carrying out attacks
against Israel. The Wye River accord lists steps including arrest
of suspected terrorists and confiscation of illegal weapons.
	   Israel has been demanding an all-out Palestinian struggle
against terrorism in return for carrying out its part of the deal,
handing over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian
civilian control.
	   The Cabinet was originally scheduled to vote on the accord last
Thursday, but the meeting was canceled. The Israelis said they had
reason to believe that the Palestinian security plan would not be
submitted on time.

U.N. rights expert expresses `frustration' over Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Japan has made little progress on key human rights
issues over the last five years, the head of the U.N. Human Rights
Committee said Friday.
	   ``None of the recommendations of the committee, notably those on
the death penalty, have been followed with action,'' French rights
expert Christine Chanet told a news conference.
	   The 18-member committee reviewing adherence to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on Thursday finished
considering Japan's latest report.
	   Although the covenant doesn't exclude the use of the death
penalty, Japan has done nothing to cut the number of crimes covered
by it, Chanet said.
	   Last week, a former member of the doomsday cult blamed for the
1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway was sentenced to death
for the slayings of four people.
	   Chanet said she was disappointed that the Japanese delegation
defended the country's use of the death penalty on the grounds that
public opinion supported it.
	   ``I found a little frustration on their position,'' she said.
``The really unanimous conclusion is that there has been no
movement for five years.''
	   However, Chanet said Japan has made positive moves toward gender
equality, an in promoting the rights of the Ainu people and
abolishing the forced sterilization of disabled women.
	   The committee, which periodically reviews the reports of each of
some 140 governments who have ratified the accord, will publish its
final conclusions next month.
	   Also this week, the Human Rights Committee reviewed Libya's
latest report.
	   Questioned about minority rights and allegations of torture, the
Libyan delegation gave ``very general and very aggressive''
answers, Chanet said. ``They still have the same rigid approach.''
	   But Libya has made some progress, especially in the area of
education and work opportunities for women, she added.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with monitors urging KLA to keep roads open;
 &UR; AP Photos Planned
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International monitors are urging
ethnic Albanian rebels to allow traffic to flow freely in Kosovo to
improve prospects for a negotiated settlement now that police and
army units have largely withdrawn and fighting has stopped.
	   The Albanian language newspaper Koha Ditore reported Friday that
members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission met Wednesday
with Kosovo Liberation Army commanders to urge them not to impede
traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to the newspaper, the monitors told the rebels that
Serb police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under
the Oct. 12 agreement between President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   It appeared the monitors were trying to reassure the rebels that
the limited presence of Serb police does not necessarily mean the
government is violating the peace agreement or that they represent
a major threat to ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   International envoys are hoping that if they can keep the lid on
the tense province, most of the thousands of refugees will return
to homes they fled after Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists Feb. 28.
	   So far, however, only a few ethnic Albanians have returned home.
Those interviewed in makeshift encampments say police or soldiers
are still in the area, or their houses were unlivable because of
war damage.
	   ``The return is not as easy as was expected,'' said Jacques
Franquin of the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched a February
crackdown in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat of
airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for
Milosevic to fully comply.
	   The deal also calls on the Serbs to facilitate the return of
some 300,000 refugees, half of them abroad and the other half
scattered over the troubled province.
	   But many refugees remain deeply suspicious that not enough
Serbian forces have pulled out. Tough talk on Thursday by Serb
government officials in Belgrade did nothing to alleviate their
concerns.
	   Vojislaw Seselj, Serbia's deputy premier, vowed to continue the
government's fight against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo despite
the withdrawals.
	   He insisted that the substantial police pullout of government
forces from Kosovo, as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would
give up its struggle against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would ``defend themselves as
they have done so far.''
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, and a
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into the Pristina barracks on Thursday
from positions 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers were positioned outside Junik, near the mountain
border with Albania.
	   Refugees said the continued police presence shows the failure of
the agreement.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' complained Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and
father of 11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about 5
kilometers (2 miles) from his village, Perceva.
	   Since the withdrawal, land mines and booby traps set by Serb
forces have been tripped and reports of sporadic violence continue.
The Serb Media Center reported Thursday that two pro-Serb Albanians
had been killed by the guerrillas in separate incidents. There was
no way to independently verify the report.

Energy company official freed in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The chief engineer of a regional energy company
was among the hostages freed during a crackdown on kidnappers in
breakaway Chechnya, a news agency reported Friday.
	   Valery Molsky, chief engineer of the Ingushenergo company, was
kidnapped in Ingushetia on June 23 and taken to neighboring
Chechnya, ITAR-Tass said. he was freed Thursday.
	   The kidnappings and other crimes that have been rampant in
Chechnya since the end of its 1994-96 war with Russia often spill
over into neighboring regions.
	   Police said a powerful explosive device was found and defused
Thursday night in Dagestan, which also borders Chechnya. ITAR-Tass
said it was found in an abandoned house near a Russian border
guards' office.
	   Chechen authorities recently launched a crackdown on

Asian stock markets close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, but bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where the key index fell on worries over Japanese corporate
earnings.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 104.21
points, or 0.76 percent, closing the week at 13,564.51. On
Thursday, the index gained 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent.
	   Share prices initially moved higher, responding to news that
Mitsui Trust and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank, was to
withdraw from overseas banking as part of restructuring plans.
	   Sentiment later turned bearish, however, as many investors sold
major blue chips.
	   Many export-oriented Japanese companies have forecast declines
in earnings for the full fiscal year partly because of poorer
overseas sales caused by the yen's appreciation against the dollar.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 116.08 yen, down 0.28 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.93 yen overnight.
	   Philippine shares rose sharply to a new three-month high, as the
peso's steady gain on the dollar spurred across-the-board buying,
traders said.
	   The peso crossed the key 40.50-level to the dollar Friday,
stoking expectations of a further softening in domestic interest
rates.
	   The dollar averaged 40.398 pesos for the day, down from
Thursday's average of 40.831 pesos.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index soared 86.08
points, or 5.2 percent, to 1,755.04, stretching its rally to a
seventh day.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher, with the key
index rising 2.3 percent on the back of an overnight rally on Wall
Street.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng index rose 223.48 points to 10,154.94,
its highest close since May 5. On Thursday, the index had slipped
4.4 points.
	   Brokers said the index surged through the 10,000-point barrier
shortly after the market opened in reaction to Thursday's gains on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 123.06
points _ or nearly 1.5 percent _ to close at 8,495.03.
	   South Korean prices also soared, with the key index closing 3.9
percent on the back of the yen's rise against the dollar as well as
on the International Monetary Fund's relatively optimistic forecast
on the South Korea's economy.
	   A stronger yen boosts South Korean stocks because local
exporters gain better price competitiveness against their Japanese
rivals in the global market.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 14.45 points to
384.75.
	   Thai shares prices slumped as investors took profits following
three consecutive sessions of gains. The Stock Exchange of Thailand
index fell 13.78 points, or 3.9 percent, to 331.29.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher on expectations of another
imminent round of interest rate cuts by local banks. The Straits
Times Index rose 1.6 percent, or 18.97 points, to 1,204.62.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher as investors were encouraged
by the release of a batch of solid corporate earnings. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 84.57 points, or 1.2 percent,
to 7,101.46.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The NZSE-40
capital Index rose 13.95 points, or 0.7 percent, 1,878.55.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed sharply higher, with
index rising to his highest closing level since the middle of
August. The All Ordinaries Index rose 30 points, or 1.1 percent, to
2,647.3.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on continued selling in
blue-chip issues as the market anticipates forthcoming corporate
results to be poor. The Composite Index fell 8.642 points, or 2.8
percent, to 300.77.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mixed. The benchmark
Composite Index slipped 1.02 points, or 0.2 percent, to 405.33.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
	   ``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local
rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio,
describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building in
Goteborg, a city of half a million people on the country's west
coast.
	   The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978,
when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
	   ``We are still searching the building ... but so far we have
found 60 dead,'' Goteborg police official Jan Edmundson said on
national radio.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases. The injured toll was
lowered slightly to 180, but included seven people who needed
treatment at emergency burn centers.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the two-story brick
building. The dance was on the second floor.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. The 60th
victim died at a hospital.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were signs that the fire was set. ``The fact
that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire,''
he said.
	   The Swedish news agency TT reported 190 people were taken to
hospitals with injuries, and about 20 were in intensive care. Seven
of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter to burn
clinics in other cities, the report said. Goteborg is about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in
building of the local Macedonian Association, which organized the
dance. The crowd in the second story of the building contained
mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday
weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Olin said the rescue service inspected the building in April
1997 and ``fulfilled all possible demands as far as emergency exits
and the possibility for fast evacuation.''
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

Strong earthquakes rock northeastern Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two undersea earthquakes rocked
southeastern parts of Indonesia early Friday, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties.
	   The first quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, struck at
1:08 a.m. (1608 GMT Thursday), and was centered on Maluku Sea,
about 165 kilometers southeast of Bitung on Sulawesi Island, the
Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said.
	   The second, magnitude 5.2 earthquake came five hours later, also
centered on the Maluku Sea, about 140 kilometers 87 miles)
southwest of Ternate, an island in northern Maluku.
	   The quakes were the latest in a series shaking the region since
last Saturday. An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage in populated areas.

Greek culture minister: legal fight not over for Archimedes text
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek Orthodox clerics will not abandon
legal efforts to reclaim the only known copy of writings by ancient
Greek scholar Archimedes, which was auctioned off for dlrs 2
million to an American collector.
	   Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who had tried to organize
a winning auction bid, said Friday that lawyers will pursue claims
that the 1,000-year-old volume was stolen from a monastery operated
by Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.
	   All but four works, including the Archimedes text, were
transferred to Athens from the monastery library in Constantinople
_ present-day Istanbul _ following World War I. The Archimedes
volume was previously held in monasteries in the Middle East.
	   The 174-leaf manuscript, known as the Archimedes Palimpsest,
contains the notes and calculations for two of the most famous
theories by the 3rd century BC mathematician and inventor: ``On
Floating Bodies'' and ``Method of Mechanical Theorems.''
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful.
	   But the copy of the Archimedes text is still legible. Some
experts believe modern scanning methods could extract previously
unseen details.
	   The Patriarchate had sought to block the Thursday auction at
Christie's in New York. But a federal court judge refused, saying
the seller _ a French family _ had clear title to sell the
manuscript.
	   Neither the name of the family or the American buyer were
released by Christie's.
	   Greek officials had appealed to Greek businesses and foundations
to contribute to a fund to compete in the auction. But Venizelos
said they bowed out of the competition once the bidding approached
dlrs 2 million. With the auction house fees, the final price
reached about dlrs 2.2 million.
	   The Greek envoy at the auction described the American bidder as
``very aggressive.''
	   ``The Culture Ministry could not compete with a rich American,''
the culture minister said.
	   Venizelos and other Greek leaders have insisted the Archimedes
text is part of the nation's heritage. If the Patriarchate wins its
legal challenge, the text would be given to Athens' National
Library, Greek officials have said.

Death toll from runaway rail car collision rises to 26
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new fatal train-bus accident. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll from a collision between five
runaway rail cars and a bus rose to 26 on Friday when two more
people died in a hospital, a news agency reported.
	   Seventeen people remain in the hospital, one in grave condition,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting doctors.
	   The accident occurred Monday at an unmanned railroad crossing in
Khabarovsk, about 6,100 kilometers (3,800 miles) east Moscow.
	   Five rail cars carrying concrete panels and other construction
material broke away from a train, accelerated down a hill and
struck a bus, splitting it in half.
	   Transport officials said negligence was to blame and were
investigating the engineer of the locomotive that had pulled the
wagons.
	   In a separate accident Friday, a train collided with a bus at an
unguarded crossing in the southern Ural Mountains, killing the bus
driver and a passenger, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   A preliminary investigation found the bus driver was to blame
for the accident between Novoabzakovo and Tashbulatovo, ITAR-Tass
said.

Floods recede in Germany but more rain forecast, towns still on
</HEADLINE>
alert &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BADEN-BADEN, Germany (AP) _ Floods receded slightly Friday in
southwestern Germany, where rivers and streams swollen by days of
heavy rain have inundated low-lying towns such as this luxurious
sparesort.
	   The Oos River, which runs through the center of Baden-Baden, had
dropped from three meters (10 feet) to 1.67 meters (5.5 feet),
although a state of emergency remained in effect as weather
forecasts predicted more rain. Several roads in the area remained
impassable.
	   Europe's busiest waterway, the Rhine, had yet to flood, but
officials in the riverside city of Cologne said the Rhine could
overrun its banks by Saturday, covering low-lying streets near the
river's edge but far from the city's old center and 14th-century
cathedral.
	   Some ferries across the Rhine have suspended business, and flood
officials warned barges to travel slowly because of the high,
choppy waters.
	   German soldiers were sandbagging flood-threatened towns in the
southern state of Bavaria and in the northern town of Delmenhorst,
near Bremen, which declared a state of emergency at 4 a.m.
	   Flooding was most severe in the center of the town, named from
the nearby Delme River. About 300 soldiers arrived during the night
to help pump out people's basements.
	   ``The moment we pump out the cellars, the water flows right back
in,'' Delmenhorst town spokesman Rolf Heitmann said.
	   Harsh storms that started late Tuesday have killed at least
three people _ one in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, and one
in Switzerland. All were involved in vehicle accidents with trees
uprooted by wind. Power cuts, traffic snarls, and highway closings
have been reported in Austria and the Netherlands.

As many as 300 dead in weekend attack in northeastern Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ As many as 300 people may have been killed
in an attack on a remote village in northeastern Kenya, news
reports said Friday.
	   Both the Daily Nation and the East African Standard said some 50
teenage girls were carried off by the raiders who also stole an
estimated 17,000 goats, cattle and camels. Hundreds of people were
reported missing.
	   There were varying reports on the number of dead.
	   Adnan Kenyan, a legislator from Wajir West district _ the
hardest hit _ told reporters Thursday at least 200 people had been
killed in the raids on Budada, Gerari, Tuli and Mudama villages
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Wajir town, the provincial
capital.
	   Abdi Ogle, an official in the opposition Democratic Party of
Kenya, put the number of dead at 300.
	   Wajir town is 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Nairobi in
a dry, desolate region where cattle raids and clan-based clashes
over the use of scarce water and wells are common.
	   Wajir District Commissioneer Fred Muthami said 139 died in the
raid, but Marsden Madoka, minister of state in the office of
President Daniel arap Moi in charge of security said the exact
number of dead was not known.
	   Madoka, government officials and legislators belonging to Moi's
ruling Kenyan African National Union party claim the raiders were
members of the Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group from
neighboring Ethiopia.
	   They say the victims were members of the Kenyan Somali Degodia
clan and that members of the Boran ethnic group brought in the OLF
to help them attack the Degodia.
	   The OLF is outlawed in Ethiopia, and it was not possible to
contact any representative to obtain the group's version of events.
	   But in the past, the government has blamed the OLF for raids
when it was later revealed that the Kenyan army was involved in
attacks against the nomadic people of the region as part of a
crackdown on alleged banditry.
	   Most of the inhabitants of North Eastern Province are ethnic
Somalis whose sub-clans migrated south from the Horn of Africa in
the 15th and 16th centuries.
	   Prior to Kenya's independence from Britain in 1963, residents in
the region voted in a referendum to join with the new state of
Somalia, but the outcome was overruled by British colonial
authorities.

National Court meets to rule on Pinochet extradition bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court convening &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge who wants former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet brought to Spain to stand trial for
genocide and other crimes awaited a National Court decision Friday
on whether Spain has jurisdiction over atrocities committed by the
military juntas of Chile and Argentina.
	   An 11-judge panel of the court convened behind closed doors at
9.30 a.m. (0830 gmt), with a decision expected by early afternoon.
	   For over two years, Judge Baltasar Garzon and a colleague have
been probing human rights crimes in Argentina and Chile in the
1970s and 1980s. Garzon filed the arrest warrant that resulted in
Pinochet's detention in London since Oct. 16.
	   The case before the court panel Friday resulted from a protest
filed in May by state prosecutors who objected to Garzon's
investigations on the grounds that Spain had no jurisdiction over
such crimes.
	   Although the National Court's decision Friday does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, Garzon
is expected to decide on the future of his case depending on the
ruling.
	   If the judges rule against Garzon, he would be in the awkward
position of seeking extradition of Pinochet on charges related to
crimes the court says he had no business investigating in the first
place.
	   In such a case, Garzon mostly likely would be forced to drop his
drive to extradite Pinochet as well as the parallel probes that led
to his arrest. Garzon is not expected to appeal if he loses.
	   Pinochet, who seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, has
been widely accused of running a ruthless regime. During his rule,
4,299 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet, 82,
on the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents. In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses
Pinochet of terrorism and torture.
	   The case was shaken Wednesday by Britain's High Court ruling
that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity. That decision is under
appeal and Garzon is expected to keep trying to extradite Pinochet
as long as he is detained and the Spanish National Court backs the
case.
	   The 11-judge panel began deliberating after hearing attorneys
argue for and against the case for some four hours Thursday
evening.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira insisted that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of junta victims in
Argentina, said: ``Pinochet is guilty of genocide because he tried
to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   Another lawyer, Juan Garces, representing families of junta
victims in Chile, drew applause from about 100 spectators in the
court chamber by stating, ``Let justice be done. Let's help
humanity.''
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in Operation Condor, in which
several military juntas in South America teamed up in the 1970s and
1980s to crush what they perceived as a communist threat.

Europarliament protests treatment of Congo opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The head of the European Parliament has
written to Congolese President Laurent Kabila to protest the
treatment of a prominent opposition figure who was prevented from
leaving the country.
	   In a telegram to Kabila made public late Thursday, Jose Maria
Gil-Robles, expressed ``deep concern'' about the treatment of
Etienne Tshisekedi, Kabila's main political adversary in the
Congolese capital, Kinshasa.
	   The president of the European Union assembly said armed forces
had surrounded Tshisekedi's home and Congolese authorities had
prevented him leaving to attend European Parliament development
meeting in Brussels on Oct. 26.
	   ``I must protest in the strongest possible terms,'' Gil Robles
wrote. He said the restrictions on Tshisekedi were ``contrary to
democratic values'' and ``completely unacceptable.''
	   Tshisekedi, a prominent opponent of late Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko called for democratic reforms after Kabila overthrew
Mobutu in May, 1997. Kabila responded by arresting Tshisekedi and
sending him into internal exile for five months.
	   Since his return to Kinshasa in July, Tshisekedi has offered to
broker peace talks between Kabila's government and rebels fighting
to overthrow the Congolese leader.

Play depicting love affair of India's first prime minister banned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Authorities have banned a play that
depicts India's first prime minister as a lovelorn man pining for
the wife of the country's last British viceroy, a government
spokesman said Friday.
	   The Hindu right-wing Shiv Sena had sought permission from the
government of the northern Uttar Pradesh state to stage on Jawahar
Lal Nehru's birth anniversary Nov. 14 the Hindi play ``Lady
Mountbatten's Tresses and Nehru.''
	   The alleged love affair between Nehru and the viceroy's wife has
been the subject of books and newspaper articles in India for
years, but writers have rarely attempted to piece together the
story in a country where the personal scandals of politicians
rarely make headlines.
	   After consultations with the federal government, permission was
denied because the play could lead to violent protests and law and
order problems, a government spokesman said Friday. Further
screening of the play has also been banned.
	   The decision evoked surprise as Uttar Pradesh state is governed
by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, an ally of the
Shiv Sena, and both the parties are staunch rivals of the main
opposition Congress Party which Nehru once led.
	   The organizers of the play said the decision was an infringement
of their fundamental rights. The Shiv Sena plans to petition the
court and organize demonstrations against the decision.
	   The Shiv Sena blames Nehru for the partition of India in 1947 at
the end of colonial British rule and the creation of the new
Islamic state of Pakistan. Party officials said Nehru's fascination
for Edwina Mountbatten had a role to play in the partition.
	   ``Nehru succumbed to the charms of Lady Edwina Mountbatten ...
(who) took advantage of Nehru and influenced him to agree to the
partition of India and the creation of Pakistan,'' the party's
state president Ram Sharan Gupta told The Associated Press.
	   ``The play is based on historical evidence and published books.
Nehru was the main architect of Pakistan's creation and the people
of India have a right to know of this,'' Gupta said.
	   Fifty years on, India and Pakistan are rivals. The partition
still evokes passions in India, where freedom movement leader
Mohandas Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a man who listed the
country's division as one of the reasons for the attack.
	   A play that sought to give the assassin's version was banned in
Maharashtra state _ which is governed by the Shiv Sena _ earlier
this year after protests forced organizers to stop its screening.

GAZA CITY: the area.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Yassin, a quadriplegic since his teens, has been under house
arrest since Thursday evening. It was a stunning move by Arafat who
in the year since Yassin's release from an Israeli jail has bent
over backward to avoid open conflict with him.
	   Arafat has moved against Hamas in the past, sometimes arresting
hundreds of activists in retaliation for suicide attacks against
Israel. However, the current crackdown marked the first time Arafat
had the entire Hamas leadership arrested and silenced.
	   Arafat had ordered the arrests in response to the suicide attack
at a busy Gaza junction in which an Islamic militant rammed an
explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep escorting a
red-and-white bus carrying Israeli school children.
	   The 40 students on board were saved _ not a single one was hurt
_ but the car bomb killed an Israeli soldier in the jeep, a
19-year-old immigrant from Ukraine now being praised as a fallen
hero. The assailant also died, and his identity remained a mystery.
The car was registered to man from the Gaza Strip town of Khan
Yunis who said he had sold it a day before the attack.
	   Political reverberations from the first suicide attack on
Israelis in six months were swift.
	   Coming only six days after the signing of a land-for-security
agreement in Washington, it was a destabilizing new factor in what
is already a highly delicate prelude to implementing the accord.
That process is to start next week.
	   Blocking the pact is the avowed goal of Hamas, which bitterly
opposes any peace with Israel. Hamas has carried out attacks that
have killed scores of Israelis.
	   Israel's government said it was too early to judge Arafat's
campaign against Hamas. ``If this is a harbinger of a new policy,
then we would certainly welcome it. If it's a repeat of short-term,
sporadic activity against Hamas, then we still have a very severe
problem,'' said government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   Fogel said Palestinian security forces must confiscate illegal
weapons and dismantle the infrastructure of the Hamas military
wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Arafat that the
Palestinians would have to wage all-our war against terrorists if
they wanted Israel to withdraw troops in the West Bank, as
stipulated in the agreement.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu indefinitely postponed a Cabinet
session that was to ratify the peace agreement. Officials in his
office said the regular weekly Cabinet session would be held
Sunday, as planned, but that the peace agreement would only be
discussed if the Palestinians had submitted a detailed security
plan to the Americans by then.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the plan would be
presented to the Americans on Monday, as initially planned.
	   There were some signs that Thursday's bombings had not harmed
the fragile new relationship between the Netanyahu government and
the Palestinian Authority too badly.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon was to meet next week with
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, in what Israel radio described as
the beginning of negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, confirmed that the meeting
was planned, but said that ``we won't label it the beginning of
final status talks.''
	   The negotiations were formally launched in May 1996, but were
suspended when Netanyahu took office later that month.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International monitors urged ethnic
Albanian rebels to allow traffic to flow freely in Kosovo to
improve prospects for a negotiated settlement now that police and
army units have largely withdrawn and fighting has stopped in the
troubled province.
	   The Albanian language newspaper Koha Ditore reported Friday that
members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission met Wednesday
with Kosovo Liberation Army commanders to urge them not to impede
traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by Serb government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to the newspaper, the monitors told the rebels that
Serb police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under
the Oct. 12 agreement between President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The monitors apparently have been trying to reassure the rebels
that the limited presence of Serb police does not necessarily mean
the government is violating the agreement or that they represent a
major threat to ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   International envoys hope if they can keep the lid on the tense
province, most of the thousands of refugees will return to homes
they fled after Milosevic launched his crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists Feb. 28.
	   So far, however, only a few ethnic Albanians have returned home.
Those interviewed in makeshift encampments complain that police or
soldiers were still in the area, or their houses were too damaged.
	   ``The return is not as easy as was expected,'' said Jacques
Franquin of the U.N. refugee agency in Geneva.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces to
the levels they were at before he launched the crackdown in Kosovo,
a province of Serbia, the dominant of the two republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in fighting. The threat of airstrikes
remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for Milosevic to
fully comply.
	   The deal also calls on the Serbs to facilitate the return of
some 300,000 refugees, half of them abroad and the other half
scattered over Kosovo.
	   But many refugees remain deeply suspicious that not enough
Serbian forces have pulled out. In Belgrade on Thursday, Vojislaw
Seselj, Serbia's deputy premier, vowed to continue the government's
fight against ethnic Albanian rebels despite the withdrawals.
	   He insisted that the substantial police pullout of government
forces, as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would give up its
struggle against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would ``defend themselves as
they have done so far.''
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo. A
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into barracks in the provincial capital
Pristina on Thursday from positions 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of
the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers were positioned outside Junik, near the mountain
border with Albania.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor, but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' said Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and father of
11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about 5
kilometers (2 miles) from his village, Perceva.
	   Since the withdrawal, land mines and booby traps set by Serb
forces have been tripped and reports of sporadic violence continue.
The Serb Media Center reported Thursday that two pro-Serb Albanians
had been killed by the guerrillas in separate incidents. There was
no way to independently verify the report.

Guinea-Bissau fighting to dominate West African summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The crisis in Guinea-Bissau is likely to
dominate the summit of West African heads of state starting Friday
in Nigeria, officials said Friday.
	   President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who is attending the
meeting as an observer, is also expected to push for renewed
mediation efforts to end the fighting in Congo, according to
Nigerian officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The summit, of the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States, or ECOWAS, will include top officials from Ghana, Benin,
Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Niger and Senegal.
	   The meeting will also delve into what Nigeria's planning
minister, Rasheed Gbadamosi, called ``the precarious financial
situation of the community.''
	   Membership dues for the group are about dlrs 40 million overdue.
	   Fighting began in Guinea-Bissau on June 7, with a coup attempt
in the capital, Bissau, by former army chief of staff Brig.
Ansumane Mane, who accuses President Joao Bernardo Vieira of
corruption.
	   On Thursday, Mane and Vieira flew to the tiny West African
nation of Gambia for their first face-to-face talks on ending five
months of fighting, Portuguese news reports said.
	   The talks were scheduled to begin late Thursday, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa said.
	   It was not clear what each side would be aiming for in the talks
in Gambia. But Lusa said the key issue would be withdrawal of
troops sent from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea to
back Vieira.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.
	   A cease-fire was declared July 26 but fighting broke out again
10 days ago.

Report: Jamaica needs trade reform to withstand shocks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ With a global banana row and strong competition
threatening to undermine vital pillars of Jamaica's foreign trade,
the Caribbean island needs to find new markets for its traditional
exports, a trade report out Friday said.
	   Jamaica's heavy reliance on imported goods and its dependence on
traditional markets for its exports of manufactured goods, bauxite,
sugar and bananas is making its economy vulnerable, the 157-page
trade policy review report by the World Trade Organization
secretariat said.
	   ``Dependence on a limited number of exports and markets, and on
tourism, keeps the island's economy highly vulnerable to both
domestic and external shocks,'' the report said. ``Jamaica needs a
stable domestic economy and open access to export markets if it is
to realize renewed economic growth by next year.''
	   The Jamaican government says imports of goods from the rest of
the world have been increasing much more rapidly than its exports.
So far this decade, imports have risen more than 50 percent while
exports have grown only 20 percent.
	   The dispute between the European Union, the United States and
Latin American banana producers over the EU's banana import regime
could further weaken Jamaica's position, the study said.
	   Banana sales to Britain and the European Union represent
Jamaica's second largest farm export, with a value of some dlrs 45
million in 1997. Jamaica and other Caribbean countries have
traditionally enjoyed preferential access to those markets under
the Lome Convention.
	   But a WTO panel has told the European Union to change its banana
import policy after the United States and several Latin American
banana producing countries said the policy discriminates against
them.
	   The dispute is ongoing. The EU has approved changes to the
regime, but the United States says they don't go far enough and has
threatened to impose trade sanctions next year unless the Europeans
make further modifications _ which could adversely affect Jamaica.
	   Jamaican exports of clothing to the United States, although
protected by guaranteed access arrangements, have lost market share
to more competitive producers during the past few years,
particularly Mexico, the report said.
	   It commended the Jamaican government for comprehensively
liberalizing trade since 1985. Jamaican foreign affairs minister
Anthony Hylton told a meeting of the WTO's trade policy review body
Friday that the government is concerned about the island's trade
deficit, but earnings from tourism have had a positive impact on
the balance of payments.
	   Jamaica is abiding by its WTO commitments but added that its
concerns, as a small country with limited resources, would need to
be taken into account more fully, he said.
	   ``While we do not seek a future tied to preferences, we do look
forward to a future - and this requires that viable alternatives be
elaborated,'' Hylton said.

GAZA CITY: the area.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Yassin, a quadriplegic since his teens, has been under house
arrest since Thursday evening. It was a stunning move by Arafat who
in the year since Yassin's release from an Israeli jail has bent
over backward to avoid open conflict with him.
	   Arafat has moved against Hamas in the past, sometimes arresting
hundreds of activists in retaliation for suicide attacks against
Israel. However, the current crackdown marked the first time Arafat
had the entire Hamas leadership arrested and silenced.
	   Arafat had ordered the arrests in response to the suicide attack
at a busy Gaza junction in which an Islamic militant rammed an
explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep escorting a
red-and-white bus carrying Israeli school children.
	   None of the 40 students were injured but the car bomb killed an
Israeli soldier in the jeep, a 19-year-old immigrant from Ukraine
now being praised as a fallen hero. The assailant also died, and
his identity remained a mystery. The car was registered to man from
the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis who said he had sold it a day
before the attack.
	   Political reverberations from the first suicide attack on
Israelis in six months were swift.
	   Coming only six days after the signing of a land-for-security
agreement in Washington, it destabilized a highly delicate prelude
to implementing the accord, a process scheduled to start next week.
	   Hamas wants to block the pact and bitterly opposes peace with
Israel. The group has carried out attacks that have killed scores
of Israelis.
	   Israel's government said it was too early to judge Arafat's
campaign against Hamas. ``If this is a harbinger of a new policy,
then we would certainly welcome it. If it's a repeat of short-term,
sporadic activity against Hamas, then we still have a very severe
problem,'' said government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   Fogel said Palestinian security forces must confiscate illegal
weapons and dismantle the infrastructure of the Hamas military
wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Arafat that the
Palestinians would have to wage all-our war against terrorists if
they wanted Israel to withdraw troops in the West Bank, as
stipulated in the agreement.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu indefinitely postponed a Cabinet
session that was to ratify the peace agreement. Officials in his
office said the regular weekly Cabinet session would be held
Sunday, as planned, but that the peace agreement would only be
discussed if the Palestinians had submitted a detailed security
plan to the Americans by then.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the plan would be
presented to the Americans on Monday, as initially planned.

Marseille bus drivers strike briefly after new attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike ending &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Bus drivers in the southern part of
this port city walked off the job briefly Friday to protest a lack
of security following a new attack on a driver.
	   On Thursday evening, a driver was beaten by a passenger who was
demanding to get off between regular stops. The driver was briefly
hospitalized.
	   There was virtually no bus service in the southern part of
Marseille Friday morning, but service returned to normal before
noon after drivers met and decided to end their strike.
	   A number of French cities have experienced similar strikes in
recent weeks, as drivers become increasingly angry over what they
see as a lack of support from the government in the face of
worsening youth violence.
	   The rising crime is blamed on youths from working-class suburbs,
who've been hit hard by double-digit unemployment. While the
national jobless rate is 11.7 percent, the rate can top 50 percent
in some neighborhoods.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Thousands of children began planting cucumber, corn
and bean sprout seeds on Friday to replicate two of the experiments
Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai will conduct on the U.S. space
shuttle Discovery.
	   Mukai _ on board with John Glenn and a team of other astronauts
_ will test how differences in gravity affect the development of
the plants in the shuttle's space lab.
	   With test kits ready to go, children only had to wait until
Mukai left for space early Friday, said Keiko Takemoto, a
spokeswoman for the Young Astronauts Club, a government-run
organization for children.
	   ``Children are very excited about the experiments and being part
of the space project,'' she said.
	   More than 400 schools and organizations applied for the
experiments, designed by the National Space Development Agency for
children in the fifth through 12th grades, four times as many as
organizers had expected, Takemoto said.
	   The participants will compare their results with those of
Mukai's when she returns.
	   The findings will have to be submitted to NASDA by Nov. 25 for
evaluation by Mukai and two other Japanese biologists. Ten groups
with outstanding reports will be awarded prizes.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Yutaka Takeyama, the head of the
Science and Technology Agency, will talk for about 20 minutes next
Thursday with Mukai and Glenn, agency official Masaaki Nishijo
said.
	   Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, is returning to
space after 36 years.

Moscow police net dozens of weapons in one-day sweep
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow police seized dozens of firearms as well as
ammunition, explosives, grenades and grenade-launchers during a
one-day crackdown on weapons. Seventy-six people were arrested, the
Interfax news agency said Friday.
	   The haul, codenamed ``Arsenal,'' included 77 firearms, 910 grams
(32 ounces) of explosives, 15 explosive devices, 24 grenades and
three grenade-launchers, Interfax said, quoting police.
	   In one apartment police seized a sawed-off shotgun, a revolver,
a homemade pen-shaped device that shoots, 5.6mm-caliber cartridges,
two gas pistols and more than 60 cartridges of different calibers,
police said.
	   In a garage rented by a 28-year-old unemployed man they found
two 200-gram (7-ounce) charges, two homemade explosive devices,
four electric detonators, 10 grenades, a gun and 20 cartridges.
	   A 40-year-old homeless man was stopped and found to be carrying
two foreign-made revolvers, a grenade with a detonator, 160
cartridges and a dagger.
	   Another homeless man was relieved of 120 grams (4.25 ounces) of
explosives.

Officials: Singapore's property prices fall by 13 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Reflecting the regional economic crisis,
property prices in Singapore dropped 13 percent in the third
quarter from the second quarter of the year, hitting the lowest
levels since late 1993.
	   The Urban Redevelopment Authority said Friday that residential
property prices dropped in line with the overall market, down 13
percent in the months from July through September, compared with
the previous three-month period.
	   Industrial property prices dropped 14 percent in the third
quarter from the second, and commercial property prices dipped 12
percent, the authority said.
	   The authority doesn't publish year-on-year figures. But based on
past reports, overall property prices dropped 30 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier.
	   Residential prices were down 31 percent, industrial prices down
29 percent and commercial prices fell by 23 percent.
	   Occupancy rates remained steady in the third quarter from the
second. Residential occupancy was unchanged at 90 percent and
office occupancy at 86 percent, down from 87 percent in the second
quarter, it said.
	   Singapore developers have been pricing new houses and
condominiums below the resale market, a tactic they did not use in
the past, in order not to undercut confidence in the market.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left
rescuers facing a hideous that local rescue service leader Lennart
Olin likened to a ''gas chamber.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since
1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found
at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials
said.
	   The injured included about 20 in serious condition.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the two-story brick
building. The dance was on the second floor.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40, and recovered 59 bodies. The 60th
victim died at a hospital.
	   The Swedish news agency TT said the association had permission
to have only 150 people in the facility. The building had just two
exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician
Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   About 180 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and
about 20 were in intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured
were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other cities, the
report said. Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest
of the capital, Stockholm.
	   The fire broke out about midnight (2300 GMT Thursday) in
building of the local Macedonian Association, which organized the
dance. The crowd in the second story of the building contained
mostly 13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday
weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

National Court meets to rule on Pinochet extradition bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court convening &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge who wants former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet brought to Spain to stand trial for
genocide and other crimes awaited a National Court decision Friday
on whether Spain has jurisdiction over atrocities committed by the
military juntas of Chile and Argentina.
	   An 11-judge panel of the court convened behind closed doors at
9.30 a.m. (0830 gmt), with a decision expected by early afternoon.
	   For over two years, Judge Baltasar Garzon and a colleague have
been probing human rights crimes in Argentina and Chile in the
1970s and 1980s. Garzon filed the arrest warrant that resulted in
Pinochet's detention in London since Oct. 16.
	   The case before the court panel Friday resulted from a protest
filed in May by state prosecutors who objected to Garzon's
investigations on the grounds that Spain had no jurisdiction over
such crimes.
	   Although the National Court's decision Friday does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, Garzon
is expected to decide on the future of his case depending on the
ruling.
	   If the judges rule against Garzon, he would be in the awkward
position of seeking extradition of Pinochet on charges related to
crimes the court says he had no business investigating in the first
place.
	   In such a case, Garzon mostly likely would be forced to drop his
drive to extradite Pinochet as well as the parallel probes that led
to his arrest. Garzon is not expected to appeal if he loses.
	   Pinochet, who seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, has
been widely accused of running a ruthless regime. During his rule,
4,299 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet, 82,
on the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents. In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses
Pinochet of terrorism and torture.
	   The case was shaken Wednesday by Britain's High Court ruling
that Pinochet has diplomatic immunity. That decision is under
appeal and Garzon is expected to keep trying to extradite Pinochet
as long as he is detained and the Spanish National Court backs the
case.
	   The 11-judge panel began deliberating after hearing attorneys
argue for and against the case for some four hours Thursday
evening.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira insisted that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of junta victims in
Argentina, said: ``Pinochet is guilty of genocide because he tried
to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   Another lawyer, Juan Garces, representing families of junta
victims in Chile, drew applause from about 100 spectators in the
court chamber by stating, ``Let justice be done. Let's help
humanity.''
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in Operation Condor, in which
several military juntas in South America teamed up in the 1970s and
1980s to crush what they perceived as a communist threat.

Report: Jamaica needs trade reform to withstand shocks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ With a global banana row and strong competition
threatening to undermine vital pillars of Jamaica's foreign trade,
the Caribbean island needs to find new markets for its traditional
exports, a trade report out Friday said.
	   Jamaica's heavy reliance on imported goods and its dependence on
traditional markets for its exports of manufactured goods, bauxite,
sugar and bananas is making its economy vulnerable, the 157-page
trade policy review report by the World Trade Organization
secretariat said.
	   ``Dependence on a limited number of exports and markets, and on
tourism, keeps the island's economy highly vulnerable to both
domestic and external shocks,'' the report said. ``Jamaica needs a
stable domestic economy and open access to export markets if it is
to realize renewed economic growth by next year.''
	   The Jamaican government says imports of goods from the rest of
the world have been increasing much more rapidly than its exports.
So far this decade, imports have risen more than 50 percent while
exports have grown only 20 percent.
	   The dispute between the European Union, the United States and
Latin American banana producers over the EU's banana import regime
could further weaken Jamaica's position, the study said.
	   Banana sales to Britain and the European Union represent
Jamaica's second largest farm export, with a value of some dlrs 45
million in 1997. Jamaica and other Caribbean countries have
traditionally enjoyed preferential access to those markets under
the Lome Convention.
	   But a WTO panel has told the European Union to change its banana
import policy after the United States and several Latin American
banana producing countries said the policy discriminates against
them.
	   The dispute is ongoing. The EU has approved changes to the
regime, but the United States says they don't go far enough and has
threatened to impose trade sanctions next year unless the Europeans
make further modifications _ which could adversely affect Jamaica.
	   Jamaican exports of clothing to the United States, although
protected by guaranteed access arrangements, have lost market share
to more competitive producers during the past few years,
particularly Mexico, the report said.
	   It commended the Jamaican government for comprehensively
liberalizing trade since 1985. Jamaican foreign affairs minister
Anthony Hylton told a meeting of the WTO's trade policy review body
Friday that the government is concerned about the island's trade
deficit, but earnings from tourism have had a positive impact on
the balance of payments.
	   Jamaica is abiding by its WTO commitments but added that its
concerns, as a small country with limited resources, would need to
be taken into account more fully, he said.
	   ``While we do not seek a future tied to preferences, we do look
forward to a future - and this requires that viable alternatives be
elaborated,'' Hylton said.

Traders and politicians appeal for weekend calm

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government outlawing opposition group, one
protester jailed &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government outlawed an
opposition coalition Friday ahead of another expected round of
demonstrations this weekend against Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   With the trial of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim set to begin
Monday, tension has blanketed the capital. People are bracing for
more clashes between riot police and anti-government demonstrators.
	   ``Violence in any form or from any quarter, whether by
demonstrators or police, must be deplored as violence can only
beget violence,'' the opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit
Siang, said Friday.
	   Deputy Home Minister Ong Ka Ting said the opposition Malaysian
Peoples Justice Movement Council, or GERAK, had been banned because
it was organizing ``illegal activities'' and wasn't registered with
the Societies Act.
	   The fledgling coalition of activists has put together gatherings
nationwide calling for political reform and social justice.
	   Ong said the notice was the ``final warning'' for GERAK's
leaders, who could be fined up to 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,630) and
jailed five years.
	   GERAK's leaders said they intended to continue their rallies,
which have attracted thousands.
	   ``The government's terrified of us because we're the people's
voice,'' said the coalition's leader, Haji Mahfuz Haji Omar. ``More
and more people are standing behind us. If the authorities crack
down on us, it'll just enrage even more Malaysians.''
	   The ban came ahead of an expected repeat of the weekly Saturday
gatherings in which thousands of Malaysians have flocked downtown
to demand justice for Anwar after Mahathir fired him as deputy on
Sept. 2.
	   Anwar faces 10 counts of corruption and sodomy.
	   A full-scale riot broke out for the first time in nearly three
decades last Saturday, after police fired tear gas and water
cannons at a neighborhood mosque. Protesters at the Muslim house of
prayer retaliated by hurling stones and bricks.
	   ``The police can only take so much,'' said police spokesman
Yusuf Said. ``So don't force us to take stern action when the
situation is out of control.''
	   Yusuf said that police would again crack down on the crowds and
warned children could die if they were exposed to tear gas.
	   On Friday, all but one out of the 178 protesters arrested by
police pleaded innocent to charges of rioting and disobeying police
orders to disperse from illegal gatherings. Most of them were
released after posting bail.
	   Umar Saharuddin, 30, who pleaded guilty to the charges, was
sentenced to one month in jail.
	   On Friday, human rights activists blamed the police for
instigating the violence last Saturday.
	   ``My appeal to calm and tolerance would be to the police, who
are behaving like thugs instead of law enforcers,'' said Tien Chua,
a spokesman for the human rights group SUARAM.

Heroin price in Thailand jumps as Myanmar troops attack refineries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar government troops have
mounted a series of attacks on heroin refineries, driving up the
price of the drug in Thailand by 20 percent, a Thai anti-narcotics
official said Friday.
	   The price in Bangkok of a standard 700-gram (24.5-ounce) package
of grade 4 heroin, the highest quality, has jumped to about 2.5
million baht (dlrs 69,500) from 1.9 million baht (dlrs 53,000),
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The price hike has also been caused by a seasonal shortage of
opium _ from which heroin is derived _ since the new harvesting
season usually begins at the end of December, said the official.
	   But the main pressure came from a Myanmar army offensive which
began two weeks ago, when six battalions, each with about 500
troops, were sent to wipe out heroin refineries along the border
with Thailand, said the official, who works with the police
narcotics suppression bureau.
	   All the drug refineries are believed to be guarded by heavily
armed guerrillas belonging to ethnic minority groups, he said.
	   Thai military intelligence officer question whether the
stepped-up attacks represent a genuine crackdown on the narcotics
trade, because of suspicions that several senior officers in the
Myanmar army's Eastern Command may have been receiving protection
money from the drug traffickers, he said.
	   They also believe that some of the opium confiscated by the
Myanmar military has been channeled back into the market by corrupt
officials, he added.
	   Myanmar government troops last week attacked a heroin refinery
near Mong Thaw in the southern part of Shan State, killing two
armed guards and forcing 50 guards and 20 laboratory workers to
flee to Thailand, Thai intelligence sources said.
	   The guards are believed to have formerly worked for one-time
drug lord Khun Sa, who commanded the 10,000-man self-styled Mong
Tai Army until his surrender almost three years ago.
	   A Myanmar government press statement issued Thursday claimed
that 62 remnants from the Mong Thai Army had surrendered on Oct. 24
after ``realizing that their destructive acts did not benefit the
nation''.
	   It is believed that surrendered troops were guards who fled from
the refinery near Mong Thaw.
	   Heroin prices have risen in areas along Thailand's border with
Myanmar as well as in Bangkok, said the narcotics officer, although
the price on the Myanmar side of the border has remained steady.
	   In Chiang Mai province, 580 kilometers (360 miles) north of
Bangkok, the price of a 700-gram (24.5-ounce) package has increased
to 190,000 baht (dlrs 5,277) from 160,000 baht (dlrs 4,450).
	   Myanmar, also called Burma, has long been one of the world's top
producers of opium and heroin.

Few refugees returning home in Kosovo despite troop withdrawals

withdrawal incomplete, asks for independent police force; TRIMS, no

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying the government draw-down in
Kosovo is incomplete, the province's main ethnic Albanian leader
called Friday for establishment of a new police force to convince
refugees it's safe to return home.
	   Despite substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army
units from Kosovo, only a few of the thousands of ethnic Albanians
who fled during a government crackdown against separatist rebels
have returned home.
	   Few if any were seen going home Thursday. Those interviewed
cited the same reasons: police or soldiers were still in the area,
or their houses were unlivable because of war damage.
	   ``The families returning face huge destruction and many are
still too afraid to go back,'' Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
Friday. ``The number of Serb forces is still huge...Our position is
for further withdrawals and setting up of Kosovo police force until
full withdrawal.''
	   Rugova also urged the Americans and Europeans to speed the
deployment of a 2,000-member mission designed to verify that
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the peace agreement
he reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Rugova said he was confident that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose attacks on police and troops prompted the Feb. 28 crackdown,
would cooperate with the verification mission.
	   In its Friday editions, the Albanian language newspaper Koha
Ditore reported that members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission met Wednesday with KLA commanders to urge them not to
impede traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to Koha Ditore, the monitors told the rebels that Serb
police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   It appeared the monitors wanted to reassure the rebels that a
limited Serb police presence does not necessarily constitute a
violation of the agreement nor represent a major threat to
civilians.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched the crackdown
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat of
airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for
Milosevic to fully comply.
	   International envoys are hoping that if they can keep the lid on
the tense province, most of the thousands of refugees will return
home before the advent of winter.
	   On Thursday, however, Vojislaw Seselj, Serbia's deputy premier,
vowed to continue the government's fight against ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo despite the withdrawals.
	   He insisted that the substantial police pullout of government
forces from Kosovo, as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would
give up its struggle against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would ``defend themselves as
they have done so far.''
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, and a
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into the Pristina barracks on Thursday
from positions 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers were positioned outside Junik, near the mountain
border with Albania.
	   Refugees said the continued police presence shows the failure of
the agreement.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' complained Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and
father of 11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about 5
kilometers (2 miles) from his village, Perceva.

Yunnan province cracks down on drugs; 21 sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Cities in southwestern China's Yunnan province
held mass rallies to sentence criminals for drug dealing, including
21 sentenced to death in the provincial capital, a Chinese
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Kunming Intermediate People's Court on Monday sentenced the
21 for serious drug crimes, the Guangming Daily reported. It said
other cities also sentenced drug criminals, but gave no further
details.
	   Yunnan borders Southeast Asia's drug production area known as
the ``Golden Triangle'' and has become a smuggling route for opium
and heroin to other parts of China.

	   By law, presidential candidates must prove to a special
linguistics commission that they are proficient in Kazak.
	   The last of the four candidates, Zhaksybai Bazilbayev, has
passed his test, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
	   Candidates also must submit a certificate attesting to their
psychological health and have lived in Kazakstan for 15 years, said
the head of the Central Election Commission, Zagipa Baliyeva. The
commission is also checking whether any of the candidates has a
criminal record or has ever been reprimanded for corruption.
	   Russians make up about one-third of Kazakstan's 16.4 million
people, and the language is still commonly spoken in the former
Soviet republic.
	   Besides Bazilbayev, vice president of a research center, the
other candidates in the Jan. 10 elections are President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Communist
leader Serikbolsyn Abdildin and a lawmaker in the upper house of
parliament, Engels Gabbasov.

Phone lines of Hamas leaders cut as Arafat silences the group

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Intensifying their crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police on Friday cut the telephone
lines of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin and the group's leading
activists. They also prevented a Hamas march in the West Bank.
	   Security officials said more than 100 Hamas activists have been
arrested in the Gaza Strip since Thursday's suicide attack on an
Israeli convoy.
	   The unprecedented decision to silence Yassin came after
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with his security chiefs to
chart the next stage of the campaign against Hamas that Israel says
is a precondition for a timely West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   On Friday morning, armed Palestinian policemen and plainclothes
agents blocked the sandy streets leading to Yassin's home in a Gaza
City slum and ordered journalists to leave. Cars were searched and
passers-by questioned.
	   Yassin has been under house arrest since Thursday. It was a
stunning move by Arafat who in the year since Yassin's release from
an Israeli jail has bent over backward to avoid open conflict with
him.
	   Yassin's neighbors complained that Arafat had crossed a line by
going after the Hamas leader, a quadriplegic who is widely revered
for having built a wide network of clinics and schools in the
impoverished Gaza Strip.
	   ``By insulting him, they have insulted every honest Muslim
here,'' said Nayed Al Amer, 34, as he returned home from noon
prayers. However, he and others said fear kept them from protesting
openly.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, meanwhile, Palestinian police
prevented Hamas from staging a march to protest the arrests.
	   Arafat has moved against Hamas in the past, sometimes arresting
hundreds of activists in retaliation for suicide attacks against
Israel. However, the current crackdown marked the first time Arafat
had the entire Hamas leadership arrested and silenced.
	   Arafat ordered the arrests in response to the suicide attack at
a busy Gaza junction in which an Islamic militant rammed an
explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep escorting a
red-and-white bus carrying Israeli school children.
	   The 40 students on board were saved _ not a single one was hurt
_ but the car bomb killed an Israeli soldier in the jeep, a
19-year-old immigrant from Ukraine now being praised as a fallen
hero.
	   The assailant also died, and police said Friday that had some
new leads regarding his identity. The car was registered to man
from the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis who said he had sold it a
day before the attack.
	   Political reverberations from the first suicide attack on
Israelis in six months were swift.
	   Coming only six days after the signing of a land-for-security
agreement in Washington, it was a destabilizing new factor in what
is already a highly delicate prelude to implementing the accord.
That process is to start next week.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel and wants to block the pact. The
group has carried out attacks that have killed scores of Israelis.
	   Israel's government said it was too early to judge Arafat's
campaign against Hamas. ``If this is a harbinger of a new policy,
then we would certainly welcome it. If it's a repeat of short-term,
sporadic activity against Hamas, then we still have a very severe
problem,'' said government spokesman Moshe Fogel.
	   Fogel said Palestinian security forces must confiscate illegal
weapons and dismantle the infrastructure of the Hamas military
wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Arafat that the
Palestinians would have to wage all-our war against terrorists if
they wanted Israel to withdraw troops in the West Bank, as
stipulated in the agreement.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu indefinitely postponed a Cabinet
session that was to ratify the peace agreement.
	   Officials in his office said the regular weekly Cabinet session
would be held Sunday, as planned, but that the peace agreement
would only be discussed if the Palestinians had submitted a
detailed security plan to the Americans by then.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the plan would be
presented to the Americans on Monday, as initially planned.

Algerian suspect extradited from Switzerland, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd graf with Zaoui's lawyer saying he was deported
to Burkina Faso. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SION, Switzerland (AP) _ An Algerian suspected of being a leader
of an Islamic fundamentalist group has been deported from
Switzerland nearly a year after he slipped into the country to seek
asylum, a Swiss official said Friday.
	   Ahmed Zaoui was flown from Switzerland to an undisclosed
destination Thursday evening, Jean-Rene Fournier, state councilor
of the southern canton of Valais, confirmed. He told The Associated
Press that Switzerland had found a country that would accept Zaoui.
	   Citing people close to Zaoui, Jean Lob, Zaoui's attorney in
Lausanne, said the Algerian had been deported to Burkina Faso in
west Africa. He said there had been no warning.
	   Swiss officials had previously said they would like to deport
Zaoui, formerly a Brussels-based spokesman for Algeria's now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front political party. But they were reluctant to
send him to Algeria because he might be tortured or mistreated
there.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front released a statement late Thursday
protesting the deportation, saying that Zaoui was expelled
``without taking into consideration his wife's sickness or the
infancy of his four children, who were also deported with him.''
	   Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Viktor Schlumpf confirmed that
Zaoui was deported with his family on a charter aircraft.
	   He said Switzerland committed itself to paying part of the
family's living costs.
	   Zaoui had been allowed to remain in Switzerland while his appeal
for asylum was pending. He entered Switzerland from Belgium last
November. He has been charged in France with membership in a
terrorist organization.
	   Last May French judge Roger Le Loire questioned Zaoui in the
presence of Swiss prosecutors, said Juerg Blaser, an official in
the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office.
	   Zaoui is accused by France of using false documents and illegal
trafficking with French identity papers on behalf of the radical
Armed Islamic Group. In 1995 he was convicted in Belgium of playing
a prominent role in a criminal association.
	   French authorities also have accused Zaoui of storing electronic
parts that could have been used to make explosive devices.
	   Last spring Swiss authorities said they were increasing
restrictions on Zaoui, claiming he was using the Internet and other
means to promote violence.
	   Police confiscated his fax machine and forbade him to use the
Internet.
	   In a letter to the Swiss Cabinet, Zaoui claimed he has no links
to violence, but sought an ``honorable political solution'' for
Algeria.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in fighting between
Islamic militants and security forces in Algeria's nearly six-year
insurgency.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government called
off a January 1992 election that the Islamic Salvation Front was
expected to win.

Report: Central African Republic orders Frenchman expelled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Authorities have ordered
the expulsion of a French national working at his embassy in
Bangui, accusing him of subversive activities, state radio
reported.
	   The Thursday report said a deportation order for warrant officer
Jean Max Arnaud signed by Home Affairs Minister Francois
Bedaya-Djadder accused Arnaud of carrying out subversive activities
aimed at jeopardizing the country's stability.
	   It did not indicate when exactly the Frenchman was to leave the
country and gave no further details.
	   Arnaud who reportedly arrived in the country only two months
ago, worked as a bodyguard for French ambassador Jean-Mark Simon.
	   Officials at the French Embassy refused comment.
	   Only a small contingent of French troops remain in this central
African country to help enforce a peace agreement between mutinous
soldiers and president Ange-Felix Patasse. Soldiers have staged
three major rebellions against Patasse since May 1996.
	   The French troops assist a 1,400-member U.N peacekeeping
operation that has also been in place since the beginning of this
year to oversee legislative elections this November.

Dutch party leader worried about new German financial policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A leading Dutch politician has
voiced fears that Germany's new government will abandon the
stringent budget policies that marked Helmut Kohl's 16-year reign.
	   In an interview published Friday in the Dutch daily De
Telegraaf, Liberal Party leader Hans Dijkstal said he has ``great
concerns about the risks for (German) financial stability which
could result from the new financial policy'' of the governing
coalition formed between Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social
Democratic Party and the Greens.
	   His remarks were published as Schroeder prepares to visit Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok next Wednesday. Dijkstal urged Kok to seek
reassurances from Schroeder during his visit.
	   Dijkstal, whose right-of-center Liberals are the No. 2 party in
the ruling Dutch coalition government, warned that the Netherlands
is highly dependent on financial and economic policies in Germany,
the country's largest trading partner.
	   The Liberal leader said he fears that Oskar Lafontaine,
Germany's new finance minister, will abandon the stringent policies
of the past and allow the budget deficit and total debt run up,
according to De Telegraaf.

Two U.S. servicemen in custody in another hit-and-run on Okinawa

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two U.S. servicemen were arrested in Okinawa on
suspicion of injuring a man in a hit-and-run accident Friday, just
weeks after a U.S. Marine was charged in an accident there that
killed a teen-ager.
	   A Marine corporal and an Air Force staff sergeant were driving
an official military van from Marine Camp Schwab that allegedly hit
a man on a moped Friday morning, said spokesman Capt. Bret Curtis.
	   The man suffered a bruised hand but no serious injuries.
	   The two servicemen, accused of fleeing the scene of the accident
in Naha, Okinawa's capital, were later arrested by Japanese police,
Curtis said. Naha is 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   The accident comes amid an edgy political climate on the
southern island since the death of 18-year-old Yuki Uema on Oct. 14
from injuries from the earlier accident.
	   U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Indiana,
has been charged with hit-and-run and drunken driving in the Oct. 7
accident. His trial has been set for Nov. 18.
	   Residents of Okinawa, where most of the American troops in Japan
are stationed, have long resented the U.S. military presence, and
crime is an especially touchy issue.
	   ``I ask that you do not judge the actions of all Americans here
on these two individuals,'' Lt. Gen. Frank Libutti, the commanding
general for the Marines in Japan, told reporters at a hastily
called news conference on Okinawa.
	   ``We will remain focused on educating and training all service
members on Okinawa to maintain high standards of discipline,'' he
said.
	   Hiromu Nonaka, Japan's chief government spokesman, was quoted by
Kyodo News service as making a request to U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Foley to ensure that the U.S. military enforce stricter discipline
to prevent such accidents.
	   Foley has expressed condolences for the earlier hit-and-run and
met with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   The man hurt in Friday's accident, Hitoshi Nakaoji, a
27-year-old bank employee, was bruised when his small motorcycle
turned over, Okinawa police spokesman Katsuya Matayoshi said.
	   The van also crashed into two parked cars and was later found
abandoned in a parking lot a kilometer (half a mile) away.

Few refugees returning home in Kosovo despite troop withdrawals

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying the government draw-down in
Kosovo is incomplete, the province's main ethnic Albanian leader
called Friday for establishment of a new police force to convince
refugees it's safe to return home.
	   Despite substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army
units from Kosovo, only a few of the thousands of ethnic Albanians
who fled during a government crackdown against separatist rebels
have returned home.
	   Few if any were seen going home Thursday. Those interviewed
cited the same reasons: police or soldiers were still in the area,
or their houses were unlivable because of war damage.
	   ``The families returning face huge destruction and many are
still too afraid to go back,'' Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
Friday. ``The number of Serb forces is still huge...Our position is
for further withdrawals and setting up of Kosovo police force until
full withdrawal.''
	   Rugova also urged the Americans and Europeans to speed the
deployment of a 2,000-member mission designed to verify that
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the peace agreement
he reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Rugova said he was confident that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose attacks on police and troops prompted the Feb. 28 crackdown,
would cooperate with the verification mission.
	   In its Friday editions, the Albanian language newspaper Koha
Ditore reported that members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission met Wednesday with KLA commanders to urge them not to
impede traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to Koha Ditore, the monitors told the rebels that Serb
police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   It appeared the monitors wanted to reassure the rebels that a
limited Serb police presence does not necessarily constitute a
violation of the agreement nor represent a major threat to
civilians.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched the crackdown
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat of
airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for
Milosevic to fully comply.
	   International envoys are hoping that if they can keep the lid on
the tense province, most of the thousands of refugees will return
home before the advent of winter.
	   On Thursday, however, Vojislaw Seselj, Serbia's deputy premier,
vowed to continue the government's fight against ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo despite the withdrawals.
	   He insisted that the substantial police pullout of government
forces from Kosovo, as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would
give up its struggle against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would ``defend themselves as
they have done so far.''
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, and a
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into the Pristina barracks on Thursday
from positions 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers were positioned outside Junik, near the mountain
border with Albania.
	   Refugees said the continued police presence shows the failure of
the agreement.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' complained Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and
father of 11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about 5
kilometers (2 miles) from his village, Perceva.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ An explosion in Georgia's breakaway
region of Abkhazia was an attempt to blow up a TV center, a duty
officer at the Interior Ministry said Friday.
	   Someone tried to blow up the Sukhumi TV center late Thursday,
but the explosion went off nearby instead, the duty officer said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Another blast went off 10 minutes later, the duty officer said.
	   No one was hurt, but a bus was seriously damaged.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province, declared independence after
driving out Georgian government forces in 1993 following the end of
a 13-month war. Despite the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in
1994, sporadic violence continues.
	   Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze plans to meet with
Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba in the first half of November,
the Interfax news agency said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Greg Norman will put some of his
millions towards helping his homeland host the 2000 Olympics _ but
there's one games experience his money can't buy.
	   Norman, whose success in golf has put virtually anything he
wants within his reach, admitted Friday that golf's absence from
the Olympic sports program was a continuing source of frustration.
	   ``I've always been very confused by the fact it's not in
there,'' said Norman. ``When I see the NBA delivers its Dream Team
to the Olympics, I think golf's a little bit more popular on a
global basis than basketball is.''
	   Golf is recognized by the Olympic movement and there were failed
bids to have it included at the Atlanta Olympics.

Ethnic Albanian leader defends Kosovo rebel cause
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leader for
the first time Friday spoke in defense of rebels fighting for the
province's independence.
	   ``The armed groups of the UCK and local patriots acted in
reaction to a ten-year oppression by the Serbian regime,'' Ibrahim
Rugova said, referring to the Albanian-language acronym for the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Rugova, renowned for his peaceful resistance to Serb
authorities, had been reticent before on the KLA and never before
actually publicly mentioned them by their acronym.
	   ``Serbia imposed this fighting we've seen for the past six
months, and which ended in massacres and mass destruction,'' Rugova
said in defense of the KLA.
	   He expressed hope rebel groups would welcome the international
monitoring mission, which together with NATO air surveillance
flights would stabilize the situation on the ground.
	   Effects of the Serb forces' crackdown on the separatist province
were devastating, he said and appealed to the international
monitors to oversee the return of refugees.
	   ``The families returning face huge destruction and many are
still too afraid to go back,'' Rugova told reporters.
	   Rugova was dissatisfied with the partial withdrawal of the Serb
police forces from Kosovo and demanded that more troops leave.
	   On the subject of negotiations with the Serb authorities, Rugova
said these have to be ``seriously prepared in order to guarantee
results,'' and that they should not begin ``just for formality's
sake.''
	   ``The best option for Kosovo is full independence, it is in the
interest of both Serbs in Kosovo and Serbia itself,'' Rugova said,
reiterating his stand. But he also supported an interim solution
for the province.
	   ``A temporary, interim solution for Kosovo would end the crisis
and create conditions for a definitive one,'' Rugova concluded.
	   A draft U.S.-sponsored plan calls for a 3-year interim plan for
Kosovo, leaving it a part of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Anti-terrorist squads shot dead a hijacker
of a Turkish plane after a seven-hour standoff Friday at Ankara's
airport _ in a clear message that Turkey does not tolerate
terrorist actions to promote Kurdish problems.
	   ``Those who wanted to spill blood on the Republican Day could
not reach their goal,'' Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas told
reporters after the ordeal. None of the 38 passengers and crew held
hostage was injured.
	   ``I believe that the success of our security forces will be a
deterrent and such attempts will not happen again,'' Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel said.
	   A hijacker, armed with a Russian-made hand grenade and a gun,
took over the Ankara-bound flight Thursday night as Turkey
celebrated its 75th anniversary as a secular republic with street
parties, official balls and fireworks.
	   The hijacker said he was protesting Turkey's crackdown on
Kurdish rebels, according to accounts from the government and
passengers. Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy in
Turkey's southeast since 1984. The conflict has killed close to
37,000 people.
	   In a 10-minute raid, security forces shot the hijacker at least
four times. Television footage showed the cockpit damaged with
bullet marks.
	   ``The terrorist got what he deserved,'' Aktas said. ``He paid
with his life for upsetting the Turkish people.''
	   Aktas said an identification card found on the hijacker named
him as Mursel Peker, but it could be false.
	   The man hijacked the plane Thursday evening shortly after it
took off from the southern city of Adana. He demanded that it be
diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland, a city significant to Kurds as
the site of a 1919 treaty that blocked their hopes of a Kurdish
state.
	   Instead of heading to Switzerland, the six-member crew brought
the plane down at Ankara's airport, apparently after misleading the
hijacker into believing the plane was stopping for fuel in
neighboring Bulgaria.
	   All airport lights were turned off, and the mosques in nearby
villages were ordered not to recite prayers to convince the
hijacker he was in Sofia, the private Channel D said.
	   The ploy reportedly worked and, assuming he was in Bulgaria, the
hijacker read out to the control tower a message from a Kurdish
rebel leader denouncing the Turkish repression in the
Kurdish-dominated southeast regions, daily Milliyet reported.
	   This month, five prisoners died after setting themselves afire
to protest the government crackdown on Kurdish rebels.
	   The hijacker appeared to have remained inside the cockpit the
entire time, easing the work of the ant-terrorist squad when they
evacuated the plane quietly and stormed the cockpit where they shot
him.
	   ``We came to the brink of death but we had full trust in our
security forces, and we knew that they would save us,'' said Erkan
Yasdiman, one of the some 20 physicians aboard who were on their
way to a convention in Ankara.
	   Turkish Airlines has been hit by two other hijackings this year,
each time with no real weapons and without injuries.
	   The problem has brought to light the lack of security at the
Turkish airports.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An exhausted Boris Yeltsin left for a Black Sea
vacation on Friday, and a senior aide said the Russian president
would formally restrict his political powers early next year.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday to receive treatment and recover from what doctors said was
extreme fatigue and unstable blood pressure.
	   The president's condition forced him to abruptly cancel a
scheduled trip to Austria, renewing concern about his ability to
serve the rest of his term ending in the summer 2000.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has remained largely out of public view since the
country was hit by an economic crisis in mid-August, and his deputy
chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev acknowledged earlier this week that the
president had turned control over the economy to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   On Friday, Sysuyev went a step further, saying that the
president would formally announce his reduced political role in a
speech to parliament early next year.
	   Yeltsin feels comfortable giving the new Cabinet responsibility
for day-to-day government affairs because it was formed with
parliament's support, the Financial Times of London quoted Sysuyev
as saying.
	   ``The political situation in Russia has changed,'' Sysuyev said.
``In the past, the president engaged in every aspect of running the
country.''
	   He added that Yeltsin would serve the rest of his term and must
preserve his constitutional powers to ensure that the next
presidential elections are democratic.
	   Before leaving for a two-week vacation to the Black Sea resort
of Sochi, Yeltsin met with Primakov to hear discuss the European
Union meeting in Austria, which the prime minister attended Tuesday
in place of the president.
	   Primakov also briefed Yeltsin about his talks Thursday with the
leader of breakaway Chechnya and other issues, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Russian TV broadcast pictures of their meeting at Moscow's
Vnukovo 2 Airport, showing Yeltsin sitting across from Primakov at
a small table, wearing a suit and tie. He was also shown walking
quite stiffly across the tarmac to a waiting plane, and waving from
the door with his wife, Naina.
	   Communists and other Yeltsin opponents have demanded his early
resignation and immediate changes in the constitution to curb the
president's sweeping powers. The Communist Party leadership was
meeting on Friday to discuss their election strategy.
	   Several months before Yeltsin's latest illness and the economic
crisis, the Communist-led opposition in parliament has started an
impeachment campaign against the president. The campaign is widely
expected to fizzle like previous such attempts.
	   A poll by the independent Public Opinion Foundation found 75
percent of Russians supported impeaching Yeltsin, while 16 percent
opposed it.
	   The poll, conducted on Oct. 17 among 1,500 people throughout the
country, gave no margin of error.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Jimmy Connors advanced to the semifinals and Bjorn
Borg lost a closely contested match Friday in the first day of the
NTT Data Championships senior tennis tournament at Ariake
Colosseum.
	   Connors, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, blew by Mansour
Bahrami of France 6-3, 6-4.
	   The victory paved the way for Connors, who was ranked No. 1 in
the world five years in a row during his regular career, to play
Mel Purcell in the semifinals on Saturday in a rematch of last
year's final.
	   ``Last year was last year,'' said Connors, who won that match
easily, 6-1, 6-2. ``Mel must have played well today to beat Noah.''
	   Purcell, from Murray, Kentucky, looked strong against Yannick
Noah, defeating the former captain of France's Davis Cup team 6-3,
6-4.
	   ``I just made too many errors,'' said Noah. ``It wasn't really
one shot, it was everything. I was never able to feel comfortable
and after a while it got frustrating.''
	   Andres Gomez of Ecuador squeaked by Borg 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-2).
Gomez, who won the French Open in 1990, moves to Saturday's
semifinals. Borg has failed to reach the finals in this event for
three straight years.
	   There he will play Tim Wilkison, who advances after beating
Henri Leconte 6-4, 6-4.
	   The NTT Data Champions is the 16th event on the 1998 World
Senior Tennis Circuit. The tour includes the Nuveen Tour in the
United States, the ATP Senior Tour of Champions in Europe and the
Champions Tour in the rest of the world.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60
people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left
rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader
Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 110, Aake Jacobsson, the rescue services
chief of the Goteborg fire department, was quoted as telling the
Swedish news agency TT.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found
at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials
said.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, although
officials said it apparently began with an explosion.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   About 180 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and
about 20 were in intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured
were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other cities. Goteborg
is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital,
Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Center Tim Horan was ruled out of next
month's Australian rugby union tour of France and England on Friday
after team officials decided not to risk further damage to his
newly repaired knee.
	   The veteran Queenslander's place in the squad for the
three-match tour, which includes tests against France on Nov. 14
and England on Nov. 21, will go to New South Wales back Scott
Staniforth.
	   Horan, 28, had surgery last month to repair damaged cartilage in
the knee.
	   ``Basically the medical staff have ruled that he's running out
of time and it's not worth the risk of reinjuring it and bringing
him back too early,'' said Australian coach Rod Macqueen.
	   ``Obviously our long-term goals are the World Cup and we don't
want to take any risks, so for that reason we've ruled him out and
Tim's been part of that decision.''
	   The loss of Horan is a major blow to a Wallaby backline already
without injured fullback Matthew Burke and wingers Ben Tune and
Damian Smith.
	   Horan will now concentrate on getting fully fit for the Super 12
season starting in February.
	   The Wallabies' other injury concern, backrower Willie
Ofahengaue, will have a fitness test Monday on his Achilles tendon.
	   The Australian team goes into camp at Caloundra, Queensland on
Wednesday before leaving for France on Nov. 11. (djp)

New government is confirmed in office

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Jozef Migas, the newly appointed
parliament chairman, Friday confirmed in office the new Slovak
coalition government formed by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda.
	   Dzurinda submitted the list of the new Cabinet soon after being
appointed prime minister by Migas, who was elected on Thursday and
is acting as head of state in the absence of a president.
	   In a move underscoring the change, outgoing Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar announced Thursday.he was relinquishing his
parliamentary seat.
	   The coalition holds 93 of the 150 seats in parliament. Meciar's
party hold 43 seats.
	   Slovaks voted Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
out of power on Sept. 25-26, electing a broad-based, four-party
coalition bent on setting the country back on the road to
integration with Western Europe.
	   Eduard Kukan, who served briefly as foreign minister in 1994 and
also served as ambassador to the United States, became the new
foreign minister.
	   Ladislav Pittner, another prominent member of Dzurinda's Slovak
Democratic Coalition, was appointed interior minister and Brigita
Schmoegnerova, an economist, became the new finance minister.
	   Dzurinda's Democratic Coalition holds eight other posts in the
Cabinet. The second largest member of the coalition, the Democratic
Left, holds six ministries. Three went to the Hungarian Coalition
party, and the Party of Civic Understanding got two posts.

Most refugees leave makeshift camp in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISNA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Most of the 3,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees living in a makeshift camp on Drenica mountain awoke in
their homes Friday for the first time in months.
	   The residents of Kisna Reka, a village 30 kilometers (about 20
miles) southwest of Pristina, moved out of the camp on Thursday and
back into their houses a few kilometers (miles) down the road.
	   Many of the homes were heavily damaged, and people were covering
holes in their roofs with plastic sheeting and washing clothing and
other belongings.
	   They had lived in huts of tree-branch frames with plastic
sheeting covering in the camp, where relief agencies brought them
food and supplies and also installed water faucets.
	   ``Even if they try to kill me ... I'm not going back to the
mountains. It is too cold,'' said Isa Qelaj, 75, wearing the white
domed cap of an elder as he stood with his walking stick talking
with other men.
	   At the camp, about 150 people from other villages in the area
remained. They said they were unable to return home yet because
Serb police were still patrolling their villages.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official saying building had maximum capacity of
110. DELETES redundant material &QL;

 &UR; By LENNART SIMONSSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story building
and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service
leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 110, Aake Jacobsson, the rescue services chief
of the Goteborg fire department, was quoted as telling the Swedish
news agency TT.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since
1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found
at the scene, and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials
said.
	   The injured included about 20 in serious condition.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the brick building.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40.
	   The Swedish news agency TT said the association had permission
to have only 150 people in the facility. The building had just two
exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician
Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   About 180 people were taken to hospitals. Seven of the most
severely injured were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other
cities, the report said. Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300
miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.
	   The dance was filled with teen-agers celebrating Halloween and a
holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

After NBA cancels rest of November, talks last 8 hours
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS; REPEATING to RESTORE remainder of slug, editor's
note. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They canceled more games, held more talks and
finally walked into the chilly early-morning air with long faces
and no deal.
	   It was one of the most eventful, if not productive, days of the
American National Basketball Association lockout Wednesday. But
when it was over, 16 hours of talking and tinkering hadn't moved
NBA owners and players much closer to a deal.
	   ``There's still a pretty wide gap that separates the sides,
despite the statements of good faith intentions,'' commissioner
David Stern said after talks ended at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Thursday.
``But at least we identified the sizes of the gaps between us.''
	   Some 12 hours earlier, Stern announced the cancellation of two
more weeks of the season, although he did admit there was a
possibility of ``recapturing'' games that will be missed.
	   In all, 194 games have been lost, with the latest cancellation
of 95 games. Each team's 82-game schedule has now been whittled to
about 68 games, and the players have lost about dlrs 200 million in
salaries.
	   ``In terms of how close and how far away we are, that's hard to
determine right now,'' said Michael Jordan, who sat in on the talks
for the first time. ``At least we've got some great dialogue
happening and in some ways we're starting to understand each
other's position. Is that improvement? Yes, I would say so.''
	   Still, the sides made little or no movement on the monetary
specifics of their offers.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   So far in negotiations, the club owners are still asking for a
scaleback of the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries from 57
to 48 percent, while the players remained stuck on holding off on
their concessions until the number reaches 63 percent.
	   ``Both sides are still locked in,'' union director Billy Hunter
said. ``We spent a lot of time talking, but no progress. I don't
think their people are willing to move.''
	   Hunter, looking haggard and weary when he left the talks,
expected to receive a phone call Thursday morning from Stern or
deputy commissioner Russ Granik to discuss what each side thinks
the next step should be.
	   No further talks have been scheduled, but the sides said they
could be back at the bargaining table Thursday or Friday.
	   The cancellations, which wiped out the rest of the November
schedule, came after the league's Board of Governors and about 100
players held separate meetings during the day. The owners'
negotiating committee then spoke to the assembly of players for 90
minutes, and formal talks began at 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) and lasted for
eight hours.
	   ``I think we just have different ideas as to what's a workable
economic system,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief
attorney. ``This will take more time. We're just still not able to
find common ground on how the thing's going to work.''

Book claims 21 percent of NFL players have committed serious
</HEADLINE>
crimes &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jeff Benedict, co-author of a new book that
claims 21 percent of players in the American gridiron National
Football League have committed serious crimes, thinks the NFL is
much too casual about the problem.
	   ``There are stop-gap measures the league can take,'' said
Benedict, who has written ``Pros and Cons; The criminals who play
in the NFL.''
	   ``One, don't allow players with a pattern of arrests to be draft
eligible. Two, get a policy with teeth in it to get them out of the
league, the same way they do with steroids and gambling.''
	   Using public access records to examine the nearly 1,600 players
on NFL rosters in 1996-97, Benedict and co-author Don Yaeger did
extensive research on a sample of 509 players whose backgrounds
they were able to check. Of that group, 109, or 21 percent, had
criminal histories with 264 arrests for everything from homicide
(2) to domestic violence (45).
	   Doug Allen, assistant executive director of the NFL Players
Association, called the research shoddy and designed to reach a
predetermined conclusion.
	   ``It's absolute nonsense to say one in five NFL players is a
criminal,'' he said. ``They've lumped together DUI and disorderly
conduct charges that were dismissed with murder charges.
	   ``They should take notice of the fact that we have the most
comprehensive anti-violence, anti-gun policy in sports. We're doing
everything an employer and union can do to be responsible. This is
not a book that has discussed it fairly.''
	   Benedict defended the research and its conclusions.
	   ``We sampled over 30 percent,'' he said. ``If we had access to
the records of the others, we're confident it would be higher.
	   ``We didn't look at juvenile records, which is the most active
crime age. If anything, we were conservative here.''
	   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello called the book an unfair attempt to
stereotype and stigmatize athletes, noting that Benedict earlier
authored a similar book on crimes committed by athletes against
women.
	   ``There are approximately 2,500 players going through our league
each year, and fortunately the overwhelming majority are good
citizens, in part because we have taken a very aggressive approach
to addressing issues of life skills and off-field conduct,'' he
said.
	   Benedict said the league's anti-violence, anti-gun policy was
meaningless.
	   ``They can't point to a single case of a player kicked out of
the league for a violent crime,'' the writer said. ``Those policies
aren't worth the paper they're printed on until you use them.''
	   Benedict cited the case of Atlanta Falcons linebacker Cornelius
Bennett, who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman who
accompanied him to a hotel room in 1997 and served 36 days in jail.
	   ``He was charged with three felonies and a misdemeanor,'' the
writer said. ``The charges were dropped because he pleaded guilty
to a reduced charge as part of a plea bargain. That doesn't mean he
didn't do those things.''
	   Benedict said the league is far more tolerant of violent crimes
than it is of other transgressions such as gambling or steroids.
``That's because gambling and steroids get at the credibility of
the game,'' he said.
	   ``The NFL acknowledges a few bad apples,'' Benedict said. ``It's
not a few. When one in five has a record reflecting these kind of
crimes, it's a staggering number. I don't think we uncovered
anything the NFL doesn't know. It's an ominous picture.''

New aero device promises spectacular Indy-car finale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONTANA, California (AP) _ Everybody is waiting to see if the
Indy-car season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway can
match the excitement of July's U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway.
	   Thanks to the advent of the Handford Device, an aerodynamic
piece fitted to the rear wing of the Champ Cars to help contain
speeds at superspeedway events, the race at Michigan was
spectacular.
	   In its first and only race, the Handford Device, created by
PacWest Racing engineer Mark Handford, not only did what it was
intended to do _ slow the cars down _ it helped create what many
now call the greatest race in CART FedEx Series history.
	   There were a record 62 lead changes in the race on July 26
before Canadian Greg Moore won on the track that is an almost exact
duplicate of California's 3.265-kilometer (2.029-mile), high-banked
oval.
	   ``It was really an awfully intense race,'' Moore said. ``I've
never been in anything like that before, not for that long. It
seemed like we were running side-by-side almost all day.''
	   Not only was the race ultra-competitive, but, despite the
Handford Device, it was still very fast, with top speeds above 350
kph (220 mph).
	   ``You can't slow the cars down too much on the big tracks
because no matter what device you use on them or what rule you
change, the engineers, engine-builders and chassis people find some
way to get it back,'' said Michael Andretti, who has won two
800-kilometer (500-mile) races in his career.
	   The awesome and frightening speeds at last year's inaugural CART
event at the Fontana track were the single biggest reason the
Handford Device was designed.
	   A year ago, Brazil's Mauricio Gugelmin set a record for the
fastest qualifying speed in a motorsports event with a lap average
of 387.676 kph (240.942 mph). He completed the 3.265 kilometers
(2.029 miles) in 30.316 seconds.
	   In the race, won by PacWest teammate Mark Blundell of England,
speeds above 370 kph (230 mph) were common.
	   ``The Handford brings down the speeds some,'' Blundell
explained. ``But mostly, the device just makes the cars a little
easier to handle and allows you to draft up on the other cars....
It cuts this big hole in the air and you just get sucked right into
it.''
	   Although the on-track action will take most of the attention
this week, there will be some important off-track activities as
well.
	   On Sunday, CART will say goodbye to Italy's Alex Zanardi, the
two-time, reigning CART champion, who will race next season for
Team Williams in Formula One. Also getting out of his Champ Car for
the last time will be three-time CART champion Bobby Rahal, who is
retiring as a driver after a 17-year career.
	   ``Not that any race driver really needs a lot of extra
incentive, but I know that I'd like to finish with a win, and I'm
pretty sure that Alex feels the same way,'' Rahal said.
	   Actually, Zanardi owes this track a little payback after
crashing twice last year and winding up missing the race with a
concussion.
	   ``This year, I would like to stay away from the walls and be
here for the race,'' he said, grinning.
	   As if anyone needed more incentive to go for the win on Sunday,
there is a special dlrs 1 million payoff for the driver who takes
the checkered flag. Second-place pays its usual dlrs 60,000.

Report: U.S. Major League Baseball to ban androstenedione
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ American Major League Baseball plans to ban the
use of androstenedione, the muscle-building dietary supplement used
by home run champion Mark McGwire, the Toronto Globe and Mail
reported Thursday.
	   The newspaper cited unidentified sources, who said they expect
commissioner Bud Selig to formally announce a ban before spring
training next season.
	   ``I would hate to be in McGwire's shoes right now,'' said Dr.
William Bryan, team physician for the Houston Astros and the past
president of the American Association of Professional Team
Physicians. ``We have just been shaking our heads all this time
that androstenedione was on the shelves.''
	   McGwire, who could not be reached for comment, hit 70 homers
this year, breaking the record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961.
	   ``All the players will know where we stand on andro once a
decision is made,'' said MLB players' union chief Donald Fehr, who
along with Selig agreed last summer to appoint a committee of
doctors to study the danger of andro. ``Right now, the doctors are
simply investigating.''
	   Androstenedione is illegal in Canada but legal in the United
States. It is banned by the International Olympic Committee, U.S.
pro gridiron National Football League and America's main governing
body for college sports (the NCAA), but allowed by MLB.
	   Selig could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   In Johnson City, Tennessee, researchers at East Tennessee State
University are studying the supplement. Dr. Craig Broeder, exercise
physiologist at the school's Human Performance Lab, said they will
study androstenedione's physical and psychological effect on men
between the ages of 35 and 65.
	   ``The main reason for the study is about health issues and
anti-aging,'' he said.
	   The study's 70 participants will undergo medical tests as they
engage in weight training for 12 weeks.
	   The dlrs 28,000 study is being funded by ChemSource, a company
that researches supplements and other products, and Metabolic
Response Modifiers, which produces supplements.
	   Broeder said he hopes to find that andro can boost men's
testosterone at an age when it begins to drop. Such a drop creates
a greater risk of heart and circulatory problems.

Bickering, complaints mar first national committee meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Athens, Greece (AP) _ Bickering, complaints and accusations on
Thursday marred the first meeting of the Greek national committee
that is to help organize the Athens 2004 summer Olympics.
	   ``This place is more like Parliament than a national
committee,'' Deputy Public Works Minister Christos Verelis said.
	   It was the first meeting of the committee, which numbers more
than 50, since Athens was awarded the Games in September 1997.
	   Intended to coordinate preparation efforts, the committee is
made up of political, social, cultural and sports figures.
	   Some of the questions raised during the four-hour meeting
included whether all the projects will be completed on time, their
cost, and if Athens will turn a profit or will be paying off debts
years after the Olympics are over.
	   Members of the main opposition conservative party also peppered
government ministers with more than 35 questions on deadlines,
money, and proposed changes in some of the Olympic venues.
	   ``Everyone understands that the organization of the Olympic
Games isn't a simple, technical issue but an opportunity to apply a
national strategy for the country's projection,'' Culture Minister
and committee president Evangelos Venizelos said.
	   ``We are within the time frame agreed upon in the agreement we
made when the Olympic Games were assigned to Athens.''
	   Although there have been some accusations that bureaucratic
red-tape has delayed the organization so far, an International
Olympic Committee commission which visited last month said it was
happy with preparations so far.
	   Athens has completed more than two-thirds of the facilities
necessary to stage the Games. Key projects _ including the subway,
a new airport and a ring road _ are due for completion by 2001,
organizers said.
	   Organizing committee president Stratis Stratigis also shrugged
off criticism that Athens was delaying in its preparations for the
Games.
	   ``After all,'' he said, ``the turtle finished before the hare.''

Italy takes first step towards extradition request against
</HEADLINE>
Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's justice minister has ordered an
investigation into a complaint filed in Italy against Augusto
Pinochet, in what was seen as the first step towards an official
request to extradite the former Chilean dictator.
	   The complaint against Pinochet was filed Thursday by a Chilean
citizen who is now a resident of Milan. The man, identified in news
reports as Vincente Bergara Taquias, accuses Pinochet in the
kidnapping, torture and murder of his brother.
	   It is now up to Milan prosecutors to look into the matter.
	   The decision by Oliviero Diliberto, the new justice minister,
followed widespread criticism in Italy that he was not doing enough
to support efforts by other countries to have Pinochet tried in
Europe.
	   ``Regardless of formal juridical acts, I would like our country
to condemn Pinochet from a political as well as from a moral point
of view,'' Diliberto was quoted as saying in Friday's La Repubblica
newspaper.
	   Switzerland last week requested Pinochet's arrest and
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture, and
groups in Sweden and France also are seeking to have Pinochet tried
in Europe.
	   The 82-year-old former dictator is in a London hospital under
police guard.
	   He was arrested by British police following an extradition
request by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon. The High Court in Britain
on Wednesday overturned the Spanish arrest warrants, but Pinochet
remains in custody pending an appeal.

Israel to build access roads to Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Attempting the deflect settler criticism of the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, the Israeli
government announced Friday that work on new to roads remote Jewish
settlements is to start next week.
	   Some Jewish settlements would be virtually surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory under terms of the Wye River
agreement, signed a week ago by Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
	   Israel is to hand over another 13.1 percent of the territory to
Palestinian civilian control over 12 weeks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged earlier this
week that ``not a single Israeli settlement'' will be an enclave in
Palestinian-controlled land. On Friday, he chaired a meeting of
ministers and officials to discuss how to strengthen the
settlements in outlying areas.
	   The ministers approved dlrs 58 million (250 million shekels) and
decided that construction work would begin Sunday.
	   Settlers are spearheading a campaign against the Wye accords,
charging that their safety will be endangered by an Israeli pullout
from land near their communities.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's president and the leader
of the West African nation's insurgents have opened direct peace
talks, raising hopes of an end to the country's five-month-old
conflict, according to news reports Friday.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane embraced
when they met late Thursday in the Gambian capital Banjul, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The first face-to-face talks between the foes, mediated by
Gambian President Yaya Jammeh, continued into the night, Lusa said.
	   Diplomats from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea _
Guinea-Bissau's neighbors _ and from France, Portugal and Sweden,
which have interests in the region, also attended the talks,
according to Lusa.
	   Vieira and Mane were to travel Friday to a meeting of West
African leaders in the Nigerian capital Abuja, Lusa said.
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a
breakaway military faction _ mostly army veterans angered by poor
pay and conditions _ seized the main army garrison and
international airport in the capital Bissau.
	   They accused Vieira of corruption and demanded that he step
down.
	   Senegal and the Republic of Guinea sent troops to support Vieira
after most of his army joined the rebellion.
	   However, the insurgents have overrun most of the small country
and the foreign troops reportedly are pinned in the capital near
the presidential palace.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of killed and
wounded in the fighting.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.

Russia collects more taxes in October
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new 2 grafs at end with more talks with USDA officials. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government collected more taxes in
October than in September, a rare bit of good news for a country
struggling to overcome an economic crisis, the tax chief announced
Friday.
	   Russians _ many reluctantly _ paid 13 billion rubles (dlrs 812
million) in taxes so far this month, up from 9.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 581 million) in September, said Georgy Boos, head of Russia's
Federal Tax Service.
	   Boos said that was well over his October target of 9.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 593 million).
	   Collecting taxes has been a chronic problem for the Russian
government. But it's been even tougher in the past few months
because of the financial crisis that erupted in mid-August and
lower revenues from Russian oil companies due to a drop in world
oil prices.
	   One of Russia's big oil companies, Sibneft, disclosed Friday
that it suffered a loss of dlrs 60.4 million in the first half of
this year, compared with a net profit of dlrs 13.7 million a year
ago.
	   Sibneft said it could not count on a rebound in oil prices ``to
restore profitability'' and laid off 5,468 employees _ 10 percent
of its workforce _ to cut costs.
	   The Russian government has been counting on further installments
from an International Monetary Fund loan to help cover its budget
shortfall.
	   The IMF froze payments on the dlrs 22.6 billion loan after the
crisis hit. It says it wants to study the government's plan to cope
with the crisis before releasing any more money.
	   The plan, presented to an IMF delegation on Wednesday, calls for
greater government involvement in the economy.
	   It includes such things as tighter currency controls, price
controls on medicines and some basic foods, a food reserve to help
the country through the winter and indexing wages and pensions to
compensate Russians for rising inflation.
	   It would also lower some taxes, but tighten the rules in hopes
of making more people pay.
	   The government insists it will not face food shortages this
winter, although the agriculture minister said Thursday that Russia
was holding ``consultations'' with the United States about
humanitarian aid.
	   Russian government officials began a second round of talks
Friday with a U.S. government delegation headed by the general
sales manager for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign
Agriculture Service, Christopher Goldthwait, news agencies said.
	   The talks are expected to last until early next week,
Agriculture Minister Viktor Semyonov said Thursday.

Few refugees returning home in Kosovo despite troop withdrawals

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying the government draw-down in
Kosovo is incomplete, the province's main ethnic Albanian leader
called Friday for establishment of a new police force to convince
refugees it's safe to return home.
	   Despite substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army
units from Kosovo, many of the thousands of ethnic Albanians who
fled during a government crackdown against separatist rebels have
refused to go home because police were still in the area or their
houses were destroyed.
	   In one exceptional case, most of the 3,000 refugees camped near
the village of Kisna Reka 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of
here went back to their homes Thursday.
	   ``Even if they try to kill me ... I'm not going back to the
mountains,'' said Isa Qelaj, 75. ``It is too cold.''
	   But thousands more are still believed camped in the hills and
forests.
	   ``The families returning face huge destruction and many are
still too afraid to go back,'' Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
Friday. ``The number of Serb forces is still huge...Our position is
for further withdrawals and setting up of Kosovo police force until
full withdrawal.''
	   Rugova also urged the Americans and Europeans to speed the
deployment of a 2,000-member mission designed to verify that
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the peace agreement
he reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Rugova said he was confident that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose attacks on police and troops prompted the Feb. 28 crackdown,
would cooperate with the verification mission.
	   In its Friday editions, the Albanian language newspaper Koha
Ditore reported that members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission met Wednesday with KLA commanders to urge them not to
impede traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to Koha Ditore, the monitors told the rebels that Serb
police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   It appeared the monitors wanted to reassure the rebels that a
limited Serb police presence does not necessarily constitute a
violation of the agreement nor represent a major threat to
civilians.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched the crackdown
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat of
airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for
Milosevic to fully comply.
	   International envoys are hoping that if they can keep the lid on
the tense province, most of the thousands of refugees will return
home before the advent of winter.
	   On Thursday, however, Vojislaw Seselj, Serbia's deputy premier,
vowed to continue the government's fight against ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo despite the withdrawals.
	   He insisted that the substantial police pullout of government
forces from Kosovo, as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would
give up its struggle against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would ``defend themselves as
they have done so far.''
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, and a
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into the Pristina barracks on Thursday
from positions 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers were positioned outside Junik, near the mountain
border with Albania.
	   Refugees said the continued police presence shows the failure of
the agreement.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' complained Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and
father of 11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about 5
kilometers (2 miles) from his village, Perceva.

Indonesians protest in Bali, Jakarta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of people protested Friday
in Bali against a Muslim Cabinet minister, and in the capital
hundreds staged a pro-government rally supporting next month's
special legislative session.
	   About 4,000 Balinese, including Muslims and Christians, took
part in the colorful protest in front of the governor's office in
Denpasar, the capital of the tourist island, witnesses said.
	   They demanded the resignation of Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin
over his remarks dismissing chance of a Hindu to become Indonesian
president. Bali is largely Hindu.
	   Media reports have quoted Saefuddin, who also is a leader of the
Muslim-based United Development Party, as suggesting that
opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri should not be elected
president of predominantly Muslim Indonesia because she is a
``Hindu.''
	   Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Sukarno, is now leading the Indonesian Democratic Party, which is
widely expected to challenge the ruling Golkar party.
	   She is a Muslim, but her grandmother was from Hindu Bali.
	   The biggest demonstration against Saefuddin was on Wednesday,
attended by at least 100,000 Hindus.
	   In Jakarta, about 500 Muslims held a peaceful demonstration on a
parking lot within the Senayan Sports complex, challenging
students' rejection to the Nov. 10-13 special session of the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly.
	   ``We don't agree with students movements always opposing the
government of President B.J. Habibie,'' said Nadjamuddin Ramly, an
organizer. ``The special session should be held because it is the
constitutional way.''
	   On Wednesday, in one of the biggest protests in the capital,
about 8,000 students demonstrated outside Parliament against plan
to convene the special session, which is to cast guidelines for
elections in 1999.
	   They also urged Habibie to quit over continuing political
turmoil and the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Habibie replaced autocrat Suharto, who was forced to resign in
May amid violent protests that left more than 1,200 killed.

Schroeder aides help settle coal mine dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ Leaders of Germany's key industrial
state settled a political dispute Friday over wetlands near a
planned coal mine which had threatened to cloud the start of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government in Bonn.
	   The deal on the strip mine's water permit followed concessions
by the environmentalist Greens party, the junior partner of the
Social Democrats in North Rhine-Westphalia state, as well as by
Schroeder's administration which took office this week.
	   Two Cabinet members with political connections to the state
helped broker the agreement, after governor Wolfgang Clement warned
that ``small-minded behavior'' by the two partners would threaten
their alliance at the national level.
	   Social Democrats, Greens and mine operator Rheinbraun agreed
early Friday on terms for protecting wetlands near the 48 square
kilometer (19 square mile) mine at Garzweiler, officials said.
	   Garzweiler has strained the state coalition for months. In the
latest tussle, the mine operator rejected demands by the Greens to
limit its water use rights to 19 years and to allow authorities to
revoke them at any time. The final deal sets a 25-year period and
contains no revocation clause.

Van Hooijdonk returns to Nottingham Forest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be updated after Van Hooijdonk news conference

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk
returned under tight security Friday to England's Nottingham
Forest, three months after he walked away from the Premier League
Club claiming it lacked ambition.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who scored 34 goals last season and helped Forest
gain promotion to the Premier League, was escorted by a dozen
security guards at the City Ground as he was rushed into a meeting
with manager Dave Bassett. He then joined his teammates for a light
workout.
	   Bassett has admitted being unhappy with Van Hooijdonk's return
and said he will attempt to sell him on the transfer market.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who helped the Netherlands to a fourth place at
the World Cup in France, was placed on the transfer list three
months ago when he refused to rejoin the club during summer
training.
	   But there were no takers for the 8-million pound (dlrs 13.4
million) asking price, leaving Van Hooijdonk to train with his
former Dutch club NAC Breda.
	   His refusal to rejoin the club angered many Nottingham Forest
fans, who view him as one in a long line of foreign stars in the
country who have not always shown loyalty to their English sides.
	   But with Forest lying three points from the bottom of the league
table, the fans may be willing to forgive Van Hooijdonk if he can
score goals.
	   ``He has proved his point,'' 23-year-old fan David Vaughan said.
``He reckoned the team was not good enough and it isn't. If he
comes back and gets the goals to take us up the table then it's
worth it.

EU says China still not ready for WTO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After 12 years of negotiations, China is still
not willing to make the market-opening concessions needed to join
the World Trade Organization, a European Union delegation said
Friday.
	   ``We have made progress, but we have not made sufficient
progress,'' Sir Leon Brittan, Vice President of the European
Commission, said after two days of meetings in Beijing.
	   China argues it has already gone a long way toward meeting
membership conditions of the body that sets rules for global trade.
It has accused members of the body of making excessive demands on
China in negotiations on the country's bid to join.
	   Brittan said he understood that ``China has difficulties in
going too far.'' But he also said China has further to go.
	   ``China so far has not been prepared to move sufficiently in
opening up its markets to financial services, to insurance,
banking, and securities'' and telecommunications, he said at a news
conference.
	   He also described China's conditions on foreign investment as
``very restrictive.''
	   Brittan was in China with a delegation led by Jacques Santer,
who arrived Thursday on the first visit by an EC president in 12
years.
	   In a meeting with Santer on Thursday, Chinese Vice Premier Li
Lanqing urged the EU to be ``more flexible and practical'' in
negotiations on China's bid to join the WTO.
	   Brittan, however, said joining the WTO entailed ``an exchange of
obligations'' and was ``not membership of a club that you give to
your friends because you like them.''
	   ``You have access to other people's markets, in return you have
to open up your own markets to the extent that is appropriate for
the economy of your size and your state of development _ and you
have to be prepared to observe the rules,'' he said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
at least 60 people and injuring about 180. The fast-spreading fire
completely gutted the two-story building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' Although an estimated 400 people, most aged
13 to 18, were at the dance on the upper floor, the facility had
approval for a maximum capacity of 110, Aake Jacobsson, the rescue
services chief of the Goteborg fire department, was quoted as
telling the Swedish news agency TT. The fire, at the facilities of
the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest
in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the
town of Boraas. Police said most victims choked to death on smoke
and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene, and the
60th victim died at a hospital, officials said. (SWEDEN-FIRE)
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Smiling ``from one ear to the
other,'' John Glenn savored the view as he cruised 340 miles (547
kilometers) above Earth and surpassed the length of his first
voyage 36 years ago. The world's oldest astronaut also found time
Thursday to begin the experiments that are the real purpose of his
trip aboard the shuttle _ making himself a human guinea pig to
study the aging process in space. Soon after Glenn blasted off from
Cape Canaveral, Florida, with six crewmates aboard Discovery, he
shared his excitement _ and his magnificent vista _ with the world.
``Boy, enjoying the show,'' he told Mission Control as Discovery
soared over Hawaii. ``I don't know what happens on down the line,
but today is beautiful and great.'' Glenn also was quick to put to
rest any fears about how his 77-year-old body would readapt to
microgravity. ``Zero-g and I feel fine,'' he said, reprising a
phrase from his historic flight on Feb. 20, 1962, when he became
the first American to orbit the Earth. (US-GLENN-SHUTTLE)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Anti-terrorist squads shot dead a hijacker
of a Turkish plane after a seven-hour standoff Friday at Ankara's
airport _ in a clear message that Turkey does not tolerate
terrorist actions to promote Kurdish problems. ``Those who wanted
to spill blood on the Republican Day could not reach their goal,''
Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said after the ordeal. None of the 38
passengers and crew held hostage was injured. ``I believe that the
success of our security forces will be a deterrent and such
attempts will not happen again,'' Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said. A hijacker, armed with a Russian-made hand grenade
and a gun, took over the Ankara-bound flight Thursday night as
Turkey celebrated its 75th anniversary as a secular republic with
street parties, official balls and fireworks. The hijacker said he
was protesting Turkey's crackdown on Kurdish rebels, according to
accounts from the government and passengers. Kurdish rebels have
been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since 1984. The
conflict has killed close to 37,000 people. (TURKEY-HIJACKING)
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Intensifying their crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police on Friday cut the telephone
lines of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin and the group's leading
activists. They also prevented a Hamas march in the West Bank.
Security officials said more than 100 Hamas activists have been
arrested in the Gaza Strip since Thursday's suicide attack on an
Israeli convoy. The unprecedented decision to silence Yassin came
after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with his security chiefs
to chart the next stage of the campaign against Hamas that Israel
says is a precondition for a timely West Bank troop withdrawal. On
Friday morning, armed Palestinian policemen and plainclothes agents
blocked the sandy streets leading to Yassin's home in a Gaza City
slum and ordered journalists to leave. Cars were searched and
passers-by questioned. Yassin has been under house arrest since
Thursday. It was a stunning move by Arafat who in the year since
Yassin's release from an Israeli jail has bent over backward to
avoid open conflict with him. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's government is delaying an
investigation into a soldier's claim that he helped bury hundreds
of Tamils killed by security forces, Amnesty International said in
a statement on Friday. The government ordered an inquiry in July
into the soldier's account of a mass grave in the Tamil heartland
of Jaffna, but the probe has since made little progress. Rights
group Amnesty International said the government has neglected to
guarantee the investigators' safety. The soldier made the claim
while appealing a death sentence in Colombo after his conviction in
a rape and murder case. He is among five soldiers and a policeman
who were sentenced to death on July 3 for the rape and murder of a
Tamil schoolgirl and her family. The six said they were innocent of
murder and merely buried the girl, her family and many other bodies
of people killed over several months. (SRI LANKA-MASS GRAVES)

Israel to build access roads to Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Attempting the deflect settler criticism of the
land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians, the Israeli
government announced Friday that work on new to roads remote Jewish
settlements is to start next week.
	   Some Jewish settlements would be virtually surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory under terms of the Wye River
agreement, signed a week ago by Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
	   Israel is to hand over another 13.1 percent of the territory to
Palestinian civilian control over 12 weeks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged earlier this
week that ``not a single Israeli settlement'' will be an enclave in
Palestinian-controlled land. On Friday, he chaired a meeting of
ministers and officials to discuss how to strengthen the
settlements in outlying areas.
	   The ministers approved dlrs 58 million (250 million shekels) and
decided that construction work would begin Sunday.
	   Settlers are spearheading a campaign against the Wye accords,
charging that their safety will be endangered by an Israeli pullout
from land near their communities.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, criticized a
reported plan by Israel to build 1,000 more homes in settlements
that are to become isolated as a result of a pullback.
	   ``This is a unilateral move. We have agreed that it stop,''
Arafat said Friday, referring to the Mideast summit in the United
States earlier this month.

Indonesian military denies reports of troop build-up in East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with denial by military chief, grafs 12-14
 &UR; AP Photos JAK101-2

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior military officer in East
Timor on Friday denied Australian media reports that troop numbers
in the disputed territory are far in excess of those claimed by the
Indonesian government.
	   The reports contradict Indonesia's claims that it has reduced
troop numbers as it tries to negotiate a U.N.-sponsored peace deal
with Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald reported Friday that the records
showed there were more than 21,000 Indonesian troops and
auxiliaries in East Timor in August, including almost 8,000
``penugasan,'' or assigned troops.
	   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the 8,000 were
combat troops, part of an overall military force of about 17,000 in
East Timor.
	   The Australian newspaper said that more than 100 pages of leaked
documents confirm the continued presence of units of the army's
elite special forces, Kopassus.
	   East Timor military chief of staff Lt. Col. Supadi told The
Associated Press on Friday that the number of troops in East Timor
stands at 15,000 after about 1,000 were withdrawn in July and
August.
	   This includes 5,000 personnel who include medical teams,
engineers and troops engaged in community development work. About
6,000 of the total are East Timorese-born, he said.
	   He did not comment on the veracity of the documents that are now
being circulated in Australia by activists who want independence
for East Timor.
	   Supadi denied news reports that claimed that Indonesian troops
had recently clashed with rebel guerrillas in the eastern part of
Timor Island.
	   ``It is very clear that there have been no armed or physical
contacts for the past five months with the guerrillas,'' Supadi
said.
	   Supadi said there have been troop movements in East Timor in
recent weeks. However, this had been for the distribution of food
and other aid to poor areas on the island.
	   Later in the day, Indonesia Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto
also denied the report he described as ``nonsense.''
	   ``How come the number of our troops in East Timor increases
while we have gradually withdrawn them,'' Wiranto said after a
meeting with President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``I want to check first, but it is nonsense if the number of our
troops is said to have increased.''
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading the previous
year during a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize
Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island territory.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan this month called for an end
to military activity and urged Indonesia to withdraw many of its
troops from the contested territory.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Friday warned that
the disclosure of troops numbers in East Timor could derail the
reconciliation process.
	   ``We've argued for two and a half years that an important
component of confidence building in East Timor is to reduce numbers
of troops,'' Downer told ABC radio.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
higher Friday, but bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where the key index fell on worries over Japanese corporate
earnings. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed
104.21 points, or 0.76 percent, closing the week at 13,564.51. On
Thursday, the index gained 152.65 points, or 1.13 percent. Share
prices initially moved higher, responding to news that Mitsui Trust
and Banking Corp., a major Japanese trust bank, was to withdraw
from overseas banking as part of restructuring plans. Elsewhere,
share prices rose in the Philippines, Hong Kong, South Korea,
Singapore, Taipei, New Zealand and Australia. Prices fell in
Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest banks announced drastic
restructuring plans Friday, calling for massive job cuts at Sakura
Bank Ltd. and a withdrawal from overseas operations for Mitsui
Trust and Banking Co. Sakura, the core bank of the powerful Mitsui
industrial group, said it will slash 3,000 jobs, or 20 percent of
its total work force, within three years. The cost-cutting move
comes as Sakura and many other Japanese banks scramble to secure
funds to write off huge loads of bad loans amid the country's worst
recession since World War II. Less than two months ago, Sakura
asked Toyota Motor Corp. and other Mitsui group members to shore up
its eroded capital base with an emergency infusion of more than 300
billion yen (dlrs 2.59 billion). Kyodo News agency reported Friday
that Toyota President Hiroshi Okuda indicated his company would not
necessarily provide the funds, saying any decision would depend
solely on the attractiveness of the return on its investment.
(JAPAN-BANKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government collected more taxes in
October than in September, a rare bit of good news for a country
struggling to overcome an economic crisis, the tax chief announced
Friday. Russians _ many reluctantly _ paid 13 billion rubles (dlrs
812 million) in taxes so far this month, up from 9.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 581 million) in September, said Georgy Boos, head of Russia's
Federal Tax Service. Boos said that was well over his October
target of 9.5 billion rubles (dlrs 593 million). Collecting taxes
has been a chronic problem for the Russian government. But it's
been even tougher in the past few months because of the financial
crisis that erupted in mid-August and lower revenues from Russian
oil companies due to a drop in world oil prices. One of Russia's
big oil companies, Sibneft, disclosed Friday that it suffered a
loss of dlrs 60.4 million in the first half of this year, compared
with a net profit of dlrs 13.7 million a year ago. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After 12 years of negotiations, China is still
not willing to make the market-opening concessions needed to join
the World Trade Organization, a European Union delegation said
Friday. ``We have made progress, but we have not made sufficient
progress,'' Sir Leon Brittan, Vice President of the European
Commission, said after two days of meetings in Beijing. China
argues it has already gone a long way toward meeting membership
conditions of the body that sets rules for global trade. It has
accused members of the body of making excessive demands on China in
negotiations on the country's bid to join. Brittan said he
understood that ``China has difficulties in going too far.'' But he
also said China has further to go. ``China so far has not been
prepared to move sufficiently in opening up its markets to
financial services, to insurance, banking, and securities'' and
telecommunications, he said at a news conference. (CHINA-EU)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Unemployment in France edged down to 11.7 percent
in September, from 11.8 percent in August, the Labor Ministry
reported Friday. ``All the indications are good,'' said Labor
Minister Martine Aubry, speaking on Europe-1 radio. Economists had
forecast unemployment to stay at 11.8 percent in September _ the
same as in August. There were 43,000 fewer people seeking
employment in September than in August, according to figures from
the French employment agency ANPE. It said there were a total of
3,011 million jobseekers in September, down 0.9 percent from August
and down 6.6 percent from a year ago. Jobseekers aged 25 and
younger were benefiting the most from the lower unemployment, it
said. That is a good sign, because recent strikes by high school
students protesting school conditions showed a deep undercurrent of
uncertainty among young people about their job prospects once they
leave school. (FRANCE-UNEMPLOYMENT)

EU countries endorse plan on Portugal beef ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union endorsed a plan
Friday to ban the export of beef and cattle from Portugal, EU farm
officials said.
	   The move cleared the way for the EU executive Commission to
impose the ban. The 20-member Commission is now set to impose the
ban at a regular meeting next Wednesday, a Commission official
said. The ban will take effect that day or within days of the
meeting, Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely said.
	   The Commission proposed the export ban Wednesday because of a
sharp rise this year in the number of cases of ``mad cow disease''
- or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - in cattle in Portugal this
year. BSE in beef has been linked to a fatal brain ailment in
humans.
	   The proposed ban was approved Friday by veterinary officials
from all EU countries except Portugal, Ireland, Belgium and
Britain, the farm officials said.	   The officials from Portugal and Ireland voted against the ban,
while the officials from Belgium and Britain abstained. Still,
their lack of support was not sufficient to block the proposal.
	   The Commission plans to ban the export of beef from Portugal for
nine months and to ban indefinitely the export of cattle from the
country. It plans to review the cattle export ban after 18 months.
	   Portugal has reported at least 67 cases of BSE this year,
according to the Commission. The total number of BSE cases that had
been reported in Portugal at the start of the year was 91,
according to the Commission.

Nathan Blake leaves Bolton for Rovers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Welsh international striker Nathan
Blake signed with Blackburn on Friday in a 4.25-million-pound (dlrs
7 million) transfer from Bolton.
	   The deal is subject to Blake passing a medical test, and Rovers
hope he can complete the exam in time for Saturday's Premier League
game at Wimbledon.
	   Blake, 26, will join Dario Marcolin _ a 27-year-old Italian
midfielder who is on loan from Lazio for the rest of the season _
at Ewood Park.
	   The move for the Bolton striker represents a consolation for
Rovers' manager Roy Hodgson after he failed to land Coventry's Dion
Dublin, who turned down a possible 6.75-million-pound (dlrs 11.1
million) transfer.
	   Blackburn, decimated by injuries, is struggling near the bottom
of the Premier League.

Austrian cardinal will returns to Austria from exile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Ailing Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, the
Austrian cardinal accused of sexually molesting young boys, has
returned from a six-month exile near Dresden, Germany, Austrian
media reported Friday.
	   Groer, 78 relinquished in April all his duties in the Roman
Catholic Church under orders from Pope John Paul II. He left
Austria soon afterward _ the first time since the Nazi era that any
high-ranking cleric has been sent into exile.
	   The allegations against Groer came from former pupils and monks.
They initially surfaced in 1995 _ when he was Austria's most senior
churchman _ and then again late last year, causing the church its
most severe crisis here since World War II.
	   Austrian state radio said the cardinal was suffering from
prostate cancer and returned to Austria for health reasons at the
request of doctors at a hospital in St. Poelten, 60 kilometers (38
miles) west of Vienna, where he is being treated.
	   Groer returned to the Marienfeld nunnery at Maria Roggendorf in
Lower Austria province, where he had lived after his retirement as
cardinal.
	   The cardinal never apologized admitted publicly any wrongdoing.
But a statement issued on his behalf by the the Apostolic
Nunciature, the Vatican's embassy in Austria, noted the allegations
and ``often inaccurate assertions about my person.''
	   ``I beg God and people for forgiveness, if I have burdened
myself with guilt,'' the statement added. ``Of course I am ready to
follow a request of the Holy Father and to give up what has until
now been my sphere of activity.''

Former Yeltsin spokesman gets Moscow city job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's former spokesman, fired for
promoting Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov as a candidate for prime
minister, has been given a top job in the Moscow city government, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky was abruptly fired in mid-September after
the prime minister's job went instead to Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Now he has accepted a job as deputy prime minister of the Moscow
city government in charge of international relations, Kommersant
reported.
	   ``For the Moscow mayor, who is no longer hiding his presidential
ambitions, it is now very important to establish relations with the
West,'' Kommersant said.
	   ``Nobody really knows him outside of Russia, and like anything
unknown, he is causing misgivings. It's not hard to guess that
Yastrzhembsky's main task will be promoting Luzhkov in the West,''
Kommersant said.
	   A former diplomat, Yastrzhembsky was widely credited with giving
a smooth, professional face to the Kremlin press service and
frequently rescuing Yeltsin from his own words and actions.
	   Yastrzhembsky, 44, was a former ambassador to Slovakia and
Foreign Ministry spokesman when he was appointed Yeltsin's top
spokesman in August 1996.
	   He was at Yeltsin's side almost continually, and was frequently
called on to explain the president's sometimes erratic behavior and
incongruous remarks.
	   Luzhkov, a powerful and popular man in Moscow, which he has
turned into Russia's only boomtown, is a potential top choice in
the 2000 presidential election.
	   Some Russians are wary of his perceived authoritarian
tendencies, however, and it is remains unclear how much support he
can muster in the impoverished provinces, which resent Moscow's
wealth.

Israel to build access roads to Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Friday attempted to deflect settler
criticism of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians
by announcing that work on new roads to remote Jewish settlements
is to start in two days.
	   Some Jewish settlements would be virtually surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled territory under terms of the new peace
agreement, signed a week ago by Israeli and Palestinian leaders in
the United States.
	   Israel is to hand over another 13.1 percent of the territory to
Palestinian civilian control over 12 weeks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged earlier this
week that ``not a single Israeli settlement'' will be an enclave in
Palestinian-controlled land. On Friday, he chaired a meeting of
ministers and officials to discuss how to strengthen the
settlements in outlying areas.
	   The ministers approved dlrs 58 million (250 million shekels) and
decided that construction work would begin Sunday.
	   Settlers are spearheading a campaign against the peace accord,
charging that their safety will be endangered by an Israeli pullout
from land near their communities.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, criticized a
reported plan by Israel to build 1,000 more homes in settlements
that are to become isolated as a result of a pullback.
	   ``This is a unilateral move. We have agreed that it stop,''
Arafat said Friday, referring to the Mideast summit in the United
States earlier this month.

Iran's leader heaps insults on Arafat for deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced
Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful ... traitor,'' heaping on the
Palestinian leader some of the worst insults he has faced for
signing a peace accord with Israel.
	   ``He is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply
immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah
Khamenei said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University.
	   Khamenei was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no
surrender, combat Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of
worshipers hearing him.
	   Most top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami,
Cabinet ministers, Parliament members and military officers were
present.
	   The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in
the capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed
intensive media campaigns encouraging people to take part.
	   Although the gist of Khamenei's speech reflected Iran's
longstanding opposition to any Palestinian peace with Israel, the
sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric.
	   Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless
and is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian
resistance, let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said.
	   Arafat singed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Oct. 23, promising to crack down on Islamic militants
in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent of
West Bank.
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations but
none matched the words of the Iranian leader.
	   Khamenei said the agreement is aimed at creating security for
Israel through the hands of ``Palestinian traitors.''
	   He criticized the United States for brokering the agreement,
which he said only served Washington's interests.
	   ``In this agreement, Mr. Yasser Arafat is executing the orders
of the prosecutor, Israel and the judge, America. Shame on this
disgraceful man,'' he said.
	   He said the agreement would not achieve its objective of
providing security for Israel.
	   ``They want to create security for the Zionist regime but they
can not. The occupying Zionist regime cannot have one single moment
of relaxed sleep. God will take their relaxation and tranquility
from them. They have money, they have weapons, but they don't have
relaxation. They have everything except the possibility of a good
life,'' Khamenei said.

Rebels say Mandela could mediate peace in Congo war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The leader of rebels fighting to
oust Congo President Laurent Kabila on Friday said President Nelson
Mandela could preside over peace talks.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Pretoria after meeting with
Mandela on Thursday, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, president of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, said Mandela could again act as
peacemaker in the vast, but war ravaged country.
	   Last year Mandela brokered negotiations between Kabila and the
man he threw out of power, dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   ``We would not be surprised if the kind of role he played last
time couldn't be repeated,'' Wamba dia Wamba said. ``If he is the
one who could bring this thing to a successful fruition then we
want that kind of role for him.''
	   The rebels took up arms Aug. 2, accusing Kabila of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400
tribes.
	   After a lightning march on the capital Kinshasa the rebels were
pushed back into their eastern strongholds by troops from several
nearby countries, including Angola, Namibia, Chad and Zimbabwe,
which rushed to Kabila's aid.
	   Numerous attempts at a peace settlement, most recently this week
at a meeting in the Zambian capital Lusaka, have failed, chiefly
because Kabila refuses to talk directly with the rebels, charging
they are acting on behalf of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Mandela has met in recent weeks with the leaders of Namibia and
Rwanda.
	   Wamba dia Wamba said he briefed Mandela about the situation in
the Congo and Mandela told him the rebels ``should not be treated
as second-class citizens in the discussions'' on peace.
	   Meanwhile, in Namibia, witnesses on Friday reported a sudden
surge in military activity at the Grootfontein Military Base,
Namibia's forward staging post for sending troops to the Congo.
	   Witness described convoys of armored vehicles and planes loaded
with soldiers arriving at the base.
	   Kabila's foreign allies promised last week to take the war to
the rebels, a risky move that could bog troops down in the vast
jungles covering the east of the country.

Aid group reports Serbs continuing attacks, terror campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Serb forces are still waging a campaign of terror
against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, and thousands of
refugees are still threatened by disease and starvation, a
French-based aid group said Friday.
	   Doctors of the World criticized reports, including one by the
French Foreign Ministry on Thursday, that only a few thousand
homeless refugees remain and that conditions are improving.
	   Under threat of NATO air strikes, Serb forces have been pulling
out and refugees are returning home.
	   But Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic has been violating the NATO
accords, with his purple-clad special forces continuing attacks as
late as Thursday, said Dr. Olivier Brochu, team director for
``Medecins du Monde'' in Kosovo.
	   ``They have left the main roads. But you still see the special
forces hiding in the woods, well armed,'' Brochu told a news
conference.
	   A 2,000-member observer force under the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe is to be deployed in the mainly
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia, where rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   The international community ``should perhaps hurry up and put
them in place,'' said Dr. Michel Brugiere, director-general of
Doctors of the World.
	   Brugiere also said it was a mistake to lift the NATO air strike
ultimatum. ``Having lifted the ultimatum posed a great risk to that
population,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, Serbs shelled Isaraluka, a village of 400-600
people southwest of Pristina, between Orahovac and Suva Reka.
Brochu said there were ``many dead,'' but he had no figures.
	   On Saturday, a refugee camp of 1,200 people was shelled near the
village of Terpec and Komorane, west of Pristina, he said. Casualty
figures were not available, he said.
	   Last week, Serb forces attacked the village of Cireq, near
Mitrovica northwest of Pristina, in an area where about
17,000-20,000 people live, Brochu said.
	   They destroyed a health center and a food depot, and a doctor
was tortured and killed, he said.
	   Brochu said the Serbs' strategy is to terrorize a village
overnight with special forces, then shell it at dawn.
	   On Thursday, the French Foreign Ministry said a Franco-German
fact-finding team in Kosovo between Sunday and Wednesday observed
about 8,000 remaining homeless and improving humanitarian
conditions.
	   But Brochu said that instead, 50,000 refugees in tents live in
``abominable sanitary conditions. There is the risk of epidemics.
... In the last five, six days, we're seeing the first cases of
malnutrition.''

Guinea-Bissau president, rebel chief discuss end to conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's president and the leader
of the West African nation's rebels have opened peace talks in an
attempt to end a five-month-old conflict, according to news reports
Friday.
	   President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig. Ansumane Mane embraced
when they met late Thursday in the Gambian capital Banjul, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   The first face-to-face talks between the foes, mediated by
Gambian President Yaya Jammeh, continued into the night, Lusa said.
	   Diplomats from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea _
Guinea-Bissau's neighbors _ and from France, Portugal and Sweden,
which have interests in the region, also attended the talks,
according to Lusa.
	   Vieira and Mane were to travel Friday to a meeting of West
African leaders in the Nigerian capital Abuja, Lusa said.
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a
breakaway military faction _ mostly army veterans angered by poor
pay and conditions _ seized the main army garrison and
international airport in the capital Bissau.
	   They accused Vieira of corruption and demanded that he step
down.
	   Senegal and the Republic of Guinea sent troops to support Vieira
after most of his army joined the rebellion.
	   However, the insurgents have overrun most of the small country
and the foreign troops reportedly are pinned in the capital near
the presidential palace.
	   There was no reliable information on the number of killed and
wounded in the fighting.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.

Yeltsin goes on vacation, aide says he will voluntarily cut his

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin arriving in Sochi, council to be formed
to consider constitutional amendments. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An exhausted Boris Yeltsin began a Black Sea
vacation on Friday, and a senior aide said the Russian president
would formally restrict his political powers early next year.
	   Yeltsin entered a rest home in the woods outside Moscow on
Tuesday to receive treatment and recover from what doctors said was
extreme fatigue and unstable blood pressure.
	   The president's condition forced him to abruptly cancel a
scheduled trip to Austria, renewing concern about his ability to
serve the rest of his term ending in the summer 2000.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has remained largely out of public view since the
country was hit by an economic crisis in mid-August, and his deputy
chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev acknowledged earlier this week that the
president had turned control over the economy to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   On Friday, Sysuyev went a step further, saying that the
president would formally announce his reduced political role in a
speech to parliament early next year.
	   Yeltsin feels comfortable giving the new Cabinet responsibility
for day-to-day government affairs because it was formed with
parliament's support, the Financial Times of London quoted Sysuyev
as saying.
	   ``The political situation in Russia has changed,'' Sysuyev said.
``In the past, the president engaged in every aspect of running the
country.''
	   He added that Yeltsin would serve the rest of his term and must
preserve his constitutional powers to ensure that the next
presidential elections are democratic.
	   Yeltsin's press secretary, Dmitry Yakushkin, also said Friday
that constitutional amendments limiting the president's powers were
out of the question, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He said an expert council was being formed to review other
proposed changes to the Russian Constitution. He said the panel
would be appointed in November.
	   Communists and other Yeltsin opponents have demanded his early
resignation and immediate changes in the constitution to curb the
president's sweeping powers. The Communist Party leadership was
meeting Friday to discuss their election strategy.
	   Many politicians have called for, among other things, the
restoration of the vice president's post, abolished in 1993 after
the last holder of the office, Alexander Rutskoi, led an
anti-Yeltsin revolt.
	   Before leaving for a two-week vacation to the Black Sea resort
of Sochi, Yeltsin met with Primakov to hear discuss the European
Union meeting in Austria, which the prime minister attended Tuesday
in place of the president.
	   Primakov also briefed Yeltsin about his talks Thursday with the
leader of breakaway Chechnya and other issues, the Interfax news
agency said.
	   Russian TV broadcast pictures of their meeting at Moscow's
Vnukovo 2 Airport, showing Yeltsin sitting across from Primakov at
a small table, wearing a suit and tie. He was also shown walking
quite stiffly across the tarmac to a waiting plane, and waving from
the door with his wife, Naina.
	   Several months before Yeltsin's latest illness and the economic
crisis, the Communist-led opposition in parliament has started an
impeachment campaign against the president. The campaign is widely
expected to fizzle like previous such attempts.
	   A poll by the independent Public Opinion Foundation found 75
percent of Russians supported impeaching Yeltsin, while 16 percent
opposed it.
	   The poll, conducted on Oct. 17 among 1,500 people throughout the
country, gave no margin of error.

Prosecutor seeks prison for Siberian mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prosecutor called Friday for a seven-year prison
term for the mayor of a small Siberian city charged with misusing
government funds following an investigation triggered by his
reported mob links.
	   Gennady Konyakhin, the mayor of Leninsk-Kuznetsky, was accused
of misappropriating 624,000 rubles (dlrs 39,000 at current exchange
rates) in government resources, including 334,000 rubles (dlrs
20,875) worth of free accommodation granted to a group of builders
in a city hotel, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Another 235,000 rubles (dlrs 14,687) was misspent as a result of
an arbitrary increase in the cost of repairs of a building leased
by Konyakhin, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Konyakhin, who was arrested in October 1997, has pleaded
innocent.
	   Former Mayor Leonid Astafyev and driver Nikolai Borozinets were
also implicated by the prosecutor. He asked for a suspended
four-year sentence for Astafyev, but no sentence for Borozinets
whose offenses were committed a long time ago.
	   Konyakhin was elected in the spring of 1997 and became known
nationwide after the influential newspaper Izvestia accused him of
being linked to the mob.
	   President Boris Yeltsin threw his weight behind the newspaper
story, calling for a thorough investigation of Konyakhin's
activities and saying the case exemplified the growing criminal
infiltration of officialdom.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying the government draw-down in
Kosovo is incomplete, the province's main ethnic Albanian leader
called Friday for establishment of a new police force to convince
refugees it's safe to return home.
	   Despite substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army
units from Kosovo, only a few of the thousands of ethnic Albanians
who fled during a government crackdown against separatist rebels
have returned home.
	   In one exceptional case, most of the 3,000 refugees camped near
the village of Kisna Reka 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of
Pristina went back to their homes Thursday.
	   ``Even if they try to kill me ... I'm not going back to the
mountains,'' said Isa Qelaj, 75. ``It is too cold.''
	   But thousands more are still believed camped in the hills and
forests.

Guinea-Bissau fighting to dominate West African summit

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Guinea-Bissau president, rebel leader to go to
Abuja. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The crisis in Guinea-Bissau is likely to
dominate the summit of West African heads of state starting Friday
in Nigeria, officials said Friday.
	   President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who is attending the
meeting as an observer, is also expected to push for renewed
mediation efforts to end the fighting in Congo, according to
Nigerian officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The summit, of the 16-member Economic Community of West African
States, or ECOWAS, will include top officials from Ghana, Benin,
Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Niger and Senegal.
	   The meeting will also delve into what Nigeria's planning
minister, Rasheed Gbadamosi, called ``the precarious financial
situation of the community.''
	   Membership dues for the group are about dlrs 40 million overdue.
	   Fighting began in Guinea-Bissau on June 7, with a coup attempt
in the capital, Bissau, by former army chief of staff Brig.
Ansumane Mane, who accuses President Joao Bernardo Vieira of
corruption.
	   On Thursday, Mane and Vieira flew to the tiny West African
nation of Gambia where they embraced before beginning their first
face-to-face talks on ending five months of fighting, Portuguese
news reports said. The talks continued well into Thursday night and
the two men were to travel Friday to the Abuja summit, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.
	   A cease-fire was declared July 26 but fighting broke out again
10 days ago.

In a flash, dance turns deadly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sweden-Fire
 &UR; By ANNE PANDOLFI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ With the shout of ''fire,'' the
Halloween dance changed from a delight to a horror. The teen-agers
who had been moving to the music suddenly fled in fright to the
exits.
	   ``A light went out. Somebody yelled 'fire.' And then somebody
shouted 'evacuate,''' said Elizabeth Moya, 17, one of an estimated
400 young people at the dance.
	   She was fortunate. She made it through a door, down stairs and
outside to safety. Behind her, youths were crushed in the surge to
escape; rescuers found 59 dead at the scene and another died at a
hospital.
	   Standing outside the charred brick building Friday morning, amid
lit candles, bouquets of flowers and dazed family and friends of
the victims, 15-year-old Christian Czari said, ``Everybody
panicked.''
	   ``Nobody cared about the girls. The strongest made way first.
Kids were fighting each other to get out.''
	   The fire started shortly before midnight. The first fire truck
arrived less than five minutes later, but too late to stop the
worst of the tragedy.
	   Bojan Jovanich, a high school student, said it was the disc
jockey who yelled ``fire'' just before he jumped out a second-story
window.
	   ``We couldn't see much because the lights had gone out,'' he
said. ``Then we saw the flames.''
	   Some boys bent back the metal grill on a window, tied a long
curtain and apparently intended to slide down. They gave up and
jumped, Jovanich said. Others caught fire _ their hair, their
clothes. ``It was a terrible sight,'' he said. ``Thank good God I'm
alive.''
	   Czari and others tried to carry or drag injured companions to a
nearby car rental shop that served as a first aid center. He gave
up because the bodies were ``sticky'' with blood and burns. ``The
skin wasn't there any more.''
	   The dance was to celebrate All Saints Day and a holiday weekend.
Many of the victims apparently were from Goteborg's large immigrant
community.
	   There are sizeable groups from 70-80 nationalities _ notably
Syrians, Kurds, Somalians and Bosnians _ in Sweden's second-largest
city, located about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of
Stockholm.
	   A young woman with tears in her eyes waited for news about
survivors at the Lutheran Church in suburban Hammarkullen,
converted to a crisis center. She said her foster brother is
missing. She appeared calm, but said, ``There's chaos inside of
me.''

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa will reduce the
intervention force in Lesotho to 2,100 from 3,500 troops, the
defense ministry said.
	   No date for the reduction was announced.
	   South African troops intervened in September to quash tension
caused by opposition protests to election results and an army
mutiny. Scores were killed and much of the downtown destroyed in
the intervention.
	   Meanwhile, a bill to establish an authority to prepare for
elections within 18 months in the tiny mountain kingdom inside
South Africa was introduced Friday in the Lesotho National
Assembly.
	   The Interim Political Authority Bill of 1998 was approved at a
meeting of Lesotho's political party leaders chaired by South
African Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi on
Wednesday in Maseru.
	   It was also agreed that a body would be set up to facilitate
preparations for the election. Debate was to start Monday.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The family of a Zimbabwean soldier who
died in the Congo said they received only his head for burial, an
independent newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Zimbabwe Mirror said the soldier, identified as Douglas
Maforere, died in unclear circumstances on Oct. 13 in Congo, where
Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops backing Congolese President Laurent
Kabila.
	   The Mirror report, under large headlines, was expected to fuel
growing opposition among Zimbabweans, traditionally superstitious
over death, to military involvement in Congo.
	   The Mirror said the Defense Ministry denied the family's claim
and said the soldier's body was flown home from Congo.
	   The military has been accused of failing to give full details of
its casualties in Congo and turning away families requesting news
of soldiers serving in the Congo.
	   --
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ A group of 122 orphans have been evacuated
from the capital of war-torn Guinea-Bissau to neighboring Senegal,
the International Committee of the Red Cross has reported.
	   The children, accompanied by Red Cross officials and members of
the aid group SOS Children Kinderdorf, arrived Thursday at the
Senegalese border town of Wassadou, a faxed statement from the
international relief agency said.
	   The children, who traveled by road from Bissau in a Red Cross
convoy, are to be taken to the Gambian capital of Banjul, where
they will remain until peace returns to the country.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by fighting, which erupted June 7 when former
army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane began a rebellion.
	   --
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The government closed down a charity
hospital, forcing the discharge of more than 150 patients.
	   Swerelief Hospital was permanently shut down Thursday following
a Health Ministry directive issued earlier in the week.
	   Set up eight years ago to treat casualties from Liberia's
seven-year war, Swerelief later evolved into a regular hospital
catering to hundreds of people daily.
	   But reports of congestion and poor sanitary conditions forced
the government to order its closure to prevent outbreaks of
disease, health ministry officials said.
	   Swerelief's medical director Dr.Clarence Yaskey, told reporters
that the most seriously ill patients had been transferred to other
hospitals in the capital while a number of others had been sent to
a nearby emergency feeding center run by the aid group Doctors
Without Borders.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Western Kenya has had the country's
highest rate of AIDS since 1990 partly because tradition requires
men to marry their brother's widows in this highly populated area,
an official said.
	   ``AIDS is still a threat in Kenya,'' Dr. Godfrey Baltazar of the
National Aids and Sexually Transmitted Disease Control Program said
at a conference Thursday.
	   Its prevalence rose from 3 percent in 1993 to 9 percent last
year, he said. About 1.5 million Kenyans have been infected with
the immune-stripping disease since 1980.
	   Western Kenya's Nyanza province has the highest death rate from
AIDS, recording 7,000 deaths annually while more than 500,000
people have been diagnosed as HIV-positive.
	   The disease has spread rapidly because widow inheritance is
compulsory among most tribes in the region in the belief that
relatives must appease the dead, Baltazar said.
	   Often, a man transmits the AIDS virus to his wife before dying.
In turn, she gives the sexually transmitted disease to the dead
man's brother who subsequently marries her. The new husband then
gives the disease to his other wives.
	   Baltazar said more than 70 percent of those who have been
diagnosed with AIDS in western Kenya are ages 15 to 49.
	   Last week, the Health Ministry National HIV/AIDS Control Program
said an estimated 256,750 Kenyans have died of AIDS since 1980 when
the first case was reported in Kenya.
	   At least 300 delegates attended the three-day conference which
ended Friday.

Iran's leader heaps insults on Arafat for deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced
Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful ... traitor,'' heaping on the
Palestinian leader some of the worst insults he has faced for
signing a peace accord with Israel.
	   ``He is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply
immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah
Khamenei said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University.
	   Khamenei was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no
surrender, combat Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of
worshipers hearing him.
	   Most top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami,
Cabinet ministers, Parliament members and military officers were
present.
	   The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in
the capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed
intensive media campaigns encouraging people to take part.
	   Although the gist of Khamenei's speech reflected Iran's
longstanding opposition to any Palestinian peace with Israel, the
sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric.
	   Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless
and is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian
resistance, let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said.
	   Arafat signed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Oct. 23, promising to crack down on Islamic militants
in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent of
West Bank.

Georgian president welcomes oil transportation deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ President Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday
praised an agreement to transport the bulk of Caspian Sea oil
through Georgia _ a deal that could bring a great deal of badly
needed money.
	   ``We have won what we could not even dream of two or three years
ago,'' Shevardnadze said Friday, a day after he returned from
signing the agreement in Turkey.
	   Under the deal, Georgia will become the transit route for a
major pipeline carrying Azerbaijan's rich oil reserves to Turkey.
	   The pipeline will be built over the next four to five years,
Shevardnadze said. In the meantime, most oil exports from two
Caspian countries _ Azerbaijan and Kazakstan _ will go through
Georgia's Black Sea ports of Supsa and Batumi.
	   In yet more good news for Georgia, another Central Asian
country, Turkmenistan, has agreed to transport its natural gas
through Georgia, Shevardnadze told reporters.
	   ``This has great benefits for Georgia,'' he said.
	   The Caspian Sea oil reserves are believed to be second only to
the Persian Gulf, but development has been slow, and the absence of
a major export pipeline has stymied long-awaited prosperity.

Chinese group files suit against Japan over wartime rapes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nine Chinese women and the family of a woman who is
now dead sued Japan on Friday for 200 million yen (dlrs 1.7
million) for alleged rape by Japanese soldiers during World War II,
a news report said.
	   The group, from Shanxi Province, northeastern China, said in a
suit filed with the Tokyo District Court that the rapes by Imperial
Japanese Army soldiers were systematic, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The Chinese women were not among the thousands of women forced
to work in wartime brothels by the Japanese military.
	   The lawsuit said the women, who were in their early teens to
mid-20s, were repeatedly raped between 1941 and 1943 by Japanese
soldiers who broke into their homes in China, attacked and abducted
them, Kyodo reported.
	   The soldiers allegedly confined the women to houses they
occupied and beat them into providing sex.
	   The women accused the Japanese government of failing to provide
compensation as prescribed under international laws and to enact
laws to provide redress, the report said.
	   On Oct. 9, the Tokyo District Court dismissed a suit filed by 46
Filipino women forced to work in Japanese front-line brothels. The
court ruled that international laws do not allow personal demands
for compensation.

International conference praises new Albanian government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Seeking to promote stability in Europe's
poorest and most unstable country, officials from 25 countries met
here Friday to endorse efforts by the new prime minister to restore
order and revive the economy.
	   Speakers, including Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
and Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, expressed hope that
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko would succeed where his predecessors
had failed.
	   ``Since the new administration has taken office, the internal
situation in Albania has dramatically improved,'' Schuessel told
the one-day conference. ``Our presence here today gives ample proof
of the fact that the country is on its way toward enhanced
stability.''
	   Geremek, chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, also urged the opposition Democratic Party
of ex-President Sali Berisha to end its boycott of parliament and
work with Majko to restore stability.
	   ``I cannot support the boycott of the democratically elected
parliament,'' Geremek said. ``One has to respect the rules of
democracy, the rule of law.''
	   In April, the assassination of an opposition figure, Azem
Hajdari, led to riots in the capital by Berisha's followers. After
the riots ceased, Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned, and Majko
took office last month. But Berisha has continued boycotting
parliamemt.
	   U.S. deputy assistance secretary of state Eileen Malloy said
Berisha had ``excellent ideas about the future of Albania'' but
they must be expressed within ``he democratically elected
institutions'' rather than the streets.
	   The conference was called to discuss economic and other
assistance to this former Communist country, which has still not
recovered from nationwide riots which broke out in 1997 after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes.
	   But the session appeared aimed primarily at giving Majko's
Socialist government a clean bill of political health so that
increased aid to Albania could be justified to legislatures of the
participating governments.
	   Albania is believed to have received over dlrs 200 million from
donor countries since the last such gathering took place in Rome on
Oct. 17, 1997.
	   At the Rome meeting, Nano asked for dlrs 300 million, saying his
government had become stable enough politically to make sure the
aid was used properly.
	   Nano also promised his Cabinet would establish public order,
carry out economic reform, fight corruption, strengthen state
institutions and enact a constitution.
	   A year later, however, few of those promises have been kept.
This small Balkan country is deeply divided. Large areas,
especially Berisha's northern stronghold, are barely under the
control of the central government.
	   The Europeans are concerned that continued instability will lead
to more and more Albanians seeking to enter European Union
countries illegally. In addition, the country has become a base for
international drug and arms smuggling and for ethnic Albanians
fighting for independence in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Schuessel alluded to the impact of Albanian instability on
Kosovo, saying the ``illegal activities of armed people'' on both
sides of the frontier ``need to be addressed more vigorously.''
	   ``Rapid and comprehensive action is also needed to combat
organized crime, including smuggling, money laundering and drug
trafficking,'' he added.
	   Those attending the Friday conference will include the foreign
ministers of Italy and Greece, as well as representatives of the
United States, the European Union, Japan and the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been
monitoring events in Albania since last year.

Britain-Ireland team doubtful for Chile championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ A combined British-Irish team may
be forced to pull out of the World Amateur Golf Team Championship
in Chile in two weeks because of concerns for player safety.
	   Julie Hall, secretary of the Ladies' Golf Union, said Friday she
would follow the direction of Britain's Foreign Office, which is
advising against non-essential travel to Chile in the wake of the
arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   The women's tournament involving three dozen teams is set for
Nov. 12-15 is Santiago, the Chilean capital.
	   ``The Foreign Office continues to advise against travel, and we
will follow their direction,'' Hall said. ``We do not have to make
a decision until the end of next week, but if there is danger the
right thing is to pull out.''
	   The combined Britain and Ireland team members are Rebecca
Hudson, Becky Morgan, and Kim Andrew.
	   The men's event is set for Nov. 19-22 in Santiago, giving the
Royal and Ancient Club an extra week to decide on the trip. Men's
team members are Gary Wolstenholme, Luke Donald, Lorne Kelly and
Paddy Gribben.

Meier staying at Festina, Dufaux leaves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Following the departure of Alex
Zuelle and Laurent Dufaux, Armin Meier, the third Swiss rider
banned for taking a banned drug in this year's Tour de France, will
be staying with the Festina team, the Swiss sports agency SI
reported Friday.
	   Last week it was disclosed that Zuelle left Festina, which was
thrown out of the French race, and signed a two-year contract with
the Spanish cycling team Banesto.
	   Dufaux will join the Saeco team from the beginning of 1999,
according to Swiss press reports this week.
	   Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were banned from taking part in
competitions until May 1 next year after they admitted taking the
performance-enhancing hormone EPO.
	   The Festina team last week cut its budget for next season by
half and said its contracts with all its riders were being
renegotiated.
	   The new offer made to Zuelle was unacceptable, said Zuelle's
manager Marc Biver.
	   Dufaux will be getting ``a good deal'' with Saeco, the Lausanne
daily Le Matin quoted Biver, who is also Dufaux's manager, as
saying. He is expected to sign his contract with Saeco Monday.

	   The ruling gave a green light to Judge Baltasar Garzon to
continue with his investigations into the alleged crimes of
genocide, terrorism and torture committed by Pinochet during his
military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on this basis which
led to the detention of Pinochet in London on Oct. 16.
	   But his probe against the 82-year-old former Chilean leader was
snarled earlier this week when Britain's High Court ruled that, as
a former head of state, Pinochet had immunity from prosecution. He
has been kept under arrest pending an appeal.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he got the backing from his
National Court he would continue to seek the extradition as long as
Pinochet remained detained.

Economic potential strong in Japan, weak in America: Official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economic potential is very strong, while
high debt and low savings make the American economy the ``most
vulnerable,'' an influential Japanese finance official said Friday.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international affairs at
the Finance Ministry, acknowledged that the Japanese economy had
problems, but noted the nation's high savings rate is a major plus
in its favor.
	   ``Japan is facing a possible crisis. At such times it's
important to take dramatic steps,'' Eisuke Sakakibara said at a
Tokyo symposium. ``I think the most vulnerable economy is that of
the U.S.''
	   The comments come as Japan is battling its deepest recession
since the end of World War II. Unemployment and bankruptcies are at
record highs, and the banking system is hobbled by heaps of bad
debt.
	   Sakakibara's remarks contrast with the way economic woes have
generally been portrayed by Washington, which has been pushing
Japan to turn around its economy so it won't hurt the robust
American economy.
	   But Sakakibara said that in contrast to Americans, Japanese are
frugal savers, with more than 1 quadrillion yen (dlrs 8.6 trillion)
in savings.
	   The United States was more vulnerable, he said, because it was
the world's biggest debtor nation and because U.S. savings rates
have dropped to near zero.
	   Sakakibara also said Japanese bank managers are becoming more
aware about the need to cut costs in order to survive. He pointed
to Daiwa Bank's recent decision to pull back its overseas business
as an example.
	   Japan has passed laws approving the use of some 60 trillion yen
(dlrs 517 million) in public funds to bailout or help troubled
banks, estimated to have some dlrs 1 trillion in bad debts from the
excessive lending of the 1980s.

Businessmen raise bail for Polish bank scandal suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Business friends of banking fraud suspect
Boguslaw Bagsik have raised more than dlrs 1.1 million to bail him
out of jail, twice the amount necessary, according to newspaper
reports Friday.
	   Bagsik, along with five others, has been on trial since
February. Prosecutors say he defrauded the national bank of some
424 million zlotys (dlrs 121 million) in Poland's biggest
embezzlement case since its transition to a market economy.
	   Bagsik, the former head of the Art-B corporation, is accused of
duping the banking system by creating phantom accounts to rack up
interest. A 1991 investigation into Art-B led to the dismissal of
the national bank chairman.
	   The bail money came from business contacts of Bagsik in Poland
and in Israel, where he and his deputy Andrzej Gasiorowski fled
arrest in August 1991. Bagsik was arrested in 1994 in Switzerland
and has been jailed in Poland since his extradition two years ago.
	   Gasiorowski is still in Israel, where he helped collect bail
money, newspapers reported. The names of those who gave money were
not published, but their identities would be revealed if they post
the bail.

Van Hooijdonk returns to Nottingham Forest

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Van Hooijdonk quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk
returned under tight security Friday to England's Nottingham
Forest, three months after he walked away from the Premier League
Club claiming it lacked ambition.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who scored 34 goals last season and helped Forest
gain promotion to the Premier League, was escorted by a dozen
security guards at the City Ground as he was rushed into a meeting
with manager Dave Bassett. He then joined his teammates for a light
workout.
	   Bassett has admitted being unhappy with Van Hooijdonk's return
and said he will attempt to sell him on the transfer market.
	   Van Hooijdonk, saying ``I am a Forest player again,'' hopes to
be playing soon.
	   ``I am happy it is all over,'' he said.
	   ``I spoke to the players and the manager and what was said
should stay in the dressing room. The atmosphere was OK.''
	   ``We spoke about things that happened and came to the conclusion
that we have to get on with playing for Forest,'' he added. People
say things and you have to get on with it. I am a professional...
Hopefully I will be playing again soon.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who helped the Netherlands to a fourth place at
the World Cup in France, was placed on the transfer list three
months ago when he refused to rejoin the club during summer
training.
	   But there were no takers for the 8-million pound (dlrs 13.4
million) asking price, leaving Van Hooijdonk to train with his
former Dutch club NAC Breda.
	   His refusal to rejoin the club angered many Nottingham Forest
fans, who view him as one in a long line of foreign stars in the
country who have not always shown loyalty to their English sides.
	   But with Forest lying three points from the bottom of the league
table, the fans may be willing to forgive Van Hooijdonk if he can
score goals.
	   ``He has proved his point,'' 23-year-old fan David Vaughan said.
``He reckoned the team was not good enough and it isn't. If he
comes back and gets the goals to take us up the table then it's
worth it.''

Queen visits flooded areas; aid for farmers sought
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Queen Beatrix visited flooded
northern provinces Friday, offering support to Dutch farmers and
relief workers fighting to control damage to waterlogged fields and
villages.
	   After days of torrential rains, rescue workers managed to
stabilize dikes holding back rising waters in the mainly
agricultural provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Flevoland.
	   The threat of widespread flooding on the scale that prompted the
evacuations of up to 250,000 people in 1995 appeared to have eased.
But more rain was forecast for the weekend, adding anxiety as the
Dutch struggled to bear up under some of the highest rainfall in
three decades.
	   Local governments and farmers were assessing the damage to crops
and villages. Dutch television showed people sloshing around in hip
boots in their homes and preparing meals in kitchens flooded with a
foot (30 centimeters) of water.
	   On Friday, Royal Dutch Air Force planes flew photo
reconnaissance missions over the flooded region to monitor the
situation.
	   ``There is huge damage to Dutch agriculture,'' said Jack Luiten,
spokesman for the National Farmers Union. Flood damage was
estimated at 250 million guilders (dlrs 140 million).
	   The flooded lands have caused a grave situation for Dutch potato
farmers, who have lost up to 60 percent of their crop, Luiten said.
	   In the province of Drenthe, where potatoes comprise
three-quarters of the local economy, the flooding has dealt a
catastrophic blow to the livelihoods of many people.
	   ``There is great damage,'' said Harma Barelds of the provincial
government. ``All the potatoes will be destroyed after this rain.''
	   Farmers were hoping the queen's visit Friday would lead to
financial aid from the government. The Dutch parliament was
discussing compensation for farmers who have lost crops to the
flooding.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok, Defense Minister Frank de Grave and
other officials also have toured the area.
	   Though the Dutch must constantly battle with nature for their
low-lying land reclaimed from the sea, the recent storms have
caused the most damage to agriculture in this decade, he added.
	   In the northernmost province of Groningen, roads were closed
from flooding, and a bungalow park vacation area was evacuated
close to the village of Zoutkamp, said Groningen police press
officer Reinder Klei.
	   Five hundred soldiers and engineers were deployed to Groningen
and Drenthe earlier this week to shore up soggy dikes weakened by
rain-swollen canals and rivers.
	   Officials said Friday that emergency equipment was being kept on
standby at a regional air base and that two barracks were ready in
case people needed to be evacuated.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60
people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left
rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader
Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective
leading the disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found
at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials
said.
	   The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or
children of immigrant. Police said the list of injured included
Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,
had in turn rented the facility out to another person for the
dance, Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, although
officials said it apparently began with an explosion.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   About 180 people were taken to hospitals with injuries, and
about 20 were in intensive care. Seven of the most severely injured
were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other cities. Goteborg
is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital,
Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

	   The ruling would allow Judge Baltasar Garzon to continue his
investigations into whether Pinochet committed genocide, terrorism
and torture during his military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on those charges,
leading to Pincher's detention in London on Oct. 16.
	   But his probe against the 82-year-old former Chilean leader was
snarled earlier this week when Britain's High Court ruled that, as
a former head of state, Pinochet had immunity from prosecution. He
has been kept under arrest pending an appeal.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if the National Court backed
him, he would continue to seek the extradition as long as Pinochet
remained detained.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new coalition government
was formed Friday by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, just over a
month after parliamentary elections.
	   In a quick succession of events, Jozef Migas, the newly
appointed parliament chairman, first appointed Dzurinda prime
minister, who then submitted his list of ministers. They were then
sworn in by Migas, who was elected on Thursday and is acting as
head of state in the absence of a president.
	   The Sept.25-26 ballot led to the resignation of authoritarian
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, whose Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia still emerged the strongest party but did not win enough
seats for a majority in parliament.
	   The coalition holds 93 of the 150 seats in parliament. Meciar's
party hold 43 seats.
	   Meciar was replaced by Dzurinda, 43, a former transportation
engineer who is now chairman of the largest ruling party, the
Slovak Democratic Coalition. and was briefly Minister of
Transportation in 1994.
	   ``We need to bring stability for our citizens, fight organized
crime, improve the economy and catch up with the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary on their way to the European Union,'' Dzurinda
said only minutes after the government was established.
	   Dzurinda's Cabinet would like to catch up fast with the other
countries. Dzurinda said he hoped his country would be acccepted as
a candidate by the EU Vienna summit in December. However, it was
unlikely the EU could chance its stance so fast.
	   ``We would like it to be at this time, but we do not want to
make it a race,'' said Dzurinda. He is preparing for his first
foreign visit to Brussels, and will later go to Bonn and Vienna.
	   The government was formed from by four parties - Dzurinda's
party, the Democratic Left of former communists, the Hungarian
Coalition Party and the Party of Civic Understanding.
	   The first session of the new government was scheduled for
Saturday.
	   Apart from being excluded from the first group of countries to
join the EU and NATO, Slovakia is also experiencing economic
problems and the health and education sectors are badly
underfunded.
	   Eduard Kukan, who served briefly as foreign minister in 1994 and
also served as ambassador to the United States, became the new
foreign minister.
	   Ladislav Pittner, another prominent member of Dzurinda's Slovak
Democratic Coalition, was appointed interior minister.
	   The country's finances will be in the hands of Brigita
Schmognerova, 50, an economist of the Party of the Democratic Left.
	   ``We have to find out the real state of the Slovak economy. We
will have to start with a provisional budget for 1999, but we
should be able to prepare the budget by February 1999, which should
be valid from April,'' said Schmognerova.
	   The four coalition partners decided they would support the
candidacy of Rudolf Schuster, the head of the Party of Civic
Understanding, for the post of Slovakia's president. The country
has been without a president since last March when the term of
Michal Kovac expired.
	   ``If there will be direct presidential elections, Slovakia
should have its president by February or March of next year,'' said
Schuster on Friday. ``It is very good that all the (coalition)
parties have agreed on one candidate. It is much better than having
several candidates,'' he said.
	   Pittner, the new interior minister in charge of police, served
notice that the fight against organized crime will one of his
priorities.
	   ``The police are often involved in organized crime,'' he
asserted. `` There is corruption at every level of the police
corps, and that needs to be changed.''

	   Pinochet, who is recovering from back surgery, remains under
police guard in Britain. He was moved Thursday from the London
Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital, which reports said could
provide better security for the general.
	   The British judges ordered Pinochet be held in custody until
prosecutors appeal the ruling. The appeal is expected to be filed
Monday to a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   The National Court decision Friday resulted from a protest filed
in May by state prosecutors, who protested that Spain had no
jurisdiction over such crimes.
	   The decision does not deal specifically with Pinochet's
detention or his extradition, but Garzon would likely have dropped
the case against Pinochet if the court ruled against him.
	   Pinochet, who seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, has
been widely accused of running a ruthless regime. During his rule,
4,299 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet, 82,
on the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents. In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses
Pinochet of terrorism and torture.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira argued that jurisdiction
for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and Chile lies
within those countries, not Spain.
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer for families of junta victims in
Argentina, said: ``Pinochet is guilty of genocide because he tried
to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   Another lawyer, Juan Garces, representing families of junta
victims in Chile, drew applause from about 100 spectators in the
court chamber by stating, ``Let justice be done. Let's help
humanity.''

Bochum goalkeeper fails drug test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOCHUM, Germany (AP) _ Kaiserslautern, the defending Bundesliga
champion, appealed Friday to have its loss to Bochum one month ago
annulled because Bochum goalkeeper Thomas Ernst failed a drug test
after the game.
	   Kaiserslautern, which lost the Sept. 26 game 3-2 at home, said
it should be awarded the three points for a victory.
	   In a strange twist, Kaiserslautern would have lost the game
anyway because its coach, Otto Rehhagel, broke German federation
rules when he substituted a fourth non-European Union foreign
player.
	   Having won the game anyway, Bochum never used its right to
appeal to the German Soccer Federation (DFB).
	   ``It would be a scandal if Kaiserslautern got back the points,''
said Bochum chairman Werner Altegoer.
	   In the match, Ernst collided with Kaiserslautern's Danish
defender Michael Schjoenberg, who suffered a leg fracture.
	   During the halftime, Ernst was given a medicine by the club
doctor to stabilize his blood pressure, Altegoer said.
	   ``He didn't do anything forbidden, he is not guilty of
anything,'' Altegoer said.
	   Ernst declined to comment but confirmed that he failed the drug
test. Bochum has requested a second test.
	   The DFB has not said what substance was involved.
	   It was the second drug case involving Bochum in less than four
years. Bochum forward Roland Wohlfarth failed a drug test for a
stimulant during an indoor tournament in January 1994 and was
banned for two months.
	   Kaiserslautern's Czech reserve goalkeeper Petr Kouba was banned
for four weeks last season after failing a drug test for anabolic
steroids.

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story building
and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service
leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the
disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since
1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
	   On Friday, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and
poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene, and the 60th
victim died at a hospital, officials said.
	   The injured included about 20 in serious condition.
	   The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or
children of immigrants. Police said the list of injured included
Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The Macedonian Association had rented the facility out for the
dance, Carlsson said. That person was not immediately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the brick building.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40.
	   The Swedish news agency TT said the association had permission
to have only 150 people in the facility. The building had just two
exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician
Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   About 180 people were taken to hospitals. Seven of the most
severely injured were taken by helicopter to burn clinics in other
cities, the report said. Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300
miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.
	   The dance was filled with teen-agers celebrating Halloween and a
holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.

No details revealed as UN special envoy ends Myanmar mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ U.N. special envoy Alvaro de Soto left
Myanmar on Friday, giving no clue whether his talks with government
and opposition leaders had moved the two sides any closer to a
dialogue.
	   De Soto, a U.N. assistant secretary general on his fifth
official visit since 1995, also went to Insein Prison on Thursday
where he met some prisoners, diplomatic sources said.
	   Outsiders are rarely allowed access to prison, where many of the
country's political prisoners are held.
	   De Soto's mandate is to soothe political tensions between
Myanmar's military government and its pro-democratic opposition. He
held a two-and-a-half hour meeting Thursday with Lt.-Gen. Khin
Nyunt, the influential Secretary-1 of the ruling State Peace and
Development Council.
	   De Soto met with Aung San Suu Kyi, head of the opposition
National League for Democracy, and other senior members of her
party on Tuesday and Thursday,, said NLD vice chairman Tin Oo on
Friday.
	   He declined to give details of the discussions, telling The
Associated Press that it would be covered in a U.N. human rights
report to be issued next week.
	   Asked to comment on de Soto's visit, Tin Oo said only that ``It
is better for a U.N. official to visit here than not allowed here
at all.''
	   Since de Soto last visited Myanmar in January, already poor
relations between the government and the opposition deteriorated
sharply.
	   In the past few months, almost 1,000 members of Suu Kyi's party
have been detained in an effort to block its activities. More than
100 have reportedly been released in the past few weeks.
	   In a statement released late Thursday, the NLD urged the
government to prove its goodwill by freeing all the detainees
``immediately without any preconditions.''
	   It described the junta's contention that the NLD members had not
been arrested but merely invited to government guest houses for an
exchange of views as ``dishonorable.''
	   The assertion ``was a deliberate attempt by the government to
deceive the visiting U.N. special envoy to Myanmar,'' it said.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing
pro-democracy demonstrations. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide
victory in 1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused
to yield power.

Turkish military chief urges vigilance against radical Islam,
</HEADLINE>
separatists &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's top general said Friday that the
nation must be ``vigilant and on guard'' against radical Islam and
Kurdish separatism.
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu's declaration,
published in the Sabah newspaper, came as a clear indication that
the powerful military was as intent as ever to stand firm against
what it has termed two main threats to Turkey.
	   ``We are forced, as a nation, to be vigilant and on guard
against the backward-looking and the separatists that have openly
declared war on the republic and its values,'' Kivrikoglu said in
his first comments on the issue since taking his post in August.
	   They came a day after a hijacker commandeered a plane apparently
to protest a government crackdown on Kurdish rebels,
	   Turkish special forces stormed the Turkish Airlines plane early
Friday and killed the hijacker. The incident marred nationwide
celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the republic.
	   The staunchly pro-secular army plays a powerful role in this
predominantly Muslim society and has taken over power three times
since 1960.
	   Last year it pressured Turkey's first Islamic-led government out
of power for anti-secular activity. The high court subsequently
ordered the Islamic party disbanded and its leaders banned from
politics for five years.
	   The Kurdish rebels are waging a war for an autonomous state in
southeastern Turkey. Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict
since 1984.

EU says China still not ready for WTO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China planning to buy euro, other details; EDITS
to trim &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After 12 years of negotiations, China is still
not willing to make the market-opening concessions needed to join
the World Trade Organization, a European delegation said Friday.
	   ``We have made progress, but we have not made sufficient
progress,'' Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European
Commission, said after two days of meetings in Beijing.
	   China argues it has already gone a long way toward meeting
membership conditions of the rule-setting body for world trade. It
has accused WTO members of demanding too many concessions.
	   But Brittan said, ``China so far has not been prepared to move
sufficiently in opening up its markets to financial services, to
insurance, banking, and securities'' and telecommunications.
	   Chinese conditions on foreign investment also are ``very
restrictive,'' he said at a news conference.
	   Brittan was in China with a delegation led by EC President
Jacques Santer, who met all of China's top three leaders Friday _
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and legislative head Li
Peng.
	   Santer, whose six-day visit is the first by an EC president in
12 years, said human rights was a ``crucial part'' of EU-China
relations and was discussed in a ``very open and frank'' manner.
	   He urged China to fully implement two U.N. human rights pacts it
has signed but not yet ratified and to open talks with the Dalai
Lama, Tibet's exiled leader.
	   Chinese officials, meanwhile, all voiced strong support for the
euro, the common currency to be adopted by 11 of the 15 EU nations
on Jan. 1., the EU delegation said.
	   A delegation statement said Chinese officials confirmed they
would convert ``a significant share'' of the country's U.S. dlrs
141 billion in foreign exchange reserves into euros.
	   But Santer said they gave no precise information on when or how
many euros China might buy.
	   Santer noted that Chinese exports to Europe have increased by 25
percent this year and he echoed Brittan in backing more open
markets.
	   The Asian financial crisis and China's problems in reforming
loss-making state firms have made the government wary of lowering
import barriers and easing investment restrictions.
	   On Thursday, in a meeting with Santer, Chinese Vice Premier Li
Lanqing urged the EU to be ``more flexible and practical'' in
negotiations on China's WTO bid.
	   Brittan acknowledged that ``things have got more difficult from
the Chinese point of view.''
	   But he also said joining the WTO entailed ``an exchange of
obligations'' and was ``not membership of a club that you give to
your friends because you like them.''
	   ``You have access to other people's markets, in return you have
to open up your own markets to the extent that is appropriate for
the economy of your size and your state of development _ and you
have to be prepared to observe the rules,'' he said.

Bochum goalkeeper fails drug test

<TEXT>
	   BOCHUM, Germany (AP) _ Kaiserslautern, the defending Bundesliga
champion, appealed Friday to have its loss to Bochum one month ago
annulled because Bochum goalkeeper Thomas Ernst failed a drug test
after the game.
	   Kaiserslautern, which lost the Sept. 26 game 3-2 at home, said
it should be awarded the three points for a victory.
	   In a strange twist, Kaiserslautern would have lost the game
anyway because its coach, Otto Rehhagel, broke German federation
rules when he substituted a fourth non-European Union foreign
player.
	   Having won the game anyway, Bochum never used its right to
appeal to the German Soccer Federation (DFB).
	   ``It would be a scandal if Kaiserslautern got back the points,''
said Bochum chairman Werner Altegoer.
	   In the match, Ernst collided with Kaiserslautern's Danish
defender Michael Schjoenberg, who suffered a leg fracture.
	   During the halftime, Ernst was given a medicine by the club
doctor to stabilize his blood pressure, Altegoer said.
	   ``He didn't do anything forbidden, he is not guilty of
anything,'' Altegoer said.
	   Ernst declined to comment but confirmed that he failed the drug
test. Bochum has requested a second test.
	   The DFB has not said what substance was involved.
	   It was the second drug case involving Bochum in less than four
years. Bochum forward Roland Wohlfarth failed a drug test for a
stimulant during an indoor tournament in January 1994 and was
banned for two months.
	   Kaiserslautern's Czech reserve goalkeeper Petr Kouba was banned
for four weeks last season after failing a drug test for anabolic
steroids.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Intensifying their crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police on Friday cut the telephone
lines of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin and the group's leading
activists. They also prevented a Hamas march in the West Bank.
	   A fax sent to news agencies claimed that Palestinian agents
ransacked Yassin's home early Friday, arrested three bodyguards and
seized weapons, videotapes and files. The authenticity of the
handwritten fax could not immediately be confirmed.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists have been arrested in the Gaza
Strip since Thursday's suicide attack on an Israeli transport of
school children in the Gaza Strip, security officials said.
	   The unprecedented decision to silence Yassin came after
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with his security chiefs to
chart the next stage of the campaign against Hamas that Israel says
is a precondition for a timely West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said the Palestinian Authority
had made it its top priority to ensure that the Israeli pullback
from 13 percent of the West Bank begins on time. ``We will not
allow any faction to stand in the way of liberating Palestinian
lands,'' Abourdeneh told The Associated Press.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Friday that Israel
would not go ahead with the 12-week pullback unless the
Palestinians wage an all-out war against the Islamic militants.
	   ``They must struggle firmly against the infrastructure of the
terror groups,'' Sharon said. ``It the commitments are fulfilled,
Israel will carry out its part.''
	   On Friday morning, armed Palestinian policemen and plainclothes
agents blocked the sandy streets leading to Yassin's home in a Gaza
City slum and ordered journalists to leave the area. Cars were
searched and passers-by questioned.
	   On Thursday evening, Arafat had placed Yassin after house arrest
on Thursday evening. It was a sharp about face. In the year since
Yassin's release from an Israeli jail, Arafat had tried hard to
avoid open conflict with Yassin who is revered in the impoverished
Gaza Strip for having built a wide network of clinics and schools.
	   Many in Yassin's Sabra neighborhood felt Arafat had gone too
far. ``By insulting him, they have insulted every honest Muslim
here,'' said Nayed Al Amer, 34, as he returned home from noon
prayers. He and others said fear kept them from protesting openly.
	   The wife of Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said she hasn't heard
from her husband since he was picked up by plainclothes agents on
Thursday afternoon. Phones were cut later that night, said Mrs.
Zahar, who would not give her first name.
	   In a sign that the crackdown is spreading to the West Bank,
Hamas activists in the town of Nablus said Palestinian security
forces prevented them from holding a march Friday to protest the
arrests of the group's leaders.
	   Arafat has moved against Hamas in the past, sometimes arresting
hundreds of activists in retaliation for suicide attacks against
Israel. However, the current crackdown marked the first time Arafat
had the entire Hamas leadership arrested and silenced.
	   The arrests came in response to the suicide attack at a busy
Gaza junction in which an Islamic militant rammed an
explosives-laden car into an Israeli army jeep escorting a
red-and-white bus carrying Israeli school children.
	   The 40 students on board were saved but the car bomb killed an
Israeli soldier in the jeep, a 19-year-old immigrant from Ukraine.
	   The attack came only six days after the signing of the agreement
in Washington. It was a destabilizing new factor in what is already
a highly delicate prelude to implementing the accord. That process
is to start next week.
	   Blocking the pact is the avowed goal of Hamas, which bitterly
opposes any peace with Israel. Hamas has carried out attacks that
have killed scores of Israelis.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu indefinitely postponed a Cabinet
session that was to ratify the peace agreement.
	   Officials in his office said the regular weekly Cabinet session
would be held Sunday, as planned, but that the peace agreement
would only be discussed if the Palestinians had submitted a
detailed security plan to the Americans by then.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the plan would be
presented to the Americans on Monday, as initially planned.

Australian 'keeper cleared of miscoduct charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa's Australian goalkeeper, Mark Bosnich,
was cleared of misconduct charges Friday after the Football
Association found no proof that he swore at Everton fans.
	   A three-man FA disciplinary committee dismissed the charge
alleging that Bosnich had verbally abused fans during Villa's 0-0
draw at Goodison Park on Aug. 15.
	   Letters from Everton fans claiming that Bosnich had done nothing
wrong were produced as evidence at the 75-minute hearing.
	   ``I would like to say a big thank you to all the supporters who
wrote in with support, saying exactly what happened, and to the FA
who reacted in a very fair and impartial way,'' Bosnich said.
	   ``It's really all over now,'' he said. ``I'd rather not hit the
back pages for things like this. I'd rather it was all about
football.''
	   In 1996, Bosnich was fined 1,000 pounds (dlrs 1,600) for making
a Nazi-style salute during a game at Tottenham.

 &UR; Spanish court upholds legal basis for bid to extradite Pinochet.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge is expected push ahead for
the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet after
the National Court ruled Friday that Spain had jurisdiction over
crimes committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and
Argentina.
	   The ruling gave a green light to Judge Baltasar Garzon to
continue with his investigations into the alleged crimes of
genocide, terrorism and torture committed by Pinochet during his
military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on this basis which
led to the detention of Pinochet in London on Oct. 16.
	   But his probe against the 82-year-old former Chilean leader was
snarled earlier this week when Britain's High Court ruled that, as
a former head of state, Pinochet had immunity from prosecution. He
has been kept under arrest pending an appeal expected to be heard
next week.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he got the backing from his
National Court he would continue to seek the extradition as long as
Pinochet remained detained.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing
families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view its a
landmark decision.''
	   The 11-judge panel reached the decision shortly after 2 p.m.
(1300gmt) after nearly five hours of deliberation.
	   ``The panel has voted unanimously to reject the appeals and
authorizes Spain to hear the facts of what happened,'' Carlos
Cezon, one of the judges, announced.
	   The decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers backing
the investigation and relatives of the victims who had gathered in
the court in downtown Madrid.
	   For over two years, Judge Baltasar Garzon and a colleague have
been probing human rights crimes in Argentina and Chile in the
1970s and 1980s. Garzon filed the arrest warrant that resulted in
Pinochet's detention in London since Oct. 16.
	   The panel of judges studying a protest filed in May by state
prosecutors who objected to Garzon's investigations on the grounds
that Spain had no jurisdiction over such crimes.
	   Although the National Court's decision Friday does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, Garzon
was expected to decide on the future of his case depending on the
ruling.
	   Pinochet seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, during
which 4,299 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet, 82,
on the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents. In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses
Pinochet of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Wednesday Britain's High Court ruling of immunity for Pinochet
shook Garzon's case. An appeal of the decision is expected next
week and a five-judge House of Lords panel may rule later in the
week.
	   Garzon is expected to keep trying to extradite Pinochet as long
as he is detained and the Spanish National Court backs the case.
	   The Spanish panel heard arguments for and against the case
Thursday evening.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira insisted that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   He argued that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Slepoy said Pinochet was ``guilty of genocide because he
tried to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in Operation Condor, in which
several military juntas in South America teamed up in the 1970s and
1980s to crush what they perceived as a communist threat.

Blast heavily damages City Hall; bomb believed cause
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFORT, France (AP) _ An explosion believed caused by a bomb
blew a hole in the roof of City Hall, damaged offices and wrecked
parked cars, authorities in this eastern French town said Friday.
	   No injuries were reported in the blast that occurred shortly
before 3 a.m., though damage was put in the millions of francs
(hundreds of thousands of dollars), said Mayor Jackie Drouet.
	   The explosion ``was due to a voluntary act,'' said Prosecutor
Christiane Corey, after firefighters smelled gunpowder and
investigators found what they believed was the remains of an
explosive device.
	   The device was found on the third floor of the City Hall in the
cultural affairs office, said authorities in this town near
Mulhouse.
	   If confirmed as a bombing, the motive was not immediately clear.
	   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement is assistant mayor of
Belfort and left his job as chief magistrate there in June last
year, when he was named minister.

Taliban let Red Cross bring medicine to opposition areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - The Taliban religious army allowed the
International Red Cross to bring 1,350 tons of medicine to
opposition held areas on Friday.
	   The Red Cross spokesman Juan Martinez in Kabul said that an
aircraft packed with medicines was allowed to pass through Taliban
air space and land at Baghram air base some 40 kilometers (24
miles) north of Kabul.
	   The air base is controlled by the northern-based opposition, but
the Red Cross had to pass through Taliban air space and over a
front line to reach Baghram air base. Without prior guarantees from
the Taliban it would have been impossible to land the aircraft at
Baghram, said Martinez.
	   The medicine will be distributed among hospitals in the
opposition-held territory, he said.
	   The Taliban army and its opponents are waging a fierce
territorial war on three different front lines _ all north of the
capital.
	   The Taliban rule 90 percent of Afghanistan and the opposition
the remaining 10 percent.

RFE starts broadcasting to Iran, Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ U.S.-sponsored Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty was starting its broadcasts to Iran and Iraq
from Czech territory Friday, an official said.
	   ``We're starting our broadcast to Iraq and Iran today,'' station
manager Jan Obrman told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   In a trial period, which is to last several weeks, the station
will broadcast one 30-minute program a day to each country, Obrman
said.
	   Earlier this month, the Czech government allowed the
transmission into Iraq but insisted the station's location should
change to avoid security risks. The Farsi-language service into
Iran was approved by the government in August.
	   The radio station originally said it intends to expand to new
offices in Prague's sixth residential district, a plan which drew
concern from the government.
	   Obrman refused to say where the location of the new offices will
be.
	   RFE/RL began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951,
spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the
Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the West and the Communist
East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2nd and 18th grafs to UPDATE with former President de
Klerk blasting report; minor editing elsewhere &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo JOH101 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The release of a long-awaited
report that was supposed to help heal deep wounds caused by
apartheid has instead caused divisiveness, with both former
liberation fighters and apartheid's main party attacking it.
	   Former President F.W. de Klerk, whose efforts to dismantle
apartheid won him the Nobel Peace Prize along with President Nelson
Mandela, said Friday the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report
``holds the seeds of future conflict.''
	   Deputy President Thabo Mbeki _ who will likely be elected
president next year _ criticized the commission for failing to
include in its report the African National Congress' response to a
detailed condemnation of abuses it committed while fighting
apartheid, including the torture of dissidents and killing of
civilians.
	   With Mbeki's backing, the ANC unsuccessfully sought in court to
block the report's release.
	   That move angered retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the
anti-apartheid champion who chaired the Truth Commission.
	   ``I didn't struggle in order to remove one set of those who
thought they were tin gods to replace them with others who are
tempted to think they are,'' he told reporters in Pretoria Friday.
	   The report is one of the most important ever produced in this
nation's tortured history. Compiled after 2 1/2 years of hearings,
it lays bare the abuses committed during the era of white minority
rule.
	   The National Party, which ruled during apartheid, blasted the
commission's ``failure to achieve reconciliation.''
	   But the report makes clear it is only a step toward
reconciliation.
	   ``If reconciliation and unity are to become a reality in South
Africa, the energy and commitment of all its people will be
required,'' the 2,750-page report concludes. It urges South
Africans to ``reach out to fellow South Africans in a spirit of
tolerance and understanding.''
	   The report says the president should call a national summit in
1999 to ensure all sectors of society are involved in considering
its recommendations, which include the teaching in schools of human
rights, specifically about racism, gender discrimination and the
rights of children.
	   The report also recommends:
	   _ That the government consider establishing human rights bureaus
in ministries.
	   _ That restitution ``for those who have suffered from ...
apartheid discrimination'' be provided, possibly through a one-time
levy on corporate and private income, or with each company listed
on Johannesburg Stock Exchange making a one-time donation of 1
percent market capitalization.
	   _ That liberation movements apologize to those whose human
rights were abused by those movements while in exile.
	   ``Reconciliation is a process which is never-ending, is costly
and often painful. For this process to develop, it is imperative
that democracy and a human rights culture be consolidated,'' the
report says.
	   De Klerk denounced the proposed levy as ``punitive retrospective
taxes.''
	   The report also calls on the government to consider prosecuting
human rights violators who didn't seek amnesty.
	   Tutu conceded wrongdoers could escape justice if deadlines on
prosecution
	   expire.
	   ``They may get away from the judicial (system). They will never
get away from themselves,'' Tutu said.
	   As expected, the report lays the heaviest burden of guilt on
white governments that made non-whites second-class citizens and
ruthlessly crushed dissent.
	   The report, contained in five hard-cover volumes, is sometimes
difficult to read. It gives accounts from thousands of prisoners
who were beaten, given electric shocks and raped during apartheid.
	   Some wounds may be too deep to heal.
	   ``The only thing that really made me break was when they
threatened to kidnap my 4-year-old nephew, Christopher, bring him
to the 13th floor and drop him out the window,'' anti-apartheid
activist Zahrah Narkedien is quoted as testifying in one of the
commissions hearings, which were held across the country.
	   Narkedien said she will never recover from her seven months in
solitary confinement.
	   ``I was damaged. A part of my soul was eaten away as if by
maggots .. and I will never get it back again,'' the report quotes
her as saying.
	   Mandela conceded the report would not produce instant
reconciliation.
	   ``Its release is bound to reawaken many of the difficult and
troubling emotions that the hearings themselves brought,'' said
Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid.
	   Furthermore, some whites will think it is a witch hunt launched
by the black majority now in power, with some blacks seeing it as
an escape route for the minority that oppressed them for so many
years.

Indonesian mob kills man suspected of mysterious murders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report on other killings

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers on Indonesia's main island
of Java killed at least three men in recent days they suspected of
involvement in a wave of mysterious murders, news reports said
Friday.
	   Two men were beaten to death Thursday night by a mob in Pemalang
regency, Central Java, about 218 miles (350 kilometers) east of
Jakarta. said Antara news agency.
	   The report said two other men were hanged, but it was unclear if
they had died. Police confirmed the attacks, but refused to provide
any details.
	   On Wednesday, an unidentified man was beaten to death in the
western Java village of Susukan, 270 kilometers (168 miles) east of
Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, the Kompas newspaper said.
	   The villagers reportedly believed the man was one of the
mysterious assassins who are said to dress in Ninja-like black
clothing. Kompas said the crowd found a black cap in his pocket.
	   The killings were the latest in a string of revenge killings for
the murders of more than 150 suspected black magic sorcerers and
Muslim preachers.
	   Mobs have lynched half a dozen other suspected murderers this
week on Java. Police say that in many cases, there has been flimsy
evidence to suspect the victims are guilty and that villagers are
quick to seek out scapegoats.
	   The two men beaten to death Thursday were captured while trying
to approach the house of a local Islamic preacher in Moga village,
about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Pemalang, Antara said, adding
that another suspect managed to escape.
	   Vigilantes said they found daggers in the men's car and a list
of preachers believed to be their targets.
	   Also Thursday, a who was arrested in the eastern Java town of
Bojonegoro, admitted that he and three other men had been promised
a payoff if they killed a Muslim preacher, reported the Suara
Pembaruan, a daily newspaper.
	   The man, identified only as Samsuri, did not say who had offered
him a sum of 20 million rupiahs (dlrs 2,750) for the killing, the
newspaper said.
	   Some Muslims suspect the murders are politically motivated.
	   While most of the violence has occurred in eastern Java,
vigilante killings have spread to other parts of the island.
	   Many of the victims of the mysterious murders were Muslim
clerics and other members of Indonesia's largest Muslim group,
Nahdhatul Ulama.
	   The group, which has formed its own political party to run in
elections next year, has warned it will deploy its own security
forces if the military does not restore order soon.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bolstering a Spanish judge's efforts to
extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, the National
Court ruled Friday that Spain had jurisdiction over crimes
committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling would allow Judge Baltasar Garzon to continue his
investigations into whether Pinochet committed genocide, terrorism
and torture during his military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on those charges,
leading to Pincher's detention in London on Oct. 16.
	   But his probe against the 82-year-old former Chilean leader was
snarled earlier this week when Britain's High Court ruled that, as
a former head of state, Pinochet had immunity from prosecution. He
has been kept under arrest pending an appeal.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if the National Court backed
him, he would continue to seek the extradition as long as Pinochet
remained detained.
	   The 11-judge panel reached the decision after nearly five hours
of deliberation.
	   ``The panel has voted unanimously to reject the appeals and
authorizes Spain to hear the facts of what happened,'' Carlos
Cezon, one of the judges, announced.
	   The decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers backing
the investigation and relatives of the victims who had gathered in
the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing
families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view its a
landmark decision.''
	   Pinochet, who is recovering from back surgery, remains under
police guard in Britain. He was moved Thursday from the London
Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital, which reports said could
provide better security for the general.
	   The British judges ordered Pinochet be held in custody until
prosecutors appeal the ruling. The appeal is expected to be filed
Monday to a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   The National Court decision Friday resulted from a protest filed
in May by state prosecutors, who protested that Spain had no
jurisdiction over such crimes. The decision does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition.
	   Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime.
During his rule, 4,299 political opponents died or disappeared,
according to a Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet on
the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents. In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses
Pinochet of terrorism and torture.
	   Garzon and a colleague have been probing human rights crimes in
Argentina and Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. Friday's decision was
in response to a protest filed in May by state prosecutors who
objected to Garzon's investigations on the grounds that Spain had
no jurisdiction over such crimes.
	   The decision does not deal specifically with Pinochet's
detention or his extradition, but it was believed that Garzon's
investigation would be strongly affected by a negative ruling.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira had argued that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Slepoy said: ``Pinochet is guilty of genocide because he
tried to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   Another lawyer, Juan Garces, representing families of junta
victims in Chile, drew applause from about 100 spectators in the
court chamber by stating, ``Let justice be done. Let's help
humanity.''

EU pursues court action against 8 EU nations over U.S.-aviation
</HEADLINE>
deals

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's head office said
Thursday it was pushing ahead with legal action against eight EU
member nations over their privileged civil aviation deals with the
United States.
	   ``The impact of the deals is detrimental to our own market,''
said Sarah Lambert, transport spokeswoman for the European
Commission.
	   She said the Commission was taking Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and Britain to the EU's high
court over the deals.
	   The eight countries have bilateral agreements with the United
States under which both sides exclusively ensure each other's
carriers the right to fly between their territories.
	   The EU says such deals discriminate against airlines from other
EU nations and says they should be replaced with a single ``open
skies'' agreement between the United States and the 15-nation EU as
a whole.
	   ``There need be no roll-back, these individual agreements can be
written into a wider deal,'' Lambert told reporters at EU
headquarters. However she acknowledged that efforts to negotiate an
EU-wide deal were moving slowly and called on EU nations to give
the Commission a wider mandate to negotiate with Washington.
	   The EU's high court, the Luxembourg-based European Court of
Justice, has powers to levy heavy fines against EU nations that
fail to respect the Union's rules, but it often takes years to
produce a judgement.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60
people and injuring 162 in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left
rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader
Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective
leading the disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found
at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials
said. Of the injured, 65 were in intensive care, said Per
Oertenwall, a local medical officer in charge of coordinating
information from the area hospitals.
	   The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or
children of immigrant. Police said the list of injured included
Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,
had in turn rented the facility out to another person for the
dance, Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, although
officials said it apparently began with an explosion.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   Oertenwall, the medical officer, said the total number of
injured was 162, down from previous estimates of 180.
	   Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter to
burn clinics in other cities. Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300
miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge is expected to press for
the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet after
the National Court ruled Friday that Spain had jurisdiction over
crimes committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and
Argentina.
	   The ruling gave a green light to Judge Baltasar Garzon to
continue with his investigations into the alleged crimes of
genocide, terrorism and torture committed by Pinochet during his
military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on this basis which
led to the detention of Pinochet in London on Oct. 16. Pinochet
went to London for back surgery and he is currently in detention in
a clinic in the English capital.
	   Britain's High Court ruled Wednesday that the 82-year-old former
Chilean leader, as a former head of state, was entitled to
diplomatic immunity.
	   An appeal against the decision is expected to be heard next week
by a five-judge panel from the House of Lords. If the decision is
upheld, any extradition order by Garzon would be in vain.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if he got the backing from his
National Court he would continue to seek the extradition as long as
Pinochet remained detained.
	   Virginia Diez, a human rights lawyer, said Garzon planned to
file for extradition next week.
	   Friday's ruling is ``an immense homage to the disappeared
(people) of Chile and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer
representing families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of
view it's a landmark decision.''
	   The 11-judge panel reached the decision shortly after 2 p.m.
(1300 gmt) after nearly five hours of deliberation.
	   ``The panel has voted unanimously to reject the appeals (against
the probes) and authorizes Spain to hear the facts of what
happened,'' Carlos Cezon, one of the panel's judges, announced.
	   The decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers backing
the investigation and relatives of the victims who had gathered in
the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``I am very happy that Pinochet can be tried in this country,''
Santiago Oyarzo, a Chilean citizen who said he was jailed and
tortured in Villa Grimaldi, in Santiago, Chile, during the late
1970s.
	   For over two years, Judge Baltasar Garzon and a colleague have
been probing human rights crimes in Argentina and Chile in the
1970s and 1980s. Garzon filed the arrest warrant that resulted in
Pinochet's detention in London since Oct. 16.
	   The panel of judges was studying a protest filed in May by state
prosecutors who objected to Garzon's investigations on the grounds
that Spain had no jurisdiction over such crimes.
	   Although the National Court's decision Friday does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, Garzon
was expected to decide on the future of his case depending on the
ruling.
	   Pinochet seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, during
which 4,299 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet, on
the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents. In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses
Pinochet of terrorism and torture.
	   The Spanish panel heard arguments for and against the case
Thursday evening.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira insisted that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   He argued that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Slepoy said Pinochet was ``guilty of genocide because he
tried to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in Operation Condor, in which
several military juntas in South America teamed up in the 1970s and
1980s to crush what they perceived as a communist threat.
	   ``It's like reaching the end of a wait that lasted 22 years,''
said Matilde Artez of the Argentine relatives of victims
association, Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.

Japan Airlines reports 10 percent higher net profit in first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales of older aircraft and lower fuel costs helped
Japan Airlines Co. post a 10 percent higher net profit in the first
half of this year, the airline said Friday.
	   Japan's largest airline said it made the 20.1 billion yen (dlrs
173.3 million) net profit in the six months ended Sept. 30, 1998,
despite a fall in revenues due to a sluggish economy and rising
competition in airfares.
	   The company posted a net profit of 18.3 billion yen (dlrs 157.5
million) in the first six months of last year.
	   The report follows strong first-half results earlier this week
by the country's other two major carriers, All Nippon Airways Co.
and Japan Air System Co.
	   Cheaper jet fuel, demand for which has fallen in the wake of the
Asian economic crisis, helped the Tokyo-based carrier pare
operating costs by 1.5 percent compared with the same period last
year.
	   But that failed to keep up with a 2.8 percent decline in
revenues as Japan's recession forced passengers to economize by
downgrading their business class seats to economy.
	   JAL also announced a cost-cutting plan, including selling off
overseas hotels and resorts that it now manages, to help it meet
lower ticket prices from new cut-fare airlines that have appeared
because of market deregulation.
	   ``We will conduct a reduction in expenses to catch up with the
pace of sales decline,'' senior vice president Tatsuru Fukaya said.
	   JAL said it made 7 billion yen (dlrs 60 million) on sales of its
older airplanes. Last year, it announced sale of 20 used DC-10-40
aircraft to another Japanese company for about 20 billion yen (dlrs
172 million).

Georgian president welcomes oil transportation deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout to CLARIFY that document signed was expression
of support for pipeline route, not final decision. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ President Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday
praised a declaration calling for the transportation of the bulk of
Caspian Sea oil through Georgia _ a deal that could bring a lot of
badly needed money.
	   ``We have won what we could not even dream of two or three years
ago,'' Shevardnadze said Friday, a day after he returned from
signing the non-binding declaration in Turkey.
	   Turkey and four former Soviet republics declared support for
building a major pipeline across Georgia for carrying Azerbaijan's
rich oil reserves to Turkey.
	   But the final decision will be made by Azerbaijan's President
Geidar Aliev based on recommendations by an international
consortium of oil companies, which are to present their analysis on
Nov. 12.
	   The major pipeline through Georgian would take four to five
years, Shevardnadze said. In the meantime, most oil exports from
two Caspian countries _ Azerbaijan and Kazakstan _ would go through
Georgia's Black Sea ports of Supsa and Batumi, according to the
declaration signed in Turkey.
	   In yet more good news for Georgia, another Central Asian
country, Turkmenistan, has agreed to transport its natural gas
through Georgia, Shevardnadze told reporters.
	   ``This has great benefits for Georgia,'' he said.
	   The Caspian Sea oil reserves are believed to be second only to
the Persian Gulf, but development has been slow, and the absence of
a major export pipeline has stymied long-awaited prosperity.

North Korea rocket may have violated Japan's airspace: Minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Defense Agency report on a firing of a North
Korean rocket has found that Japan's airspace may have been
violated by the launch, Kyodo News agency reported Friday.
	   The report on the Aug. 31 rocket launch found that it flew at an
altitude of 60 kilometers (40 miles) to 160 kilometers (100 miles)
over northern Japan before crashing into the Pacific Ocean, Kyodo
said.
	   That could be considered as part of a nation's airspace, Foreign
Minister Masahiko Komura was quoted as saying.
	   Agency officials were not immediately available for comment late
Friday.
	   Japanese media reports quoted the agency report as saying the
rocket, believed to be the Taepo Dong 1, was probably fired to test
the range of ballistic missiles.
	   Many legislators in Japan have been calling on the government to
build a multipurpose spy satellite following the North's launch.
Japan lacks such a system and had no way of knowing a rocket had
been fired without warning from the U.S. military.
	   Under current laws, Japan's space program can only be used for
peaceful purposes. But since the North Korean missile, there has
been debate on what legislative changes are needed, if any, for a
monitoring system.
	   North Korea says that the launch put a satellite in orbit. The
agency report said there was little possibility that a satellite
was put into orbit but did not totally rule it out, although it
said the satellite, if it existed, did not work, Japanese media
reports said.
	   The first stage fell into the Sea of Japan, 180 kilometers (110
miles) from the launch site, while the second stage flew over Japan
for about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and fell into the Pacific,
the agency report said.

Swedish dance turns into scramble for safety when fire breaks out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sweden-Fire &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE PANDOLFI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ With the shout of ``fire,'' the
Halloween dance changed into a desperate scramble for safety from
the fast-spreading blaze.
	   ``A light went out. Somebody yelled 'fire.' And then somebody
shouted 'evacuate,''' said Elizabeth Moya, 17, one of the 400 young
people at the dance.
	   She was fortunate. She made it through a door, down stairs and
outside to safety. Behind her, youths were crushed in the surge to
escape; rescuers found 59 dead at the scene and another died at a
hospital.
	   Standing outside the charred brick building Friday morning, amid
lit candles, bouquets of flowers and dazed family and friends of
the victims, 15-year-old Christian Czari said, ``Everybody
panicked.''
	   ``Nobody cared about the girls. The strongest made way first.
Kids were fighting each other to get out.''
	   The fire started shortly before midnight. The first fire truck
arrived less than five minutes later, but too late to stop the
worst of the tragedy.
	   Bojan Jovanich, a high school student, said it was the disc
jockey who yelled ``fire.''
	   ``We couldn't see much because the lights had gone out,'' he
said. ``Then we saw the flames.''
	   Some boys bent back the metal grill on a window, tied a long
curtain and apparently intended to slide down. They gave up and
jumped, Jovanich said. Others caught fire _ their hair, their
clothes. ``It was a terrible sight,'' he said. ``Thank good God I'm
alive.''
	   Czari and others tried to carry or drag injured companions to a
nearby car rental shop that served as a first aid center. He gave
up because the bodies were ``sticky'' with blood and burns. ``The
skin wasn't there any more.''
	   The dance was to celebrate All Saints Day and a holiday weekend.
Many of the victims apparently were from Goteborg's large immigrant
community.
	   There are sizable groups from up to 80 nationalities _ notably
Syrians, Kurds, Somalians and Bosnians _ in Sweden's second-largest
city, located about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of
Stockholm.
	   A young woman with tears in her eyes waited for news about
survivors at the Lutheran Church in suburban Hammarkullen,
converted to a crisis center. She said her foster brother is
missing. She appeared calm, but said, ``There's chaos inside of
me.''

Thai stock exchange to allow use of key indexes for derivatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Stock Exchange of Thailand has
approved in principle using its two key stock indexes _ the SET
Index and the SET-50 Index _ as the bases for derivatives, the
exchange president said Friday.
	   Trading derivatives such as index options and warrants on the
Thai stock indexes will allow investors to hedge their risk on
their positions in Thai stocks, SET President Singh Tangtatswas
said at a news conference.
	   The availability of hedges should help increase foreign
investment in the local market, he said.
	   The SET-50 Index was established in June 1996 in large part to
facilitate the development of index futures and options trading.
	   The companies making up the SET-50 Index were chosen based upon
their large market capitalization and high liquidity.
	   Singh said the Singapore International Monetary Exchange plans
to issue derivatives securities on Thai stock indexes early in
1999.

 &UR; Eds: One name correct for some Indonesians

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Poul Erik Hoyer
Larsen of Denmark made it to the semifinals of the Indonesian Open
Badminton Championship on Friday, as top seed Hendrawan of
Indonesia was upset by less experienced countryman Taufik Hidayat.
	   Larsen who won a gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta, came from behind to defeat Indonesian Johan Hadikusuma in
a grueling match that ended 11-15, 15-12, 15-10.
	   ``I lost control in the first set before recovering and took
over the lead,'' said Larsen, who is the 2nd seed in the men's
singles.
	   In the Saturday's semifinals, Larsen will take on Budi Santoso,
another Indonesian. He beat countryman Marleve Mainaki 15-8 15-8 on
Friday.
	   Also in the men's singles, Hidayat, Indonesia's junior shuttler,
stunned the crowd by easily eliminating top seed Hendrawan 15-1,
15-8.
	   Hidayat will play Malaysian Yong Hock Kim, whose Indonesian
opponent, Heryanto Arbi, failed to show up Friday because a back
injury.
	   In women's singles, Larsen's compatriot Mette Sorrensen made it
to the semifinals by defeating host shuttler Lydia Djaelawidjaja
11-5 11-4.
	   Like Larsen, Sorrensen will be the only foreigner to compete in
the semifinals where she will be challenged Meiluawati, who earlier
defeated countrywoman Ellen Angelina, 11-8 11-2.
	   Other semifinalists are top seed Mia Audina who defeated Yuli
Marfuah, and Cindana who disposed of Mona Santoso.
	   In mixed doubles, two Danish pairs _ Michael Soogard and Rikke
Olsen along with Janek Roos and Helene Kikergaard _ advanced to the
semifinals, but compatriots Jens Erikssen and Marlene Thomsen were
eliminated.
	   Only 27 foreigners are taking part in the tournament along with
42 Indonesians. The dlrs 120,000 championships is scheduled to run
until Sunday.

	   CANAKKALE, Turkey (AP) _ A solemn Prince Andrew on Friday laid
wreaths at memorials to the 91,000 soldiers who died in the
Gallipoli campaign in World War I.
	   He is the first member of the British royal family in recent
years to visit the peninsula where some 36,000 British and
Commonwealth soldiers and 55,000 Turkish soldiers died.
	   The 1915-16 battle, an attempt to knock Turkey out of the war
and take control of the Turkish straits, ended in defeat for the
Allies.
	   Dressed in his naval uniform, Andrew wandered through rows of
graves at Anzac Cove, where the allies landed in April 1915 and
where the main battles took place.
	   Andrew was in Turkey to attend the 75th anniversary celebrations
of the Turkish republic, founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Ataturk
led the Turkish troops Gallipoli.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bolstering a Spanish judge's efforts to
extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, the National
Court ruled Friday that Spain had jurisdiction over crimes
committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling would allow Judge Baltasar Garzon to continue his
investigations into whether Pinochet committed genocide, terrorism
and torture during his military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on those charges,
leading to Pinochet's detention in London on Oct. 16.
	   But his probe against the 82-year-old former Chilean leader was
snarled earlier this week when Britain's High Court ruled that, as
a former head of state, Pinochet had immunity from prosecution. He
has been kept under arrest pending an appeal.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if the National Court backed
him, he would continue to seek the extradition as long as Pinochet
remained detained.
	   Virginia Diez, a human rights lawyer, said Garzon planned to
file for extradition next week.
	   The 11-judge panel reached the decision after nearly five hours
of deliberation.
	   ``The panel has voted unanimously to reject the appeals and
authorizes Spain to hear the facts of what happened,'' Carlos
Cezon, one of the judges, announced.
	   The decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers backing
the investigation and relatives of the victims who had gathered in
the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``I am very happy that Pinochet can be tried in this country,''
Santiago Oyarzo, a Chilean citizen who said he was jailed and
tortured in Villa Grimaldi, in Santiago, Chile, during the late
1970s.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing
families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view its a
landmark decision.''
	   Pinochet, who is recovering from back surgery, remains under
police guard in Britain. He was moved Thursday from the London
Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital, which reports said could
provide better security for the general.
	   The British judges ordered Pinochet be held in custody until
prosecutors appeal the ruling. The appeal is expected to be filed
Monday to a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   The National Court decision Friday resulted from a protest filed
in May by state prosecutors, who protested that Spain had no
jurisdiction over such crimes. The decision does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, but it
was believed that Garzon's investigation would be strongly affected
by a negative ruling.
	   Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime.
During his rule, 4,299 political opponents died or disappeared,
according to a Chilean government report.
	   Garzon says that under Spanish law he can go after Pinochet on
the grounds that he committed genocide by trying to wipe out his
political opponents.
	   Garzon and a colleague have been probing human rights crimes in
Argentina and Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   National Court prosecutor Pedro Rubira had argued that
jurisdiction for human rights crimes committed in Argentina and
Chile lies within those countries, not Spain.
	   He added that Pinochet cannot be charged with genocide because
political opponents that died under his regime were not persecuted
because of their race or religion.
	   But Slepoy said: ``Pinochet is guilty of genocide because he
tried to eliminate an entire group of people.''
	   Another lawyer, Juan Garces, representing families of junta
victims in Chile, drew applause from about 100 spectators in the
court chamber by stating, ``Let justice be done. Let's help
humanity.''

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ At least 35 Somalis were
killed and 50 others wounded when rival militias fought
for control of key town, a faction spokesman said Friday.
	   The Rahanwein Resistance Army defeated forces of
Hussein Aidid on Thursday to take control of Huddor town,
capital of Bakol region, about 300 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Mogadishu, RRA spokesman Mohamed Ali Aden
said.
	   The RRA killed 20 of Aidid's men during the fighting,
and captured two battlewagons, 28 assault rifles, two
rocket-propelled grenades and a lot of food, Aden said.
	   One RRA fighter and 14 civilians were killed, he said.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991
when Ali Mahdi and Aidid's late father, Mohamed Farah
Aidid, joined forces to oust longtime dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre. The factions then turned on each other and the
country disintegrated into clan fiefdoms.

China to send 800-strong delegation to Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will send roughly 800 people to the Asian
Games in Thailand in December, including some 600 athletes
competing in all but four of the 36 events, an official newspaper
said Friday.
	   The only sports China will not compete in are kabbadi, karate,
squash and rugby, the Beijing Evening News said.
	   Tu Mingde, secretary of China's Olympic Committee, predicted
that the team would perform even better than in previous games, the
newspaper said.
	   China was the runaway champion at the last Asian Games in
Hiroshima, Japan, winning 137 _ or 41 percent _ of the 337 gold
medals at stake in the two weeks of competition.
	   In total medals, the Chinese had 289, to 207 for Japan and 179
for the South Koreans.
	   Tu was speaking Thursday in Bangkok, where he said he was
``satisfied'' with preparations for the games, the Beijing Evening
News said.
	   The games are held every four years.

Justice minister denies Hague tribunal jurisdiction in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's justice minister
declared Friday that the U.N. war crimes tribunal has no authority
to pursue cases in Kosovo, the independent Beta news agency
reported.
	   The U.N. Security Council had called on the government to
cooperate with the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, in
its Sept. 23 resolution demanding an end to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Beta quoted the minister, Zoran Knezevic, as saying the court
``has no jurisdiction over Kosovo, not according to any
international document.''
	   Knezevic said the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke does not
require Belgrade to acknowledge the tribunal's jurisdiction over
Kosovo.
	   Knezevic said ``the Hague tribunal has no place in Kosovo,''
because ``conflicts there were caused by terrorist actions of
Kosovo Albanians.''
	   Knezevic blamed the six-month conflict on the ``terrorists,'' as
rebel ethnic Albanians are referred to by the officials of Serbia
and Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ German driver Michael Schumacher proved he
is a strong contender to win the season-ending Formula One race _
and claim a third championship _ by posting the best time Friday in
practice for the Japanese Grand Prix.
	   Schumacher, in a Ferrari, clocked a lap of 1 minute 39.823
seconds on the Suzuka figure-eight track, topping series leader
Mika Hakkinen by nearly a second.
	   But being fastest in Sunday's Grand Prix won't necessarily be
enough to capture the championship.
	   The German is four points behind McLaren's Hakkinen in the
championship after 15 races and to claim the crown he not only
needs to finish first but needs Hakkinen to do no better than
third.
	   And Schumacher seemed to take little satisfaction in turning the
fastest practice run Friday.
	   ``I do not think today's result shows the whole truth, and
therefore I expect qualifying to be very close tomorrow,'' said
Schumacher.
	   Hakkinen _ who placed fifth overall _ looked better than his
slow practice time would suggest.
	   Near the end of the two-hour session Hakkinen was on pace to top
Schumacher's time only to be slowed by traffic near the end of his
lap.
	   Teammate David Coulthard met a similar fate and ended the day
with the sixth fastest time.
	   ``Mika and David had to abandon their fast laps when (Jean)
Alesi and Irvine had an off. In the end Mika was under way with his
best split times when he was held up by traffic in the last
chicane,'' explained Norbert Haug, head of Mercedes-Benz
Motorsport.
	   Alesi's Sauber and Schumacher's teammate Irvine skidded off the
track just before the close of the practice session.
	   Jordan's Ralf Schumacher, Michael's younger brother, posted the
second fastest lap around the 5.864 kilometer (3.643 miles)
circuit, 0.513 seconds behind the leader. Heinz-Harald Frentzen,
also from Germany, finished third in a Winfield Williams.
	   Hakkinen needs only a second-place finish Sunday to clinch his
first world title.
	   The Finn said he was happy with his car after Friday's practice
laps.
	   ``The car ran reliably, it was strong and we completed a good
number of laps, so I am very pleased,'' he said.
	   The leader of the McLaren driving team, Ron Dennis, is confident
Hakkinen will win the driver's championship Sunday and give McLaren
the constructors title.
	   ``He has his emotions and thoughts in control. He's absolutely
cool and calm,'' said Dennis.
	   ``My feeling is we deserve the championship,'' he said.
	   To keep Hakkinen from claiming the crown, Ferrari is counting on
its No. 2 driver Irvine to come in second.
	   Irvine was faster in practice than Hakkinen on Friday, with the
day's fourth quickest lap. If he gets out in front of him on Sunday
too, he will try to block Hakkinen, thus depriving him of precious
series points.
	   Ferrari's Schumacher has already won world championships in 1994
and 1995 and has predicted he will capture his third with a victory
Sunday.
	   He has good reason to be confident on the difficult Suzuka
course, having won the Japanese Grand Prix here last year and in
1995.
	   The German is also a good wet-weather driver, a talent that
could serve him well if the rain _ common in past races here _
comes again to Suzuka.
	   Rain fell on the course after the practice session ended Friday
afternoon and forecasters said there was a 30 percent chance of
showers for both Saturday's qualifying race and for Sunday's Grand
Prix.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Intensifying their crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police on Friday cut the telephone
lines of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin and the group's leading
activists. They also prevented a Hamas march in the West Bank.
	   A fax sent to news agencies claimed that Palestinian agents
ransacked Yassin's home early Friday, arrested three bodyguards and
seized weapons, videotapes and files. The authenticity of the
handwritten fax, signed by Yassin, could not be confirmed.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists have been arrested in the Gaza
Strip since Thursday's suicide attack on an Israeli convoy of jeeps
and school buses in the Gaza Strip, security officials said.
	   Speaking out for the first time on the crackdown, Hamas accused
Arafat of trying to ``wipe out'' the group, but did not threaten to
retaliate. In a leaflet, Hamas called Thursday's bombing ``heroic''
but fell short of claiming responsibility.

Thai baht continues climb at 12-month high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai baht edged higher to a new
12-month high Friday, strengthening on the U.S. dollar's downward
spiral against the yen and most other Southeast Asian currencies.
	   Spot trading in the baht closed Friday at 36.775 to the dollar,
up from 36.805 Thursday.
	   At Friday's close, the baht was 29.6 percent lower against the
dollar since Thailand abandoned its fixed foreign exchange system
on July 2, 1997. On Jan. 12 this year, it touched its low point of
56.45 to the dollar.
	   Thai government officials said this weeks that the baht has been
appreciating on the health of the country's current account surplus
and inflows of foreign direct investment.
	   The baht has traded above 37.00 to the dollar since Wednesday,
and dealers expect its surge to slow at 36.50.
	   The Bank of Thailand said Friday that current account surplus
was recorded at dlrs 1.12 billion at end-August. The balance of
payments was also a surplus of dlrs 376 million at end-September.
	   Bank of Thailand Economic Research Director Atchana Waiquamdee
told a press conference the baht has strengthened 9.7 percent
against the dollar in October. She said the baht rose 3 percent in
September.
	   ``The appreciation of the baht has hurt profits of Thai
exporters but has cut the cost of imports of raw materials,'' she
said.
	   She said trends haven't shown yet that Thai exports are heading
for a recovery, because imports of raw materials have continued to
decline.
	   Private consumption also is on the decline, despite stable
trends for some sectors of consumption. She said consumption of
imported consumer goods, beer, gasoline and motorcycles tends to be
stable rather than declining.
	   Dealers said key economic data released by the Bank of Thailand
Friday failed to show the economy has bottomed out.
	   ``We really don't know whether we has reached the bottom yet. We
might know that early next year,'' said a currency dealer for a
Japanese bank.
	   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
manufacturing production index and private investment are still on
the decline, but these factors are unlikely to hurt the baht for
the time being.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Once-awesome Hurricane Mitch, now
weakened to a tropical storm, drove inland over Honduras and
Nicaragua on Friday, adding to the floods and wreckage that have
killed at least 36 people and forced tens of thousands from their
homes.
	   ``God save Honduras!'' said President Carlos Flores Facusse on
Thursday after flying over parts of the disaster area left by more
than two days of hurricane-force winds. In some areas, as much as 2
feet (0.6 meters) of rain fell within six hours.
	   Honduran officials said at least 15,000 houses have been
destroyed along the Atlantic coast. Many communities were cut off
by floods in Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua.
	   There was also heavy damage reported to crucial banana and other
crops. Gasoline imports were halted by closed ports and officials
said rationing might start Saturday in this poor Central American
country.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard said it was searching the Caribbean for a
240-foot (73- meter) sailing schooner with 31 people aboard that
has been missing since Tuesday.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at 1200 GMT Friday,
the storm was centered about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southeast of
La Ceiba.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph (65 kph), down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday. The center said Mitch would probably
weaken if it remained over land, but could regain force if it
returned to sea.
	   Honduran officials said at least 23 people have been killed _ 14
of them on the Bay Islands, a diving resort that was left cut off
after being pounded by the hurricane's highest winds for two days.
At least 72,000 had fled their homes.
	   In La Ceiba, which was isolated by two downed bridges, more than
one-third of the city's 40,000 residents were staying in 18
shelters _ all running short on food and water.
	   Nicaragua reported 12 dead, and 50,000 evacuated. Mexico
reported one fatality, an American who was thrown from his boat
south of Cancun on Monday and presumed dead.
	   The missing schooner, the Antigua-registered Fantome, had been
on a tourist cruise near Belize and the Bay Islands. It was last
heard from when it radioed that it was heading east to avoid the
storm, said James Canty, a spokesman for the owner, Windjammer
Barefoot Cruises in Miami.
	   Coast Guard Assistant Duty Officer Chet Darby in Miami said late
Thursday it was too early for alarm: ``This kind of thing happens
often. We obviously don't have a hurricane out there every day but
we try not to make conclusions.''
	   Meanwhile, a mudslide Thursday near Honduras' capital,
Tegucigalpa cut the only highway to the nation's second city, San
Pedro Sula in the north.
	   The Rio Chamelecon rose Thursday night and swept away more than
300 houses in El Progreso, 20 miles (33 kilometers) southeast of
San Pedro Sula. But Col. Anael Perez, spokesman for the National
Emergency Committee, said all the residents had evacuated earlier.
	   In La Lima, Honduras headquarters for Cincinnati-based Chiquita
Brands International, neighborhoods were waist-deep in water and
hundreds of families huddled on a highway under tents of scrap tarp
and wood.
	   ``Last night the water just kept rising, so we decided to come
onto the highway,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo, 36, a firewood
collector.
	   Water, food and medicine was running short in many areas.
	   ``Today I just ate cassava with salt,'' said Maria Gonzalez, 28,
on Thursday in the town of Tela on Honduras' northern coast. She
held her 6-month-old son Jose in her arms. ``Tomorrow I don't know
what I'll do.''

Environmentalists hit global trade chief with cream pies, aide
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of
the World Trade Organization with cream pies, an official said.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech in
which he defended a WTO decision overturning a U.S. attempt to
protect endangered sea turtles from shrimp fishermen.
	   Ruggiero released a one-sentence comment through his Geneva
headquarters, saying, ``When they have no more rational arguments,
the fringe elements have to use cake.''
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side,
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year, said a
trade official.
	   Rockwell led Ruggiero back into Chatham House in London and
wiped the cream off his suit and face. He had been hit by more than
one pie, said the official, who had no further details.
	   The WTO drew the ire of environmental groups two weeks ago by
ruling that the United States cannot force shrimp-exporting
countries to fit their fleets with dlr 75 devices that protect the
turtles.
	   The World Wildlife Fund called the ruling a blow to the turtles
``and against the development of international norms and
practices.'' Other groups also denounced the decision.
	   However, the ruling upheld countries' right to introduce laws to
protect exhaustible natural resources.
	   In his speech Friday Ruggiero said the decision ``strongly
reinforces the growing need to negotiate global environmental rules
and standards, and to reach a global consensus about environmental
issues.''
	   The ruling was against a U.S. law forbidding the importation of
shrimp caught with trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered
species of sea turtles.
	   India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand have refused to put the
devices on their nets. Unequipped nets are blamed for killing
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.

Montgomerie shoots 5-under 67 to lead Westwood by one

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie shot a 5-under 67 Friday
to move to 7-under par after two rounds of the Volvo Masters and a
one-stroke lead over Lee Westwood.
	   Westwood shot 68 as the two battle in the final tournament of
the season for the European money title. Darren Clarke, the only
other player with a chance to claim the season title, had a late
start after sharing the lead with a first-round 67.
	   The lead in the tournament _ almost an afterthought in the
battle for the money title _ was held by Australian Peter Lonard,
who was 9-under after 15 holes.
	   Montgomerie tops the European Tour money list with winnings of
760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood is No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs
1,200,884) followed by Clarke at 616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   The winner of the Volvo Masters earns 166,000 pounds (dlrs
278,880). In addition, there is a bonus for the top 15 finishers on
the European money list _ beginning with 170,000 pounds (dlrs
285,600) for No. 1, 120,000 (dlrs 201,600) for No. 2 and so on.
	   If Montgomerie, 35, finishes ahead of Westwood he will claim his
sixth straight European money title. Westwood, 25, is after his
first.
	   Westwood can also take the money title by finishing second,
provided Montgomerie is third or lower. If Westwood finishes third,
Montgomerie must finish 12th or lower.
	   For Clarke to top the money list, he must win the tournament and
hope that Westwood finishes no better than third and Montgomerie no
higher than ninth.
	   Montgomerie, Westwood or Clarke could all break the European
Tour season money record of 875,146 pounds (dlrs 1,470,245) set by
Montgomerie in 1996.

Russian military says it is being shortchanged by government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian armed forces have received less than
half the money they were budgeted this year, adding to the many
problems facing the military, news agencies reported Friday.
	   The Defense Ministry said it had received 31 billion rubles so
far this year. That would be worth dlrs 1.9 billion at current
exchange rates, although some of the money was issued when the
ruble was worth more.
	   The Defense Ministry budget was 80.4 billion rubles _ dlrs 5
billion at current exchange rates, but nearly triple that amount
when the budget was signed.
	   The Defense Ministry also said it had proposed raising wages for
members of the armed services, the news agencies said. Currently,
soldiers and sailors up to the rank of sergeant-major are paid
between 18.5 rubles (dlrs 1.15) and 70 rubles (dlrs 4.35) a month.
	   A general commanding a division earns 2,100 rubles (dlrs 131) a
month.
	   The Defense Ministry has proposed doubling salaries, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Morale in the Russian armed forces is notoriously poor, and
there are frequent reports of servicemen killing themselves and
others in despair. The services are plagued by inadequate housing
and shortages of food, clothing and equipment.

Hamas lashes out against Palestinian Authority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Furious over a crackdown on its most senior
members, the militant Islamic group Hamas on Friday accused the
Palestinian Authority of trying to destroy it.
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, the group also
praised Thursday's suicide bombing aimed at a bus full of Israeli
school children as ``heroic,'' but stopped short of claiming
responsibility.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested. Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin has been put under house arrest and his phone has been cut.
	   Hamas claimed that the crackdown did not come in response to
Thursday's attack, but was part of a campaign against Hamas agreed
upon in the Wye River agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians.
	   The group urged Arab and Islamic leaders to denounce the
crackdown.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruben Acosta of Mexico was re-elected the head of
the volleyball's world governing body for his fifth term Friday,
the final day of the Federation Internationale de Volleyball World
Congress in Tokyo.
	   The meeting also decided that 12 national teams will be able to
go to the 2000 Sydney Olympics for men's volleyball, and 12
national teams for women's volleyball, the FIVB said in a
statement.
	   They will be chosen from the top three teams of the 1999 World
Cup, the winners from each of the five continents competition, and
three more teams from the Olympic world finals, it said. Australia
as host will qualify automatically.
	   In beach volleyball, 24 teams will compete for the men and 24
more for the women, with up to two teams competing from each
nation. Australia will be able to send one team each for men's and
women's competition, regardless of world rankings.
	   The other teams will be selected by world rankings set in the
world tour that runs from 1999 to August 2000, the world
championships and FIVB rankings by continent, it said.
	   The FIVB said the Youth World Championships for men will be held
in Saudi Arabia in 1999, and for women in Portugal.
	   The Junior World Championship for men will be held in Thailand.
The one for women, initially set for the Dominican Republic, was
postponed to 2001 because of the damage caused by the recent
Hurricane Georges. The new site for the 1999 competition was still
undecided, the FIVB said.
	   Earlier in the week, the FIVB adopted major rule changes,
including a decision to award points to whichever team wins a
rally, whether it is serving or not. Under current rules, only the
serving team can win a point.
	   In the new rally point scoring system, which will take effect
next year, matches will continue to be the best of five sets, but
the first four sets will be to 25 points, and only the fifth set
will be to 15 points. The changes makes the game shorter and more
exciting.
	   The congress approved a rule change that will allow each team to
register a defensive ``libero'' player restricted to the back row.
That rule, already tried out at several competitions, will be in
effect at the World Championships starting Nov. 3 in Japan.
	   The next FIVB congress will be held in Sydney in 2000.

EU welcomes formation of new Slovak government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Friday welcomed the
formation in Slovakia of a new government committed to meeting
conditions for joining the EU.
	   Lousewies van der Laan, foreign affairs spokeswoman for the
European Commission, said the EU executive particularly welcomed
the inclusion of members of Slovakia's ethnic-Hungarian minority in
the new government.
	   Under the authoritarian rule of former leader Vladimir Meciar,
Slovakia was pushed to the back of a line of former-communist
nations hoping to join the EU and NATO.
	   New Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda said after he was sworn in
Friday that Slovakia wants to catch up to its neighbors on the path
to EU membership.
	   The elections that brought Dzurinda to power were a step in the
right direction, Van der Laan said. The EU Commission is scheduled
to present progress reports on 12 nations' efforts to join the
Union Wednesday.
	   EU officials said it was unlikely they would be able to evaluate
changes in Slovakia fast enough to upgrade the country's
application by the time EU leaders meet December in Vienna,
Austria, to assess the Union's eastward expansion.
	   Dzurinda plans to fly to Brussels Nov. 6 for talks with the EU's
Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den Broek and NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana on Slovakia's bid to join both organizations.

Portuguese report into mad cow disease faults government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government's reluctance to introduce
costly new controls on cattle feed caused crucial delays in efforts
to stem the spread of mad cow disease, leading to an almost certain
EU ban on Portuguese beef exports, according to an official
inquiry.
	   A lawmaker's report, quoted in Friday's edition of daily Diario
de Noticias, said the government was ``massively irresponsible'' in
delaying appropriate measures to fight the disease.
	   The European Union is expected to ban the export of beef and
cattle from Portugal next week after EU veterinary officials
endorsed the move Friday. Neighboring Spain prohibited imports of
beef from Portugal last month.
	   The inquiry rebuked former Farm Minister Fernando Gomes da Silva
for blocking parts of a proposed 1997 law which aimed to prohibit
the use of the remains of bovine animals in cattle feed.
	   Mad cow disease _ or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE _ is
believed to have spread in Europe through animal feed containing
bovine remains.
	   Gomes da Silva, who quit Oct. 1 citing ill health, rejected the
new controls on cattle feed because they would cost 1.34 billion
escudos (dlrs 8 million) a year, a sum that could not be met by his
ministry's budget, according to the report.
	   The ministry already had implemented a costly program in 1996 to
slaughter about 5,000 cattle to prevent contagion.
	   The law tightening controls on cattle feed was finally
introduced last month after the EU threatened a beef ban.
	   The ministry declined to comment Friday on the latest report.
	   In recommending the ban, the European Commission officials said
they had found ``serious shortcomings'' earlier this year in
official controls on cattle feed. They also noted a recent sharp
rise in cases of mad cow disease.
	   Portugal has reported 67 new cases of mad cow disease this year.
That compares with a total of 94 cases in all the previous seven
years. Also, there are at least 28 suspected but unconfirmed cases.
	   No cases of nvCJD, a disease similar to BSE which affects
people, have been reported in Portugal.
	   A Farm Ministry spokesman said the incidence of BSE likely would
increase over the next two years in Portugal because the disease
has an incubation period of at least five years.
	   The number of cases would then decrease as the effect of
measures was felt, spokesman Augusto Vilela said.
	   Most cases of BSE have been detected in dairy herds in small,
outlying farms in the mountainous north of the country where
farmers often are unfamiliar with modern issues.
	   Portugal exported more than 7,000 cattle last year, about 90
percent of them to neighboring Spain.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Intensifying their crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police on Friday cut the telephone
lines of Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin and the group's leading
activists. They also prevented a Hamas march in the West Bank.
	   A fax sent to news agencies claimed that Palestinian agents
ransacked Yassin's home early Friday, arrested three bodyguards and
seized weapons, videotapes and files. The authenticity of the
handwritten fax, signed by Yassin, could not be confirmed.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists have been arrested in the Gaza
Strip since Thursday's suicide attack on an Israeli convoy of jeeps
and school buses in the Gaza Strip, security officials said.
	   Speaking out for the first time on the crackdown, Hamas accused
Arafat of trying to ``wipe out'' the group, but did not threaten to
retaliate. In a leaflet, Hamas called Thursday's bombing ``heroic''
but fell short of claiming responsibility.
	   On Thursday, a caller to Israeli radio claimed responsibility
for Hamas. It is not unusual that conflicting statements are issued
in the name of Hamas.

New German foreign minister urges pressure on Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new foreign minister called
Friday for continued international pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to make sure he pulls his forces out of Kosovo
province.
	   The comments by Joschka Fischer, a member of the formerly
pacifist Greens party who took over the post Wednesday, matched the
line of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
	   During talks with Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen,
both agreed ``that the pressure on Milosevic must be maintained,''
the foreign ministry said.
	   Both also called for a ``stability concept'' to save the Russian
economy, based on democracy and a market economy.
	   Looking ahead to Germany's presidency of the European Union
during the first half of 1999, Fischer said the reform of EU
finances and its farm subsidies would have top priority.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has served word that Germany, the
top contributor to the EU budget, will seek to bargain down its
share.
	   Fischer visited Paris, London and Warsaw this week on his first
trip abroad as foreign minister.
	   He said Germany remains a firm advocate of bringing eastern
European candidate countries into the EU fold.
	   ``Within a realistic view of the time horizon, Germany will
support with all its might a swift completion of the EU membership
processes,'' he said.
	   Petersen stopped over in Bonn on his way to the Middle East.
Fischer said the meeting underlined the new government's interest
in continued close ties with its Nordic neighbors.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
at least 60 people and injuring 162.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story building
and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service
leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the
disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. in
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   On Friday, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and
poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene, and the 60th
victim died at a hospital, officials said.
	   Of the injured, 65 were in intensive care, said Per Oertenwall,
a local medical officer in charge of coordinating information from
the area hospitals.
	   The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or
children of immigrants. Police said the list of injured included
Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The Macedonian Association had rented the facility out for the
dance, Carlsson said. The renter was not immediately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the brick building.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, although

	   Oertenwall, the medical officer, said the total number of
injured was 162, down from previous estimates of 180.
	   Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter to
burn clinics in other cities, the report said. Goteborg is about
500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.

Queen dedicates hospital to Princes Diana; Fergie defends princess
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II on Friday
dedicated a new children's hospital building to the memory of
Princess Diana, the first memorial to the princess she has unveiled
since her former daughter-in-law's death.
	   With the construction of the new building, Birmingham Children's
Hospital was granted royal permission to change its name to the
Diana, Princess of Wales Children's Hospital.
	   The queen, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, unveiled a
stained-glass window commemorating the opening, then met patients
and their families, as Diana so often did in the last years of her
life.
	   Diana's reputation came under attack this week in a new book
that said she telephoned death threats to Camilla Parker Bowles,
her husband's lover, and that she had committed adultery with her
police protection officer before Prince Charles renewed his
relationship with Mrs. Parker Bowles.
	   Sarah, Duchess of York, came to Diana's defense in a television
interview taped for broadcast on ITV Friday night.
	   ``I got very angry about it,'' said the duchess, commonly known
as Fergie. ``We all know that Diana isn't here to answer the
questions, so they shouldn't be writing bad things without her
being able to come here and answer them.''
	   ``I don't think it's right when we love her,'' she said. ``She
was a wonderful mother and a terrific friend. ... Let's keep her as
the wonderful humanitarian and fantastic and loving person. Don't
bring it down to this level.''

Schuessel says bodyguards for OSCE verifiers under discussion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Discussions are underway on the
possibility of providing armed bodyguards for the 2,000 people who
will verify compliance with the Oct. 12 peace agreement for Kosovo,
the Austrian foreign minister said Friday.
	   Wolfgang Schuessel, here for an international conference on aid
to Albania, said the security of the ``ground verification
mission'' as well as humanitarian workers was a major concern as
diplomats put together the mission to verify the accord.
	   ``We have formal information from the Yugoslav government that
they will guarantee the security,'' Schuessel told reporters. He
said the main ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova had offered
similar assurances from the ethnic Albanian side.
	   ``But political guarantees are not enough,'' Schuessel said.
``One idea is to have the same protection that we already have for
diplomats, which is bodyguards.''
	   But he added ``this is an idea that has to be worked out.''
	   Schuessel said he raised the issue of safety for the personnel
during talks Tuesday in Vienna with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and other Russian officials. Russia is a close ally of
Yugoslavia.
	   Under the agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, the 2,000 ``verifiers''
will not carry weapons.
	   Earlier this month, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
said his government was concerned about the safety of the personnel
and that he believed they should be provided with bodyguards.

Britain fields full strength side for first Test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUDDERSFIELD, England (AP) _ Britain, which slumped to a 3-0
series whitewash in New Zealand two years ago, fields a virtual
full-strength side for Saturday's opening Test against the Kiwis at
the McAlpine Stadium.
	   Three-quarters Jason Robinson, Gary Connolly and Paul Newlove
all missed the 1996 tour, while a spate of injuries kept Iestyn
Harris, Tony Smith and Keiron Cunningham out of the 2-1 defeat by
Australia 12 months ago.
	   This time, only Denis Betts is missing in a lineup that features
a talented back-row of Adrian Morley, Chris Joynt and Paul
Sculthorpe.
	   Captain Andy Goodway is considering switching Andy Farrell to
stand-off, while Harris could lose out to Kris Radlinksi at
full-back.
	   New Zealand, meanwhile, can find no place in its starting
line-up for talented Henry Paul, the former Wigan ace.
	   New Zealand has suffered serious blows with the loss of
full-back Matthew Ridge and center Richie Blackmore through injury.
	   Coach Frank Endacott is more than happy with the replacement
goalkicker, Daryl Halligan, and his new captain, Quentin Pongia.
	   Up front for the Kiwis, Joe Vagana and Stephen Kearney have the
ability to pose plenty of problems for a new-look British pack.
	   Prop forwards Neil Cowie, Dale Laughton and Darren Fleary have
just one Test cap between them.
	   ``It will be very physical,'' Goodway said. ``Frank Endacott has
talked up the game quite a lot so the players know what to expect.
We feel we have the people to match them, both among the forwards
and the three-quarters.''
	   Keith Senior, Sheffield Eagles' tough-tackling center, has been
chosen ahead of Anthony Sullivan and Francis Cummins for the
left-wing spot.
	   The Kiwis last won on British soil in 1971.
	   ``It would be brilliant for the game if the series went to a
decider in Watford,'' said New Zealand's Robbie Paul, a star with
Bradford Bulls. ``When I play for Bradford, I give my all to Super
League Europe, who after all are the ones who feed my children and
pay for the clothes on my back.
	   ``But I'm a Kiwi through and through and I would like nothing
better than a 3-0 win.''

France opens new legal door against Pinochet with investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French prosecutors on Friday opened a judicial
investigation into complaints filed by families who blame former
Chilean leader Gen. Augusto Pinochet for the disappearance of their
relatives, judicial officials said.
	   Prosecutors were investigating charges of ``sequestration
followed by torture,'' the officials said. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   On Monday, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou had said she would ask Britain
to extradite the former dictator if such a step were deemed
``necessary and possible.''

Japan Airlines reports 10 percent lower net profit in first half
</HEADLINE>

percent; ADDS details; TRIMS extraneous material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Airlines Co.'s net profit dropped 10 percent
in the first half of this year, the airline said Friday, as Asian
economic turmoil and stiff competition took its toll on business.
	   Japan's largest airline said it made 18.3 billion yen (dlrs
157.5 million) in net profit in the six months ended Sept. 30,
1998, down from 20.1 billion yen (dlrs 173.3 million) in the same
period last year.
	   The drop came despite cheaper jet fuel, which helped the
Tokyo-based carrier pare operating costs by 1.5 percent compared
with the same period last year.
	   ``The pace of fall in average air fares is so steep that
profitability is falling even with their restructuring efforts,''
said Naoko Matsumoto, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.
	   Asian economic troubles and problems in the Japanese economy,
now going through its worst recession in decades, have cut into
revenues and forced passengers to economize by abandoning business
class for economy seats.
	   JAL announced a cost-cutting plan, including selling off
overseas hotels and resorts that it now manages, to help it meet
lower ticket prices from new cut-fare airlines that have appeared
because of market deregulation.
	   ``We will conduct a reduction in expenses to catch up with the
pace of sales decline,'' senior vice president Tatsuru Fukaya said.
	   JAL also said it made 7 billion yen (dlrs 60 million) on sales
of its older airplanes. Last year, it announced sale of 20 used
DC-10-40 aircraft to another Japanese company for about 20 billion
yen (dlrs 172 million).

Roussel goes on trial accused of slander, perjury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The father of the 13-year-old heiress to
the Onassis shipping fortune went on trial Friday accused of
slander and other charges by the overseers of the girl's estate.
	   Thierry Roussel was sued by the four Greek trustees for slander,
perjury and filing a false lawsuit after he lost a court case in
which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement.
	   Athina Onassis, the granddaughter of the shipping mogul
Aristotle Onassis, inherits the estimated dlrs 600 million fortune
on her 18th birthday. Athina's mother, Christina Onassis, died in
1988.
	   Athina lives in Switzerland with Roussel, his Swedish wife and
the couple's three children.
	   French-born Roussel and the trustees have been locked in a feud
over management of the estate. Roussel has failed in legal battles
in Greece to have the administration transferred to him.
	   A separate foundation manages the shipping and real estate
empire built by Onassis.

Munich prosecutors begin investigation into Le Pen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Prosecutors said Friday they have opened
an investigation into French far-right leader Jean-Maire Le Pen to
determine whether he broke German laws that make trivializing the
Holocaust a crime.
	   Munich prosecutor Peter Schlicht said his office would ask
authorities in France to have Le Pen testify before a magistrate
there as part of the probe. No arrest warrant was being issued, he
said.
	   The investigation is expected to take several weeks.
	   Prosecutors want to charge Le Pen for calling the Holocaust a
``detail in the history of World War II'' at a Munich news
conference with German far-right politician Franz Schoenhuber last
year.
	   Le Pen maintains that the statement does not deny the Holocaust
happened. He could face a maximum of five years in jail if
convicted.
	   The European Parliament voted earlier this month to lift Le
Pen's parliamentary immunity from prosecution.

	   The French move came the same day the National Court in Madrid
ruled that Spain has jurisdiction over crimes committed during the
military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling gave a green light to a Spanish judge, Baltasar
Garzon, to continue his investigations into genocide, terrorism and
torture allegedly committed by Pinochet during his military
dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on that basis, which
led to Pinochet's detention in Britain, where he is recovering from
back surgery.
	   On Wednesday, Britain's High Court overturned the Spanish arrest
warrant.
	   The court ruled Pinochet, 82, could not be prosecuted for crimes
committed while in office, and that British courts don't have
jurisdiction to arrest a non-British citizen for crimes committed
in another country.

At least 60 killed in fire at Halloween dance in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with death toll rising to 63, ADD
that building did not have sprinklers. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos STO101-112 &QL; 
 &UR; By LENNART SIMONSSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 63 people and
injuring about 160 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left
rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader
Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective
leading the disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims
choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found
at the scene and four others died later, officials said. Before the
latest three deaths were announced, local medical officer Per
Oertenwall had said there were 162 injured, 65 of them in intensive
care.
	   The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to
have them, officials said.
	   The dance apparently was attended mostly by immigrants or
children of immigrant. Police said the list of injured included
Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
	   The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,
had in turn rented the facility out to another person for the
dance, Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, although
officials said it apparently began with an explosion.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the
capital, Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new coalition government
was formed Friday by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, a month after
parliamentary elections.
	   Jozef Migas, the newly appointed parliament chairman, first
appointed Dzurinda prime minister, who then submitted his list of
ministers. They were then sworn in by Migas, who was elected on
Thursday and is acting head of state in the absence of a president.
	   The Sept. 25-26 ballot led to the resignation of authoritarian
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, whose Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia still emerged the strongest party but did not win enough
seats for a majority in parliament.
	   The coalition holds 93 of the 150 seats in parliament. Meciar's
party hold 43 seats.
	   Meciar was replaced by Dzurinda, 43, chairman of the largest
ruling party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition. and was briefly
Minister of Transportation in 1994.
	   ``We need to bring stability for our citizens, fight organized
crime, improve the economy and catch up with the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary on their way to the European Union,'' Dzurinda
said only minutes after the government was established.
	   The government was formed by four parties _ Dzurinda's party,
the Democratic Left of former communists, the Hungarian Coalition
Party and the Party of Civic Understanding.
	   The first session of the new government was scheduled for
Saturday.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Washington began its slide to the bottom of the
NFL this season with a loss to the New York Giants. Can the
Redskins end it by beating New York?
	   And can Carolina, suddenly inept at home as well as on the road,
break its seven-game losing string against New Orleans?
	   While much attention is being paid to whether Denver or
Minnesota can manage the first unbeaten season since Miami did it
in 1972, the 'Skins and Panthers are stuck at the other end of the
standings. One of them could be headed for the ignominy of an
unprecedenteed 0-16, but not both _ they meet in Charlotte on Dec.
13.
	   ``I don't think we need to focus on the next nine games at
once,'' 'Skins tackle Shar Pourdanesh said. ``We have enough
trouble focusing on one game at a time.''
	   Sunday's game comes after a bye week for both struggling teams.
At least the Giants went into the bye off their best effort of the
year; the Redskins were as abysmal as always in being routed by
Minnesota.
	   Coach Norv Turner, heavily criticized throughout the D.C. area,
has shifted back to Trent Green at quarterback. He also lost
high-priced free agent defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield for 2-4
weeks with a knee injury.
	   ``I'm very disappointed personally, coming into a new program,
not wanting things to happen like it is,'' Stubblefield said.
``It's just not the way you want to start off putting on a new
uniform, coming to a new home, starting off with all these
disasters.''
	   The Giants (3-4) don't want to fall into the trap of
underestimating a team they beat 31-24 in the opener.
	   ``You don't want to be the team that they beat,'' defensive end
Michael Strahan said. ``At the same time, you can't think about
that when you're on the field. We can't be cautious. If we're
scared that we're going to be the team that they beat, then we're
going to get beat.''
	   The Saints (4-3) are taking the same approach into Ericsson
Stadium, where Carolina has lost six in a row, including all four
this season.
	   ``Anybody we play is going to be dangerous for us,'' Saints
coach Mike Ditka said. ``Let's face it. We understand that. We're
just trying to find out who we are.''
	   They are a contender for a wild-card berth in the watered-down
NFC. The Panthers are contenders for the first overall draft pick,
which they don't even own, having dealt it away for DT Sean
Gilbert.
	   ``Losing eats at you, period, whether it's home or on the
road,'' quarterback Steve Beuerlein said. ``Obviously you'd like to
be dominant at home, but we're not winning anywhere right now.''
	   The atmosphere could turn wild if Kerry Collins plays for New
Orleans. Ditka, who signed the quarterback after he was cut by the
Panthers following an admission his heart wasn't into the game,
won't start, but could play.
	   ``I just don't like the environment,'' Ditka said when asked
about giving Collins his first start for the Saints in his first
professional home. ``If he has to play, then it's one thing. But to
put him out there, I think there's too many sharks in the water.''
	   Elsewhere Sunday, it's Denver at Cincinnati, Minnesota at Tampa
Bay, Arizona at Detroit, Jacksonville at Baltimore, Miami at
Buffalo, New England at Indianapolis, St. Louis at Atlanta,
Tennessee at Pittsburgh, the New York Jets at Kansas City, San
Francisco at Green Bay and Oakland at Seattle.
	   On Monday night, Dallas is at Philadelphia. Off this week are
Chicago and San Diego, the final byes of the season.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new coalition government
was formed Friday by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, just over a
month after parliamentary elections.
	   In a quick succession of events, Jozef Migas, the newly
appointed parliament chairman, first appointed Dzurinda prime
minister, who then submitted his list of ministers. They were then
sworn in by Migas, who was elected on Thursday and is acting as
head of state in the absence of a president.
	   The Sept. 25-26 ballot led to the resignation of authoritarian
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, whose Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia still emerged the strongest party but did not win enough
seats for a majority in parliament.
	   The coalition holds 93 of the 150 seats in parliament. Meciar's
party hold 43 seats.
	   Meciar was replaced by Dzurinda, 43, a former transportation
engineer who is now chairman of the largest ruling party, the
Slovak Democratic Coalition. and was briefly Minister of
Transportation in 1994.
	   ``We need to bring stability for our citizens, fight organized
crime, improve the economy and catch up with the Czech Republic,
Poland and Hungary on their way to the European Union,'' Dzurinda
said only minutes after the government was established.
	   Dzurinda's Cabinet would like to catch up fast with the other
countries. Dzurinda said he hoped his country would be acccepted as
a candidate by the EU Vienna summit in December.
	   But Dzurinda immediately softened his stance, adding ``We would
like it to be at this time, but we do not want to make it a race.''
	   In Brussels, the European Union Friday welcomed the formation of
a new government committed to meeting conditions for joining the
EU.
	   Lousewies van der Laan, foreign affairs spokeswoman for the
European Commission, said the EU executive particularly welcomed
the inclusion of members of Slovakia's ethnic-Hungarian minority in
the new government.
	   The elections that brought Dzurinda to power were a step in the
right direction, Van der Laan said. The EU Commission is scheduled
to present progress reports on 12 nations' efforts to join the
Union Wednesday.
	   EU officials said it was unlikely they would be able to evaluate
changes in Slovakia fast enough to upgrade the country's
application by the time EU leaders meet in Vienna to assess the
Union's eastward expansion.
	   Dzurinda plans to fly to Brussels Nov. 6 for talks with the EU's
Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van den Broek and NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana on Slovakia's bid to join both
organizations.He will later go to Bonn and Vienna.

Justice minister denies Hague tribunal jurisdiction in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with background, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's justice minister
declared Friday that the U.N. war crimes tribunal has no authority
to pursue cases in Kosovo, the independent Beta news agency
reported.
	   In Its Sept. 23 resolution demanding an end to the Kosovo
crackdown, the U.N. Security Council called on the Yugoslav
government to cooperate with the tribunal, based in The Hague,
Netherlands.
	   But Beta quoted the minister, Zoran Knezevic, as saying the
court ``has no jurisdiction over Kosovo, not according to any
international document.''
	   Knezevic said the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke does not
require Belgrade to acknowledge the tribunal's jurisdiction over
Kosovo.
	   Officials of the tribunal have repeatedly asserted that they do
have jurisdiction over the conflict in Kosovo. The court was
established with a mandate to investigate alleged crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.
	   ``Our jurisdiction throughout the territory (of the former
Yugoslavia) is clear under international law and various Security
Council resolutions,'' tribunal spokesman Jim Landale said Friday.
``It is not negotiable by anyone apart from the Security Council,
which gives us our mandate.''
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and her deputy, Graham Blewitt,
are planning to head a team of investigators and prosecutors
traveling to the region on Thursday.
	   Yugoslav authorities, however, have so far not issued them
visas.
	   In its Sept. 23 resolution, the Security Council demanded that
Belgrade take a number of steps to defuse the crisis. NATO
threatened airstrikes if the government did not comply.
	   But the reference to cooperation with the tribunal was contained
in a separate section of the resolution which uses less threatening
and less specific language.
	   Instead of using the word ``demand,'' the resolution ``calls
upon'' Yugoslav officials and Kosovo Albanians ``to cooperate
fully'' with the tribunal ``in the investigation of possible
violations within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.''
	   Knezevic said ``the Hague tribunal has no place in Kosovo,''
because ``conflicts there were caused by terrorist actions of
Kosovo Albanians.''
	   Knezevic blamed the six-month conflict on the ``terrorists,'' as
rebel ethnic Albanians are referred to by the officials of Serbia
and Yugoslavia.

De Klerk says apartheid was not a crime against humanity

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In a sign racial
reconciliation still faces many obstacles, white-run South Africa's
last president, F.W. de Klerk, on Friday said apartheid was not a
crime against humanity.
	   De Klerk slammed a panel probing apartheid abuses that concluded
white-run governments, including his own, killed and tortured black
liberation activists.
	   Even though a last-minute court action spared de Klerk from
being explicitly condemned by the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, he was unstinting in his criticism of its efforts to
document atrocities by all sides in the fight against apartheid.
	   ``The TRC has failed lamentably to carry out its mandate to
establish the truth concerning the conflict of the past and to
promote reconciliation,'' he said in a statement.
	   Though the commission's report endorsed an internationally
recognized convention that apartheid was a ``crime against
humanity,'' de Klerk defended white rule.
	   He said killings and torture carried out by state security
forces were the work of rogue individuals and was never state
policy.
	   ``I also reject the contention that apartheid was a crime
against humanity, notwithstanding the serious injustices which
occurred and for which I have sincerely apologized,'' he said.
	   The commission's report was the culmination of 2 1-2 a half
years of collecting evidence from victims and perpetrators. It
listed details of hundreds of abuses and condemned top people from
apartheid governments and the black groups that fought them.
	   The exhaustively researched report, the most authoritative and
comprehensive investigation of apartheid ever, found that the
highest levels of government sanctioned the killing and torture of
apartheid's opponents.
	   Condemned by virtually all political parties, the report, which
was meant to help heal a nation, has instead exposed many old
racial wounds.
	   The ruling African National Congress on Thursday failed to get a
court order blocking the report's release. Its officials were
angered by findings that the party executed suspected spies and
killed innocent civilians in bombing campaigns.
	   The ANC's legal action nearly derailed the report's handover
ceremony and outraged the Truth Commission chairman, Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, one of the staunchest opponents of white rule.
	   At a news conference in Pretoria Friday, Tutu warned the ANC was
showing signs of the same dictatorial rule it fought so hard to
overthrow.
	   ``I didn't struggle in order to remove one set of those who
thought they were tin gods to replace them with others who are
tempted to think they are,'' he said.
	   With all the political posturing, the commission's report seems
to have failed _ in the short term at least _ in its main aim of
promoting reconciliation in a country still divided after 1994's
all race elections ended white rule.
	   Few will have expected the report's release to have brought
instant harmony. It ruthlessly catalogues tortures and murders by
all sides, sparing few of the gruesome details and heartbreaking
victim testimony.
	   But its supporters say that it is a necessary first step. It
lays the groundwork for future reconciliation by creating an
unbiased account of the country's past that all sides can share.

Meier staying at Festina, Dufaux leaves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Following the departure of Alex
Zuelle and Laurent Dufaux, Armin Meier, the third Swiss rider
banned for taking a banned drug in this year's Tour de France, will
be staying with the Festina team, the Swiss sports agency SI
reported Friday.
	   Last week it was disclosed that Zuelle left Festina, which was
thrown out of the French race, and signed a two-year contract with
the Spanish team Banesto.
	   Dufaux will join the Saeco team from the beginning of 1999,
according to Swiss press reports this week.
	   Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were banned from competing until May 1
after they admitted taking the performance-enhancing hormone EPO.
	   Festina last week cut its budget for next season by half and
said its contracts with all its riders were being renegotiated.
	   The new offer made to Zuelle was unacceptable, said Zuelle's
manager Marc Biver.
	   Dufaux will be getting ``a good deal'' with Saeco, the Lausanne
daily Le Matin quoted Biver, who is also Dufaux's manager, as
saying. He is expected to sign his contract with Saeco Monday.

Few refugees returning home in Kosovo despite troop withdrawals

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying the government draw-down in
Kosovo is incomplete, the province's main ethnic Albanian leader
called Friday for establishment of a new police force to convince
refugees it's safe to return home.
	   Despite substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army
units from Kosovo, many of the thousands of ethnic Albanians who
fled during a government crackdown against separatist rebels have
refused to go home because police were still in the area or their
houses were destroyed.
	   In one exceptional case, most of the 3,000 refugees camped near
the village of Kisna Reka 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of
here went back to their homes Thursday.
	   ``Even if they try to kill me ... I'm not going back to the
mountains,'' said Isa Qelaj, 75. ``It is too cold.''
	   But thousands more are still believed camped in the hills and
forests.
	   ``The families returning face huge destruction and many are
still too afraid to go back,'' Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
Friday. ``The number of Serb forces is still huge...Our position is
for further withdrawals and setting up of Kosovo police force until
full withdrawal.''
	   Rugova also urged the Americans and Europeans to speed the
deployment of a 2,000-member mission designed to verify that
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the peace agreement
he reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Rugova said he was confident that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose attacks on police and troops prompted the Feb. 28 crackdown,
would cooperate with the verification mission.
	   In its Friday editions, the Albanian language newspaper Koha
Ditore reported that members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission met Wednesday with KLA commanders to urge them not to
impede traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to Koha Ditore, the monitors told the rebels that Serb
police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   It appeared the monitors wanted to reassure the rebels that a
limited Serb police presence does not necessarily constitute a
violation of the agreement nor represent a major threat to
civilians.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched the crackdown
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat of
airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for
Milosevic to fully comply.
	   But Western powers also oppose rebel demands for an independent
Kosovo, fearing that could trigger unrest elsewhere in southern
Balkan countries with large ethnic Albanian communities.
	   ``There could be a kind of a vacuum and in that vacuum, the
withdrawl of the army could lead to an influx of the KLA,''
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said Friday in the
Albanian capital Tirana. ``This is absolutely not what we want. We
want to have stable conditions and to create an atmosphere for
political talks.''
	   Schuessel, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, said
the international message to Milosevic was clear ``but we need to
address our demands to the Kosovo Albnaian leaders and especially
to the KLA, not to misuse this time ... to intervene.''
	   On Thursday, Vojislaw Seselj, Serbia's deputy premier, vowed to
continue the government's fight against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo despite the withdrawals.
	   He insisted that the substantial police pullout of government
forces from Kosovo, as demanded by NATO, did not mean Serbia would
give up its struggle against ``terrorism.''
	   ``All armed terrorists will be disarmed and brought to
justice,'' said Seselj, according to the Fonet news agency. ``The
withdrawal of police from Kosovo does not mean the end of (our)
fight against terrorism.''
	   Also Thursday, Ivica Dacic, a spokesman for Milosevic's ruling
Socialists, said Serbia and Yugoslavia would ``defend themselves as
they have done so far.''
	   International observers report large numbers of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers have returned to barracks or left Kosovo, and a
convoy of 15 tanks rumbled into the Pristina barracks on Thursday
from positions 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of the capital.
	   But police and soldiers still maintain a visible presence in
some areas. Police were checking vehicles Thursday on the main road
between Pristina and the western city of Pec. Three tanks and two
mortar launchers were positioned outside Junik, near the mountain
border with Albania.
	   Refugees said the continued police presence shows the failure of
the agreement.
	   ``I don't have anything to eat and my family is sleeping on the
floor but I can't go back because there are police just 200 meters
(yards) from my house,'' complained Cen Gashi, 58, a farmer and
father of 11 children living in the room of an acquaintance about 5
kilometers (2 miles) from his village, Perceva.

France opens new legal door against Pinochet with investigation

	   PARIS (AP) _ French prosecutors on Friday opened an
investigation into complaints filed by families who blame former
Chilean leader Gen. Augusto Pinochet for the disappearance of their
relatives, judicial officials said.
	   Prosecutors were investigating charges of ``sequestration
followed by torture,'' the officials said. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   On Monday, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou had said she would ask Britain
to extradite the former dictator if such a step were deemed
``necessary and possible.''
	   The French move came the same day the National Court in Madrid
ruled that Spain has jurisdiction over crimes committed during the
military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling gave a green light to a Spanish judge, Baltasar
Garzon, to continue his investigations into genocide, terrorism and
torture allegedly committed by Pinochet during his military
dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on that basis, which
led to Pinochet's detention in Britain, where he is recovering from
back surgery.
	   On Wednesday, Britain's High Court overturned the Spanish arrest
warrant.
	   The court ruled Pinochet, 82, could not be prosecuted for crimes
committed while in office, and that British courts don't have
jurisdiction to arrest a non-British citizen for crimes committed
in another country.
	   Pinochet remains under police guard in Britain. He was moved
Thursday from the London Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital,
which reports said could provide better security for the general.
	   A human rights report published in 1991 identified 3,197 victims
of state-sanctioned killings committed under the Pinochet regime _
including 1,102 who are still unaccounted for and presumed dead.
	   In Britain, prosecutors are expected to file an appeal Monday to
a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   Lawyers for Pinochet have pushed for immediate bail, with a
hearing expected to take place Friday.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
63 people and injuring 162.
	   The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story building
and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service
leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the
disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   On Friday, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and
poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and four others
died later, officials said. Before the latest three deaths were
announced, local medical officer Per Oertenwall had said there were
162 injured, 65 of them in intensive care.
	   The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to
have them, officials said.

Feared general shows Arab visitor a new face

	   NETIVOT, Israel (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
showed the Arab world a different side of himself Friday.
	   The ex-general who engineered Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon
hosted Mauritanian Foreign Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed Khouna at
his sheep ranch in the southern Negev Desert.
	   In the homey surroundings of Shimkim Farm, the war hero with a
deep distrust of the Arabs spoke about Israel's desire to improve
relations with Mauritania as an Arab and Muslim country.
	   Sharon and Khouna sat in matching, cozy beige armchairs in front
of a living room fireplace. Surrounded by house plants and
knickknacks, they fielded questions about the latest peace deal.
	   Khouna congratulated Israel for reaching an agreement with the
Palestinians at Wye Plantation in Maryland last week and said he
hoped it would be implemented on time.
	   ``Both sides should respect the accords they have signed,''
Khouna said to reporters.
	   Khouna and Israel have tied his visit to the agreement. The
North African country established low-level relations in 1995, but
relations froze with the stalemate in the peace process.
	   ``Israel being a small country is very much interested in
developing relations with other countries, mainly with countries
that can influence events in the Middle East,'' Sharon said,
looking at ease in a black jacket and a white shirt open at the
neck.
	   After their one-hour meeting, Sharon escorted Khouna outside the
two-story white adobe house where he has been convalescing from a
bout with the flu. They exchanged smiles and a long handshake.
	   ``Toda'' Sharon said, thanking Khouna in Hebrew. Khouna patted
Sharon on his shoulder.
	   With his 13-month-old grandson, Rotem, nestled against his right
side, Sharon and the boy waved good-bye as the Mercedes pulled
away.
	   In the driveway, a curious Rotem watched reporters as they asked
Sharon whether he believed Israel and the Palestinians would reach
a final status agreement by May 1999, the deadline set by the 1993
Oslo peace accord.
	   ``Look, I am not going to commit myself to any date. The only
think I can tell you is that I believe that Israel will make every
effort to reach peace,'' he said, Rotem's attention occasionally
diverted by two cats standing behind Sharon.
	   ``It must be clear that everything must be based upon
reciprocity and obligations must be implemented. That is a must.''

Krajicek beats Ivanisevic, Rios pulls out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek ended a nine-match
losing streak against Goran Ivanisevic on Friday to reach the
semifinals of the Eurocard Open, while second-ranked Marcelo Rios
pulled out of his second tournament in as many weeks.
	   Rios retired in the semifinals last week in Lyon, France, with a
hamstring injury in his left leg. This time, he pulled a muscle in
his right thigh while warming up by playing soccer with a tennis
ball.
	   ``I prefer to rest than to get worse,'' Rios said.
	   The Chilean advanced to the quarterfinals when his third-round
opponent, Jan Siemerink, retired with the flu after losing the
first set 6-2 late Thursday.
	   The withdrawal of Rios allowed 10th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov to
move into the semifinals.
	   ``I've been pretty unlucky these last two weeks. It's too bad
because I've been playing some good tennis,'' Rios said.
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year, is trying
to take away the No. 1 ranking from Pete Sampras.
	   Sampras made sure of retaining the No. 1 spot for at least
another week by reaching the quarterfinals of this start-studded
dlrs 2.45 million tournament.
	   The battle for No. 1 is unlikely to be settled before next
month's season-ending World Championship of the eight top-ranked
players in Hanover, Germany.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row.
	   Krajicek improved his chances of clinching one of the last two
spots available for Hanover by defeating his old nemesis,
Ivanisevic.
	   Ivanisevic, No. 14 in the world, had won the last nine matches
against the Dutchman, including the Wimbledon semifinal this year.
	   Krajicek, No. 11 in the world, plans to have surgery on his left
knee after the indoor season.
	   Winner here in 1995 and runner-up last last year, the Dutchman
slammed 11 aces and had only one double-fault to overcome
Ivanisevic 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5).
	   The matches between the two big servers often are decided in
tiebreakers and this was no exception.
	   Ivanisevic fired 10 aces, but he also committed six
double-faults.
	   The Croat saved two match points with backhand volleys but
Krajicek fired an ace to clinch the match after one hour and 25
minutes. It was only Krajicek's third victory over Ivanisevic, and
the first since 1992.

Russians mourn victims of Communist repressions
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ ``They arrested him on the street, just a few
blocks from here,'' Tatiana Dyakova said. She was speaking of her
father, one of tens of millions of Russians who perished in Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin's purges.
	   A candle and flowers in her hand, she stood among a crowd of
people who gathered Friday near the infamous secret police
headquarters on Lubyanka Square in central Moscow to commemorate
victims of Soviet-era political repressions.
	   People laid flowers at a big gray stone, brought south from
Solovetsky Island, home to the first deadly labor camp established
by the Bolsheviks. Some held pictures of relatives who perished in
the repressions.
	   ``Gulag victims, we remember you,'' a banner read.
	   Shortly after his arrest, Dyakova's father, Sergei Dyakov, who
worked as the director of the largest Soviet automobile factory,
GAZ, was executed on charges of plotting a conspiracy against
Stalin _ a standard accusation during the purges.
	   Dyakova's mother was detained for four months, then released but
banned from living in Moscow. She and her two children spent some
time in a village, then covertly returned to the capital to live in
constant fear until Stalin died in 1953.
	   ``When a neighbor came to our apartment, we covered our mother
with blankets,'' said Dyakova, now 67.
	   While senior officials, like Dyakov, fell victim to their rank
amid Stalin's crackdown on the Communist elite, ordinary Russians
were persecuted for their roots, a careless word and, sometimes,
even an unusual name.
	   ``They had a directive to exterminate 40,000 Poles, and my
father happened to have a Polish-sounding name, although in fact he
was a Belarusian,'' said Lev Pyzh, 74. ``They shot him dead because
they couldn't find enough Poles, and they were struggling to meet a
plan.''
	   Estimates vary, but historians say that at least 20 million
people died in Stalin's purges and prison camps, in famines induced
to force peasants off the land or onto collective farms and in
forced expulsions of entire ethnic groups from their homelands.
	   Most of the victims were officially rehabilitated under Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev, the charges against them repudiated.
	   Although smaller in scale and less violent, political
repressions continued under Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders.
	   Yuri Anokhin was a 26-year college student studying journalism
in 1956, when he publicly read his verses protesting the Soviet
invasion of Hungary. ``I spent four years in prison, and I can
consider myself lucky,'' he said. ``Investigators didn't beat me.''
	   Rallies commemorating victims of Communist repressions were held
in many other Russian cities on Friday. The date marks a hunger
strike in 1974 at two Soviet labor camps. It has been marked as a
remembrance day since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Alexander Lebed, the governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk province
in central Siberia and a leading presidential hopeful, joined a
ceremony in Krasnoyarsk to consecrate a church to the repression
victims.
	   Lebed said his father was sent to a camp in the 1930s, as had
his two grandfathers previously. ``That's my family's horrible
chronicle, which is hard to forgive. But it's still worse to leave
hatred for the next generation,'' Lebed said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, former dissidents,
including Yelena Bonner, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner
Andrei Sakharov, used the date to draw attention to today's
problems.
	   Although Russia officially doesn't have political prisoners,
authorities sometimes still try to persecute those who speak out
against the government.
	   Retired naval officer Alexander Nikitin is facing trial on
treason charges for handing over information to a Norwegian
environmental group about the Russian navy's unsafe handling of its
nuclear waste.
	   Prosecutors say the data constituted a state secret. Nikitin and
Bellona say the information came from public records, including
school textbooks. A judge ruled Friday that the evidence against
Nikitin was inadequate, and told prosecutors to continue
investigating the case.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Austria's foreign minister warned Friday
that the international community does not want ethnic Albanian
rebels to try to fill the power vacuum created by the withdrawal of
Serb and Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
	   Speaking in the Albanian capital Tirana, Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel said there had been movement on the ground in
Kosovo to meet international demands for a draw-down of Serbian and
Yugoslav forces.
	   ``There could be a kind of a vacuum and in that vacuum, the
withdrawal of the army could lead to an influx of the KLA,''
Schuessel said. ``This is absolutely not what we want. We want to
have stable conditions and to create an atmosphere for political
talks.''
	   Schuessel, whose country holds the current European Union
presidency, added that the international community's message to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``is more than clear.
	   ``But we need to address our demands to the Kosovo Albanian
leaders and especially to the KLA, not to misuse this time, until
the OSCE mission is there, to intervene,'' he added.
	   He was referring to the 2,000-member verification mission which
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe plans to
send to make sure both sides are living up to the Oct. 12 peace
deal.

Order of the British Empire.
	   Lewis, dressed in top hat and tails, received his MBE from

Oil rig closed after allegations of deplorable working conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian oil rig operator, Saga
Petroleum, closed down a Scottish oil platform in the North Sea
after it received reports of alleged violations of working
conditions and safety rules, news reports said Friday.
	   Saga Petroleum closed down the Noble Al White rig Thursday when
Norwegian trade unions published reports alleging that workers on
the rig ate and slept in unhygienic quarters, and were subjected to
sexual harassment and rascist treatment.
	   ``I've worked in the North Sea for 20 years, but I've never seen
anything like it,'' Egil Boe, a rig worker was quoted as telling
the Oslo Dagbladet newspaper. ``The rig is like a pigsty, and I'm
worried about my health.''
	   Boe said the rig's ventilation systems are faulty, including in
areas where hazardous chemicals are stored, and that bathrooms and
restrooms were not properly cleaned.
	   He also said that a worker had been daily bullied by his boss,
and that Portuguese workers suffered from racial discrimination.
Also, female catering workers were subjected to sexual harassment,
Boe said.
	   ``The reports about the working conditions are terrible, and
it's natural that we shut down the rig,'' Andreas Qvale, from Saga
Petroleum told the Aftenposten daily. ``It's not the way we want to
see things on Norwegian territory.''
	   He did not say how long the rig would be shut down or what
measures the company would take to reopen the rig.
	   It was the first time an entire oil platform has been shut down
in the North Sea because of allegedly inferior working conditions,
news reports said.
	   The Noble Al White is owned by Noble Drilling in Aberdeen,
Scotland, and is operated by Saga Petroleum. The 100-member crew
includes Norwegians, Britons and Portuguese workers.

Jewish scholar argues against Holocaust Memorial for Jews alone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ As Germany reopens the debate over a
controversial national Holocaust memorial, the director of a Jewish
research center said Friday that a memorial should remember all
Nazi victims, not just Jews.
	   Plans to build a monument honoring only ``the murdered Jews of
Europe'' creates an inappropriate ``hierarchy of victims,'' Julius
Schoeps, head of the Moses Mendelssohn Center for European Jewish
Studies in Potsdam, said in an interview.
	   His opinion contradicted that of Ignatz Bubis, the leader of
Germany's Jews, who has said a memorial devoted to the 6 million
Jews killed in the Holocaust was necessary because Jewish genocide
was the Third Reich's goal.
	   Schoeps also praised Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's decision to
have the new parliament vote on whether Germany should even have a
Holocaust memorial, a subject of fierce debate since the plan's
inception almost 10 years ago.
	   Some opponents argue that a memorial should include other
victims, such as homosexuals and Gypsies. Others, chiefly a group
of intellectuals, argue that the planned memorial is in bad taste.
	   While former Chancellor Helmut Kohl championed the project, the
new government leans toward scrapping it in favor of better
preserving existing memorials, such as former concentration camps.
	   It was not yet decided when parliament would vote on the
question.

Seven arrested for alleged trafficking in African girls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police have arrested seven West
Africans suspected of bringing young African girls to the
Netherlands and forcing them into prostitution, authorities said
Friday.
	   The suspects, four men and three women, were arrested earlier
this month after police raided three houses in the southern Dutch
town of Tilburg, where they also discovered five young African
girls who were believed to be victims.
	   Police from central Gelderland province said in a statement that
they began investigating after young African girls _ who had sought
asylum as refugees _ disappeared from a local shelter.
	   The investigation revealed that the missing girls, some as young
as 15, apparently had ended up in prostitution and were trafficked
to other European countries.
	   While the inquiry continued, the five girls were brought to an
undisclosed location.

EU countries endorse plan on Portugal beef ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union endorsed a plan
Friday to ban the export of beef and cattle from Portugal, EU farm
officials said.
	   The move cleared the way for the EU executive Commission to
impose the ban. The 20-member Commission is now set to impose the
ban at a regular meeting next Wednesday, a Commission official
said. The ban will take effect that day or within days of the
meeting, Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely said.
	   The Commission proposed the export ban Wednesday because of a
sharp rise this year in the number of cases of ``mad cow disease''
_ or bovine spongiform encephalopathy _ in cattle in Portugal this
year. BSE in beef has been linked to a fatal brain ailment in
humans.
	   The proposed ban was approved Friday by veterinary officials
from all EU countries except Portugal, Ireland, Belgium and
Britain, the farm officials said. Portugal and Ireland voted
against the ban, while Belgium and Britain abstained. Still, their
lack of support was not sufficient to block the proposal.
	   The Commission plans to ban the export of beef from Portugal for
nine months and to ban indefinitely the export of cattle from the
country. It plans to review the cattle export ban after 18 months.
	   Portugal has reported at least 67 cases of BSE this year,
according to the Commission. The total number of BSE cases that had
been reported in Portugal at the start of the year was 91, the
Commission said.

Ethnic Serbs from Balkans open a three-day conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Ethnic Serbs from seven Balkan
countries, Italy and Austria gathered Friday in Romania to discuss
the problems their minorities face in the countries they live in.
	   The participants, include 35 leaders and 60 other ethnic Serbs
from communities in Albania, Austria, Croatia, Italy, Macedonia,
Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia.
	   The group is meeting in the western city of Timisoara as part of
an unprecedented three-day conference initiated and organized by
Romania's Serb minority. The conference will end Saturday.
	   The conference is aimed giving ethnic Serbs a chance to exchange
ideas on cultural, historical and religious issues. They are also
to hold prayers for Serbs around the world.
	   According to Slavomir Gozdenovici, the representative of the
ethnic Serbs in Romanian Parliament, one thing they won't be
talking about, however, is the conflict in the province of Kosovo.
	   He said they did not want to transform the conference in a
political debate or a scene for disputes.
	   ``We hope to avoid this subject as much as we can, especially as
things in Kosovo got better in the last two weeks,'' Gozdenovici
told the Associated Press by telephone.
	   Roughly 30,000 ethnic Serbs currently live in Romania.
	   Yugoslavia and Romania share a common 550-kilometer (344-mile)
long border, part of which is drawn by the Danube River. The two
countries have traditionally enjoyed good relations.
	   Three weeks ago, Romania granted NATO use of its airspace,
should the Alliance decide to launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

EU eases sanctions against Nigeria, lauds move towards democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Friday decided to
lift most of its sanctions against Nigeria in recognition of the
new government's moves towards democracy and economic reform.
	   The 15 EU nations approved an easing of the sanctions regime to
come into effect on Sunday. Only military aspects of the 1995
sanctions package will stay in place, including an arms embargo and
suspension of military cooperation.
	   From Sunday, Nigerian government members, military officials and
their families will be allowed to travel to the EU again. Military
personnel can rejoin diplomatic missions and high-level visits will
be restored.
	   A sporting sanctions regime, which was never strictly applied,
is also being formally lifted.
	   ``Taking into account recent developments of the situation in
Nigeria in favor of the democratization process and the
government's commitment to economic reform, the (EU nations)
adopted a new common position,'' the EU said in a statement.
	   The sanctions were eased Friday at the end of a diplomatic
exchange between the 15 EU capitals.
	   EU foreign ministers slapped the sanctions on Nigeria in 1995
after the regime of the late Gen. Sani Abacha executed nine
dissidents, including the acclaimed playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   The EU moves follows a call last week by the Commonwealth for
its members last week to begin lifting sanctions against Nigeria as
a reward for its promise to return to civilian rule next year.
	   Abacha died of a heart attack in June and the new government,
led by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has moved towards increased
democracy and international acceptance.
	   Abubakar has freed political prisoners, welcomed foreign envoys,
invited exiles to return and committed his military government to
presidential elections, set for Feb. 27.
	   The EU promised to open a dialogue on development cooperation
and also raised the hope to resume full cooperation after the
establishment of a civilian government.

Samaranch urges Bulgaria's government, soccer federation to iron
</HEADLINE>
out differences

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch on
Friday urged Bulgaria's government and soccer federation Friday to
iron out their differences over a doping scandal.
	   Bulgaria's national sports committee suspended the soccer
federation last month, saying it failed to punish a soccer player
who tested positive for drugs.
	   The soccer federation appealed the suspension to a high court,
which hasn't yet ruled on the case.
	   Samaranch said sports organizations ``must work closely with
governments and the governments must respect the autonomy of sports
organizations.''
	   He said the conflict was an internal problem, but he hoped the
two sides could solve it as soon as possible.
	   Bulgaria's Olympic Committee is headed by Ivan Slavkov,
son-in-law of the late communist dictator Todor Zhivkov. Slavkov,
an IOC member, also serves as chairman of the soccer association.
	   Slavkov allowed Ilia Gruev, who plays for the Neftochimic club
in Burgas, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Sofia, to join the
national squad in September, although Gruev tested positive for
drugs in June and was serving a suspension for three months.
	   Bulgaria's sports committee insists the player should have been
banned for two years.
	   Slavkov has been continuously at odds with Bulgarian governments
and judiciary since Zhivkov's ouster in 1989. Two years ago, he was
tried and acquitted on charges of embezzlement and illegal arms
possession.
	   Samaranch was in the Bulgarian capital for celebrations marking
the Bulgarian Olympic Committee's 75th anniversary. He was awarded
Bulgaria's highest order, the ``Stara Planina,'' for his leadership
of the Olympic movement.

Environmentalists hit global trade chief with cream pies, aide

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of
the World Trade Organization with cream pies, an official said.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech at
Chatham House in London in which he defended a WTO decision
overturning a U.S. attempt to protect endangered sea turtles from
shrimp fishermen.
	   Ruggiero released a one-sentence comment through his Geneva
headquarters, saying, ``When they have no more rational arguments,
the fringe elements have to use cake.''
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side,
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year, said a
trade official.
	   Rockwell led Ruggiero back into Chatham House and wiped the
cream off his suit and face. He had been hit by more than one pie,
said the official.
	   A group calling itself the Biotic Baking Brigade later issued a
statement saying its pie throwers sent ``a sticky message to
Ruggiero and the global elite: `To those who wish to dominate the
world, the world replies, `Let them eat humble pie.' ''
	   The WTO drew the ire of environmental groups two weeks ago by
ruling that the United States cannot force shrimp-exporting
countries to fit their fleets with dlr 75 devices that protect the
turtles.
	   The World Wildlife Fund called the ruling a blow to turtles
``and against the development of international norms and
practices.'' Other groups also denounced the decision.
	   However, the ruling upheld countries' right to introduce laws to
protect exhaustible natural resources.
	   In his speech Friday Ruggiero said the decision ``strongly
reinforces the growing need to negotiate global environmental rules
and standards, and to reach a global consensus about environmental
issues.''
	   The ruling was against a U.S. law forbidding the importation of
shrimp caught with trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered
species of sea turtles.
	   India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand have refused to put the
devices on their nets. Unequipped nets are blamed for killing
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.

Phone lines of Hamas leaders cut as Arafat silences the group

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Intensifying their crackdown on
Islamic militants, Palestinian police Friday cut the telephone
lines of detained Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin and the group's
leading activists.
	   Security officials also said that more than 100 Hamas activists
have been arrested since Thursday's suicide attack on an Israeli
school bus.
	   The decision to cut Yassin's ties to the outside world came
after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat huddled with his security
chiefs early Friday to chart the next stage of the campaign against
Hamas that Israel says is a precondition for a timely West Bank
troop withdrawal.
	   Armed Palestinian policemen and plainclothes agents blocked the
sandy streets leading to Yassin's Gaza City home Friday and ordered
journalists to leave the area.
	   Speaking out for the first time on the crackdown, Hamas accused
Arafat of trying to ``wipe out'' the group, but did not threaten to
retaliate. In a leaflet, Hamas called Thursday's bombing ``heroic''
but fell short of claiming responsibility.
	   The leaflet contradicted a call made Thursday to Israeli radio
claiming responsibility for Hamas. It is not unusual, however, for
conflicting statements to be issued in the name of Hamas.
	   A fax sent to news agencies claimed that Palestinian agents
ransacked Yassin's home early Friday, arresting three bodyguards
and seizing weapons, videotapes and files. The authenticity of the
handwritten fax, signed by Yassin, could not be confirmed.
	   Yassin, a quadriplegic since his teens, has been under house
arrest since Thursday evening. It was a stunning move by Arafat who
in the year since Yassin's release from an Israeli jail has bent
over backward to avoid open conflict with him.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, meanwhile, Palestinian police
prevented Hamas from holding a march to protest the arrests.
	   Arafat has moved against Hamas in the past, sometimes arresting
hundreds of activists in retaliation for suicide attacks against
Israel. However, the current crackdown marked the first time Arafat
had the entire Hamas leadership arrested and silenced.
	   Arafat had ordered the arrests in response to the suicide attack
at a Gaza junction in which an Islamic militant rammed an
explosives-packed car into an Israeli army jeep escorting a bus
full of Israeli children.
	   Not one of the 40 students on board were hurt, but the bomb
killed an Israeli soldier in the jeep, a 19-year-old immigrant from
Ukraine now being praised as a fallen hero. The assailant also
died, and his identity remained a mystery. The car was registered
to a man from the Gaza Strip who said he had sold it a day before
the attack.
	   Political reverberations from the first suicide attack on
Israelis in six months were swift.
	   Coming only six days after the signing of a land-for-security
agreement in Washington, it was a destabilizing new factor in what
is already a highly delicate prelude to implementing the accord.
That process is to start next week.
	   Blocking the pact is the avowed goal of Hamas, which bitterly
opposes any peace with Israel. Hamas has carried out attacks that
have killed scores of Israelis.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said it was too early
to judge Arafat's campaign against Hamas. ``If it's a repeat of
short-term, sporadic activity against Hamas, then we still have a
very severe problem.''
	   Fogel said Palestinian security forces must confiscate illegal
weapons and dismantle the infrastructure of the Hamas military
wing, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Arafat that the
Palestinians would have to wage all-out war against terrorists if
they wanted Israel to withdraw troops in the West Bank, as
stipulated in the agreement.
	   There were some signs that Thursday's bombings had not severely
damaged the fragile new relationship between the Netanyahu
government and the Palestinian Authority.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon is to meet next week with
Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, in what Israel radio described as
the beginning of negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, confirmed that the meeting
was planned, but said that ``we won't label it the beginning of
final status talks.''

Sulaiman: WBC wants to regulate women's boxing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The World Boxing Council voted
Friday to study adopting women's boxing _ a move that could lead to
WBC title fights between women, the organization's president said
Friday.
	   ``We want to properly regulate women's boxing in the world,''
Jose Sulaiman told The Associated Press. ``It's a growing sport.''
	   The WBC's decision to have a committee study rules and
regulations for women's boxing came during the WBC's annual
convention, held for the first time in South Africa.
	   The delegates also decided to propose to the boxing community
that a first-ever professional world boxing cup be held. Proceeds
would be used to create a pension fund for indigent former
professional boxers, Sulaiman said. TV companies and promoters
would be asked to donate.
	   Dozens of boxers, including former champions, have hit the
skids, their winnings eaten up by spending binges and unscrupulous
promoters.
	   ``We want to show boxers that boxing does not forget them,''
Sulaiman said.
	   The WBC delegates also ratified on Friday an agreement to unify
rules with the World Boxing Association.
	   The agreement, hammered out by the WBC and the WBA in a meeting
in Mexico City last April, is aimed at standardizing the names of
weight categories, the awarding of points and procedures for drug
testing.
	   However, the WBC and the WBA have no plans to merge, Sulaiman
said, adding that an eventual merger of the more than dozen
international boxing organizations is ``impossible'' because of
interests of TV companies and promoters.
	   ``Television companies and promoters want to show 2,000
championship bouts a week,'' he scoffed. ``So it's absolutely
impossible to have only one boxing organization.''
	   The WBC also decided that it would rank ex-heavyweight champ
Mike Tyson among the world's top 10 after he steps into the ring,
Sulaiman said. Tyson's specific ranking would depend on whom he
fights, and who wins.
	   The Nevada Athletic Commission earlier this month reinstated
Tyson's license, revoked after he bit Evander Holyfield's ear in a
championship fight 15 months ago.
	   The WBC convention marked the first time it has been held in
South Africa. The WBC previously refused to hold events here to
protest white rule, which ended with South Africa's first all-race
elections in 1994.
	   In closing the week-long convention Friday, Sulaiman paid homage
to President Nelson Mandela, who was an amateur boxer even as he
organized opposition to apartheid.
	   ``Mandela showed us the way to live,'' Sulaiman told delegates.
``He gave his life, his family, his everything to fight for the
ideal of human equality. He spent almost 30 years in prison, just
for his ideal.''
	   The WBC's next convention will be held in September 1999 in
Moscow.

Fed official: Year 2000 computer glitches like short-term power
</HEADLINE>
outage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve
and Germany's central bank on Friday downplayed technical problems
expected from the Millennium Bug.
	   Fed board member Roger Ferguson compared the so-called ``Y2K''
problem to a short-term power outage that won't inconvenience
people too much.
	   The world's computers need to be reprogrammed in 2000 to
recognize the change of the century.
	   The switch would be ``relatively minor for most individuals,''
said Ferguson, speaking on the sidelines of a symposium on the year
2000. Ferguson is chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, which
organized the event along with the Deutsche Bundesbank.
	   Like a power outage, it is an ``inconvenience and requires a
change in plans'' but in the end is ``quickly repaired'' and goes
largely unremembered, Ferguson said.
	   Bundesbank board member Wendelin Hartmann said a worst-case
scenario was a liquidity crunch, or the collapse of an individual
bank, but those were remote possibilities.
	   Asked about concerns that emerging markets in Asia, South
America or the former communist countries faced the brunt of year
2000 problems, Ferguson noted that many emerging markets weren't as
technically dependent as more advanced economies.
	   Millions of computer around the world must be reprogrammed to
recognize the year 2000. Normally, they read only a year's last two
digits, which could make them assume it is 1900.
	   Experts disagree on whether the glitch represents a looming
disaster or a temporary annoyance. But they say it has potential to
play havoc with computer systems.
	   Some expect power outages, as power systems are interconnected

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie shot a 5-under 67 Friday
to move to 7-under par after two rounds of the Volvo Masters and a
one-stroke lead over Lee Westwood.
	   Westwood shot 68 as the two battle in the final tournament of
the season for the European money title. Darren Clarke, the only
other player with a chance to claim the season title, slipped to
4-under for two rounds after a 1-over 73.
	   The lead in the tournament _ almost an afterthought in the
battle for the money title _ was held by Australian Peter Lonard,
who was 10-under after a 66.
	   Montgomerie, going for an unprecedented sixth consecutive money
title, had two eagles on the back nine and finished by dropping a
20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt on 18.
	   ``You feel good after holing a putt like that at the end,''
Montgomerie said. ``I'm just glad I'm in a position to win the
Volvo Masters. That's what I came here to do and I'm in a
reasonable position to do that.''
	   ``The two eagles (12 and 16) helped today,'' he added. ``They
were a huge boost.''
	   Westwood, battling a sore ankle and a minor rib injury,
practiced late after Thursday's 70 _ and hit helped.
	   ``I need all the practice I can get just to be one behind
Monty,'' Westwood said. ``I thought I played a little more
conservative today and just went for the middle of the green.''
	   Montgomerie, 35, leads the European Tour money list with
winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood is No. 2 at 714,812
(dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Clarke at 616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   The winner of the Volvo Masters earns 166,000 pounds (dlrs
278,880). In addition, there is a bonus for the top 15 finishers on
the European money list _ beginning with 170,000 pounds (dlrs
285,600) for No. 1, 120,000 (dlrs 201,600) for No. 2 and so on.
	   If Montgomerie finishes ahead of Westwood he will claim his
sixth straight European money title. Westwood and Clarke are after
their first.
	   Westwood, 25, can also take the money title by finishing second,
provided Montgomerie is third or lower. If Westwood finishes third,
Montgomerie must finish 12th or lower.
	   For Clarke, 30, to top the money list, he must win the
tournament and hope that Westwood finishes no better than third and
Montgomerie no higher than ninth.
	   Montgomerie, Westwood or Clarke could all break the European
Tour season money record of 875,146 pounds (dlrs 1,470,245) set by
Montgomerie in 1996.

France opens new legal door against Pinochet with investigation

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Friday became the latest European country
to open an investigation into alleged atrocities by former Chilean
leader Gen. Augusto Pinochet, judicial officials said.
	   Prosecutors were investigating charges by families of missing
Chileans that Pinochet was linked to their loved ones'
``sequestration followed by torture,'' the officials said. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Pinochet, now under house arrest in a London hospital, has been
targeted by Chileans in Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, who want him
extradited to those countries to face similar charges.
	   On Monday, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   The probe launched Friday will determine whether there is enough
evidence and legal grounds to prosecute Pinochet on French soil.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou has said she would ask Britain
to extradite the former dictator if such a step were deemed
``necessary and possible.''
	   The French move came the same day the National Court in Madrid
ruled that Spain has jurisdiction over crimes committed during the
military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling gave a green light to a Spanish judge, Baltasar
Garzon, to continue his investigations into genocide, terrorism and
torture allegedly committed by Pinochet between 1973 and 1990.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on that basis, which
led to Pinochet's detention in Britain, where he is recovering from
back surgery.
	   On Wednesday, England's High Court overturned the Spanish arrest
warrant.
	   The court ruled Pinochet, 82, could not be prosecuted for crimes
committed while in office, and that English courts don't have
jurisdiction to arrest a non-British citizen for crimes committed
in another country.
	   Pinochet remains under police guard in Britain. He was moved
Thursday from the London Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital,
which reports said could provide better security for the general.
	   Meanwhile, Switzerland on Monday requested Pinochet's
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. A Swedish
prosecutor was studying whether complaints filed this week warrant
judicial action.
	   A human rights report published in 1991 identified 3,197 victims
of state-sanctioned killings committed under the Pinochet regime _
including 1,102 who are still unaccounted for and presumed dead.
	   In Britain, prosecutors are expected to file an appeal Monday to
a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   Lawyers for Pinochet have pushed for immediate bail, with a
hearing expected to take place Friday.

Yugoslav justice minister denies Hague tribunal jurisdiction in
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's justice minister
declared Friday that the U.N. war crimes tribunal has no authority
to pursue cases in Kosovo, the independent Beta news agency
reported.
	   The U.N. Security Council had called on the Yugoslav government
to cooperate with the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, in
its Sept. 23 resolution demanding an end to the crackdown on ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   But Beta quoted the minister, Zoran Knezevic, as saying the
court ``has no jurisdiction over Kosovo, not according to any
international document.''
	   Knezevic said the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke does not
require Belgrade to acknowledge the tribunal's jurisdiction over
Kosovo.
	   Officials of the tribunal have repeatedly asserted that they do
have jurisdiction over the conflict in Kosovo. The court was
established with a mandate to investigate alleged crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.
	   ``Our jurisdiction throughout the territory (of the former
Yugoslavia) is clear under international law and various Security
Council resolutions,'' tribunal spokesman Jim Landale said Friday.
``It is not negotiable by anyone apart from the Security Council,
which gives us our mandate.''
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and her deputy, Graham Blewitt,
are planning to head a team of investigators and prosecutors
traveling to the region on Thursday.
	   Yugoslav authorities, however, have not issued them visas yet.
	   In its resolution, the Security Council demanded that Belgrade
take a number of steps to defuse the ethnic crisis. NATO threatened
airstrikes if the government did not comply.
	   But the reference to cooperation with the tribunal was contained
in a separate section of the resolution which uses less threatening
and less specific language.

 &UR; South Africa score 240 for seven against Sri Lanka &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ South Africa rode a superb unbeaten 113
by Jacques Kallis to pile up a commanding 240 runs for seven
wickets against Sri Lanka in the first semifinal of the Will
International Cup in the Bangabandhu national stadium on Friday.
	   This was the first match in the tournament to be hit by rains,
forcing the match refree to reduce the contest to 39 overs a side.
	   South Africa, who were put in to bat by the Sri Lankans, played
positive cricket and went for the Sri Lankan bowling from the word
go. South Africa did loose the early wicket of Mike Rindel, but
with Daryll Cullinan making the ones and twos, and Nicky Boje
hitting freely, the runs came fast.
	   The field restrictions were limited to 13 overs and South Africa
succeeded in scoring quickly within this period with Boje hitting
three fours to score 28 off 23 balls.
	   The South African acceleration did not suffer despite Boucher's
dismissal at zero. Kallis came in and immediately began hitting the
ball fearlessly.
	   The Sri Lankan spinners were given harsh treatment by the South
Africans and even the crafty Muralitharan was hit freely with
disdain. Kallis blasted three sixes in his first 50 that came in 51
balls.
	   His batting improved with every delivery and his third one day
century was made in just 91 balls _ the tournament's fastest _ and
was laced with five sixes and four fours.
	   Skipper Hansie Cronje played a brisk knock of 20 off 30 balls
and Pat Symcox kept the scoreboard ticking with his quick 11.
Benkenstien remained unbeaten on 18.

Van Damme Meet threatens to defy Nebiolo on Wednesday date
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The organizer of the prestigious Van
Damme Memorial track meet says he may defy the IAAF and continue to
hold the event on a Friday instead of a Wednesday.
	   The International Amateur Athletic Federation on Thursday
announced that each of the elite Golden League meets next year will
be held on Wednesday nights in order to make them easier to package
for television.
	   The IAAF said the Brussels meet would be held on Sept. 1.
	   ``(IAAF president) Primo Nebiolo can stand on his head, but if
there is Champions League or Belgian league soccer that Wednesday,
then we move the Van Damme to Friday Sep. 3,'' organizer Wilfried
Meert said.
	   Van Damme is one of the most popular meets on the calendar and
draws a 50,000 sellout crowd to the King Baudouin stadium.

Aid group reports Serbs continuing attacks, terror campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES that attacks not independently confirmed
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French-based aid group said Friday that Serb
forces are still waging a campaign of terror against the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, and that thousands of refugees are
still threatened by disease and starvation.
	   Doctors of the World reported new attacks and criticized
reports, including one by the French Foreign Ministry on Thursday,
that only a few thousand refugees remain homeless.
	   The reports of attacks could not be independently confirmed.
	   Under threat of NATO air strikes, Serb forces have been pulling
out and refugees are returning home. But leader Slobodan Milosevic
is violating the NATO accords, with special forces continuing
attacks as late as Thursday, said Dr. Olivier Brochu, team director
for ``Medecins du Monde'' in Kosovo.
	   ``They have left the main roads. But you still see the special
forces hiding in the woods, well armed,'' Brochu told a news
conference.
	   A 2,000-member observer force under the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe is to be deployed in the mainly
ethnic Albanian province of Serbia, where rebels are fighting for
independence.
	   The international community ``should perhaps hurry up and put
them in place,'' said Dr. Michel Brugiere, director-general of
Doctors of the World.
	   Brugiere also said it was a mistake to lift the NATO air strike
ultimatum. ``Having lifted the ultimatum posed a great risk to that
population,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, Doctors of the World said Serbs shelled Isaraluka,
a village of 400-600 people southwest of Pristina, between Orahovac
and Suva Reka. Brochu said there were ``many dead,'' but he had no
figures.
	   On Saturday, a refugee camp of 1,200 people was shelled near the
village of Terpec and Komorane, west of Pristina, he said. Casualty
figures were not available, he said.
	   Last week, Serb forces attacked the village of Cireq, near
Mitrovica northwest of Pristina, in an area where about
17,000-20,000 people live, Brochu said.
	   They destroyed a health center and a food depot, and a doctor
was tortured and killed, he said.
	   Brochu said the Serbs' strategy is to terrorize a village
overnight with special forces, then shell it at dawn.
	   On Thursday, the French Foreign Ministry said a Franco-German
fact-finding team in Kosovo between Sunday and Wednesday observed
about 8,000 remaining homeless and improving humanitarian
conditions.
	   But Brochu said that instead, 50,000 refugees in tents live in
``abominable sanitary conditions. There is the risk of epidemics.
... In the last five, six days, we're seeing the first cases of
malnutrition.''

Group of Seven nations agree to new finance policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Group of Seven major industrial nations
announced a series of new policies for global finance Friday,
including International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending
facilities for countries to draw on in times of crisis.
	   In announcing the policies, British treasury chief Gordon Brown
said the nations had in recent weeks taken steps to increase IMF
quotas and implement the new borrowing arrangements, providing an
extra dlrs 90 billion ``to ensure the stability of the
international financial system.''
	   The emergency borrowing program, available to countries pursuing
IMF-approved policies, would be ``accompanied by appropriate
private sector involvement,'' Brown said.
	   The collective statement was fine-tuned Thursday night by
representatives of the G-7 governments _ the United States, Canada,
Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ after months of
negotiations, he said.
	   The reforms also include more sophisticated systems for
supervising and regulating financial markets, and creation of an
international ``code of best practice'' governing how nations
handle financial and monetary policies, corporate governance and
accounting.
	   ``In this new interdependent and instantaneous global
marketplace, we must now create systems for supervision,
transparency, regulation and stability that are as sophisticated as
the markets they have to work with,'' Brown said.
	   The G-7 nations will strengthen systems for monitoring financial
markets ``using national and international regulatory and
supervisory expertise, including through a process of peer
review,'' Brown said.
	   Better regulation is needed to keep in check the vast flows of
capital between economies that helped spark the recent crisis, he
said.
	   Brown said there have been ``positive signs'' in recent months,
including legislative progress in Japan to reform the banking
system.
	   He said a G7 special summit on the world financial crisis is a
possibility, but stressed that work ``behind the scenes and out of
the glare of publicity'' has been effective so far.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge seeking to try former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on charges of genocide got what
amounts to a green light from the National Court on Friday.
	   The court ruled that Spain has jurisdiction over crimes
committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling upheld the legal basis for Judge Baltasar Garzon to
continue with his investigations into the alleged crimes of
genocide, terrorism and torture committed by Pinochet during his
military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on this basis which
led to the detention of Pinochet in London on Oct. 16. Pinochet
went to London for back surgery and is currently in detention in a
clinic in the English capital.
	   England's High Court ruled Wednesday that the 82-year-old former
Chilean leader, as a former head of state, was entitled to
diplomatic immunity.
	   An appeal against the decision is expected to be heard next week
by a five-judge panel from the House of Lords. If the decision is
upheld, any extradition order by Garzon would be in vain.
	   Pinochet may also be released on bail by a hearing later Friday.
	   Virginia Diez, a human rights lawyer, said Garzon would file for
extradition next week. The move must be approved by the Spanish
government before being passed on to British authorities who will
have the final say.
	   Although the National Court decision does not deal specifically
with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, Garzon was expected
to decide on the future of his case depending on the ruling.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing
families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view it's a
landmark decision.''
	   The 11-judge panel reached the decision after nearly five hours
of deliberation.
	   ``The panel has voted unanimously to reject the appeals (against
the probes) and authorizes Spain to hear the facts of what
happened,'' Carlos Cezon, one of the panel's judges, announced.
	   He did not explain the legal basis of the judges' decision,
saying the full verdict would be published next week.
	   Garzon has argued that he can go after Pinochet on grounds that
the ex-despot is guilty of genocide. Under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it is committed.
	   In the arrest warrant against Pinochet, Garzon also accuses him
of terrorism and torture.
	   The panel's decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers
backing the investigation and relatives of the victims who had
gathered inside and outside the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``I am very happy that Pinochet can be tried in this country,''
Santiago Oyarzo, a Chilean citizen who said he was jailed and
tortured in Villa Grimaldi, in Santiago, Chile, during the late
1970s.
	   For over two years, Garzon and a colleague have been probing
human rights crimes in Argentina and Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
The two cases were joined after Garzon filed the arrest warrant
that resulted in Pinochet's detention in London since Oct. 16.
	   The panel of judges was studying a protest filed in May by state
prosecutors who objected to the investigations claiming Spain had
no jurisdiction over such crimes. The prosecutors also argued that
Pinochet's alleged crimes did not amount to genocide or terrorism.
	   Pinochet seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, during
which 3,197 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report released in 1991.
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in Operation Condor, in which
several military juntas in South America teamed up in the 1970s and
1980s to crush what they perceived as a communist threat.
	   ``It's like reaching the end of a wait that lasted 22 years,''
said Matilde Artes of the Argentine relatives of victims
association, Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.

Last imprisoned high-ranking East German official is freed

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A former defense minister in communist East
Germany was released early from prison Friday after serving 4 1/2
years of a 7 1/2-year sentence for shooting deaths at the Berlin
Wall.
	   Heinz Kessler, 78, was the last high-ranking former East German
leader still in prison. His lawyer Peter Mildebrath said a Berlin
court decided to release Kessler because of his good conduct and
deteriorating health.
	   Kessler was convicted in September 1993 on seven counts of
incitement to manslaughter in shooting deaths at the Berlin Wall
and along East Germany's heavily fortified border with West
Germany.
	   More than 550 East Germans died trying to flee to the West
between August 1961, when construction on the Wall began, and
November 1989, when the border was opened.
	   Among the politicians tried with Kessler was former East German
leader Erich Honecker. He was excused from trial because of liver
cancer and was exiled to Chile, where he died in 1994.

Sack tender stirs tempest in Kenya's public sector tea business
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK MAJUTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The yearly tender for sacks in which to
pack bulk tea from Kenya's buoyant smallholder sector has stirred
up a tempest as charges swirl of rakeoffs and corruption within the
government-run Kenya Tea Development Authority.
	   KTDA recently awarded a year's contract for 3 million speciality
tea sacks to Nairobi-based manufacturer East African Packaging
Industries. But KTDA spokesman John Karungu said Friday the tender
had been cancelled after a hue and cry arose about alleged
rakeoffs.
	   ``We did so to satisfy the public and to show that there is
nothing dubious about it,'' Karungu said.
	   A report last week in a weekly newspaper about alleged
corruption at KTDA and a claim Tuesday by a legislator that KTDA
managing director Eustace Karanja, a wife of Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae and British businessman Colin Sanderson stood to
make KSH 15 (dlrs 0.25) on each sack unleashed the storm.
	   Both Karanja and Nyachae have denied the allegations. Sanderson,
who has worked for several years as a packaging consultant to KTDA,
was not available for comment.
	   John Small, managing director of EAPI, said he had received a
letter Friday from KTDA informing him of the cancellation and
advising that the closing date for a new bid was Nov. 16.
	   ``I've heard today that they were going to cancel it even though
we've committed ... we've supplied a performance bond, and we have
fairly hefty commitments,'' Small said.
	   He said the legislator's comments and published accounts of the
tendering were ``confusing the past history with this current
tender.''
	   ``There was an attempt this time to make the tendering process
much more open and fair, and because of this, it has drawn a whole
lot of flak,'' Small said.
	   EAPI's bid _ the second-lowest of six shortlisted _ was KSH
117.50 (dlrs 1.96), excluding 16 percent VAT, for a four-ply
open-mouth sack that would be made partially from paper imported
from Sweden and South Africa because locally produced paper does
not meet stringent KTDA specifications.
	   KTDA disqualified the lowest bid from Firn Overseas Packaging of
the United Kingdom for technical reasons.
	   For the past 12 years, J and C Packaging of Sri Lanka has been
supplying KTDA with the speciality paper sacks that hold around 65
kilograms of tea.
	   For the latest tender, J and C bid KSH 126 (dlrs 2.01),
excluding VAT, per sack. But for the past 10 years, the KTDA tea
factories have been paying KHS 200 (dlrs 3.33) per bag.
	   Kenya is the world's largest exporter of black or made tea, and
the smallholder sector, through 45 factories managed by KTDA, is
reponsible for 65 percent of the exports that for the just
completed 1997-98 season amounted to 151 million kilograms.
	   ``Kenya is a mega player in the tea-packaging business, and we
are a straightforward company,'' Small said, adding that EAPI,
which is 25 percent locally owned and 75 percent owned by Canadian
Overseas Packaging Industries, supplies most of Kenya's major
private tea estates with the sacks manufactured at its Mombasa
factory.
	   He said EAPI, the only Kenyan manufacturer among the 25 original
bidders, has never supplied KTDA with sacks and has been
unsuccessfully tendering bids to the tea authority since 1992. He
said EAPI was interested in a long-term relationship during which
his company would work to reduce the cost of the packaging even
further as well as provide work to other local manufacturers.
	   With a tender in hand, ``the scope for reduction (of costs) is
fantastic, and we can pass it on,'' Small said.

Few refugees returning home in Kosovo despite troop withdrawals

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Saying the government draw-down in
Kosovo is incomplete, the province's main ethnic Albanian leader
called Friday for establishment of a new police force to convince
refugees it's safe to return home.
	   Despite substantial withdrawals of Yugoslav police and army
units from Kosovo, only a few of the thousands of ethnic Albanians
who fled during a government crackdown against separatist rebels
have returned home.
	   In one exceptional case, most of the 3,000 refugees camped near
the village of Kisna Reka 30 kilometers (20 miles) southwest of
Pristina went back to their homes Thursday.
	   ``Even if they try to kill me ... I'm not going back to the
mountains,'' said Isa Qelaj, 75. ``It is too cold.''
	   But thousands more are still believed camped in the hills and
forests.
	   ``The families returning face huge destruction and many are
still too afraid to go back,'' Ibrahim Rugova told reporters
Friday. ``The number of Serb forces is still huge...Our position is
for further withdrawals and setting up of Kosovo police force until
full withdrawal.''
	   Rugova also urged the Americans and Europeans to speed the
deployment of a 2,000-member mission designed to verify that
President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with the peace agreement
he reached Oct. 12 with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Rugova said he was confident that the Kosovo Liberation Army,
whose attacks on police and troops prompted the Feb. 28 crackdown,
would cooperate with the verification mission.
	   In its Friday editions, the Albanian language newspaper Koha
Ditore reported that members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission met Wednesday with KLA commanders to urge them not to
impede traffic and to abide by a cease-fire.
	   KLA rebels have been seen milling about positions and highway
checkpoints evacuated by government forces under pressure from
NATO.
	   According to Koha Ditore, the monitors told the rebels that Serb
police will be allowed to patrol highways once a week under the
Oct. 12 agreement.
	   It appeared the monitors wanted to reassure the rebels that a
limited Serb police presence does not necessarily constitute a
violation of the agreement nor represent a major threat to
civilians.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to pressure Milosevic to agree to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to the levels they were at before he launched the crackdown
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in the fighting. The threat of
airstrikes remains, though NATO this week lifted its deadline for
Milosevic to fully comply.
	   But Western powers also oppose rebel demands for an independent
Kosovo, fearing that could trigger unrest elsewhere in southern
Balkan countries with large ethnic Albanian communities.
	   ``There could be a kind of a vacuum and in that vacuum, the
withdrawl of the army could lead to an influx of the KLA,''
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said Friday in the
Albanian capital Tirana. ``This is absolutely not what we want. We
want to have stable conditions and to create an atmosphere for
political talks.''
	   Schuessel, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, said
the international message to Milosevic was clear ``but we need to
address our demands to the Kosovo Albnaian leaders and especially
to the KLA, not to misuse this time ... to intervene.''

Moscow holds first land auction since revolution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A private land auction was held in Moscow on
Friday for the first time since the 1917 revolution, and a top city
official said the practice might be cautiously phased in.
	   The land that was sold was in not in Moscow, but in the southern
region of Saratov, which introduced agricultural land sales earlier
this year. Such sales are illegal in most of the country.
	   Forty-one lots of rural land in Saratov were sold at the Moscow
auction, which was opened by Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   One of his top deputies, Oleg Tolkachev, told reporters that
there are tentative plans to begin selling land in one district of
Moscow, and that such an auction could provide a model for a
broader sale of land in the capital.
	   However, he added, ``Moscow lands are not deer pastures,'' and
the city needs to carefully consider the ramifications of selling
land containing the infrastructure of municipal utilities, such as
water mains and electrical cables.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bolstering a Spanish judge's efforts to
extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, the National
Court ruled Friday that Spain had jurisdiction over crimes
committed during the military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling would allow Judge Baltasar Garzon to continue his
investigations into whether Pinochet committed genocide, terrorism
and torture during his military dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon issued an international arrest order on those charges,
leading to Pinochet's detention in London on Oct. 16.
	   But his probe against the 82-year-old former Chilean leader was
snarled earlier this week when Britain's High Court ruled that, as
a former head of state, Pinochet had immunity from prosecution. He
has been kept under arrest pending an appeal.
	   Sources close to Garzon said that if the National Court backed
him, he would continue to seek the extradition as long as Pinochet
remained detained.
	   Virginia Diez, a human rights lawyer, said Garzon planned to
file for extradition next week.
	   The 11-judge panel reached the decision after nearly five hours
of deliberation.
	   ``The panel has voted unanimously to reject the appeals and
authorizes Spain to hear the facts of what happened,'' Carlos
Cezon, one of the judges, announced.
	   The decision was greeted with whoops of joy from lawyers backing
the investigation and relatives of the victims who had gathered in
the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``I am very happy that Pinochet can be tried in this country,''
Santiago Oyarzo, a Chilean citizen who said he was jailed and
tortured in Villa Grimaldi, in Santiago, Chile, during the late
1970s.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina, '' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing
families of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view its a
landmark decision.''
	   Pinochet, who is recovering from back surgery, remains under
police guard in Britain. He was moved Thursday from the London
Clinic to a private psychiatric hospital, which reports said could
provide better security for the general.
	   The British judges ordered Pinochet be held in custody until
prosecutors appeal the ruling. The appeal is expected to be filed
Monday to a five-judge panel in the House of Lords.
	   The National Court decision Friday resulted from a protest filed
in May by state prosecutors, who protested that Spain had no
jurisdiction over such crimes. The decision does not deal
specifically with Pinochet's detention or his extradition, but it
was believed that Garzon's investigation would be strongly affected
by a negative ruling.
	   Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime.
During his rule, 3,197 political opponents died or disappeared,
according to a Chilean government report.

Buzek's Cabinet ends first year in office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek on Friday
rejected opposition calls to fire some ministers in his
Solidarity-led government, but he left open the door for changes
next year.
	   Buzek, who took office last Oct. 31, portrayed his side's
showing in local elections this month as support for his reforms in
administration, health care, the pension system and education. The
Solidarity bloc had the best showing of the national parties in
voting for local councils.
	   ``You don't introduce changes at a time when you can say that
the government has won the elections and its popularity has
risen,'' Buzek said in an interview with the state news agency PAP.
	   But he said the Cabinet will be revamped under a Western-style
administrative reform that will shift some powers to the local
councils on Jan. 1. He did not elaborate.
	   He was addressing months of speculation that some of his
ministers would go, following criticism from the opposition. Among
those most frequently criticized is Treasury Minister Emil Wasacz,
whom the leftist opposition accuses of selling state enterprises
too cheaply.

Pinochet granted bail by British judge

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British judge Friday granted bail for former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, detained in London on a
Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder,
torture and kidnapping during his 17 years in power.
	   Judge Stephen Richards attached conditions to the bail after
British authorities decided not to oppose the move.
	   Pinochet must remain at north London's Grovelands Priory
Hospital, where he is recuperating from back surgery, and remain
under police guard at all times.
	   On Wednesday, England's High Court threw out two Spanish
warrants seeking Pinochet's extradition, ruling he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state. But the court added he could
not leave Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling.
	   A five-judge panel at the House of Lords will hear the appeal,
probably next week, after the Monday filing deadline.
	   In granting bail, the judge said: ``The concern must be to hold
the position pending an appeal to the House of Lords, but on terms
that impose on the applicant only such restrictions as are properly
necessary.''
	   Pinochet was not in court for the hearing.
	   A Spanish judge is expected to push ahead for his extradition
after Spain's National Court ruled Friday that Spain had
jurisdiction over crimes committed during the military
dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.

New assembly breaks up amid more rifts between Bosnian Serbs

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The first session of the
newly-elected Bosnian Serb parliament broke up early Friday after
rival Serb camps failed to agree on the assembly's leadership.
	   After seven hours of heated debate, legislators in the 83-seat
assembly could not agree on a parliament speaker and his two
deputies. The session adjourned before dawn Friday and is to resume
Wednesday.
	   Later Friday, two ministers in the current, pro-Western Bosnian
Serb government resigned. The interior minister Milovan Stankovic
and Justice Minister Petko Cancar were replaced by Sredoje Novic
and Milan Trbojevic.
	   Stankovic became interior minister last January when Bosnian
Serb police were deeply divided in their loyalty to the rival Serb
camps. In his letter of resignation, Stankovic said his successor
will face ``extremely complex and heavy tasks.''

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 65 people and
injuring 157 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before
midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determined
as of Friday evening.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective
leading the disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous
gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and six others died later.
Of the injured, 57 were in intensive care, said Sven Martinell,
spokesman for the local medical authorities.
	   The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to
have them, officials said.
	   The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of
immigrants. Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19
nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and
Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and
unspecified Latin American countries.
	   The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,
had in turn rented the facility out to others for the dance,
Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the
capital, Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

Pakistan imposes federal rule in lawless Sindh province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday
dismissed the southern Sindh provincial legislature and imposed
federal rule to try to stop the relentless bloodletting terrorizing
the country's largest city of Karachi.
	   The decision to dismiss the Sindh provincial Parliament comes
after a fallout between Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and his
coalition partners in Sindh, the Muttaheda Qami Movement, over the
killing last week of a prominent philanthropist.
	   ``The killing and terrorism has paralyzed normal life,'' Sharif
told the nation in a televised speech.
	   On Wednesday, Sharif warned the MQM that the coalition would
split unless they handed over the killers of Hakim Said, a
well-known Karachi physician gunned down in the violent port city.
The next day, the MQM withdrew from the coalition government to
protest Sharif's demands.
	   Sharif ordered governor's rule in southern Sindh province, which
effectively means the province will be ruled by Sharif's
government. Orders from Islamabad will be carried out by the Sindh
governor, a retired general named Moinuddin Haider.
	   The 78-year-old Said was opposed to the MQM and the relentless
violence that has wracked Karachi for the past year, during which
time rival factions of the MQM have been waging a bitter war for
control of the city.
	   The MQM split into rival groups several years ago and in recent
months there feud has become increasingly violent. More than 1,000
people have been killed in the rivalry _ many of them innocent
civilians.

Official: Ukraine near compliance with conditions for nuclear loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ By mid-December, Ukraine will fulfill all
the conditions set by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development for a loan to complete two new nuclear reactors,
officials said Friday.
	   The country's nuclear authorities are to give the EBRD a report
on the new reactors' potential environmental and social impact, the
last of the bank's requirements, said Hennadiy Sazonov, project
director for the state nuclear energy company Energoatom.
	   Ukraine wants to complete the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and
Rivne nuclear power plants to compensate for the planned closure of
the Chernobyl power plant, which it has pledged to shut down by
2000.
	   However, top government officials have repeatedly said that
Ukraine would close Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident in 1986, only after the two new reactors start
operating.
	   Ukraine and the governments of the world's seven major
industrialized nations have asked the EBRD to consider providing
funds for the completion of the reactors, estimated at dlrs 1.2
billion.
	   The EBRD, however, put forward four requirements.
	   Sazonov spoke during a public debate of the project, one in a
series of discussions Ukraine is required to hold while preparing
the environmental and social impact report for the EBRD.
	   The report and the results of its distribution among the
citizens are to be sent to the EBRD by Dec. 18, Sazonov said.
	   He said Ukraine has fully implemented two conditions: ensuring
that the project meets the required domestic and international
safety standards and is the least costly compared to other
alternatives.
	   Energoatom intends to send the EBRD a report next month on
Ukraine's implementation of the third condition, which is to
guarantee that the the new reactors would make enough profit to
return the loan, Sazonov added.
	   The reactors at Rivne and Khmelnytsky are currently more than 80
percent completed, but their construction was halted after
Ukraine's 1991 independence due to the lack of funds and a later
parliamentary moratorium on the construction of new nuclear
facilities.
	   The government's decision to complete the two reactors has
prompted protests from environmental groups in Ukraine and adjacent
countries, but appeared to have little influence on its
determination to finish the project.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear plants have 14 operational reactors,
which account for nearly half of the country's electricity
production.

Environmentalists hit global trade chief with cream pies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of
the World Trade Organization with cream pies, an official said.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech at
Chatham House in London in which he defended a WTO decision
overturning a U.S. attempt to protect endangered sea turtles from
shrimp fishermen.
	   Ruggiero released a one-sentence comment through his Geneva
headquarters, saying, ``When they have no more rational arguments,
the fringe elements have to use cake.''
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side,
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year, said a
trade official.
	   Rockwell led Ruggiero back into Chatham House and wiped the
cream off his suit and face. He had been hit by more than one pie,
said the official.
	   A group calling itself the Biotic Baking Brigade later issued a
statement saying its pie throwers sent ``a sticky message to
Ruggiero and the global elite: `To those who wish to dominate the
world, the world replies, `Let them eat humble pie.'''
	   The WTO drew the ire of environmental groups two weeks ago by
ruling that the United States cannot force shrimp-exporting
countries to fit their fleets with dlrs 75 devices that protect the
turtles.
	   The World Wildlife Fund called the ruling a blow to turtles
``and against the development of international norms and
practices.'' Other groups also denounced the decision.
	   However, the ruling upheld countries' right to introduce laws to
protect exhaustible natural resources.
	   In his speech Friday, Ruggiero said the decision ``strongly
reinforces the growing need to negotiate global environmental rules
and standards, and to reach a global consensus about environmental
issues.''
	   The ruling was against a U.S. law forbidding the importation of
shrimp caught with trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered
species of sea turtles.
	   India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand have refused to put the
devices on their nets. Unequipped nets are blamed for killing
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.

Pinochet granted bail by British judge

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British judge Friday granted bail for former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, detained in London on a
Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder,
torture and kidnapping during his 17 years in power.
	   Judge Stephen Richards decreed, however, that Pinochet must
remain at north London's Grovelands Priory Hospital, where he is
recuperating from back surgery, and remain under police guard at
all times.
	   James Lewis, the attorney representing British and Spanish
authorities, said he would not object with those conditions
imposed. But he added, ``We make it plain that if there were to be
any variation, the respondents would have a different perspective
on the matter.''
	   On Wednesday, England's High Court threw out two Spanish
warrants seeking Pinochet's extradition, ruling he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state. But the court added he could
not leave Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling.
	   A five-judge panel at the House of Lords will hear the appeal,
probably next week, after the Monday filing deadline.
	   In granting bail, the judge said: ``The concern must be to hold
the position pending an appeal to the House of Lords, but on terms
that impose on the applicant only such restrictions as are properly
necessary.''
	   Pinochet was not in court for the hearing.
	   A Spanish judge is expected to push ahead for his extradition
after Spain's National Court ruled Friday that Spain had
jurisdiction over crimes committed during the military
dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   The ruling came after Spain's highest criminal court held that
the country has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed during
military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina _ a decision that
would have supported efforts to prosecute Pinochet.
	   Though the Spanish ruling did not specifically mention Pinochet,
the court's decision in effect gave a green light to Judge Baltasar
Garzon to continue with his investigation into genocide, terrorism
and torture allegedly committed by Pinochet during his military
dictatorship between 1973-90.
	   Garzon had issued an international arrest order that led to the
detention of Pinochet in London on Oct. 16 for crimes allegedly
committed in Chile and Argentina.
	   Garzon's case puts forward that Pinochet, together with
Argentine generals, made a systematic, organized attempt to wipe
out political opponents because of their ideological beliefs and
that it amounts to genocide, according to lawyers working with
Garzon.
	   France, meanwhile, became the latest European country to open an
investigation into alleged atrocities by Pinochet, judicial
officials said.
	   Prosecutors were investigating charges by families of missing
Chileans that Pinochet was linked to their loved ones'
``sequestration followed by torture,'' the officials said. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.

EU to fight corruption in private sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union's Justice and Interior
ministers agreed Friday to adopt legislation in member countries
that would punish palm greasing and organized corruption within the
private sector.
	   At an informal meeting in Vienna, the ministers agreed to begin
drafting laws that would allow authorities to monitor and punish
private companies who offer or receive bribes for private
contracts, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   Similar to legislation enacted last year to fine bureaucrats who
accept and organizations or individuals that offer bribes, the EU's
15 individual members would first apply it within their own borders
before subjecting international companies to the same laws.
	   According to Austrian Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek, the
ministers agreed the measures were necessary to prevent the
disruption of healthy competition and cause costs to rise
artificially.
	   The initiative will be brought before the formal meeting of the
ministers to be held in early December, Michalek said.
	   The move to punish private companies on an international level
is unprecedented.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The Ottawa Senators said Friday that Swedish
right-winger Andreas Dackell will be out of the lineup for 10 to 14
days with injuries sustained Thursday night when he was checked by
Eric Lindros of the Philadelphia Flyers.
	   Dackell, who suffered a concussion and required 30 stitches, was
to be examined again Friday morning by doctors.
	   The 1.93-meter (6-foot-4), 108-kilogram (238-pound) Lindros
crushed the 1.80-meter (5-foot-11), 87-kilo (191-pound) Dackell
into the corner boards to the right of Ottawa goaltender Damian
Rhodes late in the first period.
	   Dackell fell to the ice immediately after the hit, where he lay
for about 12 minutes while receiving medical attention. Dackell,
blood smeared on his face, was taken off the ice on a stretcher to
the Senators' dressing room.
	   Referee Richard Trottier did not penalize Lindros. The Senators
are considering sending a tape of the incident to the headquarters
of the North American National Hockey League, according to team
spokesman Morgan Quarry.
	   Ottawa won the game 3-1.

Salinas accounts confiscation goes to Swiss supreme court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Lawyers for the Raul Salinas de Gortari
have appealed a Swiss decision to order the confiscation of dlrs
114.4 million as probable laundered drug money, his wife's Swiss
attorney said Friday.
	   The appeal will send the case of Salinas, brother of former
Mexican President Carlos Salinas, to Switzerland's supreme court,
the Federal Tribunal.
	   Switzerland's federal prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, last week
ordered the confiscation of the money in accounts in Switzerland
and Britain after a 2 1/2-year investigation of Raul Salinas.
	   Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' the supreme court
would uphold the seizure if the order was appealed.
	   The appeals contest the Swiss assertion that the money came from
illegal sources and challenge the use of anonymous sources and
witnesses in the Swiss case.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in central Mexico pending completion
of trials in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal
enrichment during his brother's 1988-1994 administration.
	   In a letter written from his prison cell, he accused Swiss
prosecutors of using questionable witnesses and exaggerating the
size of his accounts.
	   He repeated his denial of taking payoffs to ease drug shipments.
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   The Swiss dropped their own money laundering case against Raul
Salinas, saying it was no longer necessary as Mexican authorities
have started their own proceedings.
	   They said they dropped the case against his wife, Paulina
Castanon, and her brother, Antonio, because their alleged
involvement in drug offenses in Mexico and money laundering charges
in Sweden could not be proven.
	   Swiss authorities arrested the two in 1995 after they allegedly
tried to withdraw money from a Geneva account of Raul Salinas. The
siblings were released four weeks later, when Swiss authorities
said they had been cooperative and had played only a secondary role
in the overall case.

Remote Australian city lights up for Glenn

 &UR; EDS: Updates and recasts with Glenn passing over Australia and
Australia's John Glenn &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Last time, an Australian named John
Glenn fashioned a spotlight, white sheets and his clothesline into
a backyard beacon he hoped his astronaut namesake would see from
space.
	   Thirty-six years later, the 76-year-old man from Perth again
left the light on.
	   About 12:50 a.m. local time (1650 GMT), Perth again transformed
itself into a city of lights to greet astronaut John Glenn during
his historic return to space. Lights at major stadiums, skyscrapers
and thousands of homes were turned on to recreate the view Glenn
saw 36 years ago as his spacecraft passed over Australia.
	   In February 1962, residents stayed up until midnight and turned
on every house light to send a welcome message to Glenn. Every
street lamp and neon sign was also lit.
	   According to Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw
clouds part to reveal ``an absolute mass of electric lights'' in
two groups, one in Perth, the other in the town of Rockingham to
the south.
	   ``The lights show up very well,'' Glenn radioed to astronaut
Gordon Cooper, who was at a tracking station in Australia at the
time. ``Please thank everybody for turning them on, will you?''
	   Perth, a remote blip on the map on Australia's southwest coast,
has kept the title ``City of Lights'' ever since.
	   This time, Glenn's flight path took him farther north. But that
dod not deter residents or the state government, which asked
everyone to turn on their lights.
	   The BP Oil refinery received permission from the state
government's Environmental Protection Department to light up its
gas flare.
	   Glenn flew over Western Australia state about 850 kms (530
miles) north of Perth. It was expected that most of the state's
southwest would have been visible to him.
	   ``We won't see the shuttle, but he will see us,'' Dr. James
Biggs of the Perth Observatory said before the passover. ``We'll
probably look like a big glowing blob to him.''
	   In 1962, many residents were advised to project normal household
lights on white surfaces directed skywards to create greater
luminescence.
	   Australia's Glenn didn't unfurl the sheets this time, and kept
it simple.
	   ``I've left the porch light on,'' Glenn told Channel Nine TV.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Mostly sunny skies were the rule across Puerto Rico during the
morning hours. However, by 11 a.m. the clouds started to increase
in our area.
	   Over the U.S. Virgin Islands the weather conditions were
different. Cloudy skies with numerous showers and thunderstorms
gave way to improving weather conditions as the morning hours
progressed.
	   The weak frontal boundary that has been affecting our local area
for the past few days will remain stationary at least through
tonight. This system will combine with an upper-level trough to
produce scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms across our
area once again this afternoon. These showers and thunderstorms
will concentrate mainly across the interior and north sections of
Puerto Rico. There is still a very high flash flood potential
across our area. For this reason residents across Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands should keep abreast of the weather
conditions this afternoon.
	   Moderate northeast swells generated from a low-pressure system
over the central Atlantic are beginning to affect our Atlantic
coastal waters and the Anegada Passage today. This will create seas
of 6 to 7 feet and small craft should exercise caution.

Van Hooijdonk returns to Nottingham Forest, but for how long?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with Van Hooijdonk saying he's still on transfer list;
new quotes throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk
rejoined Nottingham Forest Friday after a three-month boycott. But
for how long?
	   Van Hooijdonk, who returned to the club under tight security
after saying over the summer it lacked ambition, said he was still
on the transfer list. He apologized to the fans _ but apparently
not to coach Dave Bassett nor his teammates.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who scored 34 goals last season and helped Forest
gain promotion to the Premier League, was escorted by a dozen
security guards at the City Ground as he was practiced and met with
the Bassett.
	   Bassett has admitted being unhappy with Van Hooijdonk's return
and said he will attempt to sell him on the transfer market.
	   Van Hooijdonk, who helped the Netherlands to a fourth place at
the World Cup in France, was placed on the transfer list three
months ago when he refused to rejoin the club during summer
training.
	   And he's still there after going unsold for three months at the
club's 8-million-pound (dlrs 13.4 million) asking price.
	   ``I remain on the transfer list,'' Van Hooijdonk said. ``I want
to be as successful as possible with Forest, and who is saying I
will get a move?
	   ``I think we will only be able to see after a couple of months
after I've been playing again and hopefully playing well because if
you don't play well, you can be on the list for 100 years.''
	   ``In football, nobody, but nobody, can guarantee that he has a
long-term future at any club.''
	   Pressed by reporters, he declined to say he had apologized to
his teammates or Bassett.
	   ``I've spoken to the players and I've spoken to the manager.
Everything that's been discussed has stayed inside (the club),'' he
said.
	   ``I feel sorry for the supporters in a certain way because
they've been watching a club at the beginning of the season which
has been missing somebody.
	   ``I feel sorry for them because they were never a part in this
matter. From that point of view, I definitely feel sorry.''
	   His refusal to rejoin the club angered many Nottingham Forest
fans, who view him as one in a long line of foreign stars in the
country who have not always shown loyalty to their English sides.
	   But with Forest lying three points from the bottom of the league
table, the fans may be willing to forgive Van Hooijdonk if he can
score goals.
	   ``He has proved his point,'' 23-year-old fan David Vaughan said.
``He reckoned the team was not good enough and it isn't. If he
comes back and gets the goals to take us up the table then it's
worth it.''

Salinas accounts confiscation goes to Swiss supreme court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPLACES `Sweden' in penultimate graf with `Switzerland.' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Lawyers for the Raul Salinas de Gortari
have appealed a Swiss decision to order the confiscation of dlrs
114.4 million as probable laundered drug money, his wife's Swiss
attorney said Friday.
	   The appeal will send the case of Salinas, brother of former
Mexican President Carlos Salinas, to Switzerland's supreme court,
the Federal Tribunal.
	   Switzerland's federal prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, last week
ordered the confiscation of the money in accounts in Switzerland
and Britain after a 2 1/2-year investigation of Raul Salinas.
	   Del Ponte said she was ``very confident'' the supreme court
would uphold the seizure if the order was appealed.
	   The appeals contest the Swiss assertion that the money came from
illegal sources and challenge the use of anonymous sources and
witnesses in the Swiss case.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in central Mexico pending completion
of trials in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal
enrichment during his brother's 1988-1994 administration.
	   In a letter written from his prison cell, he accused Swiss
prosecutors of using questionable witnesses and exaggerating the
size of his accounts.
	   He repeated his denial of taking payoffs to ease drug shipments.
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   The Swiss dropped their own money laundering case against Raul
Salinas, saying it was no longer necessary as Mexican authorities
have started their own proceedings.
	   They said they dropped the case against his wife, Paulina
Castanon, and her brother, Antonio, because their alleged
involvement in drug offenses in Mexico and money laundering charges
in Switzerland could not be proven.
	   Swiss authorities arrested the two in 1995 after they allegedly
tried to withdraw money from a Geneva account of Raul Salinas. The
siblings were released four weeks later, when Swiss authorities
said they had been cooperative and had played only a secondary role
in the overall case.

compensation for farmers.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Farmers devastated by flooding in
northern provinces that has destroyed millions of guilders worth of
crops will be compensated for their losses, the Dutch government
announced Friday.
	   Farmers in the worst-hit areas of northern Holland will receive
full compensation for losses estimated at 250 million guilders
(dlrs 140 million), officials said.
	   Farmers in other areas of the country who lost crops will be
compensated for 70 percent their damages, and homeowners also will
be able to apply for state handouts to cover uninsured damage.
	   Queen Beatrix visited the flooded northern provinces on Friday,
offering support to Dutch farmers and relief workers fighting to
control damage to waterlogged fields and villages.
	   After days of torrential rains, rescue workers managed to
stabilize dikes holding back rising waters in the mainly
agricultural provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Flevoland.
	   The threat of widespread flooding on the scale that prompted the
evacuations of up to 250,000 people in 1995 appeared to have eased.
But more rain was forecast for the weekend, adding anxiety as the
Dutch struggled to bear up under some of the highest rainfall in
three decades.
	   Local governments and farmers were assessing the damage to crops
and villages. Dutch television showed people sloshing around in hip
boots in their homes and preparing meals in kitchens flooded with a
foot (30 centimeters) of water.
	   On Friday, Royal Dutch Air Force planes flew photo
reconnaissance missions over the flooded region to monitor the
situation.
	   ``There is huge damage to Dutch agriculture,'' said Jack Luiten,
spokesman for the National Farmers Union.
	   Flooding has especially threatened Dutch potato farmers, who
have lost up to 60 percent of their crop, Luiten said. In the
province of Drenthe, where potatoes comprise three-quarters of the
local economy, it has dealt a catastrophic blow to the livelihoods
of many people.
	   ``There is great damage,'' said Harma Barelds of the provincial
government. ``All the potatoes will be destroyed after this rain.''
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok, Defense Minister Frank de Grave and
other officials also have toured the area.
	   Though the Dutch must constantly battle with nature for their
low-lying land reclaimed from the sea, the recent storms have
caused the most damage to agriculture in this decade, he added.
	   In the northernmost province of Groningen, roads were closed
from flooding, and a bungalow park vacation area was evacuated
close to the village of Zoutkamp, said Groningen police spokesman
Reinder Klei.
	   Five hundred soldiers and engineers were deployed to Groningen
and Drenthe earlier this week to shore up soggy dikes weakened by
rain-swollen canals and rivers.
	   Officials said Friday that emergency equipment was being kept on
standby at a regional air base and that two barracks were ready in
case people needed to be evacuated.

North Korean deputy ambassador suspect in weapons, drugs smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ North Korea's deputy ambassador to Germany is
suspected of supplying illegal weapons and drugs to a smuggling
ring, a Berlin justice spokeswoman said Friday.
	   An investigation against him may be dropped, however, if he is
protected by diplomatic immunity, Michaela Blume said. Berlin
prosecutors have asked the Foreign Ministry to determine immunity
status on the diplomat, identified in the BZ tabloid newspaper as
Ri Sang Ju. Blume would not verify his name.
	   The diplomat is suspected of providing German accomplices with
illegal drugs, weapons, including machine guns, and ammunition.
	   Three residents of Brandenburg, a town just outside Berlin, were
arrested in connection with the case after a police sting operation
confiscated weapons and 320 grams (11.2 ounces) of heroin from
their car at a highway rest stop.
	   Justice officials did not identify the three suspects. Their
trial should begin in mid-December.
	   Prosecutors also are investigating a North Korean embassy
chauffeur and an employee of the embassy's foreign trade section,
according to BZ. Both have departed Germany.

Montgomerie shoots 5-under 67 to lead Westwood by one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Clarke quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie shot a 5-under 67 Friday
to move to 7-under par after two rounds of the Volvo Masters and a
one-stroke lead over Lee Westwood.
	   Westwood shot 68 as the two battle in the final tournament of
the season for the European money title. Darren Clarke, the only
other player with a chance to claim the season title, slipped to
4-under for two rounds after a 1-over 73.
	   Australian Peter Lonard claimed the tournament lead _ almost an
afterthought in the battle for the money title _ going 10-under
with a 66, the best round of the day.
	   Montgomerie, going for an unprecedented sixth consecutive money
title, had two eagles on the back nine and finished by dropping a
20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt on 18.
	   ``You feel good after holing a putt like that at the end,''
Montgomerie said. ``I'm just glad I'm in a position to win the
Volvo Masters. That's what I came here to do and I'm in a
reasonable position to do that.''
	   ``The two eagles (12 and 16) helped today,'' he added. ``They
were a huge boost.''
	   Westwood, battling a sore ankle and a minor rib injury,
practiced late after Thursday's 70 _ and hit helped.
	   ``I need all the practice I can get just to be one behind
Monty,'' Westwood said. ``I thought I played a little more
conservative today and just went for the middle of the green.''
	   Clarke, who got off to a bad start with bogies on the fifth and
seventh, blamed tee shots.
	   `I drove the ball poorly _ six of them left _ and the
consequence was that I couldn't get close to the flag,'' he said.
	   Montgomerie, 35, leads the European Tour money list with
winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood is No. 2 at 714,812
(dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Clarke at 616,867 (dlrs 1,036,337).
	   The winner of the Volvo Masters earns 166,000 pounds (dlrs
278,880). In addition, there is a bonus for the top 15 finishers on
the European money list _ beginning with 170,000 pounds (dlrs
285,600) for No. 1, 120,000 (dlrs 201,600) for No. 2 and so on.
	   If Montgomerie finishes ahead of Westwood he will claim his
sixth straight European money title. Westwood and Clarke are after
their first.
	   Westwood, 25, can also take the money title by finishing second,
provided Montgomerie is third or lower. If Westwood finishes third,
Montgomerie must finish 12th or lower.
	   For Clarke, 30, to top the money list, he must win the
tournament and hope that Westwood finishes no better than third and
Montgomerie no higher than ninth.
	   Montgomerie, Westwood or Clarke could all break the European
Tour season money record of 875,146 pounds (dlrs 1,470,245) set by
Montgomerie in 1996.

Remote Australian city lights up for Glenn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reported Glenn statement, graf 11. EDITS to
conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Last time, an Australian named John
Glenn fashioned a spotlight, white sheets and his clothesline into
a backyard beacon he hoped his astronaut namesake would see from
space.
	   Thirty-six years later, the 76-year-old man from Perth again
left the light on.
	   About 12:50 a.m. local time (1650 GMT), Perth again transformed
itself into a city of lights to greet astronaut John Glenn during
his historic return to space. Lights at major stadiums, skyscrapers
and thousands of homes were turned on to recreate the view Glenn
saw 36 years ago as his spacecraft passed over Australia.
	   In February 1962, residents stayed up until midnight and turned
on every house light to send a welcome message to Glenn. Every
street lamp and neon sign was also lit.
	   According to Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw
clouds part to reveal ``an absolute mass of electric lights'' in
two groups, one in Perth, the other in the town of Rockingham to
the south.
	   ``The lights show up very well,'' Glenn radioed to astronaut
Gordon Cooper, who was at a tracking station in Australia at the
time. ``Please thank everybody for turning them on, will you?''
	   Perth, a remote blip on the map on Australia's southwest coast,
has kept the title ``City of Lights'' ever since.
	   This time, Glenn's flight path was taking him farther north. But
that did not deter residents or the state government, which asked
everyone to turn on their lights.
	   The BP Oil refinery received permission from the state
government's Environmental Protection Department to light up its
gas flare.
	   Glenn flew over Western Australia state about 850 kms (530
miles) north of Perth.
	   NASA officials said Glenn reported, ``''They really got them lit
up tonight.''
	   ``We won't see the shuttle, but he will see us,'' Dr. James
Biggs of the Perth Observatory said before the passover. ``We'll
probably look like a big glowing blob to him.''
	   In 1962, many residents were advised to project normal household
lights on white surfaces directed skywards to create greater
luminescence.
	   Australia's Glenn didn't unfurl the sheets this time, and kept
it simple.
	   ``I've left the porch light on,'' Glenn told Channel Nine TV.

Man fined 1 million kroner for demolishing own home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ He wasn't the big bad wolf and he wasn't
after the three little pigs. He was a Norwegian homeowner who
wanted to destroy his own wooden house.
	   On the third attempt he succeeded, but police slapped him with a
fine of 1 million kroner (dlrs 135,000) _ for destroying protected
property, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported Friday.
	   The man, who was not named, on Wednesday pulled down his
150-year-old wooden house on the picturesque waterfront in Tromsoe,
some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north of Oslo.
	   Police had stopped him twice before, but this time he slipped
out before dawn with a friend and wrecked the house with a steam
shovel before the neighbors had time to wake up.
	   His million-kroner fine was more than the value of the house,
NTB said. The accomplice was fined 100,000 kroner (dlrs 13,500).
	   The report did not say why the homeowner had wanted to demolish
the building.
	   Tromsoe's conservation officer, Johanne Sognaes, told NTB that
the demolition amounted to ``deliberate sabotage.''
	   The man had bought the house in 1997, a year after the row of
waterfront wooden houses was placed under a preservation order. The
area is known for a history of fishing, whaling and polar
exploration. Many of the buildings recently have been renovated
with financial support from cultural authoritities.

Liberal theologians press for women deacons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THEODORA TONGAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Attempting to shake the foundations of an
institution deeply rooted in conservatism, liberal theologians are
pressing the Orthodox Church of Greece to allow women deacons.
	   ``I am not asking that they perform sacraments,'' theologian and
professor George Moustakis told a news conference Friday. ``But a
woman can preach.''
	   Moustakis has sent an outline of a plan for women deacons to the
Holy Synod, the Church's ruling body. But it is expected to reject
the proposal.
	   Some protestant churches permit women priests and the Roman
Catholic Church allows lay women deacons to read scriptures during
mass and assist the priest.
	   But Orthodox leaders worldwide are generally united in their
opposition to any type of formal participation for women, having in
the past threatened to boycott activities organized by the World
Council of Churches because some member churches include women
priests.
	   ``It is not possible to ordain women,'' said Archbishop
Christodoulos, head of the Orthodox Church of Greece.
	   But Moustakis and supporters _ such as Margaret Papandreou,
former wife of the late Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou _
argue that women can be more active participants in church affairs
and not be limited to such roles as money collection.
	   ``One of the steady demands of the women's movement is to give
women equal opportunities,'' said Ms. Papandreou. ``The attempt
that is being made to give women the opportunity to enter the
clergy is totally natural.''
	   Moustakis has cited various historical examples from the early
days of Christianity, when there were female deacons. They included
women who took holy communion to the first Christians in jail.
	   ``Although the Catholic church has not approved of ordination,
in the operations of the church they have moved forward, and
hopefully we will also move forward,'' said Moustakis.

Krajicek beats Ivanisevic, Rios pulls out, Gambill too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, corrects that Gambill suffered back
injury &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek ended a nine-match
losing streak against Goran Ivanisevic on Friday to reach the
semifinals of the Eurocard Open, while second-ranked Marcelo Rios
pulled out of his second tournament in as many weeks.
	   Top-ranked Pete Sampras also benefited from a retirement to
reach the semifinals. Sampras was leading 4-1 and preparing to
serve when fellow American Jan-Michael Gambill retired with a back
injury.
	   Sampras will play Krajicek in the semifinals.
	   Rios retired in the semifinals last week in Lyon, France, with a
hamstring injury in his left leg. This time, he pulled a muscle in
his right thigh while warming up by playing soccer with a tennis
ball.
	   ``I prefer to rest than to get worse,'' Rios said.
	   The Chilean advanced to the quarterfinals when his third-round
opponent, Jan Siemerink, retired with the flu after losing the
first set 6-2 late Thursday.
	   The withdrawal of Rios allowed 10th-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov to
move into the semifinals.
	   ``I've been pretty unlucky these last two weeks. It's too bad
because I've been playing some good tennis,'' Rios said.
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year, is trying
to take away the No. 1 ranking from Pete Sampras.
	   Sampras made sure of retaining the No. 1 spot for at least
another week by reaching the quarterfinals of this start-studded
dlrs 2.45 million tournament. He withdrew before the quarterfinals
in Lyon with a back strain, but says he is healthy now.
	   The battle for No. 1 is unlikely to be settled before next
month's season-ending World Championship of the eight top-ranked
players in Hanover, Germany.
	   Sampras is seeking to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row.
	   The withdrawal of Rios and the defeat Thursday of No. 3 Patrick
Rafter have bolstered Sampras' prospects of holding on to No. 1.
	   ``Certainly it helps. But I know that I can't rely on Marcelo or
Pat losing,'' Sampras said. ``I have to concentrate on what I am
trying to do and win my matches.''
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, improved his chances of
clinching one of the last two spots available for Hanover by
defeating his old nemesis, Ivanisevic.
	   It was only Krajicek's third victory over Ivanisevic, and the
first since 1992.
	   ``I knew it was that many matches, but I didn't know it was that
long,'' Krajicek said.
	   Ivanisevic, No. 14 in the world, had won the last nine matches
against the Dutchman, including the Wimbledon semifinal this year.
	   Krajicek, No. 11 in the world, plans to have surgery on his left
knee after the indoor season.
	   Winner here in 1995 and runner-up last last year, the Dutchman
slammed 11 aces and had only one double-fault to overcome
Ivanisevic 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5).
	   The matches between the two big servers often are decided in
tiebreakers and this was no exception.
	   Ivanisevic fired 10 aces, but he also committed six
double-faults.
	   The Croat saved two match points with backhand volleys but
Krajicek fired an ace to clinch the match after one hour and 25
minutes.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Once-awesome Hurricane Mitch, now
weakened to a tropical storm, drove inland over Honduras on Friday,
adding to the floods and wreckage that have killed at least 42
people and forced tens of thousands from their homes.
	   ``God save Honduras!'' President Carlos Flores Facusse said
after flying over parts of the disaster area left by more than two
days of hurricane-force winds. In some areas, as much as 2 feet
(0.6 meters) of rain fell within six hours.
	   Honduran officials said at least 15,000 houses have been
destroyed along the Atlantic coast. Many communities were cut off
by floods in Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua.
	   Maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph, (65 kph) down from 180
mph (290 kph) early Tuesday. The center said Mitch would probably
weaken if it remained over land, but could regain force if it
returned to sea.
	   Honduran officials said at least 29 people were killed _ 14 of
them on the Bay Islands, a diving resort that was left cut off
after being pounded by the hurricane's highest winds for two days.
At least 72,000 had fled their homes.
	   A family of six _ a man, two women and three children _ were
buried in a mudslide in the southern city of Choluteca on Thursday
after a river overflowed its banks and flooded the area, the Red
Cross said Friday.
	   In La Ceiba, which was isolated by two downed bridges, more than
a third of the city's 40,000 residents were staying in 18 shelters
_ all running short on food and water.
	   Nicaragua reported 12 dead and 50,000 evacuated. Mexico reported
one fatality, an American who was thrown from his boat south of
Cancun on Monday and presumed dead.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard said it was searching the Caribbean for a
240-foot (73- meter) sailing schooner with 31 people aboard that
was missing since Tuesday.
	   The Antigua-registered Fantome was on a tourist cruise near
Belize and the Bay Islands. It was last heard from when it radioed
that it was heading east to avoid the storm, said James Canty, a
spokesman for the owner, Windjammer Barefoot Cruises in Miami.
	   Coast Guard Assistant Duty Officer Chet Darby in Miami said late
Thursday it was too early for alarm: ``This kind of thing happens
often. We obviously don't have a hurricane out there every day but
we try not to make conclusions.''
	   Meanwhile, a mudslide Thursday near Honduras' capital,
Tegucigalpa cut the only highway to the nation's second city, San
Pedro Sula in the north.
	   The Rio Chamelecon rose Thursday night and swept away more than
300 houses in El Progreso, 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of
San Pedro Sula. But Col. Anael Perez, spokesman for the National
Emergency Committee, said all the residents had evacuated earlier.
	   In La Lima, Honduras headquarters for Cincinnati-based Chiquita
Brands International, neighborhoods were waist-deep in water and
hundreds of families huddled on a highway under tents of scrap tarp
and wood.
	   ``Last night the water just kept rising, so we decided to come
onto the highway,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo, 36, a firewood
collector.
	   Water, food and medicine was running short in many areas.
	   ``Today I just ate cassava with salt, Maria Gonzalez, 28, said
Thursday in the town of Tela on Honduras' northern coast.
``Tomorrow I don't know what I'll do.''

Jewish Community wants claims office to be run by former victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The Austrian Jewish Community said Friday
claims for Jewish property seized by the Nazis should be handled by
an office with representatives of victims rather than a government
fund set up to compensate all those who suffered under the Nazi
regime.
	   Fifty-three years after the end of World War II, Austria has
begun looking into what happened to billion of dollars in
businesses, real estate and art stolen by the Nazis from Austrian
Jews, many of whom were deported and murdered in the Holocaust.
	   In June 1995, a dlrs 50 million National Fund was established to
compensate Nazi victims. Its establishment was a belated
recognition of the long-denied fact that Austria was not simply a
``victim of Nazi aggression'' but also supplied a
disproportionately large number of men active in the extermination
of Jews and others deemed undesirable.
	   Anyone who can claim persecution by the Nazis because of race,
religion, nationality, sexual orientation or health can receive
compensation from the fund. Recipients must have either lived in
Austria before Hitler's annexation or been forced to flee.
	   Children of concentration camps inmates also qualify. But the
ceiling on awards is dlrs 6,000 per person. The number of those
compensated to date was not immediately known.
	   While commending the National Fund for disbursements so far,
Ariel Muzikant, president of the Austrian Jewish Community, said
Friday his organization was opposed to having the fund deal with
Jewish property claims.
	   On Thursday, the fund rejected a call by Jewish leaders for
establishment of a separate referral office to handle such claims
and be run by victims' representatives.
	   Muzikant said the property claim office should be directly
affiliated with the Jewish Community or to a commission of
historians which has begun identifying and assessing Jewish
property stolen by the Nazis during World War II.
	   Muzikant and other Jewish leaders told reporters property claims
should not be handled by ``those who have done nothing for 53
years.''
	   ``People are being sent around in a circle,'' Muzikant said,
referring to years of failure by Nazi victims to find Austrian
officials ready to handle their claims. ``We are confronted with
the wrath of these people,'' he added.
	   Meanwhile, representatives of Jewish victims from Austria have
set up a joint committee to help the victims, ensure better
communication with authorities and assist the commission of
historians.
	   An estimated 200,000 Austrian Jews fled the Nazis or perished in
concentration camps after Nazi Germany annexed Austria on March 13,
1938.
	   After the war, many Austrians -- as well as the victorious
Allies -- chose to see themselves as the first victims of Adolf
Hitler, who was born in Austria.
	   They repressed memories of the masses who cheered the German
troops marching into Austria and of the Austrians who were
personally responsible for Nazi atrocities.

Seven arrested for alleged trafficking in African girls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police have arrested seven West
Africans suspected of bringing young African girls to the
Netherlands and forcing them into prostitution, authorities said
Friday.
	   The suspects, four men and three women, were arrested earlier
this month after police raided three houses in the southern Dutch
town of Tilburg, where they also discovered five young African
girls who were believed to be victims.
	   Police from central Gelderland province said in a statement that
they began investigating after young African girls _ who had sought
asylum as refugees _ disappeared from a local shelter.
	   The investigation revealed that the missing girls, some as young
as 15, apparently had ended up in prostitution and were trafficked
to other European countries.
	   While the inquiry continued, the five girls were brought to an
undisclosed location.

RFE starts broadcasting to Iran, Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ U.S.-sponsored Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty was starting its broadcasts to Iran and Iraq
from Czech territory Friday, an official said.
	   ``We're starting our broadcast to Iraq and Iran today,'' station
manager Jan Obrman told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   In a trial period, which is to last several weeks, the station
will broadcast one 30-minute program a day to each country, Obrman
said.
	   Earlier this month, the Czech government allowed the
transmission into Iraq but insisted the station's location should
change to avoid security risks. The Farsi-language service into
Iran was approved by the government in August.
	   The radio station originally said it intends to expand to new
offices in Prague's sixth residential district, a plan which drew
concern from the government.
	   Obrman refused to say where the location of the new offices will
be.
	   RFE/RL began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in 1951,
spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries behind the
Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the West and the Communist
East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.

Pakistan imposes federal rule in lawless Sindh province
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with additional Sharif comment, background
on violence, reaction from MGM members. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday
dismissed the southern Sindh provincial legislature and imposed
federal rule to try to stop the relentless bloodletting terrorizing
the country's largest city of Karachi.
	   The decision to dismiss the Sindh provincial Parliament comes
after a fallout between Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and his
coalition partners in Sindh, the Muttaheda Qami Movement, over the
killing last week of a prominent philanthropist.
	   ``The killing and terrorism has paralyzed normal life,'' Sharif
told the nation in a televised speech.
	   ``I appeal to the people of Karachi and Sindh to cooperate with
the government in its efforts to root out terrorism,'' he said.
	   Wracked by relentless bloodletting between rival factions of a
minority ethnic party, Karachi has become a city under siege,
patrolled by thousands of police in riot gear and paramilitary
rangers in armored personnel carriers.
	   Blamed for the violence are rival factions of the Muttaheda Qami
Movement, which represents Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan
when British colonial rule of the subcontinent ended in 1947.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed so far this year in
Karachi, many of them innocent bystanders caught in a battle for
territory. Heavily armed supporters of the rival factions have
taken up positions on rooftops in several neighborhoods of Karachi,
attacking police stations and setting scores of vehicles on fire.
	   On Wednesday, Sharif warned the MQM that the coalition would
split unless they handed over the killers of Hakim Said, a
well-known Karachi physician gunned down in the violent port city.
The next day, the MQM withdrew from the coalition government to
protest Sharif's demands.
	   Sharif ordered governor's rule in southern Sindh province, which
effectively means the province will be ruled by Sharif's
government. Orders from Islamabad will be carried out by the Sindh
governor, a retired general named Moinuddin Haider.
	   MQM spokesmen said their supporters were being rounded up by
police. From his home in Britain, the exiled leader of the largest
MQM faction, Altaf Hussein, urged his supporters to go into hiding
to avoid arrest.
	   ``It is a conspiracy against democracy and it is a move to
establish a dictatorship in the country,'' Aftab Sheikh, a MQM
spokesman, said in Karachi. ``The federal government has been
interfering in provincial matters and has never allowed the
provincial government to work.''
	   The 78-year-old Said was opposed to the MQM and the relentless
violence that has wracked Karachi for the past year.

Army accuses Pakistan of trying to capture disputed glacier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ For the second time this week, India
accused Pakistan of trying to capture an icy border battlefield and
said its troops killed two enemy soldiers while repulsing the
attack.
	   The army said in a statement that Pakistani troops attacked the
Indian post ``Fateh-5770'' on the Siachen Glacier. A sentry noticed
some movement and alerted his colleagues who fought back.
	   Two Pakistani soldiers were killed in the fighting, the
statement said.
	   On Tuesday, the Indian army said its troops killed six Pakistani
soldiers while trying to push back an attack on Siachen. There was
an exchange of mortars and shells in the fighting.
	   There was no confirmation of the clash by Pakistan.
	   The glacier, 600 miles north of New Delhi, is more than 20,000
feet above sea level. Both India and Pakistan claim Siachen, and
skirmishes are common across the frontier despite severe
conditions. Temperatures on Siachen usually hover around minus-65,
with wind speeds of up to 62 mph.
	   The Siachen dispute is among the items to be discussed next week
by Indian and Pakistani secretaries of defense, water and power,
police and culture. The talks aimed at normalizing relations are
part of a round that began this month with talks between the two
countries' foreign secretaries.
	   The foreign secretaries' talks, which ended inconclusively, were
also preceded by fighting on Siachen.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British judge Friday granted bail for former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, detained in London on a
Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder,
torture and kidnapping during his 17 years in power.
	   Judge Stephen Richards decreed, however, that Pinochet must
remain at north London's Grovelands Priory Hospital, where he is
recuperating from back surgery, and under police guard at all
times.
	   James Lewis, the attorney representing British and Spanish
authorities, said he would not object with those conditions
imposed. But he added, ``We make it plain that if there were to be
any variation, the respondents would have a different perspective
on the matter.''
	   It is not unusual for judges to grant bail while restricting the
subject's movements. Technically, the decision means Pinochet no
longer is in custody.

New German foreign minister urges pressure on Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fischer comments on human rights, Poland. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new foreign minister called
Friday for continued international pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to make sure he pulls his forces out of Kosovo
province.
	   The comments by Joschka Fischer, a member of the formerly
pacifist Greens party who took over the post Wednesday, matched the
line of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
	   But he also said the new government will put more stress on
human rights. ``That is a central point for us,'' Fischer said in
an interview for broadcast Friday on ARD television.
	   During talks with Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen,
both agreed ``that the pressure on Milosevic must be maintained,''
the foreign ministry said.
	   Both also called for a ``stability concept'' to save the Russian
economy, based on democracy and a market economy.
	   Looking ahead to Germany's presidency of the European Union
during the first half of 1999, Fischer said the reform of EU
finances and its farm subsidies would have top priority.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has served word that Germany, the
top contributor to the EU budget, will seek to bargain down its
share.
	   Fischer visited Paris, London and Warsaw this week on his first
trip abroad as foreign minister.
	   He said Germany remains a firm advocate of bringing eastern
European candidate countries into the EU fold, but repeated the new
administration's call for ``realism.''
	   ``As far as I'm concerned, realism doesn't mean delaying the
matter but putting the problems openly on the table and finding
solutions,'' he said on ARD. ``That is the precondition for quick
progress. I promised the Poles that.''
	   Petersen stopped over in Bonn on his way to the Middle East.
Fischer said the meeting underlined the new government's interest
in continued close ties with its Nordic neighbors.

Remote Australian city lights up for Glenn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Glenn comments, grafs 11-12. EDITS to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Last time, an Australian named John
Glenn fashioned a spotlight, white sheets and his clothesline into
a backyard beacon he hoped his astronaut namesake would see from
space.
	   Thirty-six years later, the 76-year-old man from Perth again
left the light on.
	   About 12:50 a.m. local time (1650 GMT), Perth again transformed
itself into a city of lights to greet astronaut John Glenn during
his historic return to space. Lights at major stadiums, skyscrapers
and thousands of homes were turned on to recreate the view Glenn
saw 36 years ago as his spacecraft passed over Australia.
	   In February 1962, residents stayed up until midnight and turned
on every house light to send a welcome message to Glenn. Every
street lamp and neon sign was also lit.
	   According to Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw
clouds part to reveal ``an absolute mass of electric lights'' in
two groups, one in Perth, the other in the town of Rockingham to
the south.
	   ``The lights show up very well,'' Glenn radioed to astronaut
Gordon Cooper, who was at a tracking station in Australia at the
time. ``Please thank everybody for turning them on, will you?''
	   Perth, a remote blip on the map on Australia's southwest coast,
has kept the title ``City of Lights'' ever since.
	   This time, Glenn's flight path was taking him farther north. But
that did not deter residents or the state government, which asked
everyone to turn on their lights.
	   The BP Oil refinery received permission from the state
government's Environmental Protection Department to light up its
gas flare.
	   Glenn flew over Western Australia state about 850 kms (530
miles) north of Perth.
	   He reported, ``We got a real good view there was a little break
in the clouds.''
	   ``A long time ago I looked at the same thing from a little lower
altitude,'' Glenn said Friday. ``I think it looks even better now
than it did back then. They really got them lit up tonight.''
	   ``We won't see the shuttle, but he will see us,'' Dr. James
Biggs of the Perth Observatory said before the passover. ``We'll
probably look like a big glowing blob to him.''
	   In 1962, many residents were advised to project normal household
lights on white surfaces directed skywards to create greater
luminescence.
	   Australia's Glenn didn't unfurl the sheets this time, and kept
it simple.
	   ``I've left the porch light on,'' Glenn told Channel Nine TV.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Group of Seven major industrial nations
announced a series of new policies for global finance Friday,
including International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending
facilities for countries to draw on in times of crisis.
	   In announcing the policies, British treasury chief Gordon Brown
said the nations had in recent weeks taken steps to increase IMF
quotas and implement the new borrowing arrangements, providing an
extra dlrs 90 billion ``to ensure the stability of the
international financial system.''
	   The emergency borrowing program, available to countries pursuing
IMF-approved policies, would be ``accompanied by appropriate
private sector involvement,'' Brown said.
	   The IMF loan mechanism is likely to be employed almost
immediately as part of an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package
for Brazil, the latest country to be pummeled by frightened
investors.
	   U.S. officials believe that if such contingency financing is
made available, it might avert the very panic that has already
plunged a number of Asian countries into steep recessions and in
August leveled Russia's economy.
	   G-7 finance ministers said the new IMF loan window could be
``drawn upon in times of need and would entail appropriate interest
rates'' and shorter time frames for repayment than the normal IMF
loans.
	   One of the key demands that Congress made before approving dlrs
18 billion in additional U.S. resources for the IMF earlier this
month was that IMF loans should be at interest rates higher than
could be obtained from commercial banks in order to make sure
nations do not try to tap the international resources too
frequently.
	   While the joint G-7 statements did not specifically say that
Brazil would be the first test case for the new procedure, the
officials did have praise for the steps Brazil is taking to
stabilize its economy. U.S. officials indicated the new mechanism
will be employed as part of the Brazil support package.
	   The collective statement was fine-tuned Thursday night by
representatives of the G-7 governments _ the United States, Canada,
Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ after months of
negotiations, Brown said.
	   The reform package also includes more sophisticated systems for
supervising and regulating financial markets, and creation of an
international ``code of best practice'' governing how nations
handle financial and monetary policies, corporate governance and
accounting.
	   ``In this new interdependent and instantaneous global
marketplace, we must now create systems for supervision,
transparency, regulation and stability that are as sophisticated as
the markets they have to work with,'' Brown said.
	   The G-7 nations will strengthen systems for monitoring financial
markets ``using national and international regulatory and
supervisory expertise, including through a process of peer
review,'' Brown said.
	   Better regulation is needed to keep in check the vast flows of
capital between economies that helped spark the recent crisis, he
said.
	   Brown said there have been ``positive signs'' in recent months,
including legislative progress in Japan to reform the banking
system.
	   He said a G-7 special summit on the world financial crisis is a
possibility, but stressed that work ``behind the scenes and out of
the glare of publicity'' has been effective so far.
	   Financial markets were disappointed that high-level meetings
last month of G-7 finance ministers and central bank presidents
failed to come up with a blueprint for dealing with the crisis.
However, the officials issued a joint statement expressing their
commitment to promoting economic growth to ward off a global
downturn.
	   Investors have taken heart since then with an unexpected
interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Oct. 15, the second
that month, which was seen as a strong signal the Fed stood ready
to move aggressively to keep the United States from dipping into a
recession.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In a strong message that Turkey won't
tolerate terrorism, elite squads shot dead Friday a lone hijacker
who held 38 people hostage aboard a Turkish Airlines plane to
protest Turkey's Kurdish policy.
	   The man took over the Ankara-bound plane late Thursday during
nationwide celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the Turkish
Republic.
	   ``The terrorist got what he deserved,'' Interior Minister Kutlu
Aktas said. ``He paid with his life for upsetting the Turkish
people.''
	   ``I believe that the success of our security forces will be a
deterrent and such attempts will not happen again,'' President
Suleyman Demirel said.
	   None of the 38 passengers and crew was injured.
	   The hijacking diverted public attention from the festivities for
the republic's anniversary _ probably this year's top event in
Turkey. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries were attending the
celebrations.
	   It was not immediately known if the hijacker, who carried a
pistol and a hand grenade, was a Kurd. Authorities said he carried
false identity papers.
	   Released passengers and officials said that the man announced
during the hijacking that he was protesting Turkey's Kurdish
policy.
	   Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. Nearly 37,000 people have died in the
conflict.
	   Turkey denies Kurds cultural rights and many Kurdish politicians
are currently in jail for alleged ties with the rebel group.
	   After taking off from the southern city of Adana, the hijacker
demanded that the plane be diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland, a
city significant to Kurds as the site of a 1919 treaty that blocked
their hopes of a Kurdish state.
	   Instead of heading to Switzerland, the crew brought the plane
down at Ankara's airport where, after a seven-hour standoff, police
stormed the aircraft.

Viagra legalized in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Following in the lead of the European
Union, Hungary has authorized the anti-impotency drug Viagra, media
reported Friday.
	   Hungary's National Institute of Pharmacology completed testing
and formal registration procedures on the drug Thursday, but it was
unclear when it would hit pharmacies, MTI news agency reported.
	   Before that happens, the Minister of Health has to specify its
retail price in its official publication, the Health Gazette.
	   Registration of the drug was earlier thought to be years away,
but after the EU approved it in September, the National Institute
of Pharmacology started registration procedures.
	   Doctors have said that about one-third of Hungary's male
population over 40 are believed to have potency disorders and in
recent months illegally imported Viagra tablets have sold for 5,000
forints (dlrs 23) per pill.
	   The average monthly salary in Hungary is 70,000 forints, or dlrs
310.

Top U.S. official uneasy about Angolan peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United States' top official for Africa
said Friday that Washington is deeply concerned about the apparent
unraveling of Angola's peace accord and blamed the former rebel
group UNITA for holding up implementation of a 1994 peace accord.
	   Wrapping up a three-day visit here, Susan Rice said she also
held ``useful talks'' with officials on the conflict in neighboring
Congo and that Angolan leaders agreed on the need to keep Congo's
borders intact.
	   Rice said in a written statement to the press that the United
States was ``deeply concerned ... about the deadlock in the peace
process and the worrying decline in security in Angola.''
	   Implementation of the United Nations-brokered peace deal, which
ended a two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA, has
made no progress since May.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Indpendence of Angola _ has refused to surrender control of
its central highland strongholds to the government. The former foes
recently have engaged in small-scale skirmishes in rural areas.
	   ``We stressed that non-compliance by UNITA and (its leader)
Jonas Savimbi with their fundamental obligations ... is the main
reason for the deadlock and the fresh outbreaks of conflict,'' the
statement said.
	   Rice also urged the government to ``refrain from military action
which could lead to a return of a full-scale war.''
	   Rice _ accompanied by President Bill Clinton's special
assistant, Gayle Smith, and his special envoy to the Great Lakes
region, Howard Wolpe _ discussed the Congo conflict in her meeting
with Prime Minister Francisco van Dunem.
	   Angola, along with Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and, reportedly,
Sudan, has sent forces to support Congo President Laurent Kabila
against insurgents backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``We recognized the fundamental need to preserve the territorial
integrity of Congo and that the continuation of the conflict in
that country is a great danger to the stability of the entire
continent,'' the statement said.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2
and have since made steady gains in the country's east.
	   Rice and Angolan officials examined ways of persuading the
factions to enter into a cease-fire.
	   The U.S. delegation left Friday afternoon for Kinshasa, Congo,
as part of an African tour.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A manuscript expert at Christie's auction
house expressed shock Friday at Greece's ``bungled'' attempt to win
the bidding for a rare copy of writings by the ancient Greek
scholar Archimedes.
	   A London bookseller representing an anonymous American collector
outbid a Greek diplomatic envoy to purchase the 174-leaf manuscript
Thursday for dlrs 2 million in New York. With the auction house
fees, the final price reached above dlrs 2.2 million.
	   The loss was a stinging defeat for Greek officials, who had
insisted that Athens was the rightful place for the 1,000-year-old
manuscript.
	   ``They let a diplomat bid. They didn't even handle it
professionally at all,'' Felix de Marez Oyens, head of the auction
house's Books and Manuscripts Department, told The Associated
Press.
	   ``The whole thing's been bungled from beginning to end. ... And
you can tell them that from me with my compliments,'' he added.
	   De Marez Oyens contended the Greek government could have had a
better chance of success had it hired a professional to handle its
bidding.
	   Greece's consul general in New York, Haris Manesis, had to bow
out of the auction with a top bid of dlrs 1.9 million. He had been
given a ceiling of dlrs 2 million by the Greek Culture Ministry,
which had appealed to Greek businesses and foundations to
contribute to a fund to compete in the auction.
	   Manesis frequently asked for more time during the bidding, de
Marez Oyens said. ``And the auctioneer gave him a lot of time to
make up his mind,'' he noted.
	   The manuscript, known as the Archimedes Palimpsest, contains
notes and calculations for two of the most famous theories by the
3rd century BC mathematician and inventor: ``On Floating Bodies''
and ``Method of Mechanical Theorems.''
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful. But parts
of the copy of the Archimedes writing is legible.
	   The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem has claimed the
manuscript was stolen from its Metohion Library in Constantinople _
now Istanbul _ after World War I, when the collection was
transferred to Athens.
	   In a last-minute move, the Patriarchate began legal action to
block the auction. A federal court judge refused, saying the seller
_ a French family _ had clear title to sell the manuscript.
	   But the clerics will pursue claims in U.S. courts, Greece's
culture minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said Friday.
	   The manuscript's new owner has said he will make it available
for study, de Marez Oyens noted.
	   ``I would have been delighted if the Greek government had been
successful in buying it,'' he said. ``But I'm sure that with the
present owner, the manuscript will be better studied and more
available than if the Greek government had bought it. Because the
Metohion Library (collection) is not at all accessible.''

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 67 people and
injuring 155 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before
midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determined
as of Friday evening.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective
leading the disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at hall of the Macedonian Association local immigrant
group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In 1978, 20
people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous
gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and eight others died
later. More than 50 of the injured were in intensive care Friday
evening.
	   The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to
have them, officials said.
	   The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of
immigrants. Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19
nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and
Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and
unspecified Latin American countries.
	   The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,
had in turn rented the facility out to others for the dance,
Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the
capital, Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   The city's live theaters, cinemas and concert hall cancelled
performances Friday night as an expression of mourning.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence. On Friday
evening, memorial services were held at the Goteborg Cathedral and
at a local mosque.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

Rwanda genocide convict ends nine-day hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The first person convicted by an
international tribunal in the 1994 Rwanda genocide Friday ended a
nine-day hunger strike he began to force the court to pay for a
Canadian lawyer to appeal his conviction, a spokesman said.
	   Kingsley Moghalu said Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former mayor
convicted of crimes of genocide, had written a letter confirming he
would follow ``established procedures'' to procure a defense
counsel.
	   Akayesu stopped eating Oct. 22 because the tribunal refused to
pay for Canadian lawyer John Philpot whom he wanted to handle the
appeal of his conviction and sentencing to life in prison.
	   The tribunal says Philpot lacks the required credentials.
	   Like all other genocide defendants held by the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Akayesu says he has no money. Moghalu
said the tribunal had already paid over half a million dollars to a
succession of three court-appointed lawyers to represent the
Rwandan during his trial.
	   More than 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus, were killed between April and July 1994 in a genocide
orchestrated by the former Hutu government. The slaughter ended
when Tutsi rebels overthrew the government.
	   Moghalu said as a creation of the United Nations, the tribunal
has to follow established procedures, including geographical
representation, in the selection of court-appointed lawyers for the
30 defendants in its custody.
	   ``He has wanted to dictate to us, and the tribunal will not bow
to that kind of pressure,'' he said.
	   He also said too many French and Canadian lawyers were
representing the accused and there had to be a better geographical
distribution.
	   The tribunal lets suspects choose from a list of approved
defense attorneys at no cost. Suspects can hire other attorneys,
but the court will not pay for them.
	   One other defendant confessed to crimes of genocide and has been
sentenced to life in prison.

Libya says UN sanctions were renewed due to US-UK pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's official media accused the U.N.
Security Council on Friday of renewing an air embargo under
pressure from the United States and Britain.
	   The council's vote Thursday to maintain sanctions imposed over
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was a setback for Libya, which has
been pushing to have the embargo lifted.
	   The council reiterated that the sanctions would be suspended
only after Libya hands over two men who have been indicted in the
case. The airliner blew up in mid-air over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, killing 270 people.
	   ``The renewal of these unjust sanctions once again betrays the
pressure which the Security Council is being subjected to by
certain countries, especially the U.S. and Britain, which are using
the council for specific political objectives,'' Libya's state-run
radio said.
	   The sanctions, which have been renewed periodically since 1992,
were imposed to force Libya to surrender the suspects. They ban air
travel to and from Libya, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets
abroad and limit the sale of oil equipment.
	   In recent months several African heads of state have violated
the embargo by flying directly to the Libyan capital.
	   In July, the Security Council backed a U.S._British plan for the
two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. The
plan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.

South Africa holds summit aimed at creating more jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Business, labor, government
and community organizations committed themselves during a ``job
summit'' Friday to cutting South Africa's 33 percent unemployment
rate.
	   President Nelson Mandela, in a message to the summit, called it
``the most important event since the holding of our first
democratic elections.'' Mandela was on a diplomatic trip to Nigeria
and unable to attend.
	   The most substantive job-creation measure announced at the
summit was a project to build 150,000 houses for low-income
families by December 2001. The program will be jointly funded by
government, business and labor.
	   Government would budget 750 million rands (dlrs 133 million) in
the next two fiscal years for the project, while business said it
would contribute 1.8 billion rands (dlrs 320 million).
	   Participants also agreed to embark on a Buy South Africa
campaign to promote demand for local products and services.
Delegates agreed the flow of illegal imported goods into South
Africa had to be curbed and customs control strengthened.
	   Despite the conciliatory tone of the summit, divisions still run
deep between the business community and labor unions over how the
economy should be run.
	   John Gomomo, president of the Congress of South African Trade
Unions, said relying on market-driven solutions to relieve
unemployment would only compound the problem.
	   Labor unions believed there was a need for a Marshall Plan that
would target unemployment, poverty and inequality on a massive
scale.
	   But Business South Africa President Dorian Wharton-Hood voiced a
contradictory view, saying rigidities in South Africa's labor
market regulations were hampering free enterprise and undermining
job creation.
	   He urged stability in industrial relations.
	   ``Work place efficiency and labor equity can be reconciled,''
Wharton-Hood said. ``However, this will require new and innovative
forms of labor relations, where parties are able to collaborate to
achieve common goals.''

Adams, Trimble blame each other for deadlock over Belfast peace
</HEADLINE>
accord &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Relations between Ulster
Unionist Party leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams
plumbed new depths Friday as they blamed each other for violating
Northern Ireland's peace agreement.
	   The two leaders, emerging separately from a surprise meeting
inside Stormont Parliament Building in east Belfast, indicated that
their fourth one-on-one meeting since April's multiparty agreement
was also their worst.
	   Adams is demanding that Trimble permit his Irish Republican
Army-allied party to be appointed immediately to a new
cabinet-style administration for Northern Ireland, the intended
centerpiece of the agreement that Catholics had expected to be
established by Saturday.
	   But Trimble, chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority, is demanding that the IRA start disarming
first, a long-elusive goal also contained in the accord.
	   ``The man had absolutely nothing new to say to me. It was
disappointing, but predictable,'' Trimble, who shared this year's
Nobel Peace Prize with moderate Catholic leader John Hume, said of
Adams.
	   Adams said he intended to complain by phone to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair about what he called Trimble's ``go slow''
tactics.
	   ``I am disappointed, and I wasn't impressed with the defense
that Mr. Trimble put up for his failure to implement the
agreement,'' Adams said.
	   Their showdown has ensured that Northern Ireland's politicians
will fail to meet one of the few deadlines in the accord. It said
Northern Ireland's new government should have held an inaugural
cooperative summit with the Irish government by Oct. 31.
	   Instead, Trimble said he expects Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern to arrive in Belfast on Monday to try to narrow the gap
between himself and Adams.
	   Trimble argues that Protestant lawmakers will not tolerate any
role for Sinn Fein in the new government unless the IRA, 15 months
into an open-ended truce, demonstrates it has renounced violence by
disarming.
	   Sinn Fein argues, with the backing of the north's moderate
Catholic leaders and Ahern, that the accord specifies only that the
IRA should disarm by May 2000 _ and that IRA disarmament is not
explicitly required for Sinn Fein figures to hold office.
	   But the moderate Catholics and Ahern have also said the IRA
needs to start disarming as soon as possible, otherwise Protestant
support for the accord will weaken.

Krajicek beats Ivanisevic, Rios pulls out, Gambill too
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras is getting all the help
he can get in his battle to set a tennis landmark, even from his
rivals.
	   Sampras was leading 4-1 and preparing to serve when Jan-Michael
Gambill, a 21-year-old rapidly improving fellow American who is No.
50 in the world, retired with a foot injury Friday, giving Sampras
a smooth passage into the semifinals of the star-studded Eurocard
Open.
	   Gambill's withdrawal came just minutes after Marcelo Rios,
Sampras' closest challenger at No. 2, retired before his
quarterfinal against Yevgeny Kafelnikov because of a thigh injury.
	   ``It's a fluke, but certainly it helps, I must admit,'' said
Sampras, who is seeking to become the first player to finish as No.
1 for six years in a row.
	   With Rios forced to drop out of his second tournament in as many
weeks and No. 3 Patrick Rafter losing in the third round Thursday,
Sampras' prospects to protect the top ranking have been bolstered.
	   ``Certainly it helps. But I know that I can't rely on Marcelo or
Pat losing,'' Sampras said. ``I have to concentrate on what I am
trying to do and win my matches.''
	   By reaching the quarterfinals of this dlrs 2.45 million
tournament, Sampras had made sure of extending his reign at least
through next week's Paris indoor tournament, which he won last
year.
	   Last week in Lyon, France, Sampras had to withdraw before the
quarterfinals because of a back strain. Sampras says he is fine
now.
	   Sampras has complained this week about the lack of attention his
achievements are getting back home.
	   ``It is not easy to do year in, year out, win Grand Slams and be
No. 1. I feel much more respected in Europe than I do in the
States, from the press and from the people.
	   ``Americans expect me to win every match I play,'' said Sampras,
who has won 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's
record.
	   The No. 1 battle is unlikely to be settled before next month's
season-ending World Championship in Hanover, Germany.
	   In the semifinals, Sampras will battle Richard Krajicek, who
ended a nine-match, six-year losing streak against Goran
Ivanisevic.
	   ``I knew it was that many matches, but I didn't know it was that
long,'' Krajicek said.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, improved his chances of
clinching one of the last two spots available in the eight-man
field for Hanover.
	   Winner here in 1995 and runner-up last last year, the
11th-ranked Dutchman slammed 11 aces and had only one double-fault
to overcome Ivanisevic 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5).
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year, retired in
the semifinal in Lyon with a hamstring injury in his left leg. This
time, he pulled a muscle in his right thigh while warming up by
playing soccer with a tennis ball.
	   ``I prefer to rest than to get worse,'' said Rios, who had
reached the quarterfinals when his third-round opponent, Jan
Siemerink, retired with the flu after losing the first set 6-2 late
Thursday.
	   ``I've been pretty unlucky these last two weeks. It's too bad
because I've been playing some good tennis,'' Rios said.

Vatican: Only popes can set the limits of their power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Popes alone can determine the limits of
their powers, the Vatican's guardian of orthodoxy said Friday,
affirming the primacy that has divided Christianity for centuries.
	   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger also made the unusual concession,
however, that, ``In the history of the papacy human errors and
grave failings are not lacking.''
	   With Pope John Paul II's papacy entering its third decade,
Ratzinger's words showed the church remains unrelenting in both its
campaign against any weakening of authority or doctrine and its
drive to clear its conscience of past excesses.
	   One example: a first-of-its-kind Vatican conference this week on
the papal-directed Inquisition.
	   Ratzinger's statement was timed for the publication of findings
of a 1996 Vatican conference on the papacy.
	   John Paul's appeals for Christian unity have been a theme of his
tenure.
	   The Christian church split in 1054 into Orthodox and Roman
Catholic branches, in part because of division over the primacy of
the pope. The Church of England split from the Roman Catholic
Church over the same issue centuries later.
	   Although John Paul spoke in 1995 of finding a new way to
exercise papal primacy, he also said popes must have that supreme
position to fulfill their mission.
	   Ratzinger's statements Friday drew an even harder line.
	   ``It is clear that only the pope ... as successor of Peter, has
the authority and the competence to speak the last word on the
means of exercising the pastoral ministry of the universal
church,'' Ratzinger wrote.
	   The papacy, he said, ``is not an office of the presidency'' and
``cannot be conceived of as a type of political monarchy.''

	   KOKOBAY, Eritrea (AP) _ Two people died and 100 fields were
burned in weekend artillery exchanges between Ethiopian and
Eritrean forces, farmers and a doctor said Friday.
	   The farmers in this village 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast
of the capital, Asmara, said their fields and surrounding villages
were shelled from the Ethiopian side for several hours Saturday.
	   Dr. Habtemariam, medical director of Senafe Hospital, said a man
and a woman had been killed in the shelling, and the woman's
11-month-old child was injured.
	   The border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia has simmered for
five months after breaking out into open warfare in early June.
Several hundred people were killed in both countries.
	   Sporadic artillery exchanges at the border town of Zalambesa,
now occupied by Eritrea, and at other points along the common
border have been reported during the period. But Kokobay residents
said the weekend shelling was worse that usual.
	   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, government spokeswoman
Selome Tadesse denied Ethiopia had shelled Eritrea.
	   ``There was no shelling by Ethiopia against Eritrean forces or
towns anywhere along the common border,'' she said Thursday.
	   Farmer Haile Gebre said the shelling burned the barley and wheat
fields of 100 of the 500 farmers in the village.
	   Amlesset Begrehanes said she was at the market in nearby Seraha
when the shelling began. She said she and others took refuge in a
cave.
	   ``After that, I went home, and a bomb landed in front of my
house and another in the back. Everybody is scared,'' she said.
	   The villagers say the Ethiopians are targeting their fields to
prevent them from harvesting their crops.
	   Throughout the week, farmers have been cutting, gathering and
threshing the grain and oil-seed crops.
	   ``We are racing to collect them before they bomb again,'' Haile
Gebre, 55, said. ``We're really scared they might do that.''
	   Many younger farmers have been conscripted for the war effort,
and businessmen and professionals from Asmara have been helping to
bring the harvest in.
	   The United States has tried to revive attempts at a peaceful
settlement after a first try in June failed. President Clinton's
special envoy Anthony Lake was in Asmara and Addis Ababa at the
beginning of October, but no details were released on the outcome
of his talks with Eritrean and Ethiopean leaders.
	   Ethiopia says it will not negotiate until Eritrea withdraws from
territory it occupied after May 12. Eritrea denies holding any
territory not under its jurisdiction according to borders drawn by
Italian surveyors in the first decade of the century while Eritrea
was an Italian colony.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries was
never officially declared.

Finance ministers ask quick OK of IMF increase
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With G7-World Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Finance ministers from the world's wealthiest
nations Friday called for speedy implementation of the previously
agreed dlrs 90 billion increase in International Monetary Fund
reserves.
	   In a communique, the G-7 ministers said, ``We welcome the
positive steps that have been taken toward the implementation of
the IMF quota increase and the new arrangements to borrow. We call
for these to be implemented as soon as possible. Together they will
provide additional resources of dlrs 90 billion for the IMF.''
	   Congress approved the dlrs 18 billion U.S. share of the
increased funding after stalling over the issue for a year. The
U.S. decision opens the way for the other 181 IMF member nations to
make their contributions to the funding increase.
	   The statement said the additional funding should be used to help
``ensure the stability of the international financial system.''
	   Turning to President Bill Clinton's proposal to speed IMF money
to countries threatened with investor panic, the communique said
these nations could, if they chose, extend lines of credit
alongside the IMF.
	   The new facility could be ``accompanied as appropriate by
bilateral finance, on a case-by-case basis,'' the communique said,
``and with appropriate private-sector involvement.''
	   The statement gave no details on how private-sector
organizations such as banks might participate.
	   The statement also welcomed a new emergency lending fund
established by the World Bank, the IMF's sister institution.

Sponsors sign charter to crack down on banned drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Seeking to repair cycling's tattered image, three
top French sponsors said Friday they have signed a charter aimed at
clamping down on the use of banned drugs among cyclists with stiff
provisions for members of their teams.
	   The so-called ``Sponsors Charter,'' signed by Bigmat, Cofidis
and Francaise des Jeux, includes a range of measures designed to
make it tougher for cyclists to take illicit drugs.
	   Among the most far-reaching measures is one giving sponsors the
right to demand further medical examinations in the event of a
positive drug test, and prevent cyclists who test positive from
competing until undergoing a disciplinary hearing.
	   The move comes nearly three months after the Tour de France was
rocked by a doping scandal that saw the Festina team expelled
following revelations of the systematic use of EPO.
	   In a joint statement, Bigmat, Cofidis and Francaise des Jeux
said they drew up the charter to show that they ``have the will to
implement all possible measures to preserve the image of
professional cycling.''
	   The measures include allowing sponsors the right to hire doctors
of their own choice to test cyclists and making cyclists on the
three teams guarantee in writing that they will abstain from taking
banned substances during their contracts.
	   According to the charter, a cyclist must also inform his team of
a positive drugs test within 24 hours of receiving results.
	   The three sponsors said that they, in turn, would ensure that
sports directors take all possible measures to avoid the use of
banned substances and make cyclists fully aware of which substances
are banned.
	   The sponsors also pledged to donate one percent of their
sponsorship fees to an independent body set up to combat the use of
banned substances.
	   The three sponsors have invited other sponsors to sign the
charter.

KLA spokesman says guerrillas won't harm Serb civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DECANI, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic-Albanian guerrilla
movement would not harm Serb civilians, a spokesman for the rebels
said Friday.
	   ``We are fighting for our human rights but we are not going to
touch Serbs or other people not directly involved in the
fighting,'' said Adem Demaci, a politician who speaks for the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   He made the remarks following a rare meeting with Father Sava
Janjic, an elder of the Orthodox monastery in Decani who has been
pushing for a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo.
	   Janjic called on politicians to intensify their political
efforts to avert more violence.
	   ``Unless there is a very important and serious political interim
agreement in a few months, I am afraid there will be conflicts
again,'' Janjic said.
	   He said it was ``unacceptable'' that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic could decide the fate of everyone in Kosovo, a
predominately ethnic-Albanian province. Janjic suggested that a
representative of Kosovo's Serbs join any negotiations.
	   The monastery, near the border with Albania, is one of the
treasures of the Serbian Orthodox church that has its roots in
Kosovo and is thus prized by Serbs as the cradle of their culture.

Arafat swiftly silences Islamic militant opponents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs, UPDATES with U.S. official saying he was
confident the accord would be ratified by Israel on Sunday &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a swift move to rescue the
imperiled land-for-peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Friday silenced his Islamic militant rivals _ at
least temporarily.
	   The charismatic Hamas founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was held
under house arrest, his phone line cut, and burly security men with
AK-47 assault rifles were posted outside his home in a Gaza City
slum. Only his wife and children were allowed to come and go.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists were arrested within a 24-hour
period. Senior figures in the group that is bent on sabotaging the
U.S.-brokered peace deal were seized and had phones disconnected.
	   Israel said the crackdown on Hamas, coming a day after a suicide
attack aimed at Israeli school children, was a positive sign, but
that Arafat needed to do more to earn the 13 percent of the West
Bank he was promised in the peace accord.
	   ``They must struggle firmly against ... the terror groups,''
said Israel's hawkish foreign minister, Ariel Sharon. ``If the
commitments are fulfilled, Israel will carry out its part.''
	   But despite the tough words, a senior U.S. official said he
expected the timetable of the agreement to be kept.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinian Authority was expected to present a security work plan
to U.S. officials over the weekend. This, in turn, could pave the
way for Israeli Cabinet approval Sunday of the Wye River accord.
	   Asked whether the United States took the deadline seriously, the
official said: ``You bet. There is no talk about changing it ...
time is short.'
	   In the meantime, Arafat is under tremendous pressure to prove to
Israel that his campaign against Hamas is different from past
sweeps in which hundreds were rounded up but then released.
	   At the same time, Arafat cannot risk provoking a bloody backlash
that could lead the Palestinians to the brink of civil war.
	   In Yassin's Sara neighborhood, a slum of unpaved alleys and
crumbling homes, many felt Arafat had gone too far already.
	   ``They surrounded his home with armed officers as if he was a
criminal under arrest,'' said Omar Abul Subar, 42, wearing a long
robe, baggy pants and slippers as he emerged from the local mosque.
	   Abul Subar and other men returning home from noon prayers said
that only fear kept them from protesting openly.
	   In the longer term, the Palestinian leader will only have broad
public support for a move against Hamas if the Israelis deliver
their part of the agreement _ by releasing prisoners, opening the
Gaza airport, opening a land route between the West Bank and Gaza -
so the Palestinians feel they have something to gain.
	   Palestinian commentator Ghassan Khatib cautioned that mass
arrests were no guarantee that violence against Israel will stop.
``Even if they manage to catch the right people, Hamas can always
recruit new ones and organize attacks,'' Khatib said.
	   Still, Arafat's adviser, Nabil Abourdeneh, made it clear that
the Palestinian leader was in no mood for compromise with Hamas.
``We will not allow any faction to stand in the way of liberating
Palestinian lands,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   Arafat has rounded up Hamas activists in the past, but this
marked the first time he arrested and silenced the entire
leadership within a day. In a sign that the campaign was not
confined to Gaza, Arafat's men on Friday prevented a planned Hamas
march in the West Bank town of Nablus.
	   It was also a first that Arafat took on Yassin, a quadriplegic
since his teens who is widely respected even by many outside Hamas
for building and funding clinics, schools and kindergartens.
	   The roundup began Thursday afternoon, just hours after a
Palestinian motorist rammed his rigged caar into an Israeli army
jeep escorting school children from a nearby Jewish settlement. A
soldier was killed, but the 40 children escaped unharmed.
	   By Thursday evening, security guards were posted outside
Yassin's home and he was informed he was under house arrest.
	   In an interview Yassin granted to the Qattar-based Al-Jazeera TV
just before the guards arrived, Yassin said he wanted to avoid
fighting among the Palestinians at all costs, but that attacks on
Israelis were a legitimate way of fighting occupation.
	   Several hours later, at 1:30 a.m. Friday, Palestinian agents
ransacked Yassin's home, arrested three bodyguards and seized
weapons, videotapes and files, according to a fax sent to news
agencies. The authenticity of the handwritten fax, signed by
Yassin, could not be confirmed.
	   Despite the unprecedented pressure on the group, the first Hamas
response was relatively mild. The group accused Arafat of trying to
``wipe out'' his political opposition, but did not threaten
retaliation against the Palestinian Authority.

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ With the shout of ``fire,'' the
Halloween dance changed from a delight to a horror. The teen-agers
who had been moving to the music suddenly fled in fright to the
exits.
	   ``A light went out. Somebody yelled 'fire.' And then somebody
shouted 'evacuate,''' said Elizabeth Moya, 17, one of an estimated
400 young people at the dance.
	   She was fortunate. She made it through a door, down stairs and
outside to safety. Behind her, youths were crushed in the surge to
escape; rescuers found 59 dead at the scene and eight others died
at hospitals.
	   Standing outside the charred brick building Friday morning, amid
lit candles, bouquets of flowers and dazed family and friends of
the victims, 15-year-old Christian Czari said, ``Everybody
panicked.''
	   ``Nobody cared about the girls. The strongest made way first.
Kids were fighting each other to get out.''
	   The fire started shortly before midnight. The first fire truck
arrived less than five minutes later, but too late to stop the
worst of the tragedy.
	   Bojan Jovanich, a high school student, said it was the disc
jockey who yelled ``fire'' just before he jumped out a second-story
window.
	   ``We couldn't see much because the lights had gone out,'' he
said. ``Then we saw the flames.''
	   Some boys bent back the metal grill on a window, tied a long
curtain and apparently intended to slide down. They gave up and
jumped, Jovanich said. Others caught fire _ their hair, their
clothes. ``It was a terrible sight,'' he said. ``Thank good God I'm
alive.''
	   Czari and others tried to carry or drag injured companions to a
nearby car rental shop that served as a first aid center. He gave
up because the bodies were ``sticky'' with blood and burns. ``The
skin wasn't there any more.''
	   The dance was to celebrate All Saints Day and a holiday weekend.
Many of the victims apparently were from Goteborg's large immigrant
community.
	   There are sizeable groups from 70-80 nationalities _ notably
Syrians, Kurds, Somalians and Bosnians _ in Sweden's second-largest
city, located about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of
Stockholm.
	   A young woman with tears in her eyes waited for news about
survivors at the Lutheran Church in suburban Hammarkullen,
converted to a crisis center. She said her foster brother is
missing. She appeared calm, but said, ``There's chaos inside of
me.''

Iran's leader heaps insults on Arafat for deal with Israel

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced
Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful ... traitor,'' heaping on the
Palestinian leader some of the worst insults he has faced for
signing a peace accord with Israel.
	   ``He is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply
immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah
Khamenei said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University.
	   Khamenei was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no
surrender, combat Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of
worshipers hearing him.
	   Most top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami,
Cabinet ministers, Parliament members and military officers were
present.
	   The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in
the capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed
intensive media campaigns encouraging people to take part.
	   Although the gist of Khamenei's speech reflected Iran's
longstanding opposition to any Palestinian peace with Israel, the
sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric.
	   Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless
and is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian
resistance, let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said.
	   Arafat singed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Oct. 23, promising to crack down on Islamic militants
in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent of
West Bank.
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations.
	   In Damascus, Syria, on Friday, the leader of the Lebanese
militant group, Hezbollah, said the accord liquidated Palestinian
rights.
	   ``Arafat is an agent of Israel and the United States,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah told a rally in a Palestinian refugee camp on the
outskirts of the city.
	   Khamenei criticized the United States for brokering the
agreement, which he said only served Washington's interests.
	   ``In this agreement, Mr. Yasser Arafat is executing the orders
of the prosecutor, Israel and the judge, America. Shame on this
disgraceful man,'' he said.
	   He said the agreement would not achieve its objective of
providing security for Israel.
	   ``They want to create security for the Zionist regime but they
can not. The occupying Zionist regime cannot have one single moment
of relaxed sleep. God will take their relaxation and tranquility
from them. They have money, they have weapons, but they don't have
relaxation. They have everything except the possibility of a good
life,'' Khamenei said.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
67 people and injuring 155.
	   The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before
midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determined
as of Friday evening.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the
disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous
gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and eight others died
later. More than 50 of the injured were in intensive care Friday
evening.
	   The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to
have them, officials said.
	   The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of
immigrants. Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19
nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and
Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and
unspecified Latin American countries.
	   The Macedonian Association had rented the facility out for the
dance, Carlsson said. The renter was not immediately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the brick building.
	   About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said. Many escaped
on their own. Police rescued 40.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. ``What we know
is that there was an explosion,'' Edmundson said.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, although
officials said it apparently began with an explosion.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   Oertenwall, the medical officer, said the total number of
injured was 162, down from previous estimates of 180.
	   Seven of the most severely injured were taken by helicopter to
burn clinics in other cities, the report said. Goteborg is about
500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the capital, Stockholm.
	   The dance was filled with teen-agers celebrating Halloween and a
holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   The city's live theaters, cinemas and concert hall canceled
performances Friday night as an expression of mourning.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence. On Friday
evening, memorial services were held at the Goteborg Cathedral and
at a local mosque.

Politically correct Toronto Star bids for feisty tabloid rival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ In this four-newspaper city, the papers
themselves are front-page news, thanks to a hostile bid by the
earnestly liberal Toronto Star to acquire the irreverent Toronto
Sun, tabloid home of right-wing pundits and bikini-clad Sunshine
Girls.
	   It would be hard to find two other Canadian dailies with such
contrasting ideologies. The Sun said Friday that the proposed
takeover would be comparable to Northern Ireland's Catholics and
Protestants worshipping in the same church.
	   The takeover bid of dlrs 748 million (dlrs 486 million U.S.) was
announced Wednesday by Torstar Corp., which publishes community
newspapers and Harlequin romance novels but focuses mostly on the
Star, Canada's best-selling paper with a circulation of 450,000.
	   The offer is to buy all of Sun Media Corp., which includes Sun
tabloids in Toronto and three other cities, plus 11 other papers.
	   Though the possibility of a takeover was broached informally
during confidential talks over the summer, the timing of the
Torstar announcement surprised and annoyed Sun executives.
	   On Thursday, the Sun moved its Sunshine Girl of the day, Carina,
from the customary Page 3 venue to the front page. Clad in a skimpy
chartreuse bikini, clutching the Star in one hand, Carina gaped
incredulously under a headline that said simply, ``The Star?''
	   Later in the day, Sun Media directors huddled for four hours,
then President Paul Godfrey emerged to say his company would play
hard to get.
	   ``We intend to fight this unsolicited, hostile, opportunistic
offer,'' Godfrey said. ``People have counted us out before. ... We
will not go gently into that starry night.''
	   The Sun's front-page headline Friday was typically feisty: ``Sun
To Star: We Fight.''
	   Sun Media's decision to resist the bid suggests the company may
seek a so-called white knight to top the Torstar offer. Some
analysts speculate that the rejection may simply be a tactic to
squeeze a better price from Torstar.
	   Asked about the possibility of another suitor, Godfrey said only
that ``many people'' have expressed interest in Sun Media.
	   Torstar announced its bid the day after the launch of a new
Toronto-based daily, the National Post, which aims to compete with
the fourth Toronto-based paper, The Globe and Mail, for readers
nationwide. The Star and the Sun, which has a circulation of
240,000, concentrate their efforts on the Toronto area, where 10
percent of Canada's 30 million people live.
	   Torstar has been passive in recent years while rival newspaper
companies have grown rapidly through acquisitions.
	   Under the direction of Conrad Black, Southam Inc. and Hollinger
Inc. now operate 58 of Canada's 105 daily newspapers, including the
National Post. Sun Media is now Canada's second-largest newspaper
publisher in circulation.
	   The financial community seems to believe that both Torstar and
Sun Media would benefit if they joined forces and cut production
costs. Shares in both companies rose on the Toronto Stock Exchange
after the bid was announced.
	   But investors' enthusiasm was not shared by Sun employees.
	   If the takeover goes through, wrote columnist Peter Worthington,
``It's the end of the Sun. We've sold our soul.''
	   Christie Blatchford, a popular columnist who has written for
both the Sun and Star and now works for the National Post, called
the takeover proposal preposterous.
	   The Sun's favorite things, she wrote, include right-wing
political ideas, ``breasts, more folks in jail, better controls on
immigration, lower taxes, less red tape, fewer civil servants, a
return to basics in education, and breasts.''
	   ``The Star, editorially, believes in the direct opposites of the
things on that list, particularly the breast part,'' Blatchford
wrote.
	   Even one of the Star's columnists, Rosie DiManno, poked fun
Friday at her own paper's political correctness.
	   Noting that the Sun had just run a story on sex in the
workplace, DiManno wrote, ``The Star doesn't believe in sex in the
workplace. Or at home.''

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ With the shout of ``fire,'' the
Halloween dance changed into a desperate scramble for safety from
the fast-spreading blaze.
	   ``A light went out. Somebody yelled 'fire.' And then somebody
shouted 'evacuate,''' said Elizabeth Moya, 17, one of the 400 young
people at the dance.
	   She was fortunate. She made it through a door, down stairs and
outside to safety. Behind her, youths were crushed in the surge to
escape; rescuers found 59 dead at the scene and eight others died
at a hospital.

Environmentalists hit global trade chief with cream pies, aide says

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of
the World Trade Organization with cream pies, an official said.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech in
London in which he defended a WTO decision overturning a U.S.
attempt to protect endangered sea turtles from shrimp fishermen.
	   Ruggiero released a one-sentence comment through his Geneva
headquarters, saying, ``When they have no more rational arguments,
the fringe elements have to use cake.''
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side,
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year, said a
trade official.
	   Rockwell said someone from the group approached Ruggiero with
what appeared to be a present, ``but I told him to get out of the
way.''
	   ``Then one guy shoved the pie hard into his face and another
brought a second down on top of his head,'' accusing him of being a
turtle-killer, Rockwell said.
	   But he said Ruggiero, who had received heavy bodyguard
protection when he was trade minister in Italy in the 1980s, was
``extraordinarily calm.''
	   ``The first thing he said was, `This is not a bad cake!'''
Rockwell told The Associated Press, but he said he didn't know what
the flavor was.
	   Rockwell, who said there were no police or other guards present
when the attack occurred, led Ruggiero back into Chatham House
where he had given the speech and wiped the cream off his suit and
face.
	   A group calling itself the Biotic Baking Brigade later issued a
statement saying its pie throwers sent ``a sticky message to
Ruggiero and the global elite: `To those who wish to dominate the
world, the world replies, `Let them eat humble pie.'''
	   The WTO drew the ire of environmental groups two weeks ago by
ruling that the United States cannot force shrimp-exporting
countries to fit their fleets with dlrs 75 devices that protect the
turtles.
	   The World Wildlife Fund called the ruling a blow to turtles
``and against the development of international norms and
practices.'' Other groups also denounced the decision.
	   However, the ruling upheld countries' right to introduce laws to
protect exhaustible natural resources.
	   In his speech Friday Ruggiero said the decision ``strongly
reinforces the growing need to negotiate global environmental rules
and standards, and to reach a global consensus about environmental
issues.''
	   The ruling was against a U.S. law forbidding the importation of
shrimp caught with trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered
species of sea turtles.
	   India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand have refused to put the
devices on their nets. Unequipped nets are blamed for killing
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.

Greek culture minister: legal fight not over for Archimedes text
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A manuscript expert at Christie's auction
house expressed shock Friday at Greece's ``bungled'' attempt to win
the bidding for a rare copy of writings by the ancient Greek
scholar Archimedes.
	   A London bookseller representing an anonymous American collector
outbid a Greek diplomatic envoy to purchase the 174-leaf manuscript
Thursday for dlrs 2 million in New York. With the auction house
fees, the final price reached above dlrs 2.2 million.
	   The loss was a stinging defeat for Greek officials, who had
insisted that Athens was the rightful place for the 1,000-year-old
manuscript.
	   ``They let a diplomat bid. They didn't even handle it
professionally at all,'' Felix de Marez Oyens, head of the auction
house's Books and Manuscripts Department, told The Associated
Press.
	   ``The whole thing's been bungled from beginning to end. ... And
you can tell them that from me with my compliments,'' he added.
	   De Marez Oyens contended the Greek government would have had a
better chance of success had it hired a professional to handle its
bidding.
	   Greece's consul general in New York, Haris Manesis, had to bow
out of the auction with a top bid of dlrs 1.9 million. He had been
given a ceiling of dlrs 2 million by the Greek Culture Ministry,
which had appealed to Greek businesses and foundations to
contribute to a fund to compete in the auction.
	   Manesis frequently asked for more time during the bidding, de
Marez Oyens said. ``And the auctioneer gave him a lot of time to
make up his mind,'' he noted.
	   The manuscript, known as the Archimedes Palimpsest, contains
notes and calculations for two of the most famous theories by the
third-century B.C. mathematician and inventor: ``On Floating
Bodies'' and ``Method of Mechanical Theorems.''
	   A palimpsest is a manuscript whose pages have been written on
twice. When writing materials were in short supply, the original
text would be washed away when no longer deemed useful. But parts
of the copy of the Archimedes writing is legible.
	   The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem has claimed the
manuscript was stolen from its Metohion Library in Constantinople _
now Istanbul _ after World War I, when the collection was
transferred to Athens.
	   In a last-minute move, the Patriarchate began legal action to
block the auction. A federal court judge refused, saying the seller
_ a French family _ had clear title to sell the manuscript.
	   But the clerics will pursue claims in U.S. courts, Greece's
culture minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said Friday.
	   The manuscript's new owner has said he will make it available
for study, de Marez Oyens noted.
	   ``I would have been delighted if the Greek government had been
successful in buying it,'' he said. ``But I'm sure that with the
present owner, the manuscript will be better studied and more
available than if the Greek government had bought it. Because the
Metohion Library (collection) is not at all accessible.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's ailing president, Boris Yeltsin, is
expected to formally give away some of his vast powers next year,
and has agreed to rewrite the constitution, aides said Friday.
	   That might seem to create an opening for Russia to create a true
parliamentary democracy _ but appears more likely to lead to
another round of political mudwrestling.
	   Yeltsin effectively designed the 1993 constitution for himself,
putting the president in a position to call all the shots, and
giving little real power to parliament or the prime minister.
	   The situation has held for years. But Yeltsin's recent
illnesses, the retreat from public view since an economic crisis
hit in mid-August, and a clear transfer of the reins to Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov have prompted speculation that things
might be ripe for change.
	   Yeltsin arrived Friday at the Black Sea resort of Sochi for a
doctor-ordered vacation. He had been in a rest home outside Moscow,
recuperating from what his doctors described as extreme fatigue and
unstable blood pressure.
	   As he left Moscow, the 67-year-old president was seen on
television walking stiffly across a tarmac to a waiting airplane
and waving from the door with his wife, Naina.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, acknowledged
earlier this week that the president had turned control over the
economy to Primakov.
	   On Friday, Sysuyev went a step further, saying that the
president would formally announce his reduced political role in a
speech to parliament early next year.
	   ``The political situation in Russia has changed,'' Sysuyev was
quoted as saying by the Financial Times of London. ``In the past,
the president engaged in every aspect of running the country.''
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a potential top presidential
contender whose long-term interests might be served by a strong
presidency, nevertheless called for amendments to restrict the
president's power, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin has agreed to have an expert panel consider changes to
the constitution, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   That does not necessarily mean there will be major changes,
however. Parliament, the prime minister and Yeltsin have divergent
views on what changes should be made, and each can interfere enough
in the procedure of amending the constitution to disrupt it.
	   ``The wishes to change something are obvious, but they do not at
all coincide, and often contradict one another,'' said Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst for the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
	   ``Each of the political players wants to change the constitution
in his favor, and nobody wants to do it in the favor of others, and
certainly doesn't want to give up what they have now,'' he said.
	   One question that a constitutional panel might discuss is the
restoration of the vice presidency in Russia _ something that many
prominent politicians have called for.
	   The position was abolished in 1993, after the last vice
president, Alexander Rutskoi, led a rebellion against Yeltsin. The
revolt failed, Rutskoi was jailed, and a new constitution was
written.
	   Both Yakushkin and Sysuyev insisted that Yeltsin will not allow
amendments restricting his powers.
	   ``Amendments damaging the fundamentals of the state structure
... or changing the nature of a presidential republic will not be
passed,'' Yakushkin was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   Sysuyev was equally adamant. ``Any redistribution of the
constitutional powers of the president is out of question today,''
he said.
	   The process of changing the constitution is a long and
complicated one, requiring approval by local parliaments in
two-thirds of Russian regions. A referendum may also be called.
	   ``The year and a half remaining for Yeltsin as president are
rather safe, because the process of changing the constitution _
without violating the current one _ would hardly be shorter than
that year and a half,'' Petrov said.

Serbian judges protest media law, clampdown continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An independent union of judges
joined the protest against Serbia's restrictive media law Friday,
calling it unconstitutional and ``reminiscent of times of violence
and lawlessness.''
	   Some 600 judges from across Serbia demanded the law be amended
to leave out ``unconstitutional provisions,'' such as a ban on
foreign media broadcasts, they said in a statement carried by Beta
news agency.
	   The Serbian parliament passed the notorious law earlier this
month, amid anti-Western sentiment fueled by NATO threats to launch
airstrikes to end the crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
secessionists have been battling Serb security forces.
	   In their statement, the judges said ``the first step in
implementing the new law is frightening ... and reminiscent of the
times of violence and lawlessness.'' They criticized the law as
stripping the media of the possibility of legal protection from the
government.
	   The law has drawn criticism at home and abroad, because it
restricts press freedom by threatening huge fines for reporting
deemed ``anti-state'' by the government.
	   Despite mounting criticism, the government continued its
clampdown Friday, ordering a leading independent radio station to
stop broadcasting programs from a banned station, Radio Index.
	   B 92 radio has been sending hour-long Radio Index programs over
its airwaves since the latter was banned earlier this month for
broadcasting without a license that the government had refused to
issue it. The station's editor in chief, Nenad Cekic, faces
criminal charges.
	   Veran Matic, head of B 92 radio said broadcasting of the
disputed program would continue Saturday.
	   Last week the government fined a Belgrade weekly dlrs 246,000
for alleged anti-state reporting and police raided the its offices
and confiscated equipment.
	   The independent association of judges was formed during 1996
anti-government protests in Serbia over an attempt by the
authorities to annul an opposition election victory through court
rulings. Back then, the judges demanded an independent judicial
system in Serbia.

Hungary upbeat about improved relations with neighbors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary is upbeat about improved
relations with two neighboring countries with large ethnic
Hungarian populations, Hungary's foreign minister said Friday.
	   ``We welcome the formation of the new Slovak coalition
government,'' Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi told
reporters, adding he hoped to meet his new counterpart as early as
next week.
	   Martonyi spoke after three hours of talks with another
``neighbor,'' Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu, who traveled
to Budapest for a brief, non-official visit.
	   ``Our message to our countries, to our region, to Europe and the
world is that Hungarian-Romanian relations will continue to
develop,'' Martonyi said.
	   He also pledged Hungary's support of Romania's endeavors to join
NATO and the European Union, and willingness to lobby Western
European capitals to lift visa requirements for Romanian citizens.
	   ``The past two years have shown that bilateral relations are
exemplary and this is recognized internationally,'' Plesu said.
``It is our duty to continue this success story. Our aim is to
establish an atmosphere between us that will allow us to discuss
the sensitive issues.''
	   The sensitive issues include the language and cultural rights of
some 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania, university-level
education in their mother-tongue, and their collective rights.
	   Romanian nationalists fear the Hungarians secretly harbor
territorial claims against Romania and see minority rights as
jeopardizing Romania's territorial integrity.
	   Although the Hungarian Democratic Union, which represents the
ethnic Hungarians in Romania, is in the Bucharest government and
holds two ministerial posts, some radical ethnic Hungarians have
criticized it for being too accommodating.
	   In Slovakia, which borders Hungary to the north, the
600,000-strong ethnic Hungarian community, is now also represented
in the government. The ethnic Hungarian party holds three
portfolios in the new Cabinet, formed Friday.
	   It is Hungary's interest to see both its neighbors gain
membership to the EU and NATO.

Ambassador: U.S. to replace aid to Armenia with development
</HEADLINE>
programs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The United States will be cutting
humanitarian aid to Armenia during the next few years and replacing
it with development programs, the new U.S. ambassador said Friday.
	   ``The U.S. vision is to see a secure, democratic, prosperous
Armenia,'' Ambassador Michael Lemmon told reporters in Armenia's
capital, Yerevan.
	   Armenia has received dlrs 1 billion from the United States since
1992. The share of development programs has increased from 7
percent in 1992 to 57 percent this year.
	   The share is to grow further, gradually phasing out aid
programs, Lemmon said.
	   About 45 U.S. companies are actively working in Armenia, and
major investment programs include hotel business, oil exploration
and gold mining and processing.
	   ``Armenia must develop relations with all its neighbors,
including Turkey. The U.S. contribution is to encourage Armenia and
Turkey to heal old wounds,'' he added.
	   Turkey has imposed a trade embargo on Armenia because of its
conflict with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
Azerbaijan has very close ethnic and cultural ties with Turkey.
	   Lemmon also said the embassy in Yerevan will beef up security,
and even build a concrete wall around the building _ in line with
government recommendations issued after the Aug. 17 bombing of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The number of threats to U.S. embassies around the world has
risen dramatically since the bombings, and many have tightened
their security.
	   The two African blasts killed 224 people, including 12
Americans, and injured more than 5,000. The United States suspected
Islamic militants of being involved and carried out retaliatory
cruise missile attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a swift move to rescue the
imperiled land-for-peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Friday silenced his Islamic militant rivals _ at
least temporarily.
	   The charismatic Hamas founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was held
under house arrest, his phone line cut, and burly security men with
AK-47 assault rifles were posted outside his home in a Gaza City
slum. Only his wife and children were allowed to come and go.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists were arrested within a 24-hour
period. Senior figures in the group that is bent on sabotaging the
U.S.-brokered peace deal were seized and had phones disconnected.
	   Israel said the crackdown on Hamas, coming a day after a suicide
attack aimed at Israeli school children, was a positive sign, but
that Arafat needed to do more to earn the 13 percent of the West
Bank he was promised in the peace accord.
	   ``They must struggle firmly against ... the terror groups,''
said Israel's hawkish foreign minister, Ariel Sharon. ``If the
commitments are fulfilled, Israel will carry out its part.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that the Palestinian
Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas' military wing,
Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several terror attacks
and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing If Deif is not caught, there will
inevitably be more attacks that will derail the peace process,
Netanyahu said.

Iran's leader heaps insults on Arafat for deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced
Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful ... traitor,'' heaping on the
Palestinian leader some of the worst insults he has faced for
signing a peace accord with Israel.
	   ``He is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply
immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah
Khamenei said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University.
	   Khamenei was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no
surrender, combat Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of
worshipers hearing him.
	   Most top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami,
Cabinet ministers, Parliament members and military officers were
present.
	   The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in
the capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed
intensive media campaigns encouraging people to take part.
	   Although the gist of Khamenei's speech reflected Iran's
longstanding opposition to any Palestinian peace with Israel, the
sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric.
	   Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless
and is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian
resistance, let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said.
	   Arafat signed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Oct. 23, promising to crack down on Islamic militants
in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent of
West Bank.
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations.
	   In Damascus, Syria, on Friday, the leader of the Lebanese
militant group, Hezbollah, said the accord liquidated Palestinian
rights.
	   ``Arafat is an agent of Israel and the United States,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah told a rally in a Palestinian refugee camp on the
outskirts of the city.

	   A Dinosaur Named Christopher
	   ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) _ An 8-year-old boy has the
distinction of having a dinosaur named after him. And not just any
dinosaur.
	   The creature _ dubbed Zuniceratops christopheri _ is believed to
be the oldest horned dinosaur ever found, some 90 million years
old.
	   The first of its fossils were discovered Nov. 11, 1996, in
western New Mexico by Christopher Wolfe of Phoenix and his dad,
paleontologist Doug Wolfe. Chris found the first piece.
	   With Thursday's publication of a paper in the bulletin of the
New Mexico Museum of Natural History, the name became official.
	   ``It's exciting _ definitely real exciting,'' said Chris, a
third-grader who someday wants to explore other planets for
fossils.
	   Chris recalls the discovery as if it were yesterday.
	   ``My mom stopped to rest at the bottom of the hill, and we went
up the hill. I found a piece of the horn, then my dad found a piece
and I found another piece,'' Chris said in a telephone interview
from Phoenix.
	   He was attracted, he said, ``by the color _ blackish purple, a
little bit shiny.''
	   The fossilized fragments were from the small horn that protects
the creature's eye. The plant-eating dinosaur also was marked by a
``frill,'' a shield that swept back from its neck, like that of a
Triceratops.
	   Besides the horn and the brow itself, Christopher and his
father, an adjunct curator at the Mesa (Arizona) Southwest Museum,
found jaw parts, the brain case, teeth and other fossils.
	   Jim Kirkland, a paleontologist from Fruita, Colorado, theorizes
the three-horned Zuniceratops was 10 feet (3 meters) to 12 feet (4
meters) long, maybe 500 pounds (225 kilograms) and lived 90 million
to 92 million years ago.
	   Christopher is sure he will be a paleontologist like his dad.
	   ``Most likely I'll be doing it in space,'' he said. ``I'll be
going to other planets and seeing if they have fossils.''
	   His mom, Hazel Wolfe, doesn't rule it out.
	   ``It's certainly a possibility,'' she said. ``Hopefully he'll be
able to do some of it here, because I'd hate to send him off like
that.''

Papandreou joins call for opposition to take part in constitution
</HEADLINE>
referendum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Greece joined international calls Friday
for Albania's political opposition to take part in a Nov. 22
referendum on a new constitution.
	   ``The opposition has chosen the road of isolation,'' Greek
Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou told reporters
following an international conference on how to help Albania
achieve economic and political stability.
	   ``The boycott will and should not stop the process of the
democratization and development of Albania,'' he said.
	   Opposition leader, ex-President Sali Berisha, has called on his
Democratic Party followers to boycott the referendum, as they have
done with parliament since last year.
	   At the conference, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo called
on all Albanians to vote for the draft constitution since ``it
doesn't belong to the Socialists or the Democrats but to Albania
and to Albanians.''

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of
the World Trade Organization with cream pies, an official said.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech in
London in which he defended a WTO decision overturning a U.S.
attempt to protect endangered sea turtles from shrimp fishermen.
	   Ruggiero released a one-sentence comment through his Geneva
headquarters, saying, ``When they have no more rational arguments,
the fringe elements have to use cake.''
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side,
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year.
	   Rockwell said someone from the group approached Ruggiero with
what appeared to be a present, ``but I told him to get out of the
way.''
	   ``Then one guy shoved the pie hard into his face and another
brought a second down on top of his head,'' accusing him of being a
turtle-killer, Rockwell said.
	   But he said Ruggiero, who had received heavy bodyguard
protection when he was trade minister in Italy in the 1980s, was
``extraordinarily calm.''
	   ``The first thing he said was, `This is not a bad cake!'''
Rockwell told The Associated Press, but he said he didn't know what
the flavor was.
	   Rockwell, who said there were no police or other guards present
when the attack occurred, led Ruggiero back into Chatham House
where he had given the speech and wiped the cream off his suit and
face.
	   A group calling itself the Biotic Baking Brigade later issued a
statement saying its pie throwers sent ``a sticky message to
Ruggiero and the global elite: `To those who wish to dominate the
world, the world replies, `Let them eat humble pie.'''
	   The WTO drew the ire of environmental groups two weeks ago by
ruling that the United States cannot force shrimp-exporting
countries to fit their fleets with dlrs 75 devices that protect the
turtles.
	   The World Wildlife Fund called the ruling a blow to turtles
``and against the development of international norms and
practices.'' Other groups also denounced the decision.
	   However, the ruling upheld countries' right to introduce laws to
protect exhaustible natural resources.
	   In his speech Friday Ruggiero said the decision ``strongly
reinforces the growing need to negotiate global environmental rules
and standards, and to reach a global consensus about environmental
issues.''
	   The ruling was against a U.S. law forbidding the importation of
shrimp caught with trawling nets and equipment that harm endangered
species of sea turtles.
	   India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand have refused to put the
devices on their nets. Unequipped nets are blamed for killing
150,000 turtles a year worldwide.

Maturana wanted for questioning in drug corruption case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Prosecutors are asking former Colombian
national team coach Francisco Maturana to explain 10 checks he
received from a jailed Cali drug cartel kingpin.
	   Maturana, who just took charge of Costa Rica's national team and
recently coached the Ecuadorean national side, is not charged with
any crime but is being investigated for possible ``illicit
enrichment'', a spokesman for the chief prosecutor's office said.
	   Illicit enrichment is essentially obtaining income or assets
that one cannot prove came from legitimate sources.
	   Prosecutors have not specified the value of the 10 checks in
question, and Maturana could not immediately be located for
comment.
	   A highly respected name in international soccer, Maturana
coached the Cali club America in 1992, when he received the checks
from Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.
	   Although he did not carry the title of president of America,
Rodriguez owned and ran the club, Maturana acknowledged in a 1997
British television documentary.
	   ``He made the decisions about what player to buy or sell,''
Maturana said. ``When someone didn't get paid, they needed to get
in touch with Miguel because he was paying us.''
	   Prosecutors last week detained for questioning Maturana's former
assistant at America, Pedro Sarmiento, who they say received checks
worth 1.15 billion pesos (dlrs 1.5 million) between 1990 and 1993
from Rodriguez to distribute, as bonuses, to the club's best
players and to Maturana.
	   Two reporters, Vicente Blanco and Esteban Jaramillo also were
arrested for allegedly receiving cartel payments.
	   Prosecutors say they are now in phase two of Case 8,000 _ a
broad investigation of drug corruption in Colombian politics,
entertainment and sports that already has led to the convictions of
more than 20 former lawmakers and senior government officials.
	   The best known defendant in the case was former President
Ernesto Samper, who was absolved by a highly partisan congress in
1996 of charges he solicited dlrs 6 million in Cali cartel campaign
contributions.
	   Maturana coached Colombia's national team in the 1990 and 1994
World Cups and also coached Atletico Madrid and Real Valladolid in
the Spanish league in 1993-94.
	   Miguel Rodriguez and his brother Gilberto, who ran the Cali
cartel, were captured in 1995 and later convicted of drug
trafficking.

 &UR; South Africa defeats Sri Lanka by 92 runs &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sri Lankan batting and South Arican victory. No
pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By CHANDRA BANNERJEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ World champions Sri Lanka bowed out of
the Wills International Cup loosing to South Africa by a huge 92
runs in the Bangabandhu national stadium Friday.
	   The match, which was shortened to 39 runs because of rains was
curtailed further to 34 runs because it began to drizzle as soon as
the Sri Lankans began their innings.
	   Set a target of 224 runs in 34 overs by South Africa, Sri Lanka
could manage only 132 for nine in 23.4 overs. Muthiah Muralitharan,
who hurt his shoulder while fielding, did not bat.
	   Sri Lanka was forced to play through a steady drizzle but, as
skipper Ranatunga said after the match, the South Africans played
better cricket than his team.
	   With South African bowlers maintaining a steady line and length,
and captain Cronje making good fielding placements, it was easy to
knock the Lankan's out.
	   Earlier in the day, South Africa rode a superb unbeaten 113 by
Jacques Kallis to pile up a commanding 240 runs for seven wickets.
South Africa did loose the early wicket of Mike Rindel, but with
Daryll Cullinan making the ones and twos, and Nicky Boje hitting
freely, the runs came fast.
	   The field restrictions were limited to 13 overs and South Africa
succeeded in scoring quickly within this period with Boje hitting
three fours to score 28 off 23 balls.
	   The South African acceleration did not suffer despite Boucher's
dismissal at zero. Kallis came in and immediately began hitting the
ball fearlessly.
	   The Sri Lankan spinners were given harsh treatment by the South
Africans and even the crafty Muralitharan was hit freely with
disdain. Kallis blasted three sixes in his first 50 that came in 51
balls.
	   His batting improved with every delivery and his third one day
century was made in just 91 balls _ the tournament's fastest _ and
was laced with five sixes and four fours.
	   Skipper Hansie Cronje played a brisk knock of 20 off 30 balls
and Pat Symcox kept the scoreboard ticking with his quick 11.
Benkenstien remained unbeaten on 18.
	   On Saturday, India will play West Indies in the second
semifinal. The winner will play South Africa in the finals.

Libya says U.N. sanctions were renewed due to US-UK pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya's official media accused the U.N.
Security Council on Friday of renewing an air embargo under
pressure from the United States and Britain.
	   The council's vote Thursday to maintain sanctions imposed over
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was a setback for Libya, which has
been pushing to have the embargo lifted.
	   The council reiterated that the sanctions would be suspended
only after Libya hands over two men who have been indicted in the
case. The airliner blew up in mid-air over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, killing 270 people.
	   ``The renewal of these unjust sanctions once again betrays the
pressure which the Security Council is being subjected to by
certain countries, especially the U.S. and Britain, which are using
the council for specific political objectives,'' Libya's state-run
radio said.
	   The sanctions, which have been renewed periodically since 1992,
were imposed to force Libya to surrender the suspects. They ban air
travel to and from Libya, prohibit arms sales, freeze some assets
abroad and limit the sale of oil equipment.
	   In July, the Security Council backed a U.S.-British plan for the
two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail.

U.N. agencies and World Bank join forces to fight malaria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In a unique partnership in the
international health field, three U.N. agencies and the World Bank
launched a campaign Friday to fight malaria, which afflicts up to
500 million people a year and kills more than 1 million.
	   ``It's a major killer and it's a major burden to the developing
world broadly,'' said Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, director-general
of the World Health Organization. ``It's above all a disease of the
poor, killing the young and the weak, mostly living in the area of
sub-Saharan Africa.''
	   The campaign, ``Roll Back Malaria,'' will try to control the
disease by ensuring that sufferers have access to early and
effective treatment and that children, who are especially
vulnerable, are given insecticide-treated mosquito nets. It will
also try to strengthen local health care.
	   ``It's not going in with medicine and then moving out after some
time. We need a sustained effort,'' Brundtland said. ``We need to
be able to reach a child with fever within hours with simple, and
not expensive, medication. The problem is it is not there today in
many homes and local communities in Africa.''
	   The campaign will initially focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where
three-quarters of all malaria cases and over 90 percent of the
deaths occur.
	   It will grow to include other regions where malaria is
prevalent: Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea and the
Pacific islands, countries along the Amazon River in South America,
and newly independent states of the former Soviet Union including
Tajikistan, Armenia and southern Russia.
	   Dr. Tore Godal, the current project director, said the campaign
needs dlrs 30 million in Africa next year. That's expected to come
primarily from the agencies and the World Bank.
	   By linking the resources of WHO, UNICEF, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Bank with efforts by the private sector,
voluntary organizations and the scientific community, Brundtland
said she is confident that the number of malaria cases and deaths
can be reduced significantly.
	   If the number of deaths can be cut in half, she said, ``It's a
major success story.''
	   Brundtland called the campaign ``a pathfinder'' because it is
bringing together the entire international community on a key
health issue.
	   ``Nothing like it has ever happened in the U.N. system before in
the international health field,'' said Dr. David Nabarro, who will
become project manager for the campaign in January.
	   What makes it unique, he said, is that the U.N. agencies have
agreed to work toward a common goal without attempting to control
parts of the agenda themselves.
	   ``And we see this as a pathfinder for international cooperation
in the future,'' said Nabarro, currently chief of health in
Britain's Department for International Development.
	   In a message of support, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said:
``It is, above all, the countries and communities themselves that
will need to mobilize in order to Roll Back Malaria.''
	   The World Bank has made a commitment to increase its investment
in malaria control and research and mobilize additional funding for
the campaign.
	   But World Bank President James Wolfensohn said, ``Funding is
less of an issue than is getting the priority of the governments in
terms of their desire to focus on malaria.''
	   Brundtland said the long-term goal must be the development of a
vaccine.
	   Research has been stymied, however, because pharmaceutical
companies don't see a malaria vaccine as a moneymaker. Only one
company, SmithKline Beecham, is doing research and currently
testing a malaria vaccine.
	   To spur malaria research, Godal said Brundtland has pledged dlrs
3.5 million from the campaign to kick off an initiative in which
the private sector will provide research facilities and expertise
and the public sector will provide the money.

Small glimmers of hope on Russian economic front
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES thruout with talks with Western creditors,
Cabinet to meet on economy Saturday, IMF talks fail to reach
agreement, deal expected on U.S. food aid. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ There were rare glimmers of progress Friday in
Russia's economic crisis. Tax collections rose, a deal with Western
creditors appeared imminent and the Cabinet said it was finally
ready to tackle a plan to end the crisis.
	   None of the developments suggested that Russia has turned a
corner toward prosperity, but they were among the first signs of
forward movement in weeks.
	   In one setback, the International Monetary Fund said it had
failed to reach an agreement with the Russian government that could
lead to a resumption of financial aid.
	   The major piece of good news came from tax chief Gregory Boos,
who said the government had hauled in one-third more taxes in
October than in September, a surprising turnaround in a country
where taxpaying has been regarded as a strictly optional exercise.
	   He said Russians have paid 13 billion rubles (dlrs 812 million)
in taxes so far this month, up from 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 581
million) in September.
	   Boos said that was well over his October target of 9.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 593 million).
	   Another top government official, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov, said Russia had come to ``mutually acceptable'' terms
with holders of the country's defaulted treasury debt.
	   The two sides have been meeting in London, and Kasyanov said he
expected a final agreement next week, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   If the two sides don't reach a deal before Nov. 17, when
Russia's three-month debt moratorium is lifted, foreign banks will
likely launch a rash of lawsuits to freeze the accounts of Russian
banks abroad.
	   Russia defaulted on its treasury bonds and declared a debt
moratorium on private debt payments on Aug. 17.
	   That sent the economy into a nosedive from which it has not
recovered, and prompted President Boris Yeltsin to fire Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and his government, appointing Yevgeny
Primakov in his place.
	   Primakov has been in office nearly two months, and there has
been mounting criticism of his government for failing to enact a
plan to pull the country out of crisis. But news agencies said the
Cabinet would meet Saturday to consider such a plan.
	   The draft program contains measures to stabilize the financial
system and prop up the ruble, ITAR-Tass reported. It would
restructure the country's banking system, reschedule state debt,
streamline the budget system, restore production and improve tax
collection.
	   The IMF has demanded that the government come up with an
acceptable plan before it would consider a resumption in financial
aid. But on Friday, the lending agency said it had failed to reach
an agreement with Russia that would lead to a resumption.
	   In a statement issued after the talks, the IMF set no date for
new negotiations. It said the two sides made progress in talks, but
the government hadn't yet made up its mind on key issues such as
its budget for 1999.
	   ``While there was a common view on the desirable objectives for
economic policy through the end of next year, the necessary policy
measures are still under consideration in important areas,'' the
statement said.
	   Also Friday, Russian government officials began a second round
of talks with a U.S. government delegation to discuss the
possibility of U.S. food aid to Russia this winter.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said a preliminary agreement
is expected Monday. He said he anticipated that Russia would be
receiving small quantities of humanitarian food aid, coupled with
credits for the purchase of American meat and grain.

South Africa begins pulling troops from Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The situation in Lesotho had
normalised to such an extent that South Africa is reducing its
troops strength in the mountain kingdom, Defense Minister Joe
Modise announced Friday.
	   South Africa sent in its forces on Sept. 22 to quell an army
mutiny and a series of strikes in Lesotho. The unrest was linked to
elections last May which the ruling party won by a landslide but
which the opposition claimed were rigged.
	   An accord mediated by South Africa between the government and
opposition parties calls for new elections to be held within 18
months.
	   The number of South African troops in Lesotho, a Belgium-sized
nation of 2 million which is surrounded by South Africa, would be
reduced from 3,500 to 2,100, Modise said.

Muslim militant extradited to France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany this week extradited to France a suspected
Muslim militant arrested last spring during a sweep of Islamic
extremists ahead of the World Cup soccer championship, judicial
sources said Friday.
	   The sources said that Adel Mechat, suspected of being an aide to
a leading Islamic insurgent in Algeria, was brought to France on
Wednesday, according to the sources. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Mechat was among 88 people arrested in May 26 sweeps in Germany,
France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy.
	   The sweeps were based on what French authorities said was
evidence of possible plans to mount terrorist attacks during the
month-long World Cup, which began June 10. French authorities later
made clear the sweeps were ``preventative.''
	   Authorities suspect Mechat and a man detained in France,
Abdallah Kinai, of being top European lieutenants of a leading
Algerian insurgent.
	   Hassan Hattab has positioned himself as a rival for the
leadership post in the Armed Islamic Group, the most radical
insurgency group trying to topple Algeria's military-backed
government since 1992.
	   The London-based Islamic Observation Center issued a statement
Friday denounces the decision by German authorities to hand over
Mechat as a ``grave (human rights) violation'' because he had
allegedly applied for political asylum there.
	   The group which acts as a watchdog on behalf of Muslims also
called on human rights organizations to ensure that France ``does
not torture'' Mechat or hand him over to the Algerians and
guarantees him a fair trial.

Armenian opposition rallies against rigged privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ More than 15,000 people gathered for a
nationalist opposition rally in Armenia's capital Friday to demand
an investigation into past privatization sales in this former
Soviet republic.
	   ``We want to know who bought our plants, and for how much, and
why the plants are not operating now,'' said Ruben Akopian, a
member of the nationalist Dashnak party that organized the rally.
	   As in most other former Soviet republics, privatization sales of
state property in Armenia are widely believed to have been rigged
to enrich a few insiders.
	   Many factories have gone idle since the Soviet collapse, but the
situation in Armenia is among the worst, with unemployment as high
as 20 percent.
	   Akopian _ a lawmaker and the only representative in parliament
of the Dashnak party, which was banned until earlier this year _
demanded that a special commission be set up to investigate
disputes over the privatization program.
	   Rally participants also demanded an increase in allowances to
low-income families.
	   Dashnak is Armenia's oldest political group, founded as a secret
organization in 1890 to fight for a united, independent Armenia.
Former President Levon Ter-Petrosian suspended the party in 1994
and the Armenian Supreme Court banned it in January 1995.

Spanish court upholds legal basis for bid to extradite Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge seeking to try former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on charges of genocide got what
amounts to a green light from the National Court on Friday.
	   After five hours of deliberations, 11 judges at Spain's highest
criminal court ruled unanimously that Spain has jurisdiction to
investigate and prosecute crimes committed by military
dictatorships in Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The ruling upheld the legal basis for Judge Baltasar Garzon to
continue probes into genocide, terrorism and torture he says were
committed under Pinochet's regime between 1973-90.
	   The panel's decision was greeted with whoops of joy from human
rights lawyers and relatives of junta victims who had gathered
inside and outside the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina,'' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing families
of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view, it's a landmark
decision.''
	   For more than two years Garzon and a colleague, Manuel Garcia
Castellon, have been probing human rights crimes in Argentina and
Chile.
	   They began probing the cases of missing or dead Spaniards but
broadened the investigations to include atrocities committed
against thousands of people of several nationalities.
	   As a spin-off from his probe, Garzon issued an international
warrant that led to Pinochet's arrest on Oct. 16 in London as he
recovered from back surgery. So far Garzon has accused Pinochet of
94 killings or disappearances, mainly Chileans, but says he may
expand the charges.
	   The National Court ruling Friday was in response to appeals
filed in May by prosecutors at the same court who said Garzon
lacked jurisdiction to probe crimes committed outside Spain.
	   But the court, without mentioning the Pinochet affair, sided
with Garzon in rejecting those appeals. One of the judges, Carlos
Cezon, announced the ruling but did not explain the reasons behind
it. He said a full text would be published next week.
	   In the past Garzon has argued that he can go after Pinochet on
grounds that the ex-dictator is guilty of genocide because he
allegedly tried to wipe out an entire group of people -- his
political opponents.
	   Under Spanish law, Spanish courts can prosecute genocide no
matter where it is committed.
	   In the arrest warrant against Pinochet, Garzon also accuses him
of terrorism and torture.
	   Although the ruling was a victory for Garzon, he may still fail
to see Pinochet stand trial in Spain.
	   England's High Court on Wednesday threw out Pinochet's arrest on
grounds that he was head of state at the time the crimes he is
accused of were committed.
	   An appeal is to be heard next week before a five-judge panel of
the House of Lords, Britain's highest court. If it refuses to
reinstate the arrest warrant, any extradition request from Spain
would be in vain.
	   On Friday, a judge in London granted Pinochet bail, although he
will remain under police guard in a hospital.
	   In any case, the next step for Garzon is to file a formal
extradition request. It must be approved by the Spanish government
and then passed on the British, who have the final say.
	   Virginia Diez, a human rights lawyer, said Garzon would file
next week.
	   The center-right government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar,
eager to protect lucrative trade ties with Chile and Argentina, has
frowned on Garzon's probe. But officials have indicated that if he
filed an extradition request, the government would pass it on to
Britain.
	   After Friday's ruling government spokesman Josep Pique said only
that the government respected judicial decisions and would deal
``scrupulously'' with any extradition request.
	   He also said Aznar would travel Monday to London to meet with
Prime Minister Tony Blair but insisted the Pinochet case was not on
their agenda. Their talks will focus on European issues, Pique
said.
	   Pinochet seized power in 1973 and ruled for 17 years, during
which 3,197 political opponents died or disappeared, according to a
Chilean government report released in 1991.
	   The Spanish probes of Chile and Argentina intersect because
Pinochet is accused of taking part in Operation Condor, in which
several military juntas in South America teamed up in the 1970s and
1980s to crush what they perceived as a communist threat.

Crew acquitted on charges of transporting illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHANIA, Greece (AP) _ A court in this port city of the island of
Crete on Friday acquitted the two crew members of a fishing boat
that transported 275 Iraqi Kurds.
	   The court accepted that Mustafa al Abdul Fatah, the ship's
46-year-old Libyan captain, and Mohammed el Hamsa, 28, a Syrian,
had picked up the immigrants from a drifting boat without a crew.
	   Five immigrants who testified at the trial backed up their
story. They did not say how their boat was left crewless.
	   Both had been arrested Wednesday when port authorities stopped
the Lebanese-flagged Santa Maria. The illegal immigrants, including
about 130 children, were huddled on board the 19-meter (62-foot)
wooden vessel.
	   The immigrants are being temporarily housed in a Chania hotel.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants try to reach Greece each
year from Turkey and the Middle East.

	   NETIVOT, Israel (AP) _ Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
showed the Arab world a different side of himself Friday.
	   The ex-general who engineered Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon
hosted Mauritanian Foreign Minister Sheik El-Afia Wil'd Mohammed
Khouna at his sheep ranch in the southern Negev Desert.
	   In the homey surroundings of Shimkim Farm, the war hero with a
deep distrust of the Arabs spoke about Israel's desire to improve
relations with Mauritania as an Arab and Muslim country.
	   Sharon and Khouna sat in matching, cozy beige armchairs in front
of a living room fireplace. Surrounded by house plants and
knickknacks, they fielded questions about the latest peace deal.
	   Khouna congratulated Israel for reaching an agreement with the
Palestinians at Wye Plantation in Maryland last week and said he
hoped it would be implemented on time.
	   ``Both sides should respect the accords they have signed,''
Khouna said to reporters.
	   Khouna and Israel have tied his visit to the agreement. The
North African country established low-level relations in 1995, but
relations froze with the stalemate in the peace process.
	   ``Israel being a small country is very much interested in
developing relations with other countries, mainly with countries
that can influence events in the Middle East,'' Sharon said,
looking at ease in a black jacket and a white shirt open at the
neck.
	   After their one-hour meeting, Sharon escorted Khouna outside the
two-story white adobe house where he has been convalescing from a
bout with the flu. They exchanged smiles and a long handshake.
	   With his 13-month-old grandson, Rotem, nestled against his right
side, Sharon and the boy waved good-bye as the Mercedes pulled
away.
	   In the driveway, a curious Rotem watched reporters as they asked
Sharon whether he believed Israel and the Palestinians would reach
a final status agreement by May 1999, the deadline set by the 1993
Oslo peace accord.
	   ``Look, I am not going to commit myself to any date. The only
think I can tell you is that I believe that Israel will make every
effort to reach peace,'' he said.
	   ``It must be clear that everything must be based upon
reciprocity and obligations must be implemented. That is a must.''

Auto fatalities rise in Russia; 20,000 dead so far this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 20,000 people died in car accidents in
Russia during the first nine months of this year, authorities said
Friday, up nearly 4 percent from the same period last year.
	   An Interior Ministry spokesman, Alexander Peshkov, blamed the
situation largely on a sharp increase in auto ownership, putting
not only more cars on the road but legions of inexperienced
drivers.
	   Until recently, very few Russians owned cars. Now, there are 200
cars for every 1,000 people in Russia, according to Peshkov, with
the numbers growing rapidly every day.
	   There were 117,749 accidents during the first nine months of the
year. In addition to the 20,500 fatalities, there were 133,000
people injured, the Interior Ministry said.
	   There were 41,967 auto deaths last year in the United States,
which has many times the number of cars and drivers.

Former president Joaquin Balaguer called to testify at
</HEADLINE>
assassination trial &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSE P. MONEGRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Former president
Joaquin Balaguer is among more than 100 witnesses called to testify
at the trial of six former military officers accused of a
23-year-old political assassination.
	   The defendants are accused of killing journalist Orlando
Martinez in 1975. Martinez was a strong critic of then-president
Balaguer and the military leadership, accusing them of frequent
human rights violations.
	   The investigation languished for years until 1997, when current
President Leonel Fernandez ordered prosecutors to bring the case to
trial.
	   ``We must pass judgment above all on these important cases that
are still pending, because the people must know that no crime can
go unpunished,'' said Francisco Dominguez Brito, prosecutor for the
Federal District in the Caribbean country.
	   Among those charged is former Gen. Salvador Lluberes Montas, who
was Chief of the Dominican Armed Forces at the time of the
assassination. The trial is expected to begin Thursday.
	   Balaguer, who was president for 22 years over the past three
decades, wrote a book in which he left one page blank. That page
was left for what he called the true story about Martinez's death
and would be revealed after Balaguer died.
	   Balaguer, 92, infirm, and legally blind, was re-elected to a
four-year term in 1994, but left office in 1996 under international
pressure because of widespread evidence of fraud in his 1994
election victory.

Perth turned on the lights and took to the streets early Saturday
to send a greeting to astronaut John Glenn as he passed overhead
for the second time in 36 years.
	   People switched on their lights at home, businesses lit up
office towers and sports clubs shone spotlights in an effort to
recreate the view that Glenn saw 36 years ago as his spacecraft
passed over Australia.
	   He, and they, were not disappointed. At 12:50 a.m. local time
(1650 GMT), a cheer went up among the crowd in King's park,
overlooking Perth, as Glenn's voice was broadcast from the space
shuttle. ``I think it looks even better now than it did back
then,'' Glenn said. ``They really got them lit up tonight.
	   ``Pass along our very best to all the folks.''
	   One local radio broadcaster let out a spontaneous on-air whoop.
His colleague was awed: ``I hardly dare speak,'' she said.
	   As it did 36 years ago, Perth transformed itself into a city of
lights to greet Glenn during his historic return to space.
	   In February 1962, residents stayed up until midnight and turned
on every house light to send a welcome message to Glenn. Every
street lamp and neon sign was also lit.
	   According to Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right Stuff,'' Glenn saw
clouds part to reveal ``an absolute mass of electric lights'' in
two groups, one in Perth, the other in the town of Rockingham to
the south.
	   ``The lights show up very well,'' Glenn radioed to astronaut
Gordon Cooper, who was at a tracking station in Australia at the
time. ``Please thank everybody for turning them on, will you?''
	   Perth, a remote blip on the map on Australia's southwest coast,
has kept the title ``City of Lights'' ever since.
	   This time, Glenn's flight path took him farther north. But that
did not deter residents or the state government, which asked
everyone to turn on their lights.
	   They did, and turned out in droves in the streets, even though
they couldn't see the shuttle, even as a spark in the night sky.
	   ``It's been incredible,'' said Perth Mayor Peter Natrass. ``It's
captured the imagination of everyone in Perth.''
	   In 1962, many residents were advised to project normal household
lights on white surfaces such as sheets to create greater
luminescence. People hung sheets from their clotheslines.
	   This time, the illumination was helped by the BP Oil refinery,
which received permission from the state government's Environmental
Protection Department to light up its gas flare. Glenn flew over
Western Australia state about 850 kms (530 miles) north of Perth.
It was expected that most of the state's southwest was visible to
him.
	   Natrass said the people of Perth felt a particular affinity with
Glenn. Perth observatory astronomer Peter Birch explained the
feeling was more than just history.
	   ``The romance of having a senior citizen up there mixing it with
the young fellows, that's one thing,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``So is the tie with history. Going back
36 years when it was all done then, it put us on the map.''
	   For some, the celebrations were more low-key. Perth resident
John Glenn, 76, who in 1962 used a spotlight, bed sheets and his
clothesline to greet his namesake, this time kept it simple.
	   ``I've left the porch light on,'' Glenn told Channel Nine TV.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ About 20 environmentalists Friday hit the chief of
the World Trade Organization with cream pies, an official said.
	   WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero had just given a speech in
London in which he defended a WTO decision overturning a U.S.
attempt to protect endangered sea turtles from shrimp fishermen.
	   Ruggiero released a one-sentence comment through his Geneva
headquarters, saying, ``When they have no more rational arguments,
the fringe elements have to use cake.''
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, who was by Ruggiero's side,
expressed concern about the ``very threatening and hostile'' attack
on the 69-year-old Ruggiero, who is to step down next year.

Vieques mayor to face ethics charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUMACAO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The mayor of the island of Vieques,
which is part of Puerto Rico, will face two charges of violating
government ethics laws, a judge ruled Friday.
	   Mayor Manuela Santiago will face trial on charges that she
received dlrs 7,000 from a construction organization on the small
island to pay medical expenses. She later returned the money.
	   Santiago also faces charges that she improperly used municipal
funds to make a film documentary titled ``A Woman for History.''
The special independent prosecutor who investigated the case said
the film was used for Santiago's re-election campaign in 1996.
	   Santiago has pleaded innocent to the charges.
	   Two additional charges against her were dropped by Municipal
Judge Sonia Rebollo Trujillo. The mayor was released on dlrs 2,000
bail after the court hearing.
	   The allegations were a central issue in the 1996 election, which
Santiago won by 44 votes out of a little more than 5,000 cast.
	   If convicted, Santiago would face a prison term of up to six
years and be barred from holding office.

Pinochet granted bail by British judge, hits setback in Spain

	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet won
bail in Britain, but lost in another arena Friday: A Spanish ruling
allowed an investigation to continue into allegations of genocide,
terrorism and torture committed during his 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet was arrested by British authorities Oct. 16 on a
warrant seeking his extradition, issued by the Spanish magistrate
heading the investigation.
	   His attorneys immediately filed a petition for his release with
England's High Court, which ruled Wednesday that he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state.
	   The court added, however, that Pinochet, 82, could not leave
Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling to a five-judge
tribunal in the House of Lords, which will hear the case next week.
	   On Friday, British Judge Stephen Richards granted Pinochet's
request for bail, but decreed that he must remain at north London's
Grovelands Priory Hospital, where he is recuperating from back
surgery, and under police guard at all times.
	   It is not unusual for judges to grant bail while restricting the
person's movements, and the security measures could have been
ordered for Pinochet's protection.
	   Technically, the decision means that Pinochet, who was not in
court for the bail hearing, is no longer in custody.
	   James Lewis, the attorney representing British and Spanish
authorities, said he would not object to the granting of bail with
the conditions imposed. But he added, ``We make it plain that if
there were to be any variation, the respondents would have a
different perspective on the matter.''
	   The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, is expected to push ahead
for extradition after Spain's National Court ruled Friday that
Spain had jurisdiction over crimes committed during the military
dictatorships in Chile and Argentina.
	   Though the Spanish ruling did not specifically mention Pinochet,
the court's decision in effect gave a green light for Garzon to
continue.
	   Garzon's case puts forward that Pinochet, together with
Argentine generals, made a systematic, organized attempt to wipe
out political opponents because of their ideological beliefs and
that their actions amount to genocide, according to lawyers working
with the judge.
	   France, meanwhile, became the latest European country to open an
investigation into alleged atrocities by Pinochet committed during
his 1973-1990 dictatorship, judicial officials said.
	   Prosecutors were investigating charges by families of missing
Chileans that Pinochet was linked to their loved ones'
``sequestration followed by torture,'' the officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Santiago on Friday, the afternoon newspaper La Segunda
reported a telephone interview with Pinochet's wife, Lucia, in
which she was quoted as asking that ``pressure be made through the
governments of the world so he can be released. ... Humanitarian
reasons should take precedence over anything else.''
	   She said all Pinochet wants ``is to go home,'' and added that
his health is ``pretty bad.''

Iran's leader heaps insults on Arafat for deal with Israel

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced
Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful ... traitor,'' heaping on the
Palestinian leader some of the worst insults he has faced for
signing a peace accord with Israel.
	   ``He is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply
immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah
Khamenei said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University.
	   Khamenei was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no
surrender, combat Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of
worshipers hearing him.
	   Most top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami,
Cabinet ministers, Parliament members and military officers were
present.
	   The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in
the capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed
intensive media campaigns encouraging people to take part.
	   Although the gist of Khamenei's speech reflected Iran's
longstanding opposition to any Palestinian peace with Israel, the
sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric.
	   Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless
and is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian
resistance, let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said.
	   Arafat singed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Oct. 23, promising to crack down on Islamic militants
in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent of
West Bank.
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations.
	   In Damascus, Syria, on Friday, the leader of the Lebanese
militant group, Hezbollah, said the accord liquidated Palestinian
rights.
	   ``Arafat is an agent of Israel and the United States,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah told a rally in a Palestinian refugee camp on the
outskirts of the city.
	   Khamenei criticized the United States for brokering the
agreement, which he said only served Washington's interests.
	   ``In this agreement, Mr. Yasser Arafat is executing the orders
of the prosecutor, Israel and the judge, America. Shame on this
disgraceful man,'' he said.
	   In Gaza, a senior aide to Arafat rebuked Khamenei, saying he had
``no right to make this kind of a statement.''
	   ``The Islamic Conference at its last meeting in Iran supported
the political process between the PLO and Israel,'' Tayab Abed
Al-Rahim said in a statement. He was referring to the Organization
of the Islamic Conference which met in Tehran in December.
	   ``We call upon the Iranian leadership to stop playing games in
the Palestinian field because the (Palestinian) Authority will not
allow Khamenei or anyone else to make the Palestinian land a new
Afghanistan.''

Russian government proposing new tax system for oil industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry called Friday
for scrapping excise taxes on oil production and launching a
complex tax on surplus revenue from oil fields, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   The tax on surplus revenues was designed several years ago to
stimulate the opening of new oil deposits. The tax was to be levied
on surplus revenue after the costs of opening a new oil field were
covered.
	   Under the new plan, to take effect next year, the tax would be
levied on existing oil fields too. Oil analysts predicted that oil
companies would try to get around the tax by hiding oil field
revenues from the government.
	   As a preliminary step, the ministry proposed to slash the oil
production excise tax to 25 rubles (dlrs 1.50) per metric ton, from
55 rubles (dlrs 3) per ton now. The cut would be retroactive to
Oct. 1, Interfax reported.
	   The ministry is also pushing to scrap the excise tax on oil
refining and shift the tax burden onto consumers by launching a tax
on fuel and lubricants sales, said Abzal Nurgazief, senior oil and
gas analyst at Troika Dialog brokerage in Moscow.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Efforts to end the regular bouts of war
that plague West Africa have been hampered by fighting in
Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria's military ruler said Friday at a summit of
regional leaders, but said the opposing sides were continuing their
negotiations.
	   The five-month Guinea-Bissau civil war ``is a serious setback to
our effort aimed at bringing lasting peace to the West African
sub-region,'' Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar told leaders.
	   He added, however, that President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the
rebel leader, former army chief of staff Brig. Ansumane Mane, were
continuing negotiations Friday in Abuja.
	   On Thursday, Mane and Vieira flew to the tiny West African
nation of Gambia where they embraced before beginning their first
face-to-face talks on ending the fighting, Portuguese news reports
said. The talks continued well into Thursday night before the men
headed to Nigeria.
	   The two-day summit, of the 16-member Economic Community of West
African States, or ECOWAS, also includes top officials from Ghana,
Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Niger and
Senegal.
	   President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who attended the
Friday meetings as an observer, also warned that the crisis in
Congo threatens peace throughout the continent.
	   ``The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains a
burning ember of political instability in our region, one which
could pose a serious threat to the African continent,'' Mandela
said, calling for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of all
foreign troops.
	   Since taking up arms Aug. 2, the Congolese rebels have made
steady advances in eastern Congo but were defeated outside the
capital, Kinshasa, by President Laurent Kabila's allies from
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
	   Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them
of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Fighting began in Guinea-Bissau on June 7, with a coup attempt
in the capital, Bissau, by Mane, who accuses Vieira of corruption.
	   About half the impoverished country's population of 1 million
has been displaced by the fighting.
	   A cease-fire was declared July 26 but fighting broke out again
10 days ago.
	   The summit is also to delve into what Nigeria's planning
minister, Rasheed Gbadamosi, called ``the precarious financial
situation of the community.''
	   Membership dues for the group are about dlrs 40 million overdue.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and
injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure
Friday evening. ''The earlier information that police gave out was
wrong,'' Hand Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news
conference.
	   The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before
midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determined
as of Friday evening.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval
for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In
1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.
	   Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous
gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.
Of the injured, at least 57 were in intensive care, according to
Sven Martinell, spokesman for the local medical authorities.
	   The building did not have sprinklers and was not required to
have them, officials said.
	   The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of
immigrants. Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19
nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and
Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and
unspecified Latin American countries.
	   The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,
had in turn rented the facility out to others for the dance,
Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.
	   Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw
the fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,
including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was red
and bubbly,'' Atta said.
	   ``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at Hammarkullen
Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims
gathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. They
didn't even look down'' beforehand.
	   Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursday
and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue
workers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.
	   The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by
fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying
by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,
with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths
scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.
	   Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been
set. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a
normal fire,'' he said.
	   Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the
capital, Stockholm.
	   The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly
13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.
	   ``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave from
school and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutally
and suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensible
dimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.
	   ``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday
and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
	   Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when
the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
	   ``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It was
chaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on each
other on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows and
jumped out.''
	   Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. The
Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to
help transport the injured.
	   Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many
of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was
difficult.
	   ``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of a
friend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identification
on them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''
she said, according to TT.
	   Goteborg has about 435,000 people.

Krajicek beats Ivanisevic, Rios pulls out, Gambill too

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bjorkman advancing &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras is getting all the help
he can get in his battle to set a tennis landmark, even from his
rivals.
	   Sampras was leading 4-1 and preparing to serve when Jan-Michael
Gambill, a 21-year-old rapidly improving fellow American who is No.
50 in the world, retired with a foot injury Friday, giving Sampras
a smooth passage into the semifinals of the star-studded Eurocard
Open.
	   Gambill's withdrawal came just minutes after Marcelo Rios,
Sampras' closest challenger at No. 2, retired before his
quarterfinal against Yevgeny Kafelnikov because of a thigh injury.
	   In the semifinals, Kafelnikov will play 12th-seeded Jonas
Bjorkman, who ousted No. 13 Greg Rusedski 6-3, 6-2.
	   ``It's a fluke, but certainly it helps, I must admit,'' said
Sampras, who is seeking to become the first player to finish as No.
1 for six years in a row.
	   With Rios forced to drop out of his second tournament in as many
weeks and No. 3 Patrick Rafter losing in the third round Thursday,
Sampras' prospects to protect the top ranking have been bolstered.
	   ``Certainly it helps. But I know that I can't rely on Marcelo or
Pat losing,'' Sampras said. ``I have to concentrate on what I am
trying to do and win my matches.''
	   By reaching the quarterfinals of this dlrs 2.45 million
tournament, Sampras had made sure of extending his reign at least
through next week's Paris indoor tournament, which he won last
year.
	   Last week in Lyon, France, Sampras had to withdraw before the
quarterfinals because of a back strain. Sampras says he is fine
now.
	   Sampras has complained this week about the lack of attention his
achievements are getting back home.
	   ``It is not easy to do year in, year out, win Grand Slams and be
No. 1. I feel much more respected in Europe than I do in the
States, from the press and from the people.
	   ``Americans expect me to win every match I play,'' said Sampras,
who has won 11 Grand Slam titles, one short of Roy Emerson's
record.
	   The No. 1 battle is unlikely to be settled before next month's
season-ending World Championship in Hanover, Germany.
	   In the semifinals, Sampras will battle Richard Krajicek, who
ended a nine-match, six-year losing streak against Goran
Ivanisevic.
	   ``I knew it was that many matches, but I didn't know it was that
long,'' Krajicek said.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, improved his chances of
clinching one of the last two spots available in the eight-man
field for Hanover.
	   Winner here in 1995 and runner-up last last year, the
11th-ranked Dutchman slammed 11 aces and had only one double-fault
to overcome Ivanisevic 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-5).
	   Rios, who leads the tour with seven titles this year, retired in
the semifinal in Lyon with a hamstring injury in his left leg. This
time, he pulled a muscle in his right thigh while warming up by
playing soccer with a tennis ball.
	   ``I prefer to rest than to get worse,'' said Rios, who had
reached the quarterfinals when his third-round opponent, Jan
Siemerink, retired with the flu after losing the first set 6-2 late
Thursday.
	   ``I've been pretty unlucky these last two weeks. It's too bad
because I've been playing some good tennis,'' Rios said.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a Swedish dance hall
jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing
60 people and injuring 155.
	   The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before
midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a
hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened
to a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determined
as of Friday evening.
	   Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at
the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a
maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the
disaster investigation.
	   The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local
immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In

Moldovan, Russian premiers agree to step up economic cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The prime ministers of Russia and Moldova agreed
Friday to step up their economic cooperation, and said Moldova
would repay a natural gas debt to Russia with food, news agencies
reported.
	   Yevgeny Primakov of Russia and Ion Chubuk of Moldova also agreed
to work harder to settle ethnic conflict in the secessionist
Trans-Dniester region. The region declared independence in 1990,
fearing that Moldova would seek to reunite with neighboring
Romania.
	   Chubuk, who arrived Thursday night, left Friday evening to
return home after his talks with Primakov and other top officials,
including Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Gazprom Chairman Rem
Vyakhirev.
	   He and Primakov agreed to prepare an economic cooperation
program for the next two years, and said they were optimistic about
prospects for cooperation in joint ventures, financial industrial
groups and other endeavors, according to the Interfax and ITAR-Tass
news agencies.
	   Chubuk agreed that Moldova would repay a debt for natural gas
deliveries from Russia in Moldovan food.

Floods recede in Germany but more rain forecast, towns still on
</HEADLINE>
alert &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with heavy rain predicted on weekend, other details,
precedes BADEN-BADEN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Water receded slowly in some flooded
areas of Germany Friday, but forecasts of heavy rain on the weekend
kept thousands of emergency crew members on alert fearing a
worsening situation.
	   In Delmenhorst near Bremen in the north where city center was
flooded late Thursday and early Friday 300 emergency workers,
including soldiers and firemen, used rubber boats to evacuate
residents.
	   Other areas in Lower Saxony state were also bracing for more
flooding, especially in the Harz and Weser-Ems river regions, said
state interior minister spokesman Ingo Marek.
	   In Baden-Baden, which saw its worst flooding in decades late
Wednesday, the Oos river was dropping steadily but with more rain
forecast emergency crews were kept on alert because earthen dams
were already so saturated even smaller amounts or rain posed a
threat.
	   In northern Baden-Wuerttemberg state Wertheim on the Main river
was expected to flood as that main tributary to the Rhine in the
west continued to rise from waters pouring in out of its
tributaries in Bavaria.
	   The Rhine was also reported rising at Mannheim, and forecasters
were no longer discounting the possibility of a catastrophe similar
to weeks of flooding along the Rhine in January 1995.
	   In Rhineland Palatinate west of the Rhine, the Saar, and Mosel
rivers were also reported still rising with flood waves heading
toward the Rhine.
	   At Mainz, the Rhine was at 5.50 meters (18 feet) and forecast to
reach 6.30 meters (20.7 feet) by Saturday morning with low-lying
areas already threatened with flooding. Worse was expected with
forecasts of up to 40 liters (10.6 U.S. gallons) per square meter
(10.8 square feet) of rain.
	   Some ferries across the Rhine suspended business Friday, and
flood officials warned barges to travel slowly because of the high,
choppy waters.
	   Should the heavy rain come, serious flooding would also occur
along the Mosel river, said emergency officials in the city of
Trier.
	   In Bavaria state, the Naab, Iller and Lech rivers, which enter
into the Danube were rising, and a flood wave along that stream was
also expected, the emergency office in Regensburg said.
	   Harsh storms that started late Tuesday have killed at least
three people _ one in Germany, one in the Czech Republic, and one
in Switzerland. All were involved in vehicle accidents with trees
uprooted by wind. Power cuts, traffic snarls, and highway closings
have been reported in Austria and the Netherlands.

Arafat swiftly silences Islamic militant opponents

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a swift move to rescue the
imperiled land-for-peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat worked Friday to silence his Islamic militant rivals.
	   The charismatic Hamas founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was held
under house arrest, his phone line cut, and burly security men with
AK-47 assault rifles were posted outside his home in a Gaza City
slum. Only his wife and children were allowed to come and go.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists were arrested within a 24-hour
period. Senior figures in the group, which is bent on sabotaging
the U.S.-brokered peace deal, were seized and had phones
disconnected.
	   Israel said the crackdown on Hamas, coming a day after a suicide
attack aimed at Israeli school children, was a positive sign, but
that Arafat needed to do more to earn the 13 percent of the West
Bank he was promised in the peace accord.
	   ``They must struggle firmly against ... the terror groups,''
said Israel's hawkish foreign minister, Ariel Sharon. ``If the
commitments are fulfilled, Israel will carry out its part.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that the Palestinian
Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas' military wing,
Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several terror attacks
and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing. If he is not caught, Netanyahu
said, more attacks that could derail the peace process are
inevitable.
	   Despite the tough words, however, a senior U.S. official said he
expected the timetable of the peace agreement to be kept.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinian Authority was expected to present a security work plan
to U.S. officials over the weekend. This, in turn, could pave the
way for Israeli Cabinet approval on Sunday of the Wye River accord.
	   In the meantime, Arafat is under tremendous pressure to prove to
Israel that his campaign against Hamas is different from past
sweeps in which hundreds were rounded up but then released.
	   At the same time, Arafat cannot risk provoking a bloody backlash
that could lead the Palestinians to the brink of civil war.
	   In the Sara neighborhood of Hamas founder Yassin, a slum of
unpaved alleys and crumbling homes, many feel Arafat has gone too
far already.
	   ``They surrounded his (Yassin's) home with armed officers as if
he was a criminal under arrest,'' said Omar Abul Subar, 42, wearing
a long robe, baggy pants and slippers as he emerged from the local
mosque.
	   In the long run, Arafat only will have broad public support for
a move against Hamas if the Israelis deliver their part of the
agreement _ releasing prisoners, opening the Gaza airport, opening
a land route between the West Bank and Gaza _ so the Palestinians
feel they have something to gain.
	   Palestinian commentator Ghassan Khatib cautioned that mass
arrests were no guarantee that violence against Israel will stop.
``Even if they manage to catch the right people, Hamas can always
recruit new ones and organize attacks,'' Khatib said.
	   Still, Arafat's adviser, Nabil Abourdeneh, made it clear that
the Palestinian leader was in no mood for compromise with Hamas.
``We will not allow any faction to stand in the way of liberating
Palestinian lands,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   Arafat has rounded up Hamas activists in the past, but this
marked the first time he arrested and silenced the entire
leadership within a day. In a sign that the campaign was not
confined to Gaza, Arafat's men on Friday prevented a planned Hamas
march in the West Bank town of Nablus.
	   It was also a first that Arafat took on Yassin, a quadriplegic
since his teens who is widely respected even by many outside Hamas
for building and funding clinics and schools.
	   The roundup began Thursday afternoon, just hours after a
Palestinian motorist rammed his rigged car into an Israeli army
jeep escorting school children from a nearby Jewish settlement. A
soldier was killed, but the 40 children escaped unharmed.
	   By Thursday evening, security guards were posted outside
Yassin's home and he was informed he was under house arrest.
	   In an interview Yassin granted to Qattar-based Al-Jazeera TV
just before the guards arrived, he said he wanted to avoid fighting
among the Palestinians at all costs, but that attacks on Israelis
were a legitimate way of fighting occupation.
	   Several hours later, at 1:30 a.m. Friday, Palestinian agents
ransacked Yassin's home, arrested three bodyguards and seized
weapons, videotapes and files, according to a handwritten fax sent
to news agencies. The authenticity of the fax, which bore Yassin's
signature, could not be confirmed.
	   Despite the unprecedented pressure on Hamas, the group's initial
response to the crackdown was somewhat mild. It accused Arafat of
trying to ``wipe out'' his political opposition, but did not
threaten retaliation against the Palestinian Authority.

Kazak opposition leader arrested on slander charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prominent opposition leader was arrested in
Kazakstan on Friday, a news agency said.
	   Pyotr Svoik, leader of the Azamat opposition movement, was
arrested in Almaty, the former capital, and charged with slander,
inciting national conflict and insulting an official, Interfax
reported.
	   The information came from Semyon Grobovsky, leader of the Kazak
Workers Movement, who said he didn't know anything else about the
incident. It was not clear whom Svoik is alleged to have slandered.
	   Svoik has been an outspoken critic of President Nursultan
Nazarbayev. He complained that he was attacked and beaten last year
by men he believed were government security agents.

Mourning and dread wrack Swedes after fire kills 60 teens at dance
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an
upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the
sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or
weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.
	   Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them
severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a
boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of
moments.
	   Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the
panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,
exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400
people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and
bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''
17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and
two male friends of hers died.
	   Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told of
his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No help. No police. No
firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said from his bed in a
Goteborg hospital.
	   Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believes
the police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first fire
trucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.
But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would
likely have been too slow.
	   The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday
evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames'
quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire had
burned undetected for a time before exploding.
	   The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the
dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant
association in Sweden's second-largest city. The association had
hired out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police
said but declined to identify the arrangers.
	   The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, and
consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours at
hospitals. Some were able to make the wait in rooms off-limits to
journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and
teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals.
Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening.
	   ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but
also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _
they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska
Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) west of Stockholm.
	   The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history,
shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. King Carl XVI
Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuring
victims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel great
sympathy.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to the
fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the gutted
wreck.
	   ``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind of boots
my own children wear,'' he said.
	   On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, came to the
Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment
at a memorial service. The youths were dressed in the same sort of
hip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn, but listened to
delicate hymns instead of pounding disco.
	   They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously,
apparently not knowing how to behave in a church.
	   ``I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to
prayers,'' said a young man who gave his name only as Sami. ``I'm
accompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning
_ that's all.''

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police have detained more than 300
beggars, most from neighboring countries, in a campaign to make
Bangkok's streets safer for spectators and athletes arriving for
the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police officer said Friday.
	   Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a four-day crackdown
on panhandlers. About 100 of those detained were displayed Friday
to local and foreign press at a detention center in Bangkok.
	   ``Most come here because of economic hardship,'' said Maj. Gen.
Chanvut Vajrabukka, deputy commissioner for the immigration police.
``There are some beggars, however, who are under control of
gangsters. They could cause trouble for tourists and athletes.''
	   Other groups targeted by police in advance of the Asian Games
are foreign criminal gangs believed to operate in Bangkok and other
major cities in Thailand.
	   The Asian Games will be held from the Dec. 6-20.

	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ France's Mary Pierce stayed on course for her
second tournament win in as many weeks Friday, reaching the final
of the dlrs 164,250 Seat Luxembourg Open with 6-1, 7-5 win over
Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   In Saturday's final, Pierce will face Silvia Farina of Italy,
who prevented an all-French matchup by ousting top seed Nathalie
Tauziat 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
	   Pierce, 11th in the WTA rankings, already won the Kremlin Cup in
Moscow last week. She was rarely troubled by the Russian, ranked
27th, and swept into the final with a straight-set win.
	   Pierce is trying to put some gloss on disappointing season with
a late surge. Tauziat's glory came at Wimbledon, when she reached
her first Grand Slam final, but she fell one step short of a final
here.
	   Farina, No. 24 in the WTA rankings, claimed her third seed this
week by tenaciously hanging on when Tauziat tried to stage a
comeback. After losing the second set, the Italian remained poised
before edging Tauziat in the tense final games.
	   Saturday's winner will take home dlrs 27,000 and a Seat car.

Courtney Walsh homes in on Caribbean durability record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ With a big heart and his own individual
style, Courtney Walsh is poised to set a record for durability.
	   At 36, the West Indies fastbowler shows little evidence of
slowing down as he closes in on Malcolm Marshall's record for the
most Test wickets by a Caribbean bowler.
	   Walsh is just two away from overhauling Marshall's record of 376
wickets, a feat he is expected to accomplish when the West Indies
tours South Africa for a five-Test series starting in November.
	   In a Test career that started on the 1984 tour of Australia,
Walsh has captured 375 wickets in 102 appearances, not in the
devastating fashion of Marshall and other feared West Indian fast
men such as Michael Holding and Curtly Ambrose, but with
English-type swing bowling that has been just as effective.
	   Walsh's success comes as no surprise to people like respected
cricket writer Tony Becca, who has followed the bowler's
development since the youth stage.
	   ``His secret is that he has a big heart and takes pride in his
performance,'' Becca noted. ``Courtney has always believed in
leading from the front.''
	   Though he joined a select group of bowlers to capture 300 Test
wickets during the 1996 tour of England, Walsh says he has never
been big on milestones.
	   ``The first thing is for the team to do well, especially on this
upcoming tour,'' said Walsh. ``But getting the record would be
nice.''
	   Snatching Marshall's record would cap a magnificent year for
Walsh, who captured 22 wickets in the Windies' 3-1 win over England
in the recent home series. He maintained that form during the
summer in the England county championships when he picked up 106
wickets for Gloucestershire.
	   Walsh's run of success came after a bad start in 1998. He was
replaced as West Indies captain by Brian Lara following an
embarassing 0-3 shutout against Pakistan last winter.
	   Lara's appointment triggered talk of animosity between the two.
While admitting his disappointment at losing the captaincy, Walsh
bounced back with quality performances against England and for
Gloucestershire.
	   Success has outweighed the disappointments since Walsh made his
first-class debut in 1982 for Jamaica as a gangly fastbowler in the
regional Shell Shield tournament.
	   After consistent performances at the regional level, Walsh was
chosen for the West Indies' tours of England and Australia in 1984.
	   With the presence of Marshall, Holding and Joel Garner it would
be some time before Walsh sealed a permanent place in the team.
Even when the trio retired his selection was not automatic.
	   He was dropped for the 1992 World Cup in Australia and New
Zealand, but returned later that year to bowl the West Indies to a
dramatic victory over South Africa in the one-off Test in Barbados.
	   Alongside fellow fastbowler Curtly Ambrose, Walsh has pulled the
West Indies from the jaws of defeat on several occasions, none more
memorable than the team's nail-biting one-run win over Australia at
Adelaide in 1994.
	   While many believe the South African tour could be his last
series for the West Indies, Walsh says he wouldn't mind being
around when the Australians visit the Caribbean in early 1999.
	   ``Let's wait and see,'' he said.

Arrest ordered for ex-intelligence unit commander in assassination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The former commander of a notorious army
intelligence unit organized the assassination of Colombia's main
opposition leader three years ago, probably on orders from a senior
official, judicial sources said Friday.
	   Former Col. Bernardo Ruiz Silva, for whom an arrest warrant was
issued in mid-October, is accused of planning the Nov. 2, 1995,
murder of Alvaro Gomez Hurtado, the officials said.
	   Ruiz was still at large Friday and believed to be in Colombia,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security
reasons.
	   Prosecutors had hoped to keep the arrest warrant secret until
they captured Ruiz, but news of the charges was leaked by Colombian
media.
	   Ruiz is wanted on charges of aggravated homicide, intent to
murder and conspiracy, a spokesman for the chief prosecutor's
office said.
	   Gomez, a three-time presidential candidate and head of the
Conservative Party, was shot to death in broad daylight as he got
into his car after teaching a class at a Bogota university.
	   The assassination occurred during a period of great political
turmoil, when Gomez was demanding that then-President Ernesto
Samper resign because of evidence he was elected in 1994 with $6
million in contributions from drug cartels.
	   Four former soldiers, all of whom had worked under Col. Ruiz,
have been arrested for allegedly carrying out the assassination.
Some have implicated Ruiz, who at the time of the killing commanded
the 20th Intelligence Brigade, the sources said. In all, six people
have been arrested in the case.
	   The officials said prosecutors believe Ruiz was acting on the
orders of higher-ranking officials, perhaps even someone within the
Samper administration.
	   The television news program CM&AMP; reported Thursday night that two
generals and several leading politicians have also been implicated
in the assassination. It did not name them, however, and no further
arrest warrants have been issued.
	   Some Colombian media have theorized that the assassination was
ordered because Gomez was involved in a plot to overthrow Samper.
	   Without naming names, Samper repeatedly asserted that
conservative politicians were trying to organize a coup against
him.
	   Former U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette has said he was
approached in August 1995 by Samper opponents who sought
Washington's support for a coup. Frechette said he refused to help
the conspirators, whom he has not named.
	   Ruiz was relieved of his command in late 1997 and the 20th
Intelligence Brigade was dissolved in May. The State Department,
Colombian prosecutors and international human rights groups had
repeatedly accused the brigade of sponsoring death squad killings.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Seeking to promote stability in Europe's
poorest and most unstable country, officials from 25 countries met
here Friday to endorse efforts by the new prime minister to restore
order and revive the economy.
	   Speakers, including Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
and Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, expressed hope that
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko would succeed where his predecessors
had failed.
	   ``Since the new administration has taken office, the internal
situation in Albania has dramatically improved,'' Schuessel told
the one-day conference. ``Our presence here today gives ample proof
of the fact that the country is on its way toward enhanced
stability.''
	   In a document issued at the close of the conference, the
speakers pledged continued support of Albania and its new
government and underlined the need to continue to monitor the
progress.
	   They also asked the government to implement an anti-corruption
plan to fight smuggling and other illegal activities, promote
foreign investments, fight illegal emigration, and reform the
judiciary system.
	   Earlier in the day, Geremek, chairman of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, also urged the opposition
Democratic Party of ex-President Sali Berisha to end its boycott of
parliament and work with Majko to restore stability.
	   ``I cannot support the boycott of the democratically elected
parliament,'' Geremek said. ``One has to respect the rules of
democracy, the rule of law.''
	   In September, the assassination of an opposition figure, Azem
Hajdari, led to riots in the capital by Berisha's followers. After
the riots ceased, Prime Minister Fatos Nano resigned, and Majko
took office last month. But Berisha has continued boycotting
parliament.

Pierce, Farina play Luxembourg Open final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ France's Mary Pierce stayed on course for her
second tennis tournament win in as many weeks Friday, reaching the
final of the dlrs 164,250 Seat Luxembourg Open with a 6-1, 7-5 win
over Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
	   In Saturday's final, Pierce will face Silvia Farina of Italy,
who prevented an all-French matchup by ousting top seed Nathalie
Tauziat 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
	   Pierce, 11th in the WTA rankings, already won the Kremlin Cup in
Moscow last week.
	   Pierce was rarely troubled by the Russian, ranked 27th, and
swept into the final with a straight-set win.
	   Pierce is trying to put some gloss on a disappointing season
with a late surge. Tauziat's glory came at Wimbledon, when she
reached her first Grand Slam final, but she fell one step short of
a final here.
	   Farina, No. 24 in the WTA rankings, claimed her third seed this
week by tenaciously hanging on when Tauziat tried to stage a
comeback. After losing the second set, the Italian remained poised
before edging Tauziat in the tense final games.
	   Saturday's winner will take home dlrs 27,000 and a Seat car.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates beat host
Bahrain 1-0 in the opening match Friday of the six-nation Gulf Cup
here.
	   The UAE team, which attacked right from the start, scored in the
40th minute of the first half with a well-timed header by forward
Adil Mohammed.
	   The U.A.E. team came close to scoring several goals, but the
Bahrainis, with a homeground advantage, managed to restrict the
attacking opponents to a 1-0 score.
	   The ruler of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the prime
minister and the crown prince were among more than 30,000
spectators at the opening match of the 14th Gulf Cup.
	   Besides Bahrain and the U.A.E., the other teams competing in the
six-nation competition are Saudi Arabia Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.
	   Saudi _ which brings its World Cup experience and a recent win
in the Arab Cup held in Doha, Qatar _ is a favorite to lift the
cup.
	   The only apparent threat to Saudi Arabia is from Kuwait, which
has won the tournament eight times since its inception in 1970. The
tournament is held every two years and Kuwait won in 1996.
	   Saudi Arabia faces Kuwait on Saturday.

Courtney Walsh homes in on Caribbean durability record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ West Indies fastbowler Courtney Walsh
is showing little evidence of slowing down as he closes in on
Malcolm Marshall's record for the most Test wickets by a Caribbean
bowler.
	   Walsh, 36, is just two away from overhauling Marshall's record
of 376 wickets, a feat Walsh is expected to accomplish when the
West Indies tours South Africa for a five-Test series starting in
November.
	   In a Test career that started on the 1984 tour of Australia,
Walsh has captured 375 wickets in 102 appearances, not in the
devastating fashion of Marshall and other feared West Indian fast
men such as Michael Holding and Curtly Ambrose, but with
English-type swing bowling that has been just as effective.
	   Walsh's success comes as no surprise to people like respected
cricket writer Tony Becca, who has followed the bowler's
development since the youth stage.
	   ``His secret is that he has a big heart and takes pride in his
performance,'' Becca noted. ``Courtney has always believed in
leading from the front.''
	   Though he joined a select group of bowlers to capture 300 Test
wickets during the 1996 tour of England, Walsh says he has never
been big on milestones.
	   ``The first thing is for the team to do well, especially on this
upcoming tour,'' said Walsh. ``But getting the record would be
nice.''
	   Snatching Marshall's record would cap a magnificent year for
Walsh, who captured 22 wickets in the Windies' 3-1 win over England
in the recent home series. He maintained that form during the
summer in the England county championships when he picked up 106
wickets for Gloucestershire.
	   Walsh's run of success came after a bad start in 1998. He was
replaced as West Indies captain by Brian Lara following an
embarassing 0-3 shutout against Pakistan last winter.
	   Lara's appointment triggered talk of animosity between the two.
While admitting his disappointment at losing the captaincy, Walsh
bounced back with quality performances against England and for
Gloucestershire.
	   Success has outweighed the disappointments since Walsh made his
first-class debut in 1982 for Jamaica as a gangly fastbowler in the
regional Shell Shield tournament.
	   After consistent performances at the regional level, Walsh was
chosen for the West Indies' tours of England and Australia in 1984.
	   With the presence of Marshall, Holding and Joel Garner it would
be some time before Walsh sealed a permanent place in the team.
Even when the trio retired his selection was not automatic.
	   He was dropped for the 1992 World Cup in Australia and New
Zealand, but returned later that year to bowl the West Indies to a
dramatic victory over South Africa in the one-off Test in Barbados.
	   Alongside fellow fastbowler Curtly Ambrose, Walsh has pulled the
West Indies from the jaws of defeat on several occasions, none more
memorable than the team's nail-biting one-run win over Australia at
Adelaide in 1994.
	   While many believe the South African tour could be his last
series for the West Indies, Walsh says he wouldn't mind being
around when the Australians visit the Caribbean in early 1999.
	   ``Let's wait and see,'' he said.

Sports minister raises possibility of Cubans playing in Major
</HEADLINE>
Leagues &QL; 
 &UR; By LUIS VARELA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Cuba's Sports Minister Humberto
Rodriguez raised the possibility that Cubans might be allowed to
play in the Major Leagues in the United States.
	   ``We are receptive to any proposal by the Major Leagues as long
as it respects the principles of Cuban socialist sports,'' the
Spanish-language news agency quoted Rodriguez.
	   So far, only Cubans who have left their country, such as New
York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``Duke'' Hernandez, a standout in this
year's World Series, have played in the U.S. professional ranks.
	   Rodriguez said Cuba has not received any new proposals from the
Major Leagues but is willing to listen.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro said in a meeting last week with
U.S. newspaper editors in Havana that he is not opposed to Cuban
teams competing in the United States. Castro, a baseball fan, was a
pitcher for the University of Havana team while he was a law
student.
	   A Cuban team could not compete in the United States under
current laws, which prohibit commerce with Cuba. But Major League
teams would like to recruit top Cuban players.
	   Hernandez won the spotlight with victories in the American
League Championship Series and in the World Series this year. His
half-brother, Livan, was named Most Valuable Player in the 1997
World Series.

Eritrea to return Greater Hanish island to Yemen on Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Eritrea will return a Red Sea island to
Yemen on Sunday in compliance with a World Court ruling, Yemen's
foreign minister said here Friday.
	   ``The island of Greater Hanish will be retuned to Yemen on Nov.
1,'' Foreign Minister Abdul-Kader Bajammal told reporters on
arrival in Cairo. ``Relations with Eritrea will become as good as
they used to be.''
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9 the World Court awarded all three islands to Yemen and
stipulated that its decision should be complied with in 90 days.
	   Bajammal also said that Eitrean President Isaias Afwerki will
travel to the southern Yemeni city of Aden on Wednesday for talks
with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
	   Bajammal, who began his three-day visit by talks with his
Egyptian counterpart, will raise Yemen's border conflict with Saudi
Arabia in his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Arab
League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid, a Yemeni government
official told The Associated Press in San`a.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert on the Arabia peninsula with
potentially lucrative oil fields.
	   Yemeni authorities are preparing to mark Eritrea's hand over of
Greater Hanish with celebrations on the island on Sunday, the
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Yemeni government has said it wishes to restore full
diplomatic relations with Eritrea and resume air services between
the two countries.

Global warming diplomacy: temperature's already rising among
</HEADLINE>
negotiators &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Forest fires in South Florida.
Heat waves that have shattered century-old records. Even rising sea
levels are being cited as proof of global warming.
	   In December, the world community decided to try and halt the
phenomenon with the landmark Kyoto agreement to curb heat-trapping
greenhouse gases. Less than a year later, 166 nations will convene
in Argentina's capital Monday to hash out ways to implement the
accord.
	   ``The Kyoto Protocol left open a significant number of questions
in terms of the operational aspect,'' said Robert Watson, a top
climate expert who chairs a U.N.-sponsored assembly of scientists
on the issue.
	   History was made in Kyoto, Japan, last year when governments
agreed to emission reductions by the United States, Japan, the
15-nation European Union and 21 other industrial nations. But many
nations have grappled with how to attain those goals.
	   Watson told The Associated Press that the Buenos Aires meeting _
the biggest since Kyoto _ will be another defining moment.
	   ``I think the governments will have to demonstrate that they can
make some progress,'' he said. ``Otherwise people will say this
thing is stalled.''
	   The Kyoto accord called for developed countries to roll back
output of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are
principally emitted from power plants and automobiles to pre-1990
levels by 2012.
	   The treaty would require the European Union to reduce greenhouse
gas levels about 8 percent below 1990 emissions, the United States
by 7 percent and Japan by 6 percent.
	   When the nations meet in Buenos Aires, they will focus on
several controversial proposals for industrial countries to achieve
their targeted reductions.
	   Under a trading scheme broadly endorsed at Kyoto, countries
would be able to meet their greenhouse gas reductions in part by
trading or purchasing credits from others who have already met
their goals.
	   The United States supports unrestricted swapping of the credits,
a measure it sees as cost-saving mechanism. But opponents in Europe
and the developing world insist that unrestricted trading would
allow the United States to reach its targets without scaling back
emissions.
	   ``We will adamantly oppose efforts to set arbitrary limits on
trading,'' Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the head of
the U.S. delegation, said in Washington.
	   The United States, which has yet to ratify the agreement, also
wants to see a bigger commitment from developing countries to
reducing its emissions.
	   Developed countries would also have a chance to meet the levels
by financing climate-friendly projects in developing countries.
	   Christopher Flavin of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute
said he's hoping for real results. He noted that 14 of the warmest
years since 1860 were recorded in the past two decades, along with
increasingly erratic weather.
	   He warned that, barring progress, ``the encounter in Buenos
Aires could turn out to be little more than an elaborate tango _ a
few impressive steps that end up going nowhere.''

Iran's leader heaps insults on Arafat for deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS graf 10 to give Arafat aide's name. &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader on Friday denounced
Yasser Arafat as a ``disgraceful ... traitor,'' heaping on the
Palestinian leader some of the worst insults he has faced for
signing a peace accord with Israel.
	   ``He is an abject, treacherous person, a person who is deeply
immersed in the filth of selfishness and worldliness,'' Ayatollah
Khamenei said in a highly-publicized sermon at Tehran University.
	   Khamenei was interrupted by chants of ``no compromise, no
surrender, combat Israel'' by the hundreds of thousands of
worshipers hearing him.
	   Most top Iranian officials including President Mohammad Khatami,
Cabinet ministers, Parliament members and military officers were
present.
	   The one-hour speech marked the 1,000th Friday prayers held in
the capital since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and followed
intensive media campaigns encouraging people to take part.
	   Although the gist of Khamenei's speech reflected Iran's
longstanding opposition to any Palestinian peace with Israel, the
sermon was remarkable for its vitriolic rhetoric.
	   Arafat is a ``a disgraceful human, a traitor. He is shameless
and is unworthy of being called a member of the Palestinian
resistance, let alone the leader of this movement,'' Khamenei said.
	   Arafat signed an accord with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Oct. 23, promising to crack down on Islamic militants
in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from 13 percent of
West Bank.
	   In Gaza, a senior aide to Arafat rebuked Khamenei, saying he had
``no right to make this kind of a statement.''
	   ``We call upon the Iranian leadership to stop playing games in
the Palestinian field because the (Palestinian) Authority will not
allow Khamenei or anyone else to make the Palestinian land a new
Afghanistan,'' Tayab Abed Al-Rahim said in a statement.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Cuba's Sports Minister Humberto
Rodriguez raised the possibility that Cubans might be allowed to
play major league baseball in the United States.
	   ``We are receptive to any proposal by the major leagues as long
as it respects the principles of Cuban socialist sports,'' the
Spanish-language news agency Prensa Latina quoted Rodriguez.
	   So far, only Cubans who have left their country, such as New
York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``Duke'' Hernandez, a standout in this
year's World Series, have played in the U.S. professional ranks.
	   Rodriguez said Cuba has not received any new proposals from
major league baseball but is willing to listen.
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro said in a meeting last week with
U.S. newspaper editors in Havana that he is not opposed to Cuban
teams competing in the United States. Castro, a baseball fan, was a
pitcher for the University of Havana team while he was a law
student.
	   A Cuban team could not compete in the United States under
current laws, which prohibit commerce with Cuba. But major League
teams would like to recruit top Cuban players.
	   Hernandez won the spotlight with victories in the American
League Championship Series and in the World Series this year. His
half-brother, Livan, was named Most Valuable Player in the 1997
World Series.

Parisians ready for Halloween `a la francaise'
</HEADLINE>

	   PARIS (AP) _ Chances are nobody in France will be dressing up as
Monica Lewinsky for Halloween.
	   The French have taken up Halloween with ever-greater enthusiasm,
filling shop windows with ghoulish masks and broomsticks, and
turning their nightclubs into haunted houses. In short, Halloween
has become big business in France.
	   But it's not Halloween as Americans know it. Parisians,
traditionally wary of taking inspiration from the United States,
have refashioned the holiday ``a la francaise.''
	   Halloween here has a certain purity, inspired more by ancient
Celtic tradition than the American celebration.
	   So instead of dressing up as Austin Powers, Zorro and characters
from ``Scream 2,'' people in France stick to the basics, like
witches and goblins.
	   Stephane Collange, a Parisian accountant who was invited to an
American friend's Halloween party, was surprised to learn how
people get decked out in America.
	   ``You mean Americans dress up as anything at all?'' he said.
``Then it's just a costume party, it's not really Halloween.''
	   Advertisers stress the holiday's ancient roots, not its American
incarnation. Last year, when France Telecom decorated a park near
the Eiffel Tower with 8,000 pumpkins, a spokesman explained, ``We
are returning a European holiday to Europe.''
	   The Storrer bakery on the Rue Montorgueil, founded in 1730,
doesn't sell any candy corn. But it has inaugurated miniature
pumpkin candies made of traditional French almond paste.
	   ``The French can sometimes be a little distant, and Halloween
creates a warm kind of atmosphere,'' said Moreira Anicet, a
shopkeeper in the historic bakery, where witch decorations sit
side-by-side with 19th-century murals of naked women brandishing
loaves of bread.
	   ``It's a fun holiday, it makes us laugh,'' he said. ``And we're
selling a lot of Halloween candy.''
	   A few years ago, Halloween was still exotic here, observed only
by American students. When American bars began offering Halloween
festivities, it became part of Paris nightlife.
	   Last year, the chic nightclub Les Bains transformed itself into
a haunted house, and the beautiful people showed up in
curve-fitting skeleton costumes and sexy, decollete witches' gowns.
	   This year, Halloween, once relegated to nightlife, has come
fully into the daylight.
	   In bakeries and stores all over Paris, counters are covered with
pumpkins, silky spider webs and ghosts, and other things to buy.
Children's clothing stores are full of the paraphernalia.
	   Some parents and grandparents are tired of opening their
wallets.
	   ``It's another import from America, another excuse to buy
things,'' said Louise Delcher, playing with her four grandchildren
in a central Paris park. ``Everything has become commercial.''
	   Indeed, companies say that this year, Halloween is a sure bet.
)ne Parisian newspaper put the Halloween market in France at 100
million francs (dlrs 18 million), compared to 10 million francs
(dlrs 1.8 million) last year.
	   France Telecom will offer kids' workshops on pumpkin carving and
ghoulish make-up in six cities. Children's meals at McDonald's come
with Halloween party favors _ like blood-shot eyeballs floating in
goo.
	   Even champagne _ one serious business in France _ has let its
guard down. One brand of bubbly, Veuve Clicquot, has turned its
packaging black and orange.

Struggling Strasbourg stuns high-flying Bordeaux; Rennes wins again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bordeaux missed its chance to go back to the top of
the French first division on Friday when it surprisingly lost 3-2
at Strasbourg.
	   The defeat leaves Bordeaux with 25 points, two behind Marseille,
which won at Lorient on Thursday, and two ahead of surprise
challenger Rennes, which beat Toulouse 1-0 Friday.
	   Bordeaux's problems began with a 27th minute goal from
Strasbourg striker Lionel Rouxel, and worsened when Teddy Bertin
smashed in a free kick just before the break.
	   Early in the second half, Kaba Daiwara bundled the ball into the
net to pull one back for the title challengers, but Rouxel, picking
up a fine pass from Corentin Martins, made it 3-1 in the 68th
minute.
	   Johan Micoud reduced the deficit late on, but Strasbourg held on
to pick up three points.
	   Rennes continues to be the biggest surprise of the season.
	   In his first season as a manager, Paul Le Guen has lost only two
matches with the modest Brittany team.
	   To secure Friday's win, defender Dominique Arribage, who Le Guen
signed from Toulouse in pre-season, headed in just before half
time.
	   Long suffering Paris Saint-Germain supporters got some relief
with a 2-0 win against Auxerre.
	   In Artur Jorge's first home match since returning to coach PSG,
Nigerian Jay-Jay Okocha scored a goal in each half.
	   PSG had scored only one goal on its five previous matches.
	   Lens got a boost before Wednesday's Champions League match at
Panathanaikos, with a 2-0 win over Metz.
	   Pascal Nouma headed the first two minutes before half time
before Michael Debeve made it 2-0 in the 54th minute.
	   In Friday's other match, Bastia won 2-1 at Nancy.

After one marathon, Hickman is confident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Distance runner Libbie Hickman has tremendous
faith in coach Damien Koch and that's why she was so shocked after
running poorly at the Boston Marathon in April.
	   ``My coach, who is usually right, had me winning,'' Hickman said
of her marathon debut.
	   Instead, Hickman was ``emotionally distraught'' after finishing
12th among the women in 2 hours, 35 minutes, 37 seconds _ more than
12 minutes behind winner Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia.
	   Since then, Hickman has had time to dissect the race and
determine what went wrong. On Sunday, she will try to put her
thoughts into a successful race, in the New York City Marathon.
	   She will not be the favorite. That honor goes to Kenya's Tegla
Loroupe, the world record-holder and two-time New York champion.
Hickman is not even considered among the top contenders because she
has the slowest time among the 15 elite women in the field.
	   Yet, Hickman firmly believes that her experience six months ago,
her productive races on the track and on the roads since Boston,
and her conditioning will result in a much faster performance.
	   At Boston, Hickman felt that her natural speed, combined with
her strength, would get her through the race.
	   ``That was a good learning experience,'' she said Friday. ``I
never felt bad during the race. I held an even pace throughout. But
my training wasn't proper.''
	   Now, Hickman realizes that since the race was early in the year,
her speed wasn't as good as it is now after a full season of
competition.
	   ``Going faster would have put me in an uncomfortable position,''
she said.
	   Hickman knew by the halfway mark, which she reached in 1:16:20,
that her race was over.
	   ``That was devastating mentally,'' she said. ``My body just
wouldn't go any faster. I was strong, but not fast. I wasn't as fit
as I thought. I couldn't pick up the pace. I was imagining me
catching everybody and being strong. It didn't happen.
	   ``I had tons of strength, but no speed.''
	   On Sunday, Hickman is hoping to run the first half in under
1:15, and running the second half much faster than the 1:19:17 she
ran in her first marathon.
	   ``I'm hoping I'll be more into the race mentally,'' she said.
``There was so much pressure at Boston, it affected me mentally.''
	   That feeling didn't last long. Since then, Hickman has run
exceptionally well. She finished second in the 5,000 meters at the
USA Championships and was the 5,000 silver medalist at the Goodwill
Games. She finished second in a 10-kilometer road race in Maine,
won the U.S. Half-Marathon Championship at Parkersburg, West
Virginia, and the U.S. women's 10K road championship by taking the
Tufts Health Plan race Oct. 12 at Boston.
	   The Tufts race convinced Hickman to compete in New York.
	   ``If it hadn't gone well there and I had struggled, I wouldn't
have run here,'' she said. ``I would have shut it down for the
season. That was a very tough field there.''
	   Hickman said there would be ``no imagining'' this time.
	   ``Boston taught me a whole lot,'' she said. ``I didn't have the
proper training behind me. I also thought the adrenaline would keep
me going.
	   ``I realize you have to put all your energy into the race, not
before the race.
	   ``This time, my body will dictate a different racing tactic ...
a faster pace.''
	   That's what she'll need to keep up with Loroupe, who set the
record of 2:20:47 at Rotterdam in April.

Mourning and dread wrack Swedes after fire kills 60 teens at dance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 11th graf to RESTORE missing word 'watching.' &QL; 
 &UR; By LENNART SIMONSSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an
upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the
sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or
weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.
	   Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them
severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a
boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of
moments.
	   Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the
panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,
exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400
people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and
bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''
17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and
two male friends of hers died.
	   Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told of
his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No help. No police. No
firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said from his bed in a
Goteborg hospital.
	   Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believes
the police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first fire
trucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.
But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would
likely have been too slow.
	   The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday
evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames'
quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire had
burned undetected for a time before exploding.
	   The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the
dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant
association in Sweden's second-largest city. The association had
hired out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police
said but declined to identify the arrangers.
	   The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, and
consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours at
hospitals. Some were able to make the wait in rooms off-limits to
journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and watching
teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals.
Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening.
	   ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but
also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _
they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska
Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) west of Stockholm.
	   The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history,
shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. King Carl XVI
Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuring
victims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel great
sympathy.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to the
fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the gutted
wreck.
	   ``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind of boots
my own children wear,'' he said.
	   On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, came to the
Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment
at a memorial service. The youths were dressed in the same sort of
hip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn, but listened to
delicate hymns instead of pounding disco.
	   They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously,
apparently not knowing how to behave in a church.
	   ``I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to
prayers,'' said a young man who gave his name only as Sami. ``I'm
accompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning
_ that's all.''

Officials investigating theft of American baseball players' wills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM KIRCHOFER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Someone is stealing the wills of American baseball
Hall of Famers.
	   The last testaments wills of old-timers George Wright, Tommy
McCarthy and Hugh Duffy are missing from a courthouse vault, along
with the will of a fourth, unidentified baseball figure.
	   Now, the Suffolk County register of probate plans an inventory
to see if any other dead celebrities' papers have vanished.
	   ``As of today, we've once again tightened security. It's a sad
day for the commonwealth to think that people can't come in to
freely look at these files, which are public records,'' said
Register of Probate Richard Iannella said.
	   Earlier this week, Iannella learned that Leland's Auctions, a
New York sports memorabilia dealer, had in its catalog a document
signed by Wright upon the death of his wife, Abbie, in 1913.
	   Iannella then learned that the couple's wills were missing,
along with the wills of McCarthy and Duffy. In fact, McCarthy's
entire file appeared to have been stolen.
	   And the will of a fourth person Iannella said was connected to
baseball is also missing. Ianella would not identify that person.
	   ``My hunch is that more has been stolen,'' said Iannella, who
plans to turn the matter over to the police after he does an
inventory.
	   Wright, McCarthy and Duffy were among the earliest stars of
organized baseball.
	   Wright, an infielder, was considered one of the best ballplayers
in the United States in the 1860s and '70s. He played with the
Boston Red Stockings, the Providence Grays and the Washington
Nationals. He is also credited with introducing golf to Boston, and
a municipal course in the Hyde Park district bears his name. Wright
died in 1937 at the age of 90.
	   Duffy and McCarthy were known as ``the Heavenly Twins'' in the
1890s, when they played the outfield with Boston's National League
team, known variously as the Braves and the Beaneaters.
	   Leland's paid about dlrs 2,000 for the Wright document at a
sports memorabilia show, but it was unclear who sold it, said Irwin
Kishner, the firm's lawyer. Kisher said that upon learning it was
stolen, Leland's immediately returned the form and is out the
entire dlrs 2,000.
	   Kishner said Leland's will no longer deal in antique legal
documents.
	   Beginning in February 1997, Iannella said, people looking at
probate records had to show ID and fill out forms with their names
and the documents they wished to see. But he said he had no way of
knowing when the baseball documents were stolen.
	   Legal documents are about the way of obtaining the autographs of
the very early ballplayers.

Mourning and dread wrack Swedes after fire kills 60 teens at dance

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an
upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the
sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or
weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.
	   Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them
severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a
boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of
moments.
	   Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the
panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,
exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400
people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and
bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''
17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and
two male friends of hers died.
	   Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told of
his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No help. No police. No
firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said from his bed in a
Goteborg hospital.
	   Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believes
the police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first fire
trucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.
But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would
likely have been too slow.
	   The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday
evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames'
quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire had
burned undetected for a time before exploding.
	   The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor was rented
by the local Macedonian immigrant association in Sweden's
second-largest city. The association had hired out the hall for the
night to eight party arrangers, police said but declined to
identify the arrangers.
	   The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, and
consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours at
hospitals. Some were able to make the wait in rooms off-limits to
journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and watching
teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals.
Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening.
	   ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but
also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _
they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska
Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) west of Stockholm.
	   The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history,
shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. King Carl XVI
Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuring
victims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel great
sympathy.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to the
fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the gutted
wreck.
	   ``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind of boots
my own children wear,'' he said.
	   On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, came to the
Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment
at a memorial service. The youths were dressed in the same sort of
hip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn.
	   They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously.
	   ``I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to
prayers,'' said a young man who gave his name only as Sami. ``I'm
accompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning
_ that's all.''

A New York marathoner at 91: `I'm living my youth now'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VERENA DOBNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Sam Gadless was in his 70s, his body was a
mess and a doctor told him he might not last much longer. He
decided it was a good time to start life over again.
	   On Sunday, at 91, he's competing in his seventh New York City
Marathon, along with his son and grandson. ``If you can do it, I
can do it!'' he yelled at fellow runners last year at the starting
line.
	   This year, as the 26.2-mile (42.16-kilometer) marathon's oldest
entrant, the Boca Raton, Florida, resident hopes to beat his 1997
time of 8 hours, 10 minutes. It would be a triumph of mind over
body, since Gadless missed six weeks of training this year
recovering from being hit by a car Sept. 1.
	   If the Einstein lookalike with the flying white hair makes it,
he'll cross the finish line in Central Park Sunday wearing a
peace-and-love ring in his left ear.
	   ``I had one ear pierced for my 90th birthday. There was so much
killing in my life that we need to run for love and peace,'' said
Gadless, his English thick with the Yiddish he spoke as a child in
his native Poland.
	   He survived German attacks in World War I and escaped the
Holocaust by boarding a ship in 1939 and landing in Cuba. He spent
nearly two years there before sailing to New York.
	   Later, as an immigrant tailor in California, he chain-smoked his
way through hard times until an ulcer forced him to have more than
half his stomach removed.
	   ``I was very unhealthy all my life and I don't have good
genes,'' he says. ``My father died when he was 42.''
	   When he moved to Florida during the 1970s, he had arthritis so
severe he couldn't lift an arm and had to have the bones in his big
toes replaced with artificial ones. His cholesterol and blood
pressure were high and he was a borderline diabetic.
	   The future looked bleak, a doctor told him.
	   Then Gadless started reading ``Prevention'' magazine and other
health publications. He entered his first New York City Marathon at
85, and has since completed races in Los Angeles, Buffalo, Miami
and Orlando.
	   His secret?
	   He cooks his own meals, skipping meat, dairy products, sugar and
white flour, and eating fruit, vegetables and grains _ with some
red wine. He also eats red salmon, sardines and white tuna.
	   ``I don't eat the bad stuff, like milkshakes, or the (matzo
ball) soup my wife used to cook,'' with butter or chicken fat.
	   He's replaced it with a 16-bean soup. ``And I eat garlic by the
pound. It's an antibiotic,'' he said.
	   Gadless trains by doing aerobics, stretching and swimming, as
well as light weightlifting. And he walks up to 40 miles (60
kilometers) per week, alternating among 10 pairs of shoes.
	   He has to watch his money, since he lives off a dlrs 755 monthly
Social Security check, plus help from his children. He lost his
life's savings paying his late wife's nursing home bills.
	   Gadless goes into Sunday's race hoping to acquire a corporate
sponsor. This year, marathon sponsors didn't pay his expenses to
New York as they had in the past.
	   Three years ago he was surprised by his 56-year-old son, Lou,
and grandson, Steve, 26. They trained secretly so they could be at
the start line as ``Team Gadless'' with T-shirts that read, ``Three
Generations'' _ one with ``Grandpa,'' the others ``Son'' and
``Grandson.''
	   ``Age is just numbers,'' Gadless said. ``When I was younger, I
was sick as could be. I'm living my youth now.''

Pinochet granted bail by British judge, hits setback in Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lawyers winning right to address House of Lords'
appeal graf 9
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet won
bail in Britain, but lost in another arena Friday: A Spanish ruling
allowed an investigation to continue into allegations of genocide,
terrorism and torture committed during his 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet was arrested by British authorities Oct. 16 on a
warrant seeking his extradition, issued by the Spanish magistrate
heading the investigation.
	   His attorneys immediately filed a petition for his release with
England's High Court, which ruled Wednesday that he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state.
	   The court added, however, that Pinochet, 82, could not leave
Britain until prosecutors appealed the ruling to a five-judge
tribunal in the House of Lords, which will hear the case next week.
	   On Friday, British Judge Stephen Richards granted Pinochet's
request for bail, but decreed that he must remain at north London's
Grovelands Priory Hospital, where he is recuperating from back
surgery, and under police guard at all times.
	   It is not unusual for judges to grant bail while restricting the
person's movements, and the security measures could have been
ordered for Pinochet's protection.
	   Technically, the decision means that Pinochet, who was not in
court for the bail hearing, is no longer in custody.
	   James Lewis, the attorney representing British and Spanish
authorities, said he would not object to the granting of bail with
the conditions imposed. But he added, ``We make it plain that if
there were to be any variation, the respondents would have a
different perspective on the matter.''
	   Lawyers representing victims of Pinochet's military dictatorship
Friday won permission to address the House of Lords' appeal, and
say they will argue that the scale of human rights' violations
committed, together with their systematic nature, constituted
crimes against humanity which should nullify Pinochet's immunity
from prosecution.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Floodwaters unleashed by Tropical
Storm Mitch rose quickly across Honduras and Nicaragua on Friday,
trapping tens of thousands of people with little food or water and
raising the number of confirmed dead to 88.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard, meanwhile, continued to search for a
four-masted schooner missing since Tuesday off the Honduran coast.
The Fantome, a Windjammer Barefoot Cruises yacht once owned by
Aristotle Onassis, had 31 people aboard.
	   The National Hurricane Center said that at 2100 GMT Friday, the
storm was centered about 45 miles (70 kms) south of La Ceiba and
was drifting west-southwest at 3 mph (6kph). Maximum sustained
winds were near 40 mph (65 kph), down from 180 mph (290 kph) early
Tuesday.
	   The once-fierce hurricane, reduced to a mild tropical storm,
continued to dump water on already flooded towns and farmland. In
some areas, as much as 2 feet (60 cms) of rain fell within six
hours, and the National Weather Service said some areas could
expect up to 2 feet (60 cms) more.
	   The waters sparked mudslides that cut off the highway between
the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the country's second-biggest city,
San Pedro Sula. In the southern city of Choluteca, a mudslide
buried a family of six on Thursday, the Red Cross said Friday.
	   In all, 56 deaths were confirmed in Honduras, including 14 on
the Bay Islands that house many popular diving resorts. Fifty
people were missing in the city of Comayagua in central Honduras
after the Salistroso River swept away 150 houses.
	   On Friday, Juan Padilla, police chief of coastal Santa Rosa de
Aguan, reported 27 people had died in the town because of flooding.
	   In Nicaragua, the official death toll climbed fast as reports
came in from areas cut off by the floods. President Arnoldo Aleman
said at least 31 people had died there.
	   Mexico reported one fatality, an American who was thrown from
his boat south of Cancun on Monday and presumed dead.
	   A Coast Guard C-130 was searching the Caribbean Sea for a
240-foot (73 meter) schooner with 31 people aboard that was missing
since Tuesday. The Antigua-registered Fantome was on a tourist
cruise near Belize and the Bay Islands when it disappeared.
	   Many towns in both Nicaragua and Honduras remained incommunicado
because of downed bridges and washed-out roads, and officials
expected the death toll to rise.
	   Honduran Foreign Minister Fernando Martinez said the United
States and Taiwan each had donated dlrs 500,000.
	   In Chamelecon, a southern suburb of San Pedro Sula, people
walked through waist-deep water carrying televisions, refrigerators
and furniture to load up on trucks as they moved into shelters.
More than 30,000 people were in shelters in San Pedro Sula alone.
	   In one gymnasium, 2,000 people spread out through the stands and
the basketball court, sleeping on pieces of cardboard as chickens
and dogs wandered among their belongings.
	   ``They've given us very little food _ just a little bread,
nothing more. I have no money and can't get in touch with my other
relatives,'' said Estela Munoz, 49.
	   In La Ceiba, near the center of the storm, the floodwaters began
to recede Friday as a calm fell over the city that some residents
attributed to the storm's eye.
	   Rescuers were able for the first time since Wednesday to reach
the Armenia Bonito neighborhood, where flash floods tore apart all
but a tiny hilltop. Six families had huddled on that hilltop
without even a tree to shelter them since the flood came.
	   The rheumatism in his right leg had prevented Jose Martinez, 70,
from evacuating. His wife, Ermina, gathered together their nine
children and grandchildren and climbed the hill.
	   ``We had nothing to eat. We couldn't even sleep,'' Martinez
said. ``We had to remain standing, with only one tarp to cover the
children. It's a miracle of God that we are alive.''
	   On Friday, the fierce current dropped to waist-level and
neighbors formed a human chain to help the families to the other
side. One carried Martinez across on his back.
	   On the other side, the neighbors offered them coconut water.
	   It was all they had.

Council nears agreement on review of Iraq's U.N. compliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council neared agreement
Friday on the broad outline of a review of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions which it hopes will lead Baghdad to resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The ``comprehensive review'' does not include assurances sought
by Iraq _ and pushed by Russia and China _ that the assessment will
lead to the lifting of harsh economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Even if the council ultimately determines that Iraq has fully
complied with all U.N. resolutions, diplomats said that a separate
review of sanctions would need to be held by the council.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the council president,
said all 15 council members agreed on the text of a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan about the framework for a
``comprehensive review.'' Diplomats said China withheld final
approval until officials in Beijing could be consulted.
	   Annan suggested the review in a bid to persuade Iraq to rescind
its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperation, which has halted spot
searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   As envisaged by the council, a review would start ``a very short
time'' after Iraq resumed cooperation with the inspectors.
	   Iraq ended its cooperation when chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler refused to state that Baghdad had destroyed all its weapons
of mass destruction _ the key requirement for lifting crippling
sanctions.
	   The first phase of the review would assess Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions on disarmament, which call for the
destruction of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the
missiles to deliver them. The review would also cover arrangements
for continued monitoring and verification.
	   In periodic reviews since 1990, the council has maintained
sanctions in light of evidence that Iraq continues to conceal
elements of its weapons programs, most recently biological weapons.
	   The second phase, which would follow immediately, would examine
Iraq's compliance with all other U.N. resolutions, including those
pertaining to Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing Kuwaiti
property.
	   ``It is envisaged that the council would outline clearly in each
phase remaining steps to be taken by Iraq to fulfill its
obligations under all the relevant resolutions, and would establish
a likely timeframe for this purpose, assuming full Iraqi
cooperation,'' the draft letter said.
	   Iraq would be invited to contribute its own account of its
compliance, in both written reports and oral presentations, ``with
a clear explanation of its reasoning,'' the letter said.
	   It made no mention of Iraq's request that outside experts be
allowed to participate in the review.
	   Greenstock said the letter would not solve ``every detail of the
points that would come up under a comprehensive review'' but he
called it ``a good step.''
	   ``You would have to expect there to be more discussion of
detail, of precise criteria in precise areas,'' he said.
	   The deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, called it ``a strong
letter,'' and noted that the review would cover 10 or 11
resolutions ranging from disarmament to human rights.
	   ``We're looking forward to a thorough review of all the
obligations Iraq has because in our view they haven't met any of
them,'' he said.

Mourning and dread wrack Swedes after fire kills 60 teens at dance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS one graf at end with mourners gathering at fire site &QL; 
 &UR; By LENNART SIMONSSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an
upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the
sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or
weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.
	   Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them
severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a
boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of
moments.
	   Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the
panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,
exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400
people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and
bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''
17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and
two male friends of hers died.
	   Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told of
his ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No help. No police. No
firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said from his bed in a
Goteborg hospital.
	   Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believes
the police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first fire
trucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.
But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response would
likely have been too slow.
	   The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday
evening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames'
quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire had
burned undetected for a time before exploding.
	   The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the
dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant
association in Sweden's second-largest city. The association had
hired out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, police
said but declined to identify the arrangers.
	   The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, and
consisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,
including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well
as people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified
Latin American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours at
hospitals. Some were able to make the wait in rooms off-limits to
journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and watching
teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals.
Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening.
	   ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but
also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _
they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska
Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers
(300 miles) west of Stockholm.
	   The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history,
shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. King Carl XVI
Gustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuring
victims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel great
sympathy.''
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to the
fire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the gutted
wreck.
	   ``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind of boots
my own children wear,'' he said.
	   On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, came to the
Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment
at a memorial service. The youths were dressed in the same sort of
hip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn, but listened to
delicate hymns instead of pounding disco.
	   They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously,
apparently not knowing how to behave in a church.
	   ``I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to
prayers,'' said a young man who gave his name only as Sami. ``I'm
accompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning
_ that's all.''
	   Many young people also gathered outside the dance hall building
Friday evening. Memorial bouquets of fresh flowers lay on the
pavement where the victims had lain, and mourners placed scores of
candles on the ground, the flames commemorating those lost to other
flames.

Brazilian share prices soar with fiscal aid package on horizon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO (AP) _ Brazilian share prices soared Friday at the
prospect of an international aid package.
	   After five days of losses, the country's biggest stock exchange,
in Sao Paulo, closed up 7.8 percent, while Rio's was up 5.5 percent
from close of trading Thursday.
	   Markets jumped after the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations issued a communique, indicating support for Brazil's
austerity measures and calling for a dlrs 90 billion increase for
the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``We're seeing a lot of good news coming in at the same time,''
said Silvio Camargo, head of international institutional equities
sales at Sao Paulo's Banco Fator.
	   Despite buoyant share prices, dlrs 172 million left Brazil
Friday in foreign exchange market trading as the country continued
to be affected by global financial and economic turbulence.
	   The IMF is widely reported to be preparing a dlrs 30 billion aid
package for Brazil. Confirmation of the aid is expected shortly,
after Brazil Wednesday announced austerity measures aimed at saving
dlrs 24 billion (28 billion reals) next year. The measures need
Congressional approval.

Strikers reject contract offer from Canadian newsprint giant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Striking workers have rejected the latest offer
from Abitibi-Consolidated, the world's No. 1 newsprint producer, to
end a strike that has shut down 10 paper mills in eastern Canada
since June 15.
	   Serge Lord, a spokesman for the Communications, Energy and
Paperworkers Union, said Friday that 80 percent of the 4,500
strikers took part in a vote, and 97 percent of those who voted
rejected the company offer.
	   The closed mills are in Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland.
	   Montreal-based Abitibi had offered a pay increase of about 11
percent over six years, and a signing bonus of dlrs 1,000 (dlrs 650
U.S.). The union says the longest contract it would accept is four
years.
	   Abitibi reported a dlrs 57 million (dlrs 37 million U.S.) loss
for the third quarter because of the strike, but analysts believe
it can afford to hold out longer.
	   It has nine other mills operating in Canada, the United States
and Europe, and is producing more than half its normal output of
newsprint.
	   Abitibi normally controls about 16 percent of newsprint
production in North America.
	   Some industry analysts say newsprint prices worldwide probably
would have fallen sharply over the past few months if the drop in
Abitibi's output hadn't offset the decline in Asian demand for
newsprint.

Spanish court upholds legal basis for bid to extradite Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD reaction from Spanish government,
Aznar trip to London. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge seeking to try former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on charges of genocide got what
amounts to a green light from the National Court on Friday.
	   After five hours of deliberations, 11 judges on Spain's highest
criminal court ruled unanimously that Spain has jurisdiction to
investigate and prosecute crimes committed by military
dictatorships in Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 80s.
	   The ruling upheld the legal basis for Judge Baltasar Garzon to
continue probes into genocide, terrorism and torture he says were
committed under Pinochet's regime between 1973-90.
	   The panel's decision was greeted with whoops of joy from human
rights lawyers and relatives of junta victims who had gathered at
the court in downtown Madrid.
	   ``It's an immense homage to the disappeared (people) of Chile
and Argentina,'' said Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer representing families
of Argentine victims. ``From a legal point of view, it's a landmark
decision.''
	   Garzon issued an international warrant that led to Pinochet's
arrest on Oct. 16 in London as he recovered from back surgery. So
far Garzon has accused Pinochet of 94 killings or disappearances,
mainly Chileans, but says he may expand the charges.
	   The National Court ruling Friday was in response to appeals
filed in May by prosecutors at the same court who said Garzon
lacked jurisdiction to probe crimes committed outside Spain.
	   But the court, without mentioning the Pinochet affair or giving
its reasons, sided with Garzon in rejecting those appeals. The full
text was to be published next week.
	   In the past, Garzon has argued that he can go after Pinochet on
grounds that the ex-dictator is guilty of genocide because he
allegedly tried to wipe out an entire group of people _ his
political opponents.
	   Under Spanish law, Spanish courts can prosecute genocide no
matter where it is committed.
	   In the arrest warrant, Garzon also accuses Pinochet of terrorism
and torture.
	   Although the ruling was a victory for Garzon, he may still fail
to see Pinochet stand trial in Spain.
	   England's High Court on Wednesday threw out Pinochet's arrest on
grounds that he was head of state at the time the alleged crimes
were committed and is therefore immune from prosecution.
	   An appeal is to be heard next week before a five-judge panel of
the House of Lords, Britain's highest court. If it refuses to
reinstate the arrest warrant, any extradition request from Spain
would be in vain.
	   In any case, the next step for Garzon is to file a formal
extradition request. It must be approved by the Spanish government
and then passed on the British, who have the final say.
	   The center-right government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar,
eager to protect lucrative trade ties with Chile and Argentina, has
frowned on Garzon's probe. But officials have indicated that if he
filed an extradition request, the government would pass it on to
Britain.
	   After Friday's ruling, government spokesman Josep Pique said
only that the government respected judicial decisions and would
deal ``scrupulously'' with any extradition request.
	   He also said Aznar would travel Monday to London to meet with
Prime Minister Tony Blair but insisted the Pinochet case was not on
their agenda.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a swift move to rescue the
imperiled land-for-peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Friday silenced his Islamic militant rivals _ at
least temporarily.
	   The charismatic Hamas founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was held
under house arrest, his phone line cut, and burly security men with
AK-47 assault rifles were posted outside his home in a Gaza City
slum. Only his wife and children were allowed to come and go.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists were arrested within a 24-hour
period. Senior figures in the group that is bent on sabotaging the
U.S.-brokered peace deal were seized and had phones disconnected.
	   Later Friday night, the Palestinian cabinet ratified the Wye
River accord signed in Washington last week, though a few ministers
voted against it, senior Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel Rahim said. Rahim
did not elaborate on which ministers opposed the agreement or why.
	   Israel said, 4th graf prvs.

Negotiators in NBA dispute to take the weekend off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ No weekend negotiations were scheduled in the
American National Basketball Association contract dispute, though
the phones could get another workout.
	   Calls between management and the players union have resulted in
the scheduling of a meeting Monday by the lawyers for both sides _
and possible resumption of full scale negotiations on Wednesday.
	   ``That's what they're working toward,'' NBA spokesman Chris
Brienza said Friday.
	   The season was to have started Tuesday, but the entire month of
November already has been wiped from the schedule due to the
lockout.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit players from
working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement sets things like minimum
salaries, pension and health insurance benefits, roster limits and
a salary cap.
	   The biggest issues in this work stoppage are the owners'
insistence on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   Owners and players have spent a total of about 24 hours talking
since Saturday, developing a loose framework for what the next
labor deal is going to look like.
	   The biggest hang-up remains what percentage of revenues will be
devoted to salaries by the time the new system has been in place
for a few years.
	   The owners have moved off their insistence on getting the
percentage down from 57 percent to 48 percent, and the players have
moved off asking for 63 percent, sources involved in the talks told
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   The owners are believed to have signaled for a move to a 50-50
split in the next-to-last year of the deal, while the players want
a 60-40 split.
	   ``There's still a pretty wide gap that separates the sides. But
at least we identified the sizes of the gaps between us,''
commissioner David Stern said.
	   In the meantime, owners continue collecting their television
rights payments from U.S. networks NBC and TNT _ about dlrs 500
million split 29 ways. The owners negotiated a deal under which
rights payments do not cease during the lockout, and the union has
taken to calling the networks ``co-conspirators.''
	   ``A lot of players have actually stated that they're not going
to do interviews with either network,'' union executive director
Billy Hunter told the New York Times.
	   Hunter, however, thinks the networks will eventually push for a
settlement when the lack of games to televise cuts into their
proceeds.

upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the
sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or
weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 60 of them.
	   Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them
severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a
boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of
moments.
	   Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the
panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,
exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400
people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and
bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''
17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and
two male friends of hers died.
	   Police earlier had reported 67 dead but later Friday backed off
that figure and said 60 had died. ``The earlier information that
police gave out was wrong,'' Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in
the case, told a news conference.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Forest fires in South Florida.
Heat waves that have shattered century-old records. Even rising sea
levels are being cited as proof of global warming.
	   In December, the world community decided to try and halt the
phenomenon with the landmark Kyoto agreement to curb heat-trapping
greenhouse gases. Less than a year later, 166 nations will convene
in Argentina's capital Monday to hash out ways to implement the
accord.
	   ``The Kyoto Protocol left open a significant number of questions
in terms of the operational aspect,'' said Robert Watson, a top
climate expert who chairs a U.N.-sponsored assembly of scientists
on the issue.
	   History was made in Kyoto, Japan, last year when governments
agreed to emission reductions by the United States, Japan, the
15-nation European Union and 21 other industrial nations. But many
nations have grappled with how to attain those goals.
	   Watson told The Associated Press that the Buenos Aires meeting _
the biggest since Kyoto _ will be another defining moment.
	   ``I think the governments will have to demonstrate that they can
make some progress,'' he said. ``Otherwise people will say this
thing is stalled.''
	   The Kyoto accord called for developed countries to roll back
output of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are
principally emitted from power plants and automobiles to pre-1990
levels by 2012.
	   The treaty would require the European Union to reduce greenhouse
gas levels about 8 percent below 1990 emissions, the United States
by 7 percent and Japan by 6 percent.
	   When the nations meet in Buenos Aires, they will focus on
several controversial proposals for industrial countries to achieve
their targeted reductions.
	   Under a trading scheme broadly endorsed at Kyoto, countries
would be able to meet their greenhouse gas reductions in part by
trading or purchasing credits from others who have already met
their goals.
	   The United States supports unrestricted swapping of the credits,
a measure it sees as cost-saving mechanism. But opponents in Europe
and the developing world insist that unrestricted trading would
allow the United States to reach its targets without scaling back
emissions.
	   ``We will adamantly oppose efforts to set arbitrary limits on
trading,'' Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the head of
the U.S. delegation, said in Washington.
	   In a speech to business leaders this week, he said an agreement
of the Kyoto participants to allow credit trading _ in order to
ease the cost of reducing greenhouse gases _ ``must hold.''
	   With 1.5 million metric tons a year, the United States leads the
world in carbon dioxide emissions, or nearly twice as much as China
and more than three times that of Russia, independent statistics
show.
	   The Kyoto accord has yet to be signed or ratified by the United
States. Fifty-seven countries have signed the treaty, but only Fiji
has ratified it.
	   The United States also wants to see a bigger commitment from
developing countries to reducing its emissions.
	   Developed countries would also have a chance to meet the levels
by financing climate-friendly projects in developing countries.
	   The World Wildlife Fund said in a report released Friday that
global warming now threatens a third of the world's forests. Warmer
temperatures could increase the risk of forest fires, water
shortages, and tree-killing pests, the group warned.
	   It said scientists tracking climate change report such evidence
as drastic drops in toad populations in the Costa Rican cloud
forests and stress on northern evergreen forests that are home to
woodland caribou.
	   ``Forests are especially sensitive to climate change,'' WWF's
Jennifer Morgan said.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
five gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from fossile fuel consumption in
power plants and automobiles.
	   Critics contend dire warming scenarios have yet to be proven and
don't warrant potentially costly shifts away from fossile fuels.
	   Christopher Flavin of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute
said he's hoping for real results from the Buenos Aires meeting. He
noted that 14 of the warmest years on record in the United States
since 1860 were recorded in the past two decades.
	   Barring progress, he said, ``the encounter in Buenos Aires could
turn out to be little more than an elaborate tango _ a few
impressive steps that end up going nowhere.''

Hess, Venezuela oil company complete deal on joint venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Amerada Hess Corp.
annouced Friday it has reached a final agreement with Petroleos de
Venezuela for a joint venture to operate a refinery in this U.S.
territory in the Caribbean.
	   The agreement paves the way for the construction of a dlrs 500
million facility on the island of St. Croix to process Venezuelan
crude oil. Amerada Hess vice president Alex Moorehead said
construction is scheduled to begin early next year.
	   The new company formed through the joint venture, HOVENSA, will
operate the existing St. Croix refinery previously owned by Hess.
	   Under the new agreement, HOVENSA will begin buying approximately
155,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude oil per day. When the new
facility is constructed, an additional 115,000 barrels a day will
be purchased.
	   Amerada Hess will recieve dlrs 62.5 million in cash in the deal
and a 10-year interest-bearing note for dlrs 562.5 million. Hess
will also receive approximately dlrs 307 million from HOVENSA as
payment for the refinery's net working capital.
	   Once constructed, the new refinery facility is expected to
create 2,000 jobs.

Council votes unanimously to keep force in Western Sahara
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council voted
unanimously Friday to keep a U.N. force in Western Sahara until
mid-December and reiterated calls for a referendum on the disputed
territory's political status ``without further delay.''
	   By a vote of 15-0, the council adopted a resolution welcoming a
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan which proposed speeding
up the identification of tribal voters.
	   For the first time, Annan suggested a possible new date for a
referendum: December 1999, a year later than the original Dec. 7,
1998 target date.
	   The Western Sahara is a disputed area of North Africa claimed
both by Morocco and rebels of the Polisario Front, which is seeking
independence for the area's indigenous people.
	   The two sides have agreed to hold a referendum on the
territory's future in which voters will choose between independence
for the region and integration with Morocco.
	   Western Sahara was abandoned by Spain, its former colonial
ruler, in 1976. The following year Morocco occupied two-thirds of
the territory, claiming historical links. The territory would
increase the size of Morocco by more than 50 percent.
	   A U.N. force has been trying to identify voters because of
disagreements about who is eligible to cast ballots. Each side has
accused the other of trying to pad voter rolls and both have failed
to resolve differences over identifying voters among three Saharan
tribes.
	   The council decided to maintain the U.N. force in Western Sahara
until Dec. 17. It supported Annan's proposal that the force start
publishing the provisional list of voters by Dec. 1.
	   The council also gave its backing to the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, which intends to forward to both sides shortly a
protocol on the repatriation of refugees.
	   It welcomed Morocco's agreement to formalize the presence of the
UNHCR in the Western Sahara and the Polisario Front's agreement to
resume pre-registration of voters in refugee camps.
	   Both parties should ``take concrete action to enable the UNHCR
to carry out the necessary preparatory work for the repatriation of
Saharan refugees eligible to vote, and their immediate families,''
the council said.

Palestinian cabinet approves Wye agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Amid a show of force against the
Islamic militant group Hamas, the Palestinian cabinet ratified the
Wye River accord on Friday, a Palestinian official said.
	   Emerging from a cabinet meeting that lasted nearly five hours,
senior Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel Rahim said late Friday night that
the accord passed by a majority, with a few ministers voting
against it. He did not elaborate on who opposed it or why.
	   Rahim also defended the Palestinian Authority's crackdown on the
Islamic militant group Hamas, blaming the group for Thursday's
suicide attack against a bus in the Gaza Strip and accusing Hamas
of using violence to try to derail the peace process.
	   ``It is like they were telling Netanyahu, `Why are you agreeing
to the withdrawal?''' Rahim said.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested. Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin has been put under house arrest and his phone has been cut.
	   Rahim said that Hamas was acting against Palestinian national
interests and that the sanctions against Yassin would last as long
as Yassin continued to call for violent opposition to the
agreement.

U.S.-Canadian task force expands hunt for abortion-doctor sniper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A joint Canadian-U.S. police task force set up
toll-free tip lines Friday as investigators expanded the hunt for
whoever fatally shot an American abortion provider and wounded
three Canadian doctors in similar attacks.
	   The head of the task force, Inspector Keith McCaskill of
Winnipeg, Manitoba, also said investigators had compiled a profile
of the sniper, though he released no details.
	   Investigators hope they may get tips after an episode about the
shootings airs Saturday night on the television show ``America's
Most Wanted.''
	   ``There's no doubt we need a break,'' McCaskill said.
	   After initial caution, Canadian and U.S. police publicly agreed
Friday that the sniper who killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in Amherst,
New York, last week shares enough characteristics with the other
shootings that they are probably the same assailant.
	   In each case, the doctors were shot by a sniper who apparently
lay in wait behind their homes. All the attacks took place in late
October or early November, and all targeted doctors who provided
abortions.
	   The task force was bolstered Friday when New York state and
Amherst police officially signed on.
	   Police in Winnipeg, Vancouver and Hamilton, Ontario _ sites of
the Canadian shootings _ teamed up with the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police a year ago to form a sniper task force. The FBI and the
sheriff's department from New York's Monroe County joined two weeks
ago, revealing a previously unpublicized 1997 attack on a doctor in
the Rochester, New York, area.
	   The Canadian government has been under pressure from
abortion-rights groups to provide extra funding to the task force,
but the Cabinet minister in charge of police said Friday that this
was unnecessary.
	   Solicitor General Andy Scott said the Mounties, who already have
spent several hundred thousand dollars on the investigation,
assured him that they had enough resources.
	   Marilyn Wilson, executive director of the Canadian Abortion
Rights Action League, accused the government of appearing
unconcerned.
	   ``It's been our position all along that this task force has
operated under severe financial constraints,'' she said.
	   In British Columbia, the provincial government pledged up to
dlrs 250,000 (dlrs 150,000 U.S.) to improve security for
abortion-providing doctors. Measures may include providing
bulletproof jackets for doctors and bulletproof glass for their
homes.
	   The string of shootings began with the Nov. 10, 1994, attack on
Vancouver's Dr. Garson Romalis and included attacks in 1995 on
Hamilton's Dr. Hugh Short and a 1997 shooting of Dr. Jack Fainman
in Winnipeg.
	   Romalis, who was badly wounded, was interviewed for the
``America's Most Wanted'' episode, and Canadian TV stations played
excerpts Friday.
	   ``It is the kind of act that should never be left unchallenged
in a free democratic society,'' Romalis said.
	   ``No matter what people's beliefs are with regard to the
abortion issue, the shooting of a doctor is a violent act. It's a
terrorist act.''

Official: Congress will push through austerity program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Finance Minister Pedro Malan said
Friday that after talks with Senate and other political leaders, he
was confident that Congress would quickly push through the fiscal
austerity program.
	   ``We've presented the plan in full detail, and with total
transparency, and I am confident the Brazilian Congress will rise
to the challenge,'' he told reporters.
	   The austerity program, unveiled Wednesday, looks to save 28
billion reals (dlrs 24 billion) in 1999 alone and 100 billion reals
(dlrs 84.7 billion) over three years in order to attack a budget
deficit currently at 7 percent of the country's gross domestic
product.
	   With the program, the country hopes to restore investment
confidence and stanch the outflow of dollars which began in the
wake of Russia's moratorium on its debt payments in August.
	   The government also hopes that the program will also make Brazil
eligible for IMF aid, estimated at dlrs 30 billion.
	   ``I believe this support (from the IMF) has already been
expressed but I haven't seen the final text yet,'' Malan said,
adding that finance ministry officials were traveling to Washington
Friday evening to present details of the program.
	   Malan took pains to label the IMF aid package a contingency
facility that Brazil could use should the need arise, rather than a
rescue package similar to the ones granted to Mexico, Thailand and
Indonesia.
	   He pointed out that those countries had exhausted their foreign
reserves before IMF aid was made available while Brazil still has
some dlrs 47 billion in reserves.
	   He declined, however, to comment on when the aid package might
be announced.
	   Although Brazil's stock market has responded positively to the
package's announcement _ Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange closed
up 7.8 percent Friday _ analysts have expressed skepticism that
many of the elements would pass quickly through Brazil's
independent-minded Congress.
	   Malan, however, brushed such skepticism aside, saying that after
presenting the program to the Senate Thursday and after meetings
with the government allied parties, he was ``confident Brazil would
rise to the challenge.''
	   The problem is time. In order to contain dollar outflows Brazil
hiked internal interest rates to near 50 percent a year and the
longer interest rates remain this high, the faster the budget
deficit will snowball.
	   If Brazil does not manage to lower interest rates soon, any
impact the fiscal austerity program might have had will likely be
blunted and many fear the government may be forced to resort to a
maxi-devaluation of the currency, a possibility Malan denied out of
hand.
	   ``We are not going to change our exchange rate policy,'' Malan
said.
	   Brazil currently devaluates the currency at a rate in small
increments slightly ahead of inflation. Malan estimated that this
policy would result in a devaluation of the real by 7.5 percent in
1998.

East Lake has got Tiger by the tail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Golf-Tour Championship &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Tiger Woods took a mighty hack from the rough on
the first hole, then winced and rubbed his shoulder.
	   ``In football you would say I got a stinger,'' he said. ``It
didn't bother me after that.''
	   Still, the rest of his round was one big pain.
	   For the second straight day at East Lake Golf Club, Woods failed
to make a birdie. He finished with a 6-over 76 and, at 151 for his
first two rounds in the Tour Championship, was last in the field of
30.
	   ``I'm not swinging well,'' Woods said. ``I was in the rough, the
bunkers, the trees, the gallery, the water ...''
	   Woods took a double bogey at No. 5 and followed that with
consecutive bogeys, then seemed to breeze through the final nine
holes.
	   As soon as he hit his drive at No. 10, he held his arm out to
the right and yelled, ``Fore!'' The ball stopped 4 feet(1.2 meters)
from the chain-link fence guarding the catering service. He hacked
from rough to rough and took bogey.
	   His best chance to end his birdie-less streak _ now at 37 holes
dating to the Disney Classic last week _ was at No. 14, where he
missed a 6-footer. He was in the middle of the fairway at No. 15,
an uphill par-5 measuring 495 yards (452 meters), but put an iron
into the bunker, blasted out to 30 feet (nine meters) and
three-putted for bogey.
	   ``I just couldn't put anything together,'' Woods said.
	   If he wants to win the scoring title, he better put something
together quickly.
	   Depending on how the scoring is adjusted, Woods likely needs to
finish no more than four strokes behind David Duval to win the
Vardon Trophy. Duval shot a 69 and was at 144, seven strokes ahead
of Woods.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; BIG PAYDAY
	   The 30 players in the Tour Championship aren't the only ones who
stand to pick up a big check this week. Considering that caddies
generally get about 10 percent of a player's earnings, the carrier
of the winning bag figures to pocket dlrs 72,000 _ which is more
than what seven players will make.
	   ``That's a heck of a payday for one week's work,'' said Mark
Love, the brother _ and caddie _ of Davis Love III. ``It makes
every shot interesting. It's just as exciting for the guy carrying
the winner's bag as for the winner.''
	   Bob Riefke, the caddie for Justin Leonard, knows the feeling _
Leonard got dlrs 720,000 for winning The Players Championship in
March.
	   If there's a caddie worth rooting for this week, it could be
Andy Martinez. The caddie for Tom Lehman, he injured his ribs
playing basketball during the spring and was home recovering when
Lehman tied for second at the Players Championship _ a dlrs 352,000
payoff.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WET FROM THE START
	   East Lake has one of the most unusual driving ranges on the PGA
Tour _ the first 80 yards (70 meters) is over the lake itself, and
it's safe to say a lot of nice balls will be at the bottom of it
after this week.
	   ``I can't pull the sand wedge out for the first club of the day
unless I want to lose about 10 balls,'' Jim Furyk said. ``First
swing of the day, I'm not getting one over that lake.''
	   The game this week has been trying to skip balls through the
water and onto the green. On Friday, Mark Calcavecchia used his
sand wedge and tried to skip about eight balls, each of them
unsuccessfully.
	   Even Tiger Woods joined in. He tried to hit a low, hard shot
with his driver, but topped the ball so badly that it dribbled down
the hill and into the water.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVEL
	   The Tudor-style clubhouse at East Lake is like a Bobby Jones
museum.
	   The four trophies from his Grand Slam year of 1930 _ the U.S.
Amateur and U.S. Open, the British Amateur and British Open _ are
in a showcase near the front doors. Twenty photographs of Jones are
hung side-by-side, four rows deep, depicting his face from boyhood
to his final years.
	   In another case are a set of Spalding irons that he promoted,
along with a sleeve of the old Spalding-Dot ball. And on the walls
upstairs outside the locker room are a dozen newspapers of Jones'
accomplishments.
	   That's what caught Tom Lehman's attention _ but not only for the
love of golf and Jones.
	   ``You look at them, they have the baseball box scores in
there,'' Lehman said. ``Ruth went 2-for-5, Gehrig was 3-for-4. The
history, to me, just blows my mind.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DIVOTS
	   Now that most of Lynx's assets have been sold to Golfsmith, Fred
Couples no longer is wearing the Lynx logo on his hat. On Friday,
the logo of choice was the North American National Hockey League
Players Association. Couples will be switching to the Tommy Armour
845s, but he still had a set of Maxfli irons in the bag. ... John
Huston's 2-over 72 in the first round was the first time he failed
to break par since a 1-over 73 in the first round of the Texas Open
Sept. 24, a streak of 11 straight rounds.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a swift move to rescue the
imperiled land-for-peace agreement with Israel, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Friday silenced his Islamic militant rivals _ at
least temporarily.
	   The charismatic Hamas founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was held
under house arrest, his phone line cut, and burly security men with
AK-47 assault rifles were posted outside his home in a Gaza City
slum. Only his wife and children were allowed to come and go.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists were arrested within a 24-hour
period. Senior figures in the group that is bent on sabotaging the
U.S.-brokered peace deal were seized and had phones disconnected.
	   Later Friday night, the Palestinian cabinet ratified the Wye
River accord signed in Washington last week, though a few ministers
voted against it, senior Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel Rahim said. Rahim
did not elaborate on which ministers opposed the agreement or why.
	   Israel said the crackdown on Hamas, coming a day after a suicide
attack aimed at Israeli school children, was a positive sign, but
that Arafat needed to do more to earn the 13 percent of the West
Bank he was promised in the peace accord.
	   ``They must struggle firmly against ... the terror groups,''
said Israel's hawkish foreign minister, Ariel Sharon. ``If the
commitments are fulfilled, Israel will carry out its part.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that the Palestinian
Authority arrest Mohammed Deif, a leader of Hamas' military wing,
Izzedine al Qassam. Deif has masterminded several terror attacks
and has been in hiding in Gaza for three years.
	   Netanyahu said there was ``increasing suspicion'' that Deif was
involved in Thursday's bombing. If he is not caught, Netanyahu
said, more attacks that could derail the peace process are
inevitable.
	   Despite the tough words, however, a senior U.S. official said he
expected the timetable of the peace agreement to be kept.
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Palestinian Authority was expected to present a security work plan
to U.S. officials over the weekend. This, in turn, could pave the
way for Israeli Cabinet approval on Sunday of the Wye River accord.
	   In the meantime, Arafat is under tremendous pressure to prove to
Israel that his campaign against Hamas is different from past
sweeps in which hundreds were rounded up but then released.
	   At the same time, Arafat cannot risk provoking a bloody backlash
that could lead the Palestinians to the brink of civil war.
	   In the Sara neighborhood of Hamas founder Yassin, a slum of
unpaved alleys and crumbling homes, many feel Arafat has gone too
far already.
	   ``They surrounded his (Yassin's) home with armed officers as if
he was a criminal under arrest,'' said Omar Abul Subar, 42, wearing
a long robe, baggy pants and slippers as he emerged from the local
mosque.
	   In the long run, Arafat only will have broad public support for
a move against Hamas if the Israelis deliver their part of the
agreement _ releasing prisoners, opening the Gaza airport, opening
a land route between the West Bank and Gaza _ so the Palestinians
feel they have something to gain.
	   Palestinian commentator Ghassan Khatib cautioned that mass
arrests were no guarantee that violence against Israel will stop.
``Even if they manage to catch the right people, Hamas can always
recruit new ones and organize attacks,'' Khatib said.
	   Still, Arafat's adviser, Nabil Abourdeneh, made it clear that
the Palestinian leader was in no mood for compromise with Hamas.
``We will not allow any faction to stand in the way of liberating
Palestinian lands,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   Arafat has rounded up Hamas activists in the past, but this
marked the first time he arrested and silenced the entire
leadership within a day. In a sign that the campaign was not
confined to Gaza, Arafat's men on Friday prevented a planned Hamas
march in the West Bank town of Nablus.
	   It was also a first that Arafat took on Yassin, a quadriplegic
since his teens who is widely respected even by many outside Hamas
for building and funding clinics and schools.
	   Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi urged Arafat on Friday to lift
Yassin's house arrest.
	   ``It is unacceptable for Sheik Ahmed Yassin to be sent to a
Palestinian prison after being released from an Israeli jail,''
state-run Libyan television quoted Gadhafi as saying in a message
to Arafat.
 &UR; The roundup began Thursday, pick up 18th graf pvs.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Amid a show of force against the
Islamic militant group Hamas, the Palestinian cabinet ratified the
Wye River accord on Friday, a Palestinian official said.
	   Emerging from a cabinet meeting that lasted nearly five hours,
senior Arafat aide Tayeb Abdel Rahim said late Friday night that
the accord passed by a majority, with a few ministers voting
against it. He did not elaborate on who opposed it or why.
	   Rahim also defended the Palestinian Authority's crackdown on the
Islamic militant group Hamas, blaming the group for Thursday's
suicide attack against a bus in the Gaza Strip and accusing Hamas
of using violence to try to derail the peace process.
	   ``It is like they were telling (Benjamin) Netanyahu, `Why are
you agreeing to the withdrawal?''' Rahim said.
	   Since the attack, more than 100 Hamas activists, including
senior members, have been arrested. Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed
Yassin has been put under house arrest and his phone has been cut.
	   Rahim said that Hamas was acting against Palestinian national
interests and that the sanctions against Yassin would last as long
as Yassin continued to call for violent opposition to the
agreement.

Singh takes wild ride but keeps lead in Tour Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Vijay Singh experienced the best and the worst
that East Lake Golf Club had to offer on Friday. When his wild ride
was over, he was right back where he started _ atop the leaderboard
in the Tour Championship.
	   One day after his course-record 63, Singh recovered from a
disastrous start with birdies on six of the last 13 holes for an
even-par 70 that put him at 7-under 133 and gave him a two-stroke
lead over Jim Furyk.
	   ``What a comeback by Vijay,'' said Tom Lehman, four strokes off
the lead after a 71. ``It just shows that if you're not hitting it
quite right, you can make big numbers. And if you're hitting good
shots, you can make birdies.''
	   Singh did a little of both on a day in which the pendulum swung
wildly in both directions.
	   When he started the second round on another sunny afternoon with
slightly stronger wind, he was three strokes clear of the field. By
the time he walked off the fourth green, he was 5-over for the day
and his name wasn't even on the first two pages of the electronic
scoreboard.
	   ``That wasn't the way I wanted to start,'' Singh said. ``But I
hung in there. The first three holes wasn't the end for me. I
sorted it out along the way.''
	   That in itself was almost as gratifying as his first-round 63.
With wind picking up and the greens drying, East Lake played
tougher than the first round. Only five players managed to break
par for the day, and only four were still under par through 36
holes.
	   Furyk, coming off a victory two weeks ago in the Las Vegas
Invitational and the only player in the field with a chance of
surpassing David Duval atop the money list, had the only card
without a bogey _ a 2-under 68 that left him at 135.
	   Hal Sutton bogeyed the 18th from the rough for a round of 67 _
tied with Fred Couples for the lowest of the day _ and was three
strokes back at 136.
	   Six players were at even-par 140, including Couples and Justin
Leonard.
	   Duval, the defending champion, missed three putts inside three
feet (a meter) but still shot a 69 for 144. Last in the field of
the top 30 money-winners on the PGA Tour was Tiger Woods, who shot
a 76 for 11-over 151 and still hasn't made a birdie on East Lake.
	   ``I'm not sure this course favors anyone,'' Furyk said.
	   Couples was headed for a round of 65 that would have put him
right in the thick of it for the weekend. But he three-putted on
the 17th, and failed to save par from the bunker on No. 18.
	   ``I scored better,'' Couples said with a shrug. ``It's still
hard. If you miss a fairway, you're probably going to make bogey.
And if you hit the fairway, some of the holes are still no bargain.
It's going to be four hard days.''
	   Singh packed the drama of 72 holes into one afternoon.
	   After a bogey on No. 1 and a 5-foot (1.5-meter) putt to save par
on the second hole, he dropped off the map with a triple-bogey 7 on
the third hole that started when his approach found the back of a
bunker.
	   ``Someone didn't rake the bunker very well,'' he said.
	   He tried to punch it out, and knocked it clear over the green by
a good 20 yards (meters). His chip came up short into more rough,
then he chopped that out to eight 8 feet (2.5 meters) and
two-putted. After a bogey on the fourth, he suddenly found himself
two strokes out of the lead.
	   ``I almost lost the tournament today,'' Singh said. ``But I kept
my head today. I told my caddie, `Let's just get back to par for
the day.' That's what I'm most pleased about.''
	   Furyk, Sutton and Lehman all had at least a share of the lead at
one point Friday, but Singh never lost his confidence.
	   ``You're not going to lose your golf swing in a day,'' he said.
``I really hit it good coming down the stretch.''
	   And it showed. Singh went from slumping his shoulders and
dropping his club when the ball sailed off its line to staring it
down as it stopped near the flagstick. He got consecutive birdies
with wedges to eight feet (2.5 meters) on the 12th and 13th to get
back to 5-under, then added two more.
	   He drove into the rough on No. 16, a 481-yard (440-meter) par-4
that plays downhill but into the wind. He caught a decent lie and
ripped an 8-iron that bounded onto the green and stopped 15 feet
(4.5 meters) away for his sixth birdie of the day.
	   ``My game came back, and I gained some confidence,'' Singh said.
	   More importantly, he regained the lead.

American teen-ager beaten at Bell Challenge

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ France's Nathalie Dechy ended the surprising run
of American Alexandra Stevenson at the Bell Challenge, beating the
17-year-old tennis amateur 6-2, 7-6 (7-1) Friday to reach her first
ever semifinal.
	   ``What I wanted to do today was hold my serve, because I know
that she has a big serve,'' said Dechy, the eighth seed and world
No. 54. ``Once I did that, then I could try and focus on getting to
her serve.''
	   Dechy was broken only once while breaking Stevenson three times
in the first set and moved Stevenson around the court. Things
tightened in the second set before Dechy won the tiebreaker.
	   ``She puts the ball over, takes pace off and uses it to her
advantage,'' said Stevenson, ranked No. 140. ``I wasn't the
aggressor and was late to the ball. And my big weapon, my serve,
was off.''
	   Seventh-seeded Tara Snyder of the U.S. beat Romanian Catalina
Cristea 6-4, 6-4 in another quarterfinal. Since the French Open,
Snyder had failed to advance past the second round in eight
tournaments.

Officials investigating theft of American baseball players' wills

	   BOSTON (AP) _ Someone is stealing the wills of American baseball
Hall of Famers.
	   The last testaments wills of old-timers George Wright, Tommy
McCarthy and Hugh Duffy are missing from a courthouse vault, along
with the will of a fourth, unidentified baseball figure.
	   Now, the Suffolk County register of probate plans an inventory
to see if any other dead celebrities' papers have vanished.
	   ``As of today, we've once again tightened security. It's a sad
day for the commonwealth to think that people can't come in to
freely look at these files, which are public records,'' Register of
Probate Richard Iannella said.
	   On Friday, Iannella said a source contacted him after reading an
Associated Press account of the thefts on the Internet and told him
that McCarthy's stolen will and possibly others were advertised for
sale in a collectors' magazine.
	   ``We have the name of a dealer now who has been selling this
stuff across the country,'' Iannella said. He would not identify
the source.
	   Earlier this week, Iannella learned that Leland's Auctions, a
New York sports memorabilia dealer, had in its catalog a document
signed by Wright upon the death of his wife, Abbie, in 1913.
	   Iannella then learned that the couple's wills were missing,
along with the wills of McCarthy and Duffy. In fact, McCarthy's
entire file appeared to have been stolen.
	   And the will of a fourth person Iannella said was connected to
baseball is also missing. Ianella would not identify that person.
	   ``My hunch is that more has been stolen,'' said Iannella, who
plans to turn the matter over to the police after he does an
inventory.
	   Wright, McCarthy and Duffy were among the earliest stars of
organized baseball.
	   Wright, an infielder, was considered one of the best ballplayers
in the United States in the 1860s and '70s. He played with the
Boston Red Stockings, the Providence Grays and the Washington
Nationals. He is also credited with introducing golf to Boston, and
a municipal course in the Hyde Park district bears his name. Wright
died in 1937 at the age of 90.
	   Duffy and McCarthy were known as ``the Heavenly Twins'' in the
1890s, when they played the outfield with Boston's National League
team, known variously as the Braves and the Beaneaters.
	   Leland's paid about dlrs 2,000 for the Wright document at a
sports memorabilia show, but it was unclear who sold it, said Irwin
Kishner, the firm's lawyer. Kisher said that upon learning it was
stolen, Leland's immediately returned the form and is out the
entire dlrs 2,000.
	   Kishner said Leland's will no longer deal in antique legal
documents.
	   Beginning in February 1997, Iannella said, people looking at
probate records had to show ID and fill out forms with their names
and the documents they wished to see. But he said he had no way of
knowing when the baseball documents were stolen.
	   Legal documents are about the way of obtaining the autographs of
the very early ballplayers.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an
upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the
sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or
weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 60 of them.
	   Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them
severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick
two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a
boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of
moments.
	   Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the
panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,
exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400
people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass and
bloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''
17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined
building Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance and
two male friends of hers died.
	   Many young people also gathered outside the dance hall building
Friday evening. Memorial bouquets of fresh flowers lay on the
pavement where the victims had lain, and mourners placed scores of
candles on the ground, the flames commemorating those lost to other
flames.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Sam Gadless was in his 70s, his body was a
mess and a doctor told him he might not last much longer. He
decided it was a good time to start life over again.
	   On Sunday, at 91, he's competing in his seventh New York City
Marathon, along with his son and grandson. ``If you can do it, I
can do it!'' he yelled at fellow runners last year at the starting
line.
	   This year, as the 26.2-mile (42.16-kilometer) marathon's oldest
entrant, the Boca Raton, Florida, resident hopes to beat his 1997
time of 8 hours, 10 minutes. It would be a triumph of mind over
body, since Gadless missed six weeks of training this year
recovering from being hit by a car Sept. 1.
	   If the Einstein lookalike with the flying white hair makes it,
he'll cross the finish line in Central Park Sunday wearing a
peace-and-love ring in his left ear.
	   ``I had one ear pierced for my 90th birthday. There was so much
killing in my life that we need to run for love and peace,'' said
Gadless, his English thick with the Yiddish he spoke as a child in
his native Poland.
	   He survived German attacks in World War I and avoided the
Holocaust by boarding a ship in the early 1930s and landing in
Cuba. He spent nearly two years there before sailing to New York.
	   Later, as an immigrant tailor in California, he chain-smoked his
way through hard times until an ulcer forced him to have more than
half his stomach removed.
	   ``I was very unhealthy all my life and I don't have good
genes,'' he says. ``My father died when he was 42.''
	   When he moved to Florida during the 1970s, he had arthritis so
severe he couldn't lift an arm and had to have the bones in his big
toes replaced with artificial ones. His cholesterol and blood
pressure were high and he was a borderline diabetic.
	   The future looked bleak, a doctor told him.
	   Then Gadless started reading ``Prevention'' magazine and other
health publications. He entered his first New York City Marathon at
85, and has since completed races in Los Angeles, Buffalo, Miami
and Orlando.
	   His secret?
	   He cooks his own meals, skipping meat, dairy products, sugar and
white flour, and eating fruit, vegetables and grains _ with some
red wine. He also eats red salmon, sardines and white tuna.
	   ``I don't eat the bad stuff, like milkshakes, or the (matzo
ball) soup my wife used to cook,'' with butter or chicken fat.
	   He's replaced it with a 16-bean soup. ``And I eat garlic by the
pound. It's an antibiotic,'' he said.
	   Gadless trains by doing aerobics, stretching and swimming, as
well as light weightlifting. And he walks up to 40 miles (60
kilometers) per week, alternating among 10 pairs of shoes.
	   He has to watch his money, since he lives off a dlrs 755 monthly
Social Security check, plus help from his children. He lost most of
his life's savings paying his late wife's nursing home bills.
	   Gadless goes into Sunday's race hoping to acquire a corporate
sponsor. This year, marathon sponsors didn't pay his expenses to
New York as they had in the past.
	   Three years ago he was surprised by his 56-year-old son, Lou,
and grandson, Steve, 26. They trained secretly so they could be at
the start line as ``Team Gadless'' with T-shirts that read, ``Three
Generations'' _ one with ``Grandpa,'' the others ``Son'' and
``Grandson.''
	   ``Age is just numbers,'' Gadless said. ``When I was younger, I
was sick as could be. I'm living my youth now.''

Surge in AIDS cases threatens young female population in Trinidad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A sudden surge in HIV infections
is threatening the population of women of child-bearing age on this
twin-island Caribbean nation, the chief medical officer warned.
	   Dr. Rawle Edwards said Friday the rate of infection of people
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, jumped from 35 cases per
100,000 population in 1996 to an estimated 300 cases per 100,000
this year.
	   In the 15-to -19 year-old group, seven times as many females as
males are infected, most through heterosexual contact, Edwards
said.
	   ``At this rate, our young female population of child-bearing age
will be decimated,'' said Edwards. ``Let us no longer deceive
ourselves into believing that this is a disease which only affects
homosexuals and drug users.''
	   Edwards said a pattern of older men infecting young women and
minors has been detected. Part of the cure consists of building
better self-esteem among young women and urging better educated
women to help counsel younger, more vulnerable females, he said.
	   The virus threatens to become entrenched in Trinidad and Tobago,
a two-island nation of 1.2 million people off the coast of
Venezuela, Edwards said.
	   ``We have been averaging some 35 deaths per month from the
disease,'' he said.
	   In the United States, an estimated 0.76 percent of the
population carries the virus, while infection rates are estimated
to be as high as 25 percent in some African countries.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose broadly Friday as the Dow
industrials finished its best month in nearly 12 years. The gains
came on signs the economy is stronger than expected, bolstering the
outlook for corporate profits, and as the world's wealthiest
nations moved to speed their response to global economic turmoil.
The Dow Jones industrial average, up 123.06 on Thursday, added
97.07 _ or 1.1 percent _ to close at 8,592.10. It was the highest
finish since Aug. 25, before the worst of a nerve-racking selloff.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. economic growth perked up over the summer
as healthy consumer spending offset a continued decline in export
sales and a dramatic slowdown in business investment. ``In the face
of worldwide economic turmoil our economy remains the strongest in
a generation,'' President Bill Clinton said at the White House.
``But to keep it going we must stay with the strategy that created
the conditions of this enduring economic expansion and we must
address the challenges of the global economy,'' he said. The gross
domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced within
U.S. borders, advanced at a 3.3 percent seasonally adjusted annual
rate in the July-September quarter, the Commerce Department said
Friday. (US-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Group of Seven major industrial nations
announced a series of new policies for global finance Friday,
including International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending
facilities for countries to draw on in times of crisis. In
announcing the policies, British treasury chief Gordon Brown said
the nations had in recent weeks taken steps to increase IMF quotas
and implement the new borrowing arrangements, providing an extra
dlrs 90 billion ``to ensure the stability of the international
financial system.'' The emergency borrowing program, available to
countries pursuing IMF-approved policies, would be ``accompanied by
appropriate private sector involvement,'' Brown said. The IMF loan
mechanism is likely to be employed almost immediately as part of an
expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for Brazil, the latest
country to be pummeled by frightened investors. (G7-WORLD ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Finance ministers from the world's wealthiest
nations Friday called for speedy implementation of the previously
agreed dlrs 90 billion increase in International Monetary Fund
reserves. In a communique, the G-7 ministers said, ``We welcome the
positive steps that have been taken toward the implementation of
the IMF quota increase and the new arrangements to borrow. We call
for these to be implemented as soon as possible. Together they will
provide additional resources of dlrs 90 billion for the IMF.''
Congress approved the dlrs 18 billion U.S. share of the increased
funding after stalling over the issue for a year. The U.S. decision
opens the way for the other 181 IMF member nations to make their
contributions to the funding increase. (G7-IMF)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After 12 years of negotiations, China is still
unwilling to make the market-opening concessions needed to join the
World Trade Organization, a European delegation said Friday. ``We
have made progress, but we have not made sufficient progress,'' Sir
Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Union's executive
agency, said after two days of meetings in Beijing. China argues it
has gone a long way toward meeting membership conditions of the
rule-setting body for world trade. It has accused WTO members of
demanding too many concessions. But Brittan, the EU's trade chief,
said, ``China so far has not been prepared to move sufficiently in
opening up its markets to financial services, to insurance,
banking, and securities'' and telecommunications. (CHINA-EU)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's head office said
Friday it was pushing ahead with legal action against eight EU
member nations over their privileged civil aviation deals with the
United States. ``The impact of the deals is detrimental to our own
market,'' said Sarah Lambert, transport spokeswoman for the
European Commission. She said the Commission was taking Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and Britain
to the EU's high court over the deals. The eight countries have
bilateral agreements with the United States under which both sides
exclusively ensure each other's carriers the right to fly between
their territories. (EU-US-AVIATION)

Catastrophic flooding in Nicaragua and Honduras; at least 99 dead

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Floodwaters unleashed by Tropical
Storm Mitch rose quickly across Honduras and Nicaragua, trapping
tens of thousands of people with little food or water and raising
the number of confirmed dead to 99.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard continued Friday to search for a
four-masted schooner missing since Tuesday off the Honduran coast.
The Fantome, a Windjammer Barefoot Cruises yacht once owned by
Aristotle Onassis, had 31 people aboard.
	   The National Hurricane Center said that at midnight GMT Friday,
the storm was centered about 35 miles (55 kms) north-northeast of
the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. It was heading west-southwest at
6 mph (9 kph). Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (85 kph),
down from 180 mph (290 kph) early Tuesday.
	   The once-fierce hurricane, reduced to a mild tropical storm,
continued to dump water on already flooded towns and farmland. In
some areas, as much as 2 feet (60 cms) of rain fell within six
hours, and the National Weather Service said some areas could
expect up to 2 feet (60 cms) more.
	   The waters sparked mudslides that cut off the highway between
the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the country's second-biggest city,
San Pedro Sula. In the southern city of Choluteca, a mudslide
buried a family of six on Thursday, the Red Cross said Friday.
	   In all, 56 deaths were confirmed in Honduras, including 14 on
the Bay Islands that house many popular diving resorts. Fifty
people were missing in the city of Comayagua in central Honduras
after the Salistroso River swept away 150 houses.
	   On Friday, Juan Padilla, police chief of coastal Santa Rosa de
Aguan, reported 27 people had died in the town because of flooding.
	   In addition, one prisoner was shot to death and two were wounded
when they tried to escape during the evacuation of Tegucigalpa's
Central Penitentiary. The building was starting to collapse in the
floodwaters, and the three men broke through a wall. The death was
not included in the official count.
	   In Nicaragua, the official death toll climbed fast as reports
came in from areas cut off by the floods. Defense Minister Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro said 42 people died.
	   Mexico reported one fatality, an American who was thrown from
his boat south of Cancun on Monday and presumed dead.
	   A Coast Guard C-130 was searching the Caribbean Sea for a
240-foot (73 meter) schooner with 31 people aboard that was missing
since Tuesday. The Antigua-registered Fantome was on a tourist
cruise near Belize and the Bay Islands when it disappeared.
	   Many towns in both Nicaragua and Honduras remained incommunicado
because of downed bridges and washed-out roads, and officials
expected the death toll to rise.
	   Honduran Foreign Minister Fernando Martinez said the United
States and Taiwan each had donated dlrs 500,000.
	   In Chamelecon, a southern suburb of San Pedro Sula, people
walked through waist-deep water carrying televisions, refrigerators
and furniture to load up on trucks as they moved into shelters.
More than 30,000 people were in shelters in San Pedro Sula alone.
	   In one gymnasium, 2,000 people spread out through the stands and
the basketball court, sleeping on pieces of cardboard as chickens
and dogs wandered among their belongings. There was little to eat
and only rainwater to drink.
	   ``They've given us very little food _ just a little bread,
nothing more. I have no money and can't get in touch with my other
relatives,'' said Estela Munoz, 49.
	   In La Ceiba, near the center of the storm, the floodwaters began
to recede Friday as a calm fell over the city that some residents
attributed to the storm's eye.
	   Rescuers were able for the first time since Wednesday to reach
the Armenia Bonito neighborhood, where flash floods tore apart all
but a tiny hilltop. Six families had huddled on that hilltop
without even a tree to shelter them since the flood came.
	   The rheumatism in his right leg had prevented Jose Martinez, 70,
from evacuating. His wife, Ermina, gathered together their nine
children and grandchildren and climbed the hill.
	   ``We had nothing to eat. We couldn't even sleep,'' Martinez
said. ``We had to remain standing, with only one tarp to cover the
children. It's a miracle of God that we are alive.''
	   On Friday, the fierce current dropped to waist-level and
neighbors formed a human chain to help the families to the other
side. One carried Martinez across on his back.
	   On the other side, the neighbors offered them coconut water.
	   It was all they had.

Talks to resume Monday and Wednesday

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The sense of urgency that was so prevalent in
the American National Basketall Association labor talks just a few
days ago seemed to dissipate as the opposing sides announced they
wouldn't meet again until Monday.
	   ``In our view, clearly the owners are slowing things down. We're
not sure why,'' Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside attorney for the
players' union said Friday. ``Maybe they think they went too far,
or maybe they think the extra time will create pressure that will
help them.''
	   The NBA season was to start Tuesday, but the entire month of
November already has been wiped from the schedule due to the
lockout.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit players from
working until a deal is reached. The collective bargaining
agreement sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issues in the work stoppage are the owners'
insistence on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   Monday's meeting will be among attorneys only, and the full
negotiating committees won't meet again until Wednesday _ the day
after the regular season was to begin.
	   By the time the weekend ends, the sides will have had almost
four full days to go over the progress they made this week in
setting up a loose framework for the next collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Despite having the ``skeleton'' of a deal, as NBA commissioner
David Stern called it, the sides remain far apart on the major
economic details, as well as several major non-economic issues.
	   ``David Stern is going to want to have the last word on this.
He's going to drag it out,'' said Dwight Manley, the agent for Karl
Malone and Dennis Rodman. ``Stern knows exactly when the drop dead
date is, and he wants players to miss paychecks.''
	   Manley's words of pessimism were representative of a feeling
around the NBA community that the lockout may last much longer.
	   With each week the stalemate persists, another week of the
season will be scrapped.
	   ``Stern wants to dictate everything,'' Manley said. ``Look at
his history of walking out of meetings and hanging up the phone on
people. He did it to me in New York when I was there with Dennis,
and he's done it in these talks. That's how he's going to try to
have the final say,'' Manley said.
	   Stern did not comment Friday, nor did deputy commissioner Russ
Granik or union director Billy Hunter.
	   The biggest hang-up remains what percentage of revenues will be
devoted to salaries by the time the new system has been in place
for a few years.

G-7 agrees to boost IMF power to fight financial turmoil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Trying to curb a global economic crisis, the
world's seven richest industrial countries endorsed new proposals
that President Bill Clinton said should provide needed assurances
to jittery markets.
	   ``The world's leading economies have linked arms to contain the
financial turmoil,'' the president said Friday at the White House.
He also hailed news that despite the global turbulence, the U.S.
economy grew at a healthy 3.3 percent annual rate from July to
September.
	   The package's key element is the endorsement by the Group of
Seven countries of a Clinton proposal that would allow the
International Monetary Fund to provide loans to countries before
foreign investors begin fleeing.
	   U.S. officials say the new IMF loan idea will probably play a
role in an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package being put
together for Brazil, the latest country to be threatened by
investor flight that has already hurt Russia and several nations in
Asia.
	   ``This line of credit gives us a powerful new tool that can be
used when it will do the most good at the lowest cost, before the
trouble starts,'' Clinton said.
	   In a flurry of activity four days before U.S. mid-term
elections, the Clinton administration produced both a joint
statement from G-7 leaders and a declaration by G-7 finance
ministers and central bank presidents that is the most detailed
blueprint to date of how the current economic crisis can be
contained _ and how future crises can be averted.
	   The G-7 leaders also endorsed a new emergency lending facility
at the 182-member World Bank, which could be used to provide
support for poor people and loan guarantees for businesses that are
endangered by economic turbulence.
	   Wall Street and other markets rallied on the newfound resolve
among the G-7 countries _ the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The Dow Jones industrial average
ended the day up nearly 100 points. Brazilian share prices rallied
strongly on growing optimism about international support.
	   A Brazilian finance team also was headed to Washington for talks
with IMF officials.
	   Private economists said the G-7 statement was a welcome change
from meetings earlier this month in Washington that produced more
discord than agreement. At the time, other G-7 countries agreed
only to ``explore'' Clinton's ideas.
	   ``This is a belated attempt by the G-7 to support markets and
ease fears,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Global
Economics.
	   ``The critical point is that the G-7, which had for some time
appeared divided and fragmented, has now pulled together with a
strategic plan,'' said Robert Hormats, economist at Goldman Sachs
in New York.
	   But analysts say much work still needs to be done to implement
vague pledges to promote greater openness in the release of
financial data and stronger financial regulation.
	   Clinton administration officials took note of several positive
developments in recent weeks, including Congress' approval of dlrs
18 billion to replenish IMF resources, passage of a plan to deal
with insolvent banks in Japan and interest rate cuts in the United
States and other countries, which should help ward off the threat
of global recession.
	   But Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin refused to declare the
15-month-long crisis at an end, saying ``I think there will be ups
and downs.''
	   The G-7 nations also pledged to work toward reforms at the IMF,
which has been criticized for its handling of the Asian crisis.
Those reforms, including less secrecy in dealings with member
countries and more efforts to promote free-market reforms, had been
conditions attached by Congress to the dlrs 18 billion U.S.
contribution toward a dlrs 90 billion increase in IMF resources.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanians want
independence. Yugoslavia says forget it and the international
community agrees, at least for now.
	   Such a major difference has left the Albanian majority feeling
double-teamed and confused, wondering why Western powers preach
democracy but reject its demand for a referendum on independence.
	   Instead, the United States and European nations are pressing for
substantial self-rule for the Kosovo Albanians, but under a formula
that would keep them within President Slobodan Milosevic's
Yugoslavia.
	   ``The international community says the best solution is to not
let people say what they want,'' chief Albanian negotiator Fehmi
Agani said Friday. ``Politics has pragmatic logic. It doesn't have
real logic.''
	   The question of how much self-rule Kosovo should have is crucial
to ending a conflict that could spread elsewhere in the Balkans.
Both the Albanians and Serbs appear intransigent, casting doubt on
chances for immediate progress.
	   Failure to reach some kind of political agreement would allow
the tension and deep hatreds to simmer all winter, possibly
bringing fresh fighting in the spring thaw.
	   With roots dating back at least nine years, when then-Serbian
Communist Party chief Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its autonomous
status, the conflict has grown into a violent uprising and spawned
an ethnic Albanian guerrilla movement.
	   Hundreds of people died in seven months of fighting after a Serb
crackdown on Albanian separatists began in February.
	   Fearing further warfare and a humanitarian catastrophe for
refugees forced into the woods, a Western pressure campaign backed
by threatened NATO airstrikes forced Milosevic to agree to withdraw
some forces and seek a political solution.
	   But the core issue of who should rule Kosovo has stymied efforts
by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill to get negotiations started.
	   An initial model calls for autonomy for Kosovo with the
possibility of a review in three years. During that time, Kosovo
could rebuild the local institutions it lost in 1989.
	   Any agreement stops there.
	   While ethnic Albanian guerrillas call for independence now, most
ethnic Albanians would likely accept granting Kosovo the same
status as Serbia and Montenegro _ the two republics that comprise
Yugoslavia _ during the three-year interim period.
	   After that, even the ``moderates'' want a referendum on
independence.
	   ``Independence is the best solution for Kosovo and stability in
the region,'' the province's chief ethnic Albanian politician
Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   Agani, Rugova's chief negotiator, said continued Serbian rule
means more discrimination and ``genocide'' for Albanians.
	   ``Being inside Serbia, that means working by its laws,'' he
said. ``We'd organize a kind of province that has its own
structures, but no power of its own.''
	   A Serb official said any solution must respect the ``national
integrity and sovereignty'' of Yugoslavia.
	   ``Independence after three years is out of the question,'' said
Zoran Andjelkovic, head of a Serb-appointed interim government in
Kosovo. ``After the three years, we will continue our discussions
to see whether the solution which we come up with now is final or
needs some changes.''
	   Hill said Washington also opposes independence for Kosovo.
	   ``We do not feel it would be a stabilizing factor in the
region,'' he said, referring to fears that Albanians in neighboring
Macedonia also would start independence campaigns.
	   ``We do not see that the Serbs are going to be able to support
Kosovo's independence, and therefore it's a rather difficult
proposition at this point to negotiate,'' Hill said.
	   That brought a derisive response from Agani.
	   ``I welcome their good intentions, but when they have to face
such difficulty from Serbia, they think it is easier for Kosovo to
change,'' he said, adding that anything short of freedom from Serb
rule will mean continued conflict.
	   ``We cannot set ourselves free,'' he warned, ``but we can keep
Serbia in a crisis situation all the time.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Prosecutors are asking former Colombian
national team coach Francisco Maturana to explain 10 checks he
received from a jailed Cali drug cartel kingpin, they said Friday.
	   Maturana, who just took charge of Costa Rica's national team and
recently coached Ecuador's, is being investigated for possible
``illicit enrichment,'' the chief prosecutor's office said.
	   Maturana coached the Cali club America in 1992, when he received
the checks from Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. Although he did not
carry the title of club president, Rodriguez owned and ran the
club, Maturana has acknowledged.
	   Maturana coached Colombia in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. He
coached Atletico Madrid and Real Valladolid in Spain in 1993-94.
	   Miguel Rodriguez and his brother Gilberto, who ran the Cali
cartel, were captured in 1995 and convicted of drug trafficking.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A peasant in the
southern state of Chiapas alleges he was questioned for four hours
by soldiers who searched his belongings and found a book about
Gandhi.
	   According to the complaint, Julio Cesar Sanchez was on an
intercity bus which was searched at a military checkpoint in
Ocosingo _ a routine practice since Zapatista rebels arrived here
in 1994.
	   Soldiers found papers by Indian independence leader Mohandas
Gandhi on non-violent resistance, said Fernando Michel, spokesman
for the Peace Education Collective, a non-government organization.
	   Capt. Gerardo Meza Mata, spokesman for the local military
detachment, declined to comment.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army briefly rose up in arms
in 1994 to demand better conditions for the state's poor indigenous
population. Peace talks with the government have stalled since
1996.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The family of former President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari benefited from a government-proposed bank bailout by
about dlrs 5 million, according to a legislative study.
	   The bank bailout, proposed last March by President Ernesto
Zedillo, could cost Mexican taxpayers up to dlrs 55 billion.
Opposition lawmakers have said it would benefit still-wealthy
individuals whose bad debts were picked up in the process.
	   The newspaper La Jornada reported Friday that the study by
lawmakers from the leftist Democratic Revolution Party concluded
that loans totaling dlrs 4.9 million made to Adriana Salinas _
sister of the former president _ and her husband Luis Yanez were
absorbed by the Deposit Protection Fund, known as Fobaproa.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's presidential race between
a failed coup leader and a Yale-trained economist is narrowing
slightly, according to a poll Friday.
	   Former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who staged a bloody coup attempt
against the government six years ago, has seen his lead over former
state governor Henrique Salas Romer trimmed from 10 to 6 percentage
points since September, said Datanalisis' poll published in El
Universal newspaper.
	   The new poll found that 45 percent of surveyed Venezuelans
planned to vote for Chavez in the Dec. 6 presidential election, up
from 42 percent.
	   Meanwhile, 39 percent planned to vote for Salas, up from 31
percent. Much of his gain appears to come from voters who have
abandoned languishing candidates.
	   The poll was conducted from Oct. 19 to 23 and canvassed a total
of 1,200 Venezuelans. The poll had a margin of error of plus or
minus 2.8 percentage points.
	   Salas is seen as a centrist, anti-Chavez consensus candidate.
Chavez, who touts populist and nationalist issues, has raised the
ire of the rich who fear he will roll back economic liberalization
reforms.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Former president
Joaquin Balaguer, 92, is among more than 100 witnesses called to
testify at the trial of six former military officers accused of a
1975 political assassination.
	   The defendants are accused of killing journalist Orlando
Martinez, a strong critic of then-president Balaguer and the
military leadership, accusing them of frequent human rights
violations.
	   The investigation languished for years until 1997, when current
President Leonel Fernandez ordered prosecutors to bring the case to
trial. The trial is expected to begin Thursday.
	   Balaguer, who was president for 22 years over three decades,
wrote a book in which he left one page blank. That page was left
for what he called the true story about Martinez's death and would
be revealed after Balaguer died.
	   Balaguer, infirm, and legally blind, was re-elected to a
four-year term in 1994, but left office in 1996 under international
pressure because of widespread evidence of fraud in his election
victory.

	   MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AP) _ Calling themselves ideological
orphans, leftists from throughout Latin America met here Friday,
hoping to unite as a renewed political force and to fight
free-market free trade pacts.
	   Some 50 left-wing Latin American congressmen and academics
attended the Sao Paulo Forum in Mexico City to discuss ways to
strengthen the hemisphere's leftist movements.
	   Latin America's left has had mixed success over the past decade
since the collapse of socialist bloc in Europe and the end of most
guerrilla conflicts in the Americas.
	   It has won mayoral races several major cities _ including this
one _ and many seats in national congresses, but no major
presidency.
	   ``On the people's level, we are not coordinated,'' said
Uruguayan legislator Raul Sol. ``Many times even though we
represent parties with a long history of friendship, we don't even
talk to each other at world parliamentary meetings.''
	   ``This way, my friends, we influence very little, or more likely
nothing.''
	   Many of the participants said the biggest challenge is to halt
the spread of free-market reforms which they believe have increased
poverty for the majority while making a few better off.
	   ``We need to act quickly as an influential force in view of the
fact that our governments are condemned to reproduce the North
American Free Trade Agreement model across Latin America,'' said
Congressman Jesus Martin del Campo of Mexico's left-leaning
Democratic Revolution Party.
	   Delegates said they want to work together to modify trade
agreements to ensure greater rights and protection for small
businessmen and workers.
	   This year's forum was poorly attended compared to previous ones,
which have drawn as many as 180 participants.

War crimes tribunal accuses Yugoslavia of flaunting
</HEADLINE>
responsibilities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. tribunal for former Yugoslavia
has accused the Yugoslav government of flaunting its responsibility
to hand over war crimes suspects for a fifth year.
	   In its annual report to the U.N. Security Council, the tribunal
said Yugoslavia ``persists in its refusal'' to cooperate and urged
the international community to take action to ensure Belgrade's
compliance.
	   The report did not specify what action should be taken, but
earlier this month, the tribunal's president, Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald, told the Security Council it had the duty to enforce
resolutions demanding that Belgrade turn over war crimes suspects
from Balkan conflicts.
	   McDonald called on the council to issue a resolution to remind
Belgrade that it has a legal obligation to turn the men over.
	   ``It seems to me that the `deploring' and `condemning' language
is helpful, but stronger actions need to be taken,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't specify what particular actions, but it seems to me that
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be told that the time is
now, in fact long overdue, in terms of responding to its
obligations.''
	   The report released Friday noted that 31 people who have been
publicly indicted for alleged war crimes ``continue to enjoy
absolute impunity.''
	   ``The experience of recent years in the former Yugoslavia has
shown that the only effective response to such events is a firm and
timely one. While prevention is still possible, it is imperative
that this experience is applied constructively,'' it said.
	   The report said the tribunal's ``significant breakthrough'' in
starting to dispense justice during the past year remains ``modest
considering the shocking atrocities that were committed in the
former Yugoslavia.''

	   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) _ When Jaho Mulosmani swaggers into
the Mountain Breeze Bar, the pistol-packing drinkers hush up.
Mulosmani is reputedly the toughest character in this trigger-happy
border town. He's also the new police chief.
	   ``I will bring law and order to this town,'' says the commander,
whose diminutive stature is offset by high-heeled leather boots.
	   His long curly hair, black leather jacket and saucer-sized belt
buckle recall 1980s chic, the predominant male fashion in Bajram
Curri, a lawless town of 6,000 people near the border with
Yugoslavia.
	   ``First thing I need is more guns so we (the police) can match
the civilians,'' he said.
	   Car theft rather than cattle-rustling is the staple of crime
here. Otherwise, Bajram Curri is right out of the Old West days of
lawlessness and violence in the 19th-century United States,
complete with quick-draw lawmen and family feuds.
	   It's been this way since March 1997, when nationwide rioting,
sparked by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, resulted in
more than 1 million weapons being looted from military arsenals.
	   Prior to that time, the town had been under government control,
providing a bit more order, although corruption has been rampant
here since 1992.
	   As in other towns in this country, Bajram Curri faces a dizzying
rise in violent crime unchecked by untrained and often corrupt
police. Recent photos of the town are hard to come by; displaying
an expensive camera in public is a good way to make the
acquaintance of some of the town's most notorious armed robbers.
	   National efforts to round up the weapons have had virtually no
success, particularly in the mountainous north, where killings go
uninvestigated and farmers protect their crops with machine guns.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe keeps
six international representatives here to monitor the
Albania-Yugoslavia border.
	   The OSCE representatives, from Europe and the United States, are
forced to travel on foot or hitch rides after masked bandits stole
both their trucks this month. They often see one of the trucks
around town but can do nothing to get it back.
	   ``Police don't have a hot-pursuit policy here,'' said one of the
representatives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We told
them where the thieves went with our truck and they headed in the
opposite direction.''
	   Last month, the government asked Mulosmani to head Bajram
Curri's 170-man police force, mostly reservists, when the former
chief left town after only six months on the job, fearing the wrath
of disgruntled townspeople.
	   That chief had replaced an official who was accused of killing
nine members of a rival family, including one of his own men, and
who has since fortified his home with sandbags and never leaves
without a flak jacket and armed bodyguards.
	   Mulosmani says he is ready to shoot at criminals. He has,
however, denied allegations by opposition politicians that he was
behind the killing of a Democratic Party leader, Azem Hajdari,
whose death in September triggered riots in the capital, Tirana.
	   ``Hajdari was a chicken thief,'' Mulosmani said. ``But I didn't
kill him.''
	   A 25-year-old policeman who gave only his first name, Agem, says
the quick-draw reputation of a police chief like Mulosmani is the
only thing preventing further anarchy in Bajram Curri.
	   ``Going out after dark is crazy,'' said Pierre Maurer, the
leader of the OSCE here. ``You won't make it to the corner before
you're robbed or shot.''
	   At night, OSCE representatives and a few humanitarian workers
retreat to the local hotel bar, while gunfire crackles along nearby
streets.
	   Asgen Haklaj, who tries to run town hall while the mayor is on
indefinite leave elsewhere, says at least half of adult men and
almost all women are unemployed.
	   Nobody in Bajram Curri has paid taxes, electricity or water
bills for at least two years, he said.
	   Haklaj laughs when asked if the police help him collect taxes.
	   ``One of the police officers shot me in the leg in May,'' he
complained. ``I can't even get him demoted, let alone fired.''

Council nears agreement on review of Iraq's U.N. compliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS, UPDATES with Security Council approving letter on
review. EDITS to conform, trim. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council has agreed on the
broad outlines of a review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions, a step aimed at getting Baghdad to resume cooperation
with weapons inspectors.
	   The ``comprehensive review'' endorsed Friday does not include
assurances sought by Baghdad _ and pushed by Russia and China _
that the assessment would lead to the lifting of harsh economic
sanctions imposed against Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Even if the council ultimately determines that Iraq has fully
complied with all U.N. resolutions, diplomats said a separate
review of sanctions would need to be held by the council.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, the council president,
said all 15 council members had agreed on the text of a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the general framework for the
review.
	   Annan suggested the review to persuade Iraq to rescind its Aug.
5 decision to stop cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspection
team, which has halted spot searches of suspected weapons sites.
	   Iraq ended its cooperation when the chief weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, refused to state that Baghdad had destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction _ the key requirement for lifting the
crippling sanctions.
	   As envisioned by the council, a review would start ``a very
short time'' after Iraq resumes cooperation with the weapons
inspectors.
	   The first phase of the review would assess Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions on disarmament, which call for the
destruction of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the
missiles to deliver them. The review would also cover arrangements
for ongoing monitoring and verification.
	   The second phase would examine Iraq's compliance with all other
U.N. resolutions.
	   In periodic reviews since 1990, the council has maintained
sanctions in light of evidence that Iraq continues to conceal
elements of its weapons programs, most recently biological weapons.
	   Iraq would be invited to contribute its own account of its
compliance, but the letter made no mention of Iraq's request that
outside experts be allowed to participate in the review.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has
met with the head of South Korea's largest conglomerate in his
first such meeting with a prominent South Korean since taking power
as head of the reclusive country, an official news report said
Saturday.
	   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim
welcomed Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder and honorary chairman of the
Hyundai group, and his family and ``had a cordial talk with them.''
	   The KCNA gave no further details.
	   Chung was expected to return home later Saturday by crossing the
heavily armed border separating North and South Korea. He had been
scheduled to depart Friday, but extended his visit for a fifth day
in order to meet North Korean leader Kim.
	   Kim, 56, took over leadership duties after his father, Kim Il
Sung, died in 1994 and currently rules as chairman of North Korea's
National Defense Commission, which oversees the country's 1.1
million-strong military.
	   The military is the world's fifth largest armed force and forms
the backbone of the power structure in the belligerent, Marxist
country.
	   The Hyundai chief began his trip, the second such visit in four
months, on Tuesday to discuss tourism and proposed joint venture
projects.
	   Hyundai already has obtained North Korean approval to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for a four-day
tour of Diamond Mountain, a scenic attraction on the North's east
coast.
	   But South Korean officials have expressed reservations due to
safety and communications concerns.
	   The sightseeing tour would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   Hyundai also hopes to make headway on a number of other joint
venture projects in the North, including offshore oil exploration,
car assembly and construction of an industrial complex and ship
repair yard.
	   South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung has actively pushed for
non-governmental contacts with North Korea under his ``sunshine
policy'' aimed at opening up the North's closed society.

American Airlines, British Airways consider phased-in alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN MONTOYA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS, Texas (AP) _ American Airlines and British Airways have
discussed plans to phase in their transatlantic partnership more
slowly in order to please regulators, but remain committed to a
full-fledged alliance.
	   American spokesman Chris Chiames said Friday that the two
airlines first considered edging into an alliance last spring after
British regulators demanded that British Airways give up hundreds
of its takeoff and landing spots at London's Heathrow airport in
exchange for approval of the alliance.
	   ``It was part of an effort to give regulators and government
officials some options,'' Chiames said. ``The two governments have
been kind of boxed in by other airlines'' who don't favor the
alliance.
	   Chiames said scaling back plans for the partnership is the best
option the two companies have at getting approval from regulators.
The alliance, which would be the largest in the world, would allow
the two carriers to coordinate fares and flight schedules.
	   He said a phased-in alliance might also persuade U.S. regulators
to approve a so-called ``open skies'' agreement _ a new aviation
treaty between the United States and Britain that would allow any
airline in either country to fly across the Atlantic and land at
any airport it chooses in the two countries.
	   Under the current aviation treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two
U.S. carriers _ American and United Airlines _ are allowed to fly
into Heathrow.
	   U.S. officials have said there would be no approval of the
proposed alliance until Britain signs off on the open skies
proposal.
	   ``We think that both sides, meaning the U.S. and British
governments, are interested in open skies and liberating the
aviation market, but they've become paralyzed by other airlines who
are against it,'' Chiames.
	   Negotiators also have discussed plans that would gradually open
access to Heathrow, instead of immediately as proposed. The United
States already has similar phased-access agreements with Japan and
France.
	   Chiames said any progress on ``open skies'' would help American
Airlines and British Airways reach a partnership sooner.

With Pinochet arrest, Chileans admit justice is a pending task

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on a
Spanish warrant in Britain has prompted calls here for homegrown
justice for those responsible for the massive human rights abuses
of his dictatorship.
	   With the Spanish prosecution of Pinochet still unsure, demands
are growing for Chile's young democracy to take the initiative by
repealing an amnesty law Pinochet issued that has prevented the
worst crimes from being brought before the courts.
	   ``The main political effect of this situation is that a strong
conscience has emerged about the lack of justice,'' said Enrique
Krauss, president of the ruling Christian Democratic Party.
	   Socialist Sen. Sergio Bitar said it was Chile's duty to make
sure the crimes of Pinochet's regime are punished. ``I no longer
want my country to face the shame of being seen around the world as
a country that is unable to make justice,'' he said.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London at the request of
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who accuses him of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   Garzon's efforts to extradite Pinochet were bolstered Friday
when the Spanish National Court ruled that Spain has jurisdiction
over crimes committed during the dictatorships in Chile and
Argentina.
	   However, England's High Court ruled Wednesday that Pinochet was
immune from prosecution because he was a former head of state. An
appeal before a panel of the House of Lords is scheduled for next
week.
	   The 82-year-old former dictator remained secluded at a London
hospital pending that hearing, although a court granted him freedom
on bail Friday.
	   An official report by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet found that 2,095 people were killed for political reasons
during his 1973-90 regime. Another 1,102 remain unaccounted for
after being arrested, a situation often described as the most
painful legacy of the dictatorship.
	   Most of the abuses have gone unpunished as a result of the
amnesty law covering the 1973-78, when the most serious cases
occurred.
	   Sen. Andres Zaldivar acknowledged that Chile's 1990 transition
to democracy came at the expense of a compromise with Pinochet and
the military under which they received safeguards against
prosecution for human rights violations.
	   Pinochet secured additional immunity for himself by establishing
in the constitution the post of senator-for-life, which he assumed
after stepping down as army commander in March.
	   Congresswoman Isabel Allende, daughter of Salvador Allende, the
leftist president toppled in the 1973 coup led by Pinochet,
insisted ``he must be tried in Chile.''
	   ``We can't accept that the price for living in democracy has to
be that impunity will last for ever,'' she said.
	   Pinochet faces 12 lawsuits in Chile for murder, torture and
disappearance of detainees. But even the judge handling the cases,
Juan Guzman, has admitted that he will probably have to drop them
because of the amnesty law.
	   Chile's right-wing parties have warned they will oppose efforts
to try the former ruler or other military leaders. Those promoting
the end of the amnesty law ``should be very careful,'' warned
retired Gen. Luis Cortes, a close Pinochet ally.
	   ``You can't blame everything on the military,'' he said. ``We
probably did some things wrong, but what we did was for the sake of
our fatherland, and if there is a price to pay, let us all to pay
it. Not only the military.''

Spainish judge presses on with case against Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge plans to press ahead with
his bid to try Augusto Pinochet on genocide charges despite legal
proceedings in Britain that could let the former Chilean dictator
walk free and go home.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, dubbed ``Super Judge'' for his
high-profile role in major corruption and drug trafficking cases in
Spain, won the endorsement of the National Court on Friday for the
legal basis of his case against Pinochet.
	   An 11-judge panel ruled unanimously that Spanish courts have
jurisdiction to prosecute human rights crimes committed in Chile
and Argentina when military juntas ruled in the 1970s and 80s.
	   A ruling to the contrary would have ended Garzon's drive to
extradite Pinochet from Britain, where he was arrested Oct. 16 on a
warrant issued by Garzon, and have him stand trial in Spain on
charges of genocide, torture and terrorism. Pinochet was in London
for back surgery.
	   An official Chilean government report issued in 1991, a year
after Pinochet stepped down, said 3,197 people died or disappeared
between 1973 and 1990 as Pinochet tried to crush a perceived
communist threat.
	   In Chile, Pinochet cannot be prosecuted for the crimes because
he is a senator for life, a job created for him in a constitution
he guided to enactment.
	   In his arrest warrant, Garzon argued Pinochet was responsible
for genocide, because he tried to wipe out an entire group of
people _ his political opponents. Under Spanish law, Spanish courts
can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurs.
	   Prosecutors at the National Court had argued that Garzon had no
jurisdiction in Latin America. They also said Pinochet cannot be
accused of genocide because the killings he is accused of did not
involve race, religion or ethnicity.
	   The National Court didn't give the reasons for its ruling
Friday. It said a full text would be released next week.
	   Garzon plans to file a formal request next week for Pinochet's
extradition, said Virginia Diez, part of a team of private human
rights lawyers who have worked closely with Garzon in the Pinochet
case.
	   It must first be approved by the government of center-right
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, which is eager to protect trade
ties with Chile and has frowned on Garzon's probe.
	   However, Aznar and other Spanish government officials have said
they wouldn't block a request for Pinochet's extradition.
	   Also next week, a five-judge panel in Britain's House of Lords
will begin hearings that could lead to Pinochet's release.
	   The panel is to hear an appeal of a High Court ruling on
Wednesday that said Pinochet cannot be prosecuted because he was
head of state at the time the crimes cited against him were
allegedly committed.
	   On Friday a judge granted Pinochet bail but said he must remain
in the hospital under police guard.

Suspects detained in Mexico massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TLAPA DE COMONFORT, Mexico (AP) _ Eight people have been
arrested in the massacre of a family in southwestern Mexico, police
said. They said the killing was a settling of accounts among drug
traffickers.
	   Masked gunmen opened fire with assault rifles Wednesday night on
the family in this remote mountain village, 130 miles (210 kms)
south of Mexico City.
	   Killed were Taurino Leal Sierra, his wife, two of their children
and another person whose relationship was unclear. Two other
children, ages 4 and 6, were wounded.
	   State Judicial Police Chief Marcos Roman Bahena reported the
arrests and said two other suspects ``from this band of drug
traffickers'' were at large. He said earlier reports that 15 people
had taken part in the attack were erroneous.
	   Most of those arrested appeared to be from a family in the
nearby town of Villa de Guadalupe, where Leal was from.
	   Roman Bahena said investigators believe the massacre was a
settling of scores between drug traffickers. Neighbors of the Leal
family said that Taurino Leal Sierra had only recently been
released from prison, where he had served a sentence for assault.
	   Last month, 19 members of an extended family were lined up
outside their house in the northern Indian community of El Sauzal
and shot to death in what prosecutors call a drug-related attack.
Fourteen people have been arrested, but not the gunmen.

Mexican government continues investigation of U.S. agents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government plans to use evidence
from upcoming U.S. court hearings to build a case for extraditing
American drug agents to Mexico, a congressman said in summarizing
an earlier meeting with Attorney General Jorge Madrazo.
	   Congressman Juan Marcos Gutierrez said Friday he was confident
the Mexican government soon would present an extradition request
for U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency employees accused of operating in
Mexico without local authorization.
	   ``I have been told in no uncertain terms that (the extradition)
is being sought,'' he said, summarizing a meeting Thursday between
Madrazo and lawmakers from the right-center National Action Party.
	   A spokeswoman for the attorney general refused to comment.
	   Madrazo's office has been under heavy political pressure to
pursue extradition of U.S. agents involved in the Operation
Casablanca sting operation, which lured Mexican bankers to the
United States where they were among 167 people arrested in
connection with laundering drug money.
	   Many Mexicans were outraged by reports that U.S. law enforcement
agents had operated here without permission of Mexican officials _
actions Mexicans claim violated the country's law and its
sovereignty.
	   Gutierrez said the attorney general's office expects to obtain
evidence against the agents during a Nov. 6 court hearing in Los
Angeles on the Casablanca indictments. He did not specify what sort
of evidence. As the case advances, however, U.S. officials likely
will have to describe in greater detail actions by the agents while
in Mexico.
	   The Zedillo administration has said it would seek the
extradition of the agents, but an official request has yet to be
presented.
	   In June, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 404-3 in favor
of a nonbinding resolution endorsing the Operation Casablanca
sting, saying the United States should not extradite the agents
involved.

Report: Two major Japanese banks plan alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two of Japan's largest banks have agreed to form a
strategic alliance to cope with increased deregulation and spur bad
loan write-offs, a leading business daily reported Saturday.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd., both of which rank
among the top ten banks in Japan, will set up a jointly owned trust
banking venture with troubled Fuji affiliate Yasuda Trust and
Banking Co., the Nihon Keizai newspaper said, citing unnamed
sources.
	   Spokesmen at both banks declined immediate comment, saying they
would issue statements on the report later Saturday.
	   The reported venture, unusual in that it would link major banks
from industrial groups with few traditional ties, will specialize
in asset-management, a business field recently deregulated under
Japan's ``Big Bang'' program of opening financial markets to
greater competition.
	   These reforms have led many domestic and foreign financial
institutions, including Citigroup Inc., to enter the Japanese
market to vie for a share of an estimated dlrs 9 trillion pool of
personal financial assets.
	   The deal also would allow Yasuda Trust to raise almost 200
billion yen (dlrs 1.72 billion) in capital to dispose of a massive
load of bad loans by selling its pension-management and
securities-custody businesses to the new venture, according to the
report.
	   The move could ease concern about the financial health of
Japan's Fuyo industrial group, which is headed by Fuji Bank and
includes Yasuda Trust, Nissan Motor Co. and trading house Marubeni
Corp.
	   Separately, Fuji Bank denied a report Friday of plans to sell
its controlling stake in Heller Financial Inc., a U.S.
commercial-finance subsidiary, to generate cash for writing off its
portfolio of bad loans.
	   Kyodo News agency reported the sale was planned as part of a
broader restructuring which would also halve the number of overseas
outlets operated by the bank.

After a half-century, Korea opens door to Japanese pop culture

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Selling contraband on a street in
central Seoul, a young man was unfazed by two policemen patrolling
nearby.
	   ``People, especially young people, like this stuff,'' he said.
``I am meeting their demand.''
	   The man, who gave only his last name, Lee, was blasting
earsplitting music from a cassette player while peddling tapes,
videos and computer games from Japan _ popular culture items
officially banned for a half-century because of Korea's deep
animosity toward its former colonial ruler.
	   Despite the ban, Japanese pop culture has been making inroads
here for years, aided by satellite TV, smugglers and policemen who
look the other way, as well as some legal products imported under
other categories.
	   Last week, South Korea acknowledged that reality: In the first
phase of what it called a ``gradual'' opening to Japanese pop
culture, the government lifted the prohibition against the import
of Japanese comic books, magazines and international award-winning
movies. More products will be allowed officially later.
	   ``From now on, there will be no discrimination,'' said Culture
and Tourism Minister Shin Nak-kyun. ``The government will deal
equally with Japanese cultural products and other foreign
products.''
	   Under the prohibition, no Japanese films were shown in South
Korean theaters and no Japanese actors appeared on Korean TV. No
Korean children were supposed to be exposed to Japanese music or
computer games.
	   Nonetheless, bootleg Korean versions of Japanese comic books
accounted for 47 percent of the dlrs 302 million domestic comics
market.
	   Young South Koreans decorate their cars and mobile phones with
accessories bearing the Japanese cartoon character Kitty the cat.
Newspapers carry daily programing schedules of NHK, the Japanese
public network, which Koreans receive via satellite.
	   And in the absence of a government ban on electronic goods,
Nintendo games have flooded the South Korean market for years.
	   ``I love X-Japan. I love V6. I love Amuro Namie,'' said high
school junior Park Sun-mi, who named her favorite Japanese pop
singers while out shopping with friends. ``My friends are crazy
about them, too.''
	   There has been no one law specifically banning Japanese
products. But the government censorship board, the Korea Ethics
Committee for Performing Arts, has tried to control them as much as
possible by invoking laws banning ``unhealthy'' products.
	   ``It was not a legal issue. It was a matter of public
sentiments,'' said Ha Jae-yoel, a ministry official.
	   South Korea is infamous for being against imports of many kinds.
Efforts to control its trade imbalances and protect its owns
products from competition, for instance, have left streets
virtually devoid of cars from any other country.
	   But opposition to Japanese products has been underscored by a
profound bitterness over the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910
to 1945. Korean men were forced to work in coal mines in Siberia
and elsewhere, Korean women were conscripted as sexual slaves for
the World War II Japanese Army, and children were prohibited from
using their Korean names and language in school.
	   Older Koreans still denigrate Japanese and insist on referring
to the body of water east of Korea as the East Sea, though most of
the world calls it the Sea of Japan.
	   But Koreans also have envied Japan enormously, if not openly, in
recent decades, rebuilding their economy from the ashes of the
1950-53 Korean War with Japanese parts and technology and by
copying Japanese goods.
	   Japanese restaurants are everywhere, and the Japanese language
has become the second-most widely learned foreign language after
English as economic and political ties blossom.
	   After visiting Tokyo early this month, President Kim Dae-jung
urged his nation to bury old animosities and embrace Japan, with
which it will play co-host to 2002 World Cup soccer finals, the
first ever in Asia.
	   ``A country culturally closed will never thrive,'' Kim said.
	   But old feelings die hard in Korea.
	   The media have warned the policy will bring a new Japanese
invasion, this time cultural, and that Japanese products will
threaten the livelihood of Korean singers, cartoonists and
moviemakers.
	   ``I don't understand this opening up to Japan. What can you
learn from the culture of a country that doesn't even repent for
the horrible deed it has done to the world?'' said Kim Soo-hee, a
60-year-old Seoul woman.
	   Korean youngsters grow up listening to their parents' and
grandparents' stories of Japanese atrocities and reading history
books that depict the Japanese as cruel colonialists.
	   But many want trendy Japanese goods more than they want to make
any kind of political statement about a past they didn't personally
experience.
	   Said Lee Mi-ok, a 17-year-old high school girl: ``I don't think
about history when I go shopping.''

Mexican prosecutors order 19 arrests in Ericsson contract case

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Officials have ordered the arrest of 19
people on suspicion of irregularities involving a radio
communications system, the Mexico City attorney general's office
announced Friday.
	   Seventeen of those accused are former officials of the attorney
general's office. Two were identified as officials of Mexican
subsidiaries of the Swedish telecommunications company Telefon AB
LM Ericsson.
	   It was the second time that the year-old opposition-party
government in Mexico City has accused a major company and former
officials of irregularities in a contract for services for the city
attorney general's office.
	   In a communique, the prosecutor's office said that the agency's
former administration signed at least two contracts worth a total
of more than dlrs 27 million in 1995 and 1996 with Sistemas
Ericsson S.A. de C.V. and Redes y Sistemas Ericsson S.A. de C.V.
without opening the sale to bids.
	   It said that the Ericsson equipment installed was not compatible
with the radio frequencies legally assigned to the attorney
general's office.
	   The announcement came after Ericsson offices had closed Friday
night and there was no answer at the company's telephone number.
	   Among those ordered arrested were Cesar Jesus Islas Acosta and
Alejandro Soto Silva, who allegedly represented the Ericsson
subsidiaries in the sales.
	   Also ordered arrested were two former chiefs of administration
of the city attorney general's office: Humberto Moheno Diez and
Jose Socorro Velazquez.
	   In July, Mexico City Attorney General Samuel Del Villar
announced that International Business Machines Corp.'s Mexican unit
had agreed to pay money and in-kind reparations for alleged fraud
in the delivery of a computer database.
	   That agreement did not end criminal proceedings brought in June
against three IBM officials and 19 former city officials accused of
helping the company illegally win the contract without putting it
up for public bid, Del Villar said.
	   The suspects face two criminal counts. If found guilty, they are
subject to up to 19 years in prison, but the agreement would settle
any fines they might be sentenced to.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Floodwaters unleashed by Tropical
Storm Mitch rose quickly across Honduras and Nicaragua, trapping
tens of thousands of people with little food or water and raising
the number of confirmed dead to 127.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard continued Friday to search for a
four-masted schooner missing since Tuesday off the Honduran coast.
The Fantome, a Windjammer Barefoot Cruises yacht once owned by
Aristotle Onassis, had 31 people aboard.
	   The presidents of Honduras and Nicaragua declared states of
emergency as the storm drove into the heart of Honduras, spreading
heavy rains over virtually all of the country.
	   ``Almost all the roads are destroyed... everything is tragedy in
Honduras,'' said Col. Anael Perez, spokesman for the Permanent
Emergency Committee.
	   As the storm center neared the capital, Tegucigalpa, the rising
Rio Grande threatened to tear down the four bridges connecting the
city to its suburb of Comayaguela. The capital's airport had been
closed.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that at midnight GMT
Friday, the storm was centered about 35 miles (55 kms)
north-northeast of Tegucigalpa. It was heading west-southwest at 6
mph (9 kph). Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (85 kph),
down from 180 mph (290 kph) early Tuesday.
	   The once-fierce hurricane, reduced to a mild tropical storm,
continued to dump water on already flooded towns and farmland. In
some areas, as much as 2 feet (60 cms) of rain fell within six
hours, and the National Weather Service said some areas could
expect up to 2 feet (60 cms) more.
	   The waters sparked mudslides that cut off the highway between
Tegucigalpa, and the country's second-biggest city, San Pedro Sula.
In the southern city of Choluteca, a mudslide buried a family of
six on Thursday, the Red Cross said Friday.
	   In all, 56 deaths were confirmed in Honduras, including 14 on
the Bay Islands that house many popular diving resorts. Fifty
people were missing in the city of Comayagua in central Honduras
after the Salistroso River swept away 150 houses.
	   On Friday, Juan Padilla, police chief of coastal Santa Rosa de
Aguan, reported 27 people had died in the town because of flooding.
	   In addition, one prisoner was shot to death and two were wounded
when they tried to escape during the evacuation of Tegucigalpa's
Central Penitentiary. The building was starting to collapse in the
floodwaters, and the three men broke through a wall. The death was
not included in the official count.
	   In Nicaragua, the official death toll climbed fast as reports
came in from areas cut off by the floods. The National Emergency
Committee said 70 people had died and 117 were missing.
 &UR; Mexico reported one, pick up 10th graf pvs.

<TEXT>
	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   GETTING THERE: Cartagena (pronounced Car-ta-HEY-na) is 640
kilometers (400 miles) north of Bogota, Colombia. It is safely
reachable only by air. Avianca, the Columbian carrier, has daily
direct flights out of Miami and a weekly flight (on Saturdays) from
Madrid. The Panamanian carrier Copa has a direct flight from Panama
City.
	   Few travel agencies book Cartagena vacations and even Latour
(212-370-6060), a New York-based tour operator, relies on a handful
of more expensive hotels in the packages it offers.
	   LODGING: Most hotels are on the Bocagrande strip and include
budget options for less than 48,000 Colombian pesos (dlrs 30) a
night. The five-star Hilton (www.hilton.com) has a private beach
off-limits to vendors. Other five-star options include two
atmospheric former convents in the Old City, both newly renovated:
the Santa Clara, where double rooms go for 250,000 pesos (dlrs 160)
a night, and the Charleston, 200,000 pesos (dlrs 130) double
occupancy.
	   Many tourists favor the neocolonial Hotel Caribe in Bocagrande,
a faded five-star where a double with breakfast is 68,000 pesos
(dlrs 43) per person. The Decameron is 90,000 pesos (dlrs 60) per
person, including three meals.
	   RESTAURANTS: Few Cartagena restaurants are spectacular, despite
having some of Colombia's highest prices. You can get the local
lobster (langosta), squid, shrimp or porgy (pargo) almost anywhere.
But try it at the hole-in-the-wall ``Donde Olano'' at the corner of
Santo Domingo and Inquisicion streets. Its French-Colombian owners
offer creative plates for a reasonable 28,000 pesos (dlrs 18) per
person with wine and dessert.
	   TRANSPORTATION: Car rentals are expensive and not worth the
trouble. Taxis are cheap and plentiful in Cartagena, just a few
dollars for any destination in the city. For day trips to the
Rosario islands for snorkeling and a typical stop at the Bari
beach, travelers fluent in Spanish can bargain for boats at the
docks near the Convention Center. More reliable but pricier _ about
40,000 pesos (dlrs 25) per person _ are boats available through
travel agencies and hotels.
	   CLIMATE: Expect hot days and breezy nights, with daytime
temperatures averaging 90-95 degrees Fahrenheit (32-35 degress
Celsius) and dipping just below 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees
Celsius) at night year-round. The driest, most popular season with
tourists is November through March.
	   CURRENCY: The Colombian peso has lost about 20 percent of its
value this year against the U.S. dollar, to the advantage of
foreign tourists. One dollar is currently worth 1,596 pesos.
Travelers checks and major credit cards are accepted at banks,
hotels and ``Casas de Cambio'' though the best exchange rates are
via bank debit and credit cards using the Cirrus and Plus networks.
Do NOT attempt to change money on the street. Con artists abound.
	   SIGHTS: Don't miss the Castillo San Felipe, the impenetrable
fortress on high ground slightly inland from the old town. Its
tunnels are an engineering masterwork, and it is ideal for catching
the evening breeze and a nighttime view of the city. Museums worth
seeing include the Palace of the Inquisition and its collection of
torture implements.
	   INFORMATION: For more information call the newly created
Cartegena de Indias Convention and Visitors' Bureau at (57-5)
660-2414 or 2418. They speak English and French in addition to
Spanish. An Internet information site in Spanish was launched in
October: www.cartagenadeindias.org. Spanish speakers can also check
the local newspaper: www.eluniversal.com.co.

Speeds down just a bit at California Speedway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FONTANA, California (AP) _ It's hard to believe that anyone
would call a lap at 236.564 mph (380.695 kph) slow.
	   Still, after last year's top speeds at California Speedway
flirted with 241 mph (388 kph), the drivers were a lot more
comfortable on Friday in the opening rounds of practice for CART's
season-ending Marlboro 500.
	   The difference is the Handford Device, an aerodynamic piece
invented by Swift Engineering's Mark Handford that is attached to
the rear wing of the sleek Champ Cars to slow them down on the two
big ovals at which the CART FedEx Series runs.
	   Adrian Fernandez was fastest Friday on the 2-mile
(3.22-kilometer) oval _ just a little flatter than its high-banked
sister track in Brooklyn, Michigan _ with a lap of 236.564 mph
(380.695 kph). Right behind were Michael Andretti at 235.428 mph
(378.867 kph) and Greg Moore, the winner of the U.S. 500 in July at
Michigan Speedway, at 234.951 mph (378.099 kph).
	   ``It's again doing what it's supposed to do,'' Andretti said,
referring to the Handford Device.
	   ``With the Handford Device, the cars are pretty stuck (to the
track) still, but we're going slower on the straightaways, which
slows you down a little everywhere. Then, if you get behind another
car, there's a big suction.''
	   Moore said, ``The Handford Device adds a whole new dimension to
racing. I enjoy it. Out there by yourself, you're doing 228, 229,
maybe 230 (367, 369, maybe 370). When you see a car out there in
front of you a half straightaway or so ahead, you suddenly pick up
2 to 3 miles per hour (3 to 5 kilometers per hour) from the
draft.''
	   Fernandez, who started from the pole at Michigan, agreed,
adding, ``Even though you want to run on your own, you can't. Even
though a car is a full straight ahead of you, you still get the
draft.''
	   The race at Michigan produced a CART record 62 lead changes and
the drivers expect more of the same Sunday, although perhaps not to
the same degree.
	   ``It probably won't be exactly the same (as the Michigan race)
because this track is not banked as much and you'll probably see
less side-by-side racing,'' Andretti said. ``But it still should be
a very exciting race.''
	   Mauricio Gugelmin, who set the racing qualifying mark of 240.942
(387.741 kph) last year in the inaugural CART race here, was fourth
Friday at 234.830 (377.905 kph), followed by Jimmy Vasser at
234.461 (377.311 kph) and defending race champion Mark Blundell at
234.213 (376.912 kph).
	   Alex Zanardi, who already has clinched his second straight
series title, missed this race a year ago after crashing twice and
suffering a concussion. On Friday, he stayed out of trouble and was
eighth on the speed chart at 233.980 (376.537 kph).
	   In all, 25 cars, including backups, ran laps above 230 mph (370
kph) in preparations for Saturday's qualifying.

A look inside back street art studios
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY304-305 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the winding back streets near Pere Lachaise
Cemetery, where Frederic Chopin and Jim Morrison lie, artists still
toil away in creaky, crumbling workshops hidden from the hustle and
bustle.
	   But there's a chance to get a glimpse of Paris' inner art world.
Painters, sculptors, photographers or anyone even posing as an
artist throw open their ``ateliers,'' or studios, to the public
once a year.
	   In this city of 2 million, an estimated 10,000 artists are
working out of 3,000 ateliers, according to artotal.com, a Web site
on the art world in France.
	   At a neighborhood cultural center, pick up a map of about 100
ateliers peppered through the Menilmontant area of northeastern
Paris, and away you go. Bring your walking shoes.
	   ``It's a big festival,'' says graffiti artist Jerome Mesnager,
38, who sells paintings of his sleek, muscular body forms that
cover walls across Paris.
	   ``It's better than a gallery; you see the painter's universe.
It's the atmosphere where the painting was created.''
	   The intimacy works both ways for Eliane Mathieu, a
painter-sculptor-poet in a charmingly rundown courtyard that used
to house small factories making locks and brooms, among other
things.
	   For the art buff, ``it's a way to discover the neighborhood, and
the places we work,'' she says. And for her, ``It's a way to meet
the public. It gives me confidence to get their feedback. It's
encouraging.''
	   The quality of the work varies widely. Most of it is on the
avant-garde end of the spectrum, some more classic. Some look more
like powder-room kitsch.
	   But at the cultural center, visitors can narrow their expedition
by looking at pictures of work from each atelier.
	   ``Some are good and some not so good, but I think it's super,''
Helene Szalewa, a midwife in the area, said as she looked at
mosaics in Irene Nectoux's workshop.
	   ``It's great to tour the ateliers, talk with the artists,'' she
says. ``It's an adventure.''
	   Catch these glimpses while you still can. Modern times are
threatening the area in the 19th and 20th arrondissments of
northeastern Paris, where many crumbling buildings have been razed
instead of rehabilitated, making way for low-cost housing.
	   Other ateliers are being saved from the wrecking ball, but
artists such as Ms. Mathieu worry they may be priced out of the
rent market due to costly renovations.
	   The three-day Menilmontant open house ended Oct. 5, but more
than a dozen neighborhood artist groups in Paris open their
ateliers in the spring and fall.
	   Ask City Hall, 33-1-4276-6700, for a listing of ``Ateliers
Portes Ouvertes'' (Open-Door Studios). Their bilingual
paris-france.org site also promises the listings soon.

Statues draw tourists to Kansas farming town
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CARL MANNING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HIAWATHA, Kansas (AP) _ Every Kansas town seems to have a story
to tell. But few are more fascinating than the tale of John Milburn
Davis and the massive marble memorial he built to Sarah, his wife
of 50 years.
	   The childless couple farmed nearby for years before moving into
town in 1915. Then, in the middle of the Depression, Davis angered
many residents by spending a fortune to memorialize his wife, who
died in 1930.
	   Towns folk guessed the monument cost as much as dlrs 200,000,
which they felt could have helped finance a hospital or a swimming
pool, both needed in this northeast Kansas town surrounded by corn
fields and open skies.
	   Instead, Davis, a loner with a long white beard, built the
memorial complete with life-size white marble sculptures of the
couple.
	   Now it's the town's top attraction.
	   Davis died in his sleep in 1947 at age 92. At his bedside was
the only man he called a friend _ Horace England, a local tombstone
salesman who had arranged for the sculptures by Italian craftsmen.
	   When completed in 1934, the memorial measured some 25 feet by 25
feet (7 1-2 meters by 7 1-2 meters). It includes a 52-ton stone
canopy on columns, a huge marker for the couple's tombs, assorted
stone urns _ plus a dozen sculptures depicting the couple's various
stages of life.
	   Ten are marble, which Davis felt more suitable to show a woman's
delicate features. Two are granite _ one of him seated and an empty
chair inscribed ``The Vacant Chair.''
	   It's all ringed by a 4-foot (1.2-meter) stone wall with the
request ``Kindly Keep Off The Memorial'' carved into each corner
post. It's said Davis had the wall erected so children couldn't sit
in the laps of the sculptures.
	   Over the years, the monument became a magnet for the curious
from around the world. A video recounting the story is on sale at
the Brown County Agriculture Museum across the street from the
cemetery.
	   Bonnie Reetz, Hiawatha Chamber of Commerce administrator,
estimates at least 20,000 people visit the site each year, spending
time and money in this town of some 3,600 people.
	   Sherm Daeschner, a local historian, sees a certain irony in the
way things turned out. ``He never wanted to give anything to the
town, but he gave more than anybody would have dreamed of,'' he
says.
	   Daeschner, who retired 20 years ago as postmaster, recalls
seeing Davis on solitary walks about town and on Sundays at the
Mount Hope Cemetery where he talked to those visiting the memorial.
	   ``He kept all to himself because people were bitter about him
most of the time,'' Daeschner says. ``He just walked around by
himself.''
	   Davis' public sentiment for the project is carved in stone at
the memorial: ``John M. Davis erected this memorial to the sacred
memory of his dearly beloved wife Sarah E. Davis.''
	   But there's plenty of speculation about other motives.
	   Some say Davis wanted to get even with the town that never
accepted him, perhaps because Mrs. Davis' family never accepted
him. Others say he spent the money so there would be nothing for
her family to inherit.
	   Maybe it was a desire to be immortal with his wife, or maybe the
tombstone salesman talked him into it.
	   There was gossip that Davis wasn't kind to his wife and built
the memorial to make amends.
	   Part of Davis' decision may be tied to his infected left hand
being amputated in 1908 at a nearby small hospital. He reportedly
said the hospital didn't do enough to save his hand, and anything
built in Hiawatha wouldn't be much better.
	   ``I'm sure that's what he said,'' Daeschner says.

Mourning and dread wrack Swedes after fire kills 60 teens at dance

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Relatives and friends gathered at
hospitals, a memorial service and the burned-out wreckage of a
dance-hall, weeping in disbelief that a fire killed 60 teen-agers
and left dozens clinging to life.
	   As they mourned, hospital officials agonized over identifying
the dead and investigators tried to determine what caused the worst
fire disaster in modern Swedish history.
	   Bent metal bars on some windows showed the panic-fueled strength
that the teen-agers exerted as they kicked their way out of the
inferno early Friday. With about 400 people crowded inside, it was
packed to more than twice its legal capacity.
	   ``Everybody panicked,'' Christian Czari, 15, said outside the
building Friday. ``Nobody cared about the girls. The strongest made
way first. Kids were fighting each other to get out.''
	   Police said 20 of the 173 injured were clinging to life. Of the
dead, only 14 bodies had been identified by Friday evening _ a
process made painstakingly slow because bodies were badly burned
and many youngsters weren't carrying identification.
	   Below the second-floor windows of the dance-hall lay stray
shoes, broken glass and bloody blankets used to wrap the
casualties. Teens gathered there Friday, crying among memorial
bouquets of fresh flowers lying on the pavement where victims had
lain in the otherwise nondescript neighborhood of small retail
shops.
	   ``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm
alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead?'' asked
17-year-old Alina Turk, standing outside the ruined building. She
said she had been at the dance and two male friends of hers died.
	   On Friday evening, about 1,500 people, mostly young, came to the
Goteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewilderment
at a memorial service. They wept, they embraced, and some looked
around nervously, as if unsure how to behave in a church.
	   ``I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go to
prayers,'' said a young man who gave his name only as Sami. ``I'm
accompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning
_ that's all.''
	   Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the hall, spoke of
the ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No help. No police. No
firemen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said from his bed in a
Goteborg hospital.
	   Although Hersi, like many at the dance, believes the police and
firemen were slow to arrive, authorities said the first fire trucks
were there within five minutes of the alarm. But the fire spread so
quickly that even an instant response likely would have been too
late.
	   Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous
gases.
	   The cause of the blaze wasn't clear. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo
Wahlstroem said the fire's swift, raging spread could indicate
arson, or that it had burned undetected for a time before
exploding.
	   The fire destroyed the building, which housed on the second
floor the Macedonian immigrant association in Goteborg, Sweden's
second-largest city. The association had rented out the hall for
the night to eight party-arrangers, police said, but refused to
identify them.
	   The crowd was mostly 13 to 18, witnesses said, and consisted
mainly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents. Officials
said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities, including
Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as well as people
from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin
American countries.
	   Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcing
relatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait for
hours at hospitals. Some were able to stay in rooms off-limits to
journalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying and watching
teen-agers hurry in and out of rooms while they looked for their
friends.
	   ``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but
also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _
they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska
Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 residents about 300
miles west of Stockholm.
	   The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was
in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.

UN decries attacks on Rwanda civilians, says judiciary in crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hutu insurgents in Rwanda are using the
same tactics employed during the 1994 genocide, indiscriminantly
killing women, children and survivors of that massacre with equal
impunity, a U.N. report says.
	   The report, released Friday by a special rapporteur of the U.N.
Human Rights Commission, deplored the loss of civilian lives and
called for the international community to condemn ``forcefully and
unequivocally the resurgent forces which have shown themselves bent
on resuming the program of genocide launched in 1994.''
	   The report noted an increase in attacks by armed groups, both in
frequency and intensity, since a year ago. And it decried the
failure of the government to reach an agreement with a U.N. human
rights team on a new mandate _ leading to the team's departure in
July.
	   The report said Rwanda's judiciary was in a crisis, but
commended efforts to speed up trials and release prisoners on
humanitarian grounds.
	   Rwanda's 1994 Hutu-sponsored genocide killed an estimated
500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus before Tutsis took power.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Richter stopped 30 shots for his second
straight shutout and 19th of his career and Todd Harvey scored the
only goal to lead the New York Rangers to a 1-0 victory over the
Carolina Hurricanes in National Hockey League action.
	   Carolina appeared to tie the score with seven seconds remaining
in Friday night's game, but the goal was disallowed because Ron
Francis had his skate in the goal crease.
	   The Rangers extended their unbeaten streak to six (3-0-3).
	   Harvey scored a power-play goal from the slot at 10:05 of the
second, beating Arturs Irbe between the legs off a setup pass from
Wayne Gretzky. The goal broke a scoreless streak of 124:49 for the
Rangers, who played to a scoreless tie against Buffalo on Tuesday.
 &UR; Sabres 4, Maple Leafs 1
	   In Buffalo, New York, Michael Grosek, Matthew Barnaby and Derek
Plante each scored first-period goals to lead the Buffalo Sabres
over the Toronto Maple Leafs.
	   Dominik Hasek made 36 saves and had his bid for back-to-back
shutouts spoiled with 5:46 left on Mike Johnson's shorthanded goal.
	   The Sabres ended a three-game winless streak and broke out of a
scoring drought in which they had been shut out in two of their
past three games.

Reports: Thai leaders confident nation will pull out of slump next
</HEADLINE>
year

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Buoyed by the recent stability of the
Thai currency and a rising stock market, Thailand's ruling Democrat
Party predicted the country would pull out of its economic crisis
in six to eight months, local newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Leaders at the party's annual meeting Friday reportedly said the
government would accelerate debt restructuring and capitalization
of banks and stimulate domestic demand to insure a recovery.
	   ``To look ahead, we are confident that previous measures will
materialize in six to eight months and help the economy to turn
around, although it may not be full recovery,'' a party spokesman,
Abhisit Vejjajiva, was quoted as saying by The Bangkok Post.
	   Thailand was the first country hit by the outbreak of the Asian
financial crisis last year, but the government of Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai has earned high marks for implementing economic
reforms in line with an International Monetary Fund rescue scheme.
	   Thailand's benchmark SET index closed the week at 331.29 points,
up 60 percent from its nadir so far this year of 207.31 points on
Sept. 4.
	   ``Of five countries in Asia which have been rocked by severe
economic problems, our currency has shown the most stability
despite the fact that we were at the bottom of the list when the
crisis began,'' Chuan was quoted by the Post as having told members
at the meeting.
	   But market analysts cautioned that the foundations for a
sustained rally in the Thai equity prices were still not present.
	   ``This stock market rally has firmer justifications than the one
we saw earlier this year,'' ABN Amro country manager George Morgan
told a Bangkok conference on Friday.
	   ``However, this in general isn't based on fundamental value but
liquidity looking for a short-term home,'' he added.
	   Analysts said many foreign investors, who are crucial for a
long-term recovery, remain largely on the sidelines awaiting a
clearer picture of Thailand's plans to stabilize its ailing
financial sector.

Russia's Butyrskaya wins women's short program at Skate America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Despite falling on an attempted triple lutz,
world championships bronze medalist Maria Butyrskaya of Russia won
the women's short program Friday night in Skate America.
	   Butyrskaya received all 5.7s for presentation in taking a lead
over American Angela Nikodinov, holding second place after skating
a clean program that included a triple lutz-double toe combination.
	   Russia's Elena Sokolova, also among the few women to complete a
combination jump Friday night, was third entering Saturday's
decisive free skate. Nicole Bobek, the 1995 U.S. champion, fell on
her triple flip and was fourth.
	   The short program accounts for one-third of the total score.
	   France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizert, runners-up in this
year's world championships and Olympic bronze medalists at Nagano,
retained first place in ice dancing after their original dance
Friday night.
	   Russia's Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh, second heading into
the original dance, stayed in second place. Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Mariusz Margaglio of Italy finished third.
	   Americans Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev, fifth after Thursday
night's compulsories, dropped to sixth after Tchernyshev fell
during their routine Friday night.
	   The original dance is worth 30 percent of the skaters' total
score.
	   As the first event in the International Skating Union's Grand
Prix series, Skate America features Olympic-eligible skaters. The
series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks before
the world championships in Finland.
	   This year's event concludes Saturday with free skates in the
men's, women's and pairs competitions, as well as the free dance.

Transsexual mayor turns to national political scene in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - A former drag queen and
prostitute who was believed to have become the world's first
transsexual mayor has been wooed onto the national political stage
in New Zealand.
	   Georgina Beyer, 40, confirmed Saturday that she has accepted an
offer from the opposition Labor Party to stand against New
Zealand's deputy prime minister Wyatt Creech in an election
scheduled for next year.
	   Beyer, formerly known as George, had a sex change operation at
age 24 and was recently reelected as mayor of the rural town of
Carterton with 90 percent of the vote.
	   She said her past history should has little bearing on her
current career, adding that she is committed to her life as a
public servant.
	   ``What I did 18-odd years ago and what I do now are two
completely different things,'' Beyer said.

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ Floodwaters unleashed by Tropical
Storm Mitch rose quickly across Honduras and Nicaragua early
Saturday, trapping tens of thousands of people with little food or
water and raising the number of confirmed dead to 127.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard, meanwhile, continued to search Friday for
a four-masted schooner missing since Tuesday off Honduras. The
Fantome, a Windjammer Barefoot Cruises yacht once owned by
Aristotle Onassis, had 31 people aboard.
	   The presidents of Honduras and Nicaragua declared states of
emergency as the storm drove into the heart of Honduras, spreading
heavy rain over virtually all of the country.
	   ``Almost all the roads are destroyed ... everything is tragedy
in Honduras,'' said Col. Anael Perez, spokesman for the Permanent
Emergency Committee.
	   As the storm center neared the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa,
the rising Rio Grande threatened to tear down the four bridges
connecting the city to its suburb of Comayaguela. The capital's
airport had been closed.
	   The National Hurricane Center said the storm was centered about
25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa on Friday night. It
was heading west-southwest at 7 mph (11 kph). Maximum sustained
winds were near 50 mph (80 kph), down from 180 mph (289 kph) early
Tuesday.
	   The once-fierce hurricane, however, continued to dump water on
already-flooded towns and farmland. In some areas, as much as 2
feet (0.61 meters) of rain fell within six hours, and the National
Weather Service said some areas could expect as much as that again.
	   The deluge sparked mudslides that cut off the highway between
Tegucigalpa and the country's second-biggest city, San Pedro Sula.
In the southern city of Choluteca, a mudslide buried a family of
six on Thursday, the Red Cross said Friday.
	   In all, 56 deaths were confirmed in Honduras, including 14 on
the Bay Islands that house many popular diving resorts. Fifty
people were missing in the city of Comayagua in central Honduras
after the Salistroso River swept away 150 houses.
	   On Friday, Juan Padilla, police chief of coastal Santa Rosa de
Aguan, reported 27 people had died in the town because of flooding.
	   In addition, one prisoner was shot to death and two were wounded
when they tried to escape during the evacuation of Tegucigalpa's
Central Penitentiary. The building was starting to collapse in the
floodwaters, and the three men broke through a wall. The death was
not included in the official count.
	   In Nicaragua, the official death toll climbed fast as reports
came in from areas cut off by the floods. The National Emergency
Committee said 70 people had died and 117 were missing.
	   Mexico reported one fatality, an American who was thrown from
his boat south of Cancun on Monday and presumed dead.
	   A Coast Guard C-130 plane was searching the western Caribbean
for a 240-foot (73- meter) schooner missing since Tuesday. The
Antigua-registered Fantome was on a tourist cruise near Belize and
the Bay Islands when it disappeared. All the passengers had
disembarked and 31 crew members remained aboard.
	   Many towns in both Nicaragua and Honduras remained incommunicado
because of downed bridges and washed-out roads, and officials
expected the death toll to rise.
	   In Chamelecon, a southern suburb of San Pedro Sula, people
walked through waist-deep water carrying televisions, refrigerators
and furniture to load on trucks as they moved into shelters. More
than 30,000 people were in shelters in San Pedro Sula alone.
	   In one gymnasium, 2,000 people spread out through the stands and
the basketball court, sleeping on pieces of cardboard as chickens
and dogs wandered among their belongings. There was little to eat
and only rainwater to drink.
	   ``They've given us very little food _ just a little bread,
nothing more. I have no money and can't get in touch with my other
relatives,'' said Estela Munoz.
	   In La Ceiba, near the center of the storm, floodwaters began to
recede Friday.
	   Rescuers were able for the first time since Wednesday to reach
the Armenia Bonito neighborhood, where flash floods tore apart all
but a tiny hilltop. Six families had huddled on that hilltop
without even a tree to shelter them since the flood came.
	   The rheumatism in his right leg had prevented Jose Martinez, 70,
from evacuating. His wife, Ermina, gathered together their nine
children and grandchildren and climbed the hill.
	   ``We had nothing to eat. We couldn't even sleep,'' Martinez
said. ``We had to remain standing, with only one tarp to cover the
children. It's a miracle of God that we are alive.''
	   On Friday, the fierce current dropped to waist-level and
neighbors formed a human chain to help the families to the other
side. One carried Martinez across on his back.
	   On the other side, the neighbors offered them coconut water.
	   It was all they had.

Vietnam may cut sentences for more than 10,000 inmates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese Police Ministry has begun
considering reducing the sentences being served by more than 10,000
prison inmates, Saturday's Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper quoted a
top official as saying.
	   Pham Duc Tran, director of the ministry's prisons management
department, did not elaborate on any criteria for eligibility under
the proposed amnesty.
	   The government has granted two presidential amnesties over the
past two months for 7,849 inmates, including some well-known
dissidents and 34 foreigners.
	   ``The firm political and security situation and the higher
respect of laws by people have allowed the amnesties this year,''
Tran was quoted as saying.

Spanish tenor pledges concerts for hurricane victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Spanish tenor Placido Domingo has agreed
to give two concerts here in December to benefit victims of last
year's Hurricane Pauline, Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero
announced.
	   Aguirre told a news conference Friday that the Dec. 29 concerts
would raise money to build 150 dwellings for families whose homes
were destroyed by the August 1997 storm.
	   ``It seems to me that is a gesture of great nobility by this
great tenor,'' Aguirre said.
	   State officials say 1,200 families still lack housing.

Fire 2, Crew 1, OT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Frank Klopas' goal in the first overtime lifted
the MLS champion Chicago Fire to a 2-1 victory over the Columbus
Crew on a rainy Friday night in the U.S. Open Cup final.
	   Klopas, a Chicago native who played for the Crew last season,
took a pass on a header from Josh Wolff after a corner kick by
Jerzy Podbrozny in the 99th minute.
	   The Crew's Stern John had tied the game in the 53rd minute.
	   Podbrozny's penalty shot during injury time in the 45th minute
gave Chicago a 1-0 halftime lead.
	   Defenseman Lubos Kubik was injured early in the match and the
Fire, who didn't have any defensemen on the bench, had to send in
midfielder Josh Keller as a substitute and Peter Nowak switched to
defense.
	   ``We were worried because we were shorthanded and Nowak had to
play back there. So we were happy to be ahead at the half,'' coach
Bob Bradley said.
	   The U.S. Open Cup involved Major League Soccer teams but was
conducted separately from the league championship, which the
expansion Fire won Sunday over D.C. United at Pasadena, Calif.
	   The Crew lost to United in the MLS' Eastern Conference finals.
