<HEADLINE> Iran Proposes Military Cooperation with Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian military authorities
today proposed a military cooperation with Gulf countries in a
bid to maintain regional security.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shahbazi, chief of the joint staff of the army, said that
Iran is ready to support its neighboring countries against
foreign threats, specially those stemming from the United States
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Iran is fully prepared to face all kinds of
military, political and economic threats against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"But Iran is no threat against any countries particularly its
neighbors," he was quoted by the Persian evening paper Ettellat
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi made the statement on the occasion of the Army
Day. He said that the anti-Iran propaganda by the world
imperialism regarding Iran's threats against the neighboring
countries is only a ploy for the plunder of the wealth of the
region's countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted there are still some deep distrust
between Iran and Gulf countries which accused Iran of involving
in their internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi said that Iran spent a total of 850 million
U.S. dollars on the country's defense last year, which is nothing
compared with that of other countries in the region or the
Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the world media for exaggerating Iran's
military expenditure so as to make Iran look like a threat to the
other countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> PNA Renews Security Coordination With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) said that it has renewed security coordination
with Israel along with representatives of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted PNA officials as saying that the decision to
renew security contacts, suspended due to Israel's decision to
start building a new Jewish neighborhood on Har Homa in Arab East
Jerusalem, showed that the Palestinians were serious about
fighting against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service chief Ami Ayalon reportedly
held a secret meeting with Palestinian security heads and CIA
representatives in Tel Aviv Friday as the first step to resume
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Last week, PNA President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy agreed to revive peace talks at a meeting
staged by the European Union (EU) at the Malta conference. Both
of them declared a renewed readiness to seek peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani said the Palestinian
leader and Levy promised to "go back to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, Kanafani denied reports that Arafat agreed to renew
security coordination, saying "we have no direct coordination
except through the American side since Mr. Netanyahu ended
political coordination."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat discussed ways to advance the peace process
at a meeting Friday night in Gaza with EU Middle East envoy
Miguel Moratinos.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia party said today that it will
put up a candidate for the presidential election in 2000, but
stopped short of saying whether he himself would run.
</P>
<P>
"We have time before 2000 and our movement is ready to propose
a candidate for the post of head of state," said Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after being re-elected party chairman for
another two-year term at the party's fourth congress in Moscow
today.
</P>
<P>
However, Chernomyrdin, who has been prime minister for more
than four years, did not make clear if he himself would be the
party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is too early to decide finally who it will be, but we
should be ready for such a step." said Chernomyrdin, whose party
is the largest in the state Duma (lower house) after the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
Our Home is Russia backed President Boris Yeltsin for a second
term in last year's presidential election. Chernomyrdin is widely
seen as a possible successor to Yeltsin since the 66-year-old
Kremlin leader cannot be re-elected for a third term.
</P>
<P>
Our Home is Russia, founded by Chernomyrdin in May 1995,
has branches in more than 2,000 cities and regions of the
country.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Speaker Admits Taking Money From Hanbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's beleagured
parliamentary speaker admitted today he took money from the
now bankrupt Hanbo steel company in his 1992 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kim Soo-han, who was questioned for four hours by South Korean
prosecutors at his official residence this evening, said that
Chung Tae-soo, founder of the Hanbo Group which heads the Hanbo
Steel Co, gave him about 56,000 U.S. dollars as "election funds"
right before the parliamentary election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
But Kim said that since he failed to be elected a parliamentary
representative, the money was not a bribe, just "political funds."
</P>
<P>
Kim is the first head of South Korea's legislature to be probed
by prosecutors and also the highest level politician implicated in
the Hanbo loans-for-kickbacks scandal. The opposition has
demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
In view of his status as head of the legislative body,
investigators visited Kim at his official residence instead of
summoning him to the prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
Kim is one of several politicians called in for questioning
over the scandal of Hanbo Steel, the flagship company of the Hanbo
Group. The company accumulated 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in debts
before collapsing in January.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors suspect more politicians may have taken bribes in
exchange for government-controlled bank loans for the failed Hanbo
Steel and they have called in 33 politicians for questioning. Most
of them have admitted receiving money from Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
Chung, head of the Hanbo Group, the country's 14th largest
conglomerate, is on trial for bribery and other charges along
with nine others, including three long-time political allies of
President Kim Young-sam, for their involvement in the collapse of
Hanbo Steel.

NEW DELHI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- India's External Affairs
Minister I. K. Gujral today was elected leader of the United Front
(UF) in place of outgoing Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, the
Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
The choice was announced after a meeting of the United Front
Steering Committee held here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Gujral was elected by consensus, which was reached after days
of hectic discussions among leaders of the 13-party front.
</P>
<P>
The election of Gujral ended a week-long deadlock over the
leadership issue of UF. The Congress party, which brought down the
Deve Gowda government earlier this month, has promised to extend
support to the UF to form a new government under a new leader
other than Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Gujral, who is from the Janata Dal, is expected
to stake his claim for forming a new government with the Congress
party support tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of his election, Gujral told
newsmen that he will provide a clean government to the people that
would help solve problems like poverty and backwardness and ensure
social justice.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Two Ruling Partners to Decide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Two crucial ruling partners
will decide Sunday the fate of Israel's coalition government,
which is facing a real crisis of survival amid a political
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Bar-On for Hebron" scandal, which centered on
the short-lived appointment of former Jerusalem lawyer Roni
Bar-On as the attorney-general in January, has caused deep
cracks within the coalition as major ruling partners like
Yisrael Baaliya and The Third Way seriously consider leaving it
to pave the way for new elections.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Edana Arbel is to announce her decision Sunday
evening on whether to endorse the police recommendations to indict
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi,
Shas party leader Aryeh Deri and Avigdor Liberman,
director-general of the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Hanegbi and Liberman were charged by the police
with breach of trust and fraud, while Deri with blackmailing in
pushing for Bar-On's appointment by threatening to vote against
the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya, the influential Russian immigrant party, said
today its leadership would convene an emergency meeting Sunday
night following the state attorney's announcement to decide its
future in the government.
</P>
<P>
Another ruling partner, The Third Way, also plans to convene
a meeting following the state attorney's decision. The meeting
is to decide whether the party would remain in the coalition
whose image has already been seriously tainted by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the tremendous pressure from both the opposition
and the public to resign to take responsibility, Netanyahu has
ruled out his resignation, insisting that he was innocent and
vowing to fight for his political survival.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu is facing a real crisis of survival regardless
of state attorney's decision to indict him or not. And the fate
of the coalition is lying in the hands of his ruling partners
like the Yisrael Baaliya and The Third Way.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliya leader Natan Sharansky said during the course
of the investigation that he would leave the coalition if any
minister was found to be involved in the Bar-On scandal. At the
Friday meeting of the party leadership, some speakers warned
Netanyahu that he was wrong in assuming that the party would
automatically stand behind him.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu is indicted, it is almost certain that his
government will not survive, though legally speaking he can
still remain in power to face the charges at the court. But the
problem is that the coalition partners will unlikely remain in a
government whose image has been tainted. The Third Way's leader
Avigdor Kahalani made it clear Thursday that his party would
leave the coalition if Netanyahu was indicted.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu is not indicted, it does not mean that he is
assured of the support by his ruling partners. Both The Third
Way and Yisrael Baaliya officials agreed that they would still
leave the coalition if serious breach of public norms was
discovered even if Netanyahu was not indicted.
</P>
<P>
Observers pointed out that even if the state attorney decided
not to indict Netanyahu, perhaps for reason of insufficient
evidence, she would most likely criticize the government for
breaching public norms in appointing Bar-On as the
attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
In that case, both The Third Way and Yisrael Baaliya might
still seriously consider withdrawing their support to the
present government to pave the way for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's Basic Law, if the current coalition loses the
61 majority in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament), new elections
for both the premier and the Knesset will be held within 60
days. The coalition holds a majority of 66 seats, including
Yisrael Baaliya's seven seats and The Third Way's four
seats.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries to Build Beira </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A big program is being initiated
among southern African countries to build a Beira Development
Corridor (BDC) to link Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and
to a lesser extent, Zaire and Botswana for sub-regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
Beira is an important port at the Indian Ocean coast of
Mozambique. There are container and oil terminals, navigation
equipment and better communications. Its wharfs can serve
50,000-ton ships. Its annual handling capacity of cargo is up to
7.5 million tons. Railways and highways extend from Beira port to
the nearby inland countries as a catchment area.
</P>
<P>
Political stability, favourble georgraphical position, rich
natural resources and better communication and infrastructure in
the sub-region have led to the scheme to establish the Beira
Development Corridor (BDC).
</P>
<P>
In late 1996, delegates of relevant countries met in Harare to
work out an intitiative for the program.
</P>
<P>
Discussions have already taken place between the foreign
ministries of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, which resulted in a joint
communique announcing they had "agreed to deepen and widen
cooperation in the devleopment of the Beira Corridor". A joint
working group has been set up by the two sides to advice their
governments how to form and promote the corridor.
</P>
<P>
There are primary factors for developing the Beira Corridor.
Northeast Zimbabwean farmers are using it to export 100,000 tons
of citrus yearly. Mozambican citrus growers can learn from
Zimbabwe's experience. Now the corridor has been successfully
used for citrus, other fruits like monagoes can be moved in the
same way.
</P>
<P>
Timber from the highlands of Mozambique has also been exported
via Beira and a value added element has increased export earnings
through the manufacture of doors and particle boards. The export
of a million tons of wood chips is currently being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is grasping the opportunities the corridor offers. A
1.5 billion US dollar industrial park is being planned for east
of Harare to attract investment and promote export.
</P>
<P>
Zambia highly values the establishment of the BDC. The Zambia
Investment Center (ZIC) in a press release says, "The corridor's
development has exciting prospects for the Zambian industry."
</P>
<P>
Once the railway link between Kafue in Zambia and Lion's Den
in Zimbabwe is constructed as was origainally envisaged, the
corridor will provide a cheaper and shorter alternative export
route. The reduction in transport costs will make Zambian exports
more competitive. A cheaper and shorter export route can lead to
increased export volumes, export earnings and ultimately
increased investment, ZIC says.
</P>
<P>
The realization of peace in Mozambique has provided a suitable
environment to attract investment to explore the resources of
block granite, copper, limestone, tin, gold, bauxite, feldspar,
coal and natural gas. Investers can also come to run farms and
forests.
</P>
<P>
A consortium of Zimbabwean organizations has been formed in
conjunction with Mozambican partners to investigate the necessity
to construct permanent grain handling equipment and silos to
improve cargo handling and facilitate exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
However, it is no easy job to build the Beira Development
Corridor. The Zimbabwe-Mozambique Joint Working Group has
expressed their will to emerge as a home-grown facility which
acts as a catalyst to sustainable growth in the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Consumption Encouraged in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will set up more natural gas
fueling stations to encourage the use of a more efficient fuel to
help boost Egyptian crude oil exports and improve air quality.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Oil Hamdy el-Banbi has said that seven
natural gas filling stations have been set up in Greater Cairo and
Alexandria, the Arabic-language newspaper Al Gomhuria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Construction was under way of 13 automobile natural gas fueling
stations slated to start operation by the end of this year, thus
raising the total number of gas stations to 20, he said. The
Social Fund for Development will finance the new ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 8 percent of the electric power generating stations
had also been converted to run on the cleaner fuel.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi said the petroleum sector has managed to reduce the
annual increase of consumption to 0.3 percent at present
from 3 percent in 1982, which will in turn promote valuable
Egyptian crude oil exports.
</P>
<P>
It also succeeded in scaling down the proportion of the
gasoline lead additive as part of the effort to reduce air
pollution, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian crude oil production reached 880,000 barrels per
day and the natural gas production 1.6 billion cubic feet per day,
meeting about 92 percent its domestic need.
</P>
<P>
The first public natural gas fueling station in the Middle East
opened in Heliopolis, a plush living quarter in Cairo, in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 vehicles in Egypt are using compressed natural
gas compared with only 180 vehicles at the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
While the use of natural gas saves about 60 percent of the fuel
used by any vehicle when compared with the conventional fuel, it
also reduces pollution by over 30 percent, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had announced earlier that its benzine production will be
lead-free by June in a bid to protect the environment from
pollution. It is among the first of the developing countries to
make such a move.
</P>
<P>
About 82 percent of car fuel marketed at service stations
nationwide is lead free, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Dissolve French National Assembly: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will dissolve the French National Assembly, or lower house of
parliament, and announce the organization of early legislative
elections, in a televised speech to the nation Monday evening,
reported the daily Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted several leading figures of the ruling
majority as saying that Chirac has made the decision to dissolve
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
If it is true, this action will be a big gamble by Chirac to
ease France's entry into the European Monetary Union and push
forward the European construction, as the French Constitution only
allows the president to dissolve parliament in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe will announce on Tuesday the
platform of the ruling majority for the early legislative
elections, which will most probably be held on May 25 and June 1,
or June 1 and June 8, said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The justification for the dissolution of parliament and
organization of early elections is to avoid an overlap between the
originally scheduled legislative elections in April 1998 and the
nearing of the deadline for the launching of the European single
currency, the euro, on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
As France's unemployment rate stays high at 12.8 percent, the
government's austerity social and economic policy, which was
designed to meet the strict budgetary criteria for joining the
euro, has become more and more controversial.
</P>
<P>
Determined to see France enter the monetary union in 1999,
Chirac is unwilling to let his plan stalled by a big debate over
the European monetary union in next year's legislative elections.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Extend Telecommunications Services to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye today urged the Tanzanian Telecommunications
Company Limited (TTCL) to extend its services to the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
When inaugurating the Dar es Salaam-Dodoma-Mwanza backbone
microwave system and the new Dodoma Digital Telephone Exchange
and cable network in the town of Dodoma, central Tanzania, he
said that telecommunications was very important for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"We should not lose sight of our most significant challenge in
Tanzania," where more than 80 percent Tanzanians live in rural
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus should be to increase basic telecommunications
services in order to support various economic activities taking
place there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the existing discrepancy between rural and urban
areas on the access to telecommunications must be addressed now.
</P>
<P>
He said the inauguration of the new telecommunication system,
which would cost about 180 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 300
million U.S. Dollars) upon completion, would send positive
signals to Tanzania's prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
"This inauguration today will send positive signals to our
would-be investors, especially those who were not sure of the
telecommunication network of Tanzania," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told TTCL officials and workers that the focus should,
therefore, continue to be on how to develop a robust
telecommunications system which will support current and future
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
He exhorted the private sector to venture further in the
telecommunications industry, saying Tanzania represented a huge
potential telecommunications market of about 30 million people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also told the TTCL management and workers
to change the management style to match with the present needs,
competitions and expectations.
</P>
<P>
"You must take your customers friendly and try as much as
possible to satisfy their demands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said TTCL should change its attitude of "business as
usual", now that the private sector has entered the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of
Agriculture and Cooperatives Paul Kimiti inaugurated the new
pyrethrum board of Tanzania here today, urging it to draw up
strategies for increased production of the crop.
</P>
<P>
The minister said production of pyrethrum has drastically
nosedived from 2,396 tons in 1992/93 season to 468 tons in
1993/94 and 600 tons in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
He told the newly-appointed board to draw up plans for raising
production to at least 2,000 tons within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this can be achieved," the minister said,
attributing the drop in production to low morale among farmers
for lack of prompt payment for their crop.
</P>
<P>
He said the board had for long been bedeviled by financial
problems leading to accumulation of huge debts. He said last
season the board owed farmers 127 million Tanzania Shilling
(about 211,600 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, it was encouraging that the board has started to pay
some of the farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was informed that 150 million T.Shs. (about
250,000 Dollars) has been set aside for payment of the
outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the debts would be cleared before the next season." he
said.

<P>
CHONGQING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China's newest municipality of
Chongqing needs to further intensify its fight against
environmental pollution, an environmental inspection team said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Winding up a tour of Chongqing today, the team, made up of
representatives of the State Environmental Protection Bureau and
the Ministry of Supervision, told the municipal government that
the city's water and air pollution situations are severe, and the
city should close down all small polluting enterprises and treat
big polluting sources within a designated period.
</P>
<P>
The city, the largest in southwest China, recently became
China's forth municipality directly under the Central Government,
and has placed great importance on environmental protection work.
</P>
<P>
It has put into effect a series of regulations on environmental
protection, closing down 375 polluting enterprises and dealing
with more than 260 cases involving illegal pollution-related
activities.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team told the municipal government that although
it has been successful in treating the noise pollution caused by
urban traffic, it should handle the relationship between economic
development and environmental protection properly, and increase
its input in the work as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Urges Merger, More Re-employment Channels (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A circular covering the merging
of successful and bankrupt state-owned enterprises as well as the
re-employment of laid-off workers in selected Chinese cities is a
major move taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China and the State Council to save the troubled state-run
firms.
</P>
<P>
A "People's Daily" commentary to be published Monday also says
the difficulties currently confronting the state-owned companies
are inevitable in the process of economic reform and the upgrading
of the industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Similar experiences have been had by almost all countries which
have carried out large-scale readjustment of their economic
structure, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The problems of state-owned enterprises are sure to be
overcome, it said, as long as parties involved remain confident,
change their way of thinking, reach a common understanding and
tailor their actions to fit their needs, it said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises must gear themselves to the market,
reorganize their existing assets and labor force and speed up
structural readjustment if they want to extricate themselves from
their tough situation.
</P>
<P>
Practicing bankruptcy measures toward those state-owned firms
which were unprofitable for a long period and were unable to pay
debt with assets, or which are unlikely to make up the deficits,
is an important means of accelerating structural readjustment and
also a positive measure to protect the creditor's rights and
interests -- namely the assets of national banks -- from more
losses, the commentary stated.
</P>
<P>
It is also stipulated that steps must be taken to set up
re-employment service centers and help laid-off workers find new
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Urges Merger, More Re-employment Channels (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Council has always stressed the importance of
introducing more mergers and letting fewer firms go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments under the State Council have issued a
series of policies to encourage well-performing enterprises to
merge with those that are poorly-operated.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises share the common problem of having
a surplus of workers. The only way to solve the problem is to
exploit more channels of re-employment, which requires the
enthusiasm of the government, enterprises, laborers and other
social sectors.
</P>
<P>
All social sectors must work to help the unemployed people and
surplus workers find new jobs through various channels. This is
also essential for the country's sustained, rapid and healthy
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since China's economic reform and opening to the outside world,
the country has enjoyed a high-speed and sustained economic
growth. In the wake of a rise in people's income and all-round
social progress, people's requirements have changed greatly.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, a large number of surplus workers have left
traditional industry for rising industries and the service
trade. This is an inevitable trend in national economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprise is in the critical
stage. On the one hand, multi-economic sectors have grown rapidly,
competition has intensified on both the domestic and international
markets, and some deep-rooted problems faced by the state-owned
enterprises have been laid bare and must be solved immediately.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the great achievements of reform and the
sustained, rapid and healthy economic growth in China provide the
opportunities to solve these problems, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> China Construction Bank Takes Major Reform Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB),
one of the four largest state-owned commercial banks in the
country, has adopted a key reform measure to reduce operational
hazards by granting authoritative certificates to heads of local
branches.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, CCB branches act under the go-ahead of the
CCB headquarters, the bank's legal representative said.
</P>
<P>
The rule stipulates that the headquarters authorize all
managerial rights of the CCB branches, which are entrusted with
the rights to handle loans, bills, credit cards, deposits,
accountancy and personnel.
</P>
<P>
In the past, all branches and sub-branches of the bank operated
independently, which made it difficult for the headquarters to
maintain internal operational control and eliminate trouble spots
within the organization.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has stepped up efforts to reform its
banking sector by commercializing existing state-owned banks and
opening new banks. Foreign banks have been allowed to open
branches in big cities in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Relief
Organization is switching its goal from emergency relief and
rehabilitation operations to development-oriented endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Shunet Admas said his organization,
established in Amhara Region in February 1984, had been aimed at
launching emergency relief and rehabilitation operations during
the height of famine compounded by civil strife.
</P>
<P>
The preoccupation of the organization had been dispensing
relief aid to people severely affected by famine other than
rehabilitating people displaced by then prevailing conflict, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the organization was undertaking organizational
restructuring since the war ended in 1991, said Shunet, adding
that it is now designed in such way that it will buttress
socio-economic development in the Amhara Region.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Relief Organization has charted strategies in
order to make its modest contribution in sustainable development
efforts among which the launching of rural credit service and
rural safe water provisions were given priority, Shunet
explained.

<HEADLINE> Local Athletes Win Timex Hong Kong Durathlon Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong athletes clean swept
the top two places in the men's and women's open categories at the
Timex Durathlon Race here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Con O'Kelly took the men's Open title with a time of one hour
46 minutes 56 seconds, followed by teammate Andrew Patrick in
1:48:15.
</P>
<P>
China's Zhang Xuefeng, 21, was timed at 1:49:07 for third
place.
</P>
<P>
"The flat course is nice. For me, the most difficult part today
was the cycling race as it was really windy," O'Kelly said after
the triumph.
</P>
<P>
It was Kim Isherwood from Hong Kong who came out the winner in
the women's Open event, registering a time of 1:53:57.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with my time today. The wind did not quite affect me
but probably caused some problem for some others," said the
38-year-old winner after the race.
</P>
<P>
She said the course was very flat which was especially good for
her cycling race. But she complained about the humidity,
especially when there was sunshine at the later stage of the race.
</P>
<P>
Isherwood's teammate and a star long-distance runner, Chiu Pik
Kwan, was four minutes 19 seconds behind for second place and Yu
Ting from China, 16, took the bronze medal in 2:00:02.
</P>
<P>
A controversy arose when China's pre-race favorite Liu Nannan,
17, took a wrong turn after being instructed in her final
six-kilometer run. This resulted in a race three kilometers short
of the set distance. Liu was the first to reach the finish line
but her time of 1:50:06 was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
Liu was disappointed after being told of the disqualification.
"Anyway, I will accept whatever decisions from the organizers,"
she said after the race.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to arrange courses of six groups along the same
highway," said Chinese head coach Wang Ping. "Such an arrangement
would not be accepted if it is a standard triathlon race," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
Today's durathlon race consisted of only a six-kilometer run, a
40-kilometer cycle race and another six-kilometer run for the Open
categories, instead of the regular Olympic course of 1.5-kilometer
swimming, 40-kilometer cycling and 10-kilometer running.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the organizers would make a fair and
reasonable decision on the matter," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Liu was later clarified as finishing fifth, with a time of
2:04:07.
</P>
<P>
Complaints were raised as the organizers failed to clearly
mark the routes and turns for some 350 participants of six
categories who took their respective courses along the same
expressway. Such arrangement, which followed a last-minute change
late Saturday, caused confusions among both the participants and
staff members.
</P>
<P>
Organizers, who felt the pressure of arranging such an event in
a comparatively short period of time, called it a rare chance and
a historical race.
</P>
<P>
There would almost be no chance at all for arranging a similar
race along the newly completed expressway after its opening next
month as the road would have to be closed to an expectedly heavy
traffic for such a race.
</P>
<P>
The winners' time would thus be taken as the course records
which are expected to stand for ever.
</P>
<P>
The expressway along the northern coast of Hong Kong's biggest
island, Lantau Island, is one of Hong Kong's New Airport Core
Program projects. It links the Tsing Ma Bridge and the new airport
at Chek Lap Kok which is now under construction.

<HEADLINE> German Newspaper Reports Nuclear Warhead Theft in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian nuclear warheads had
been stolen in 1993, a German newspaper disclosed today
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung
quoted Russian disarmament expert Vladimir Orlov as saying that
two drunken employees motivated by a wager managed to steal two
nuclear warheads out of a nuclear weapon base in Russia in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
It could be the first case of nuclear warhead theft worldwide
that had been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear warheads were stolen from a nuclear facility known
as "X Zavod" east of the Urals. Fortunately, they were recovered
later by Russian security officials in a parking garage in a
residential area, Orlov said.
</P>
<P>
Orlov is currently chief of the Moscow-based PIR Center, a
institute for international security and politics. His credibility
was vouched for by Harald Mueller, a member of the board of
directors of the Peace and Conflict Research Foundation based in
the German state of Hesse.

<HEADLINE> Minor Planet Found Very Close to the Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A minor planet is orbiting less
than 75,000 kilometers away from the Earth -- a distance only one
fifth of that between the Earth and the Moon, Chinese scientists
say.
</P>
<P>
The planet, 1997BR, found on January 20 by Chinese scientists,
is the first minor planet revolving so close to the Earth in the
Leo Constellation, Li Qibin, director of the Beijing Observatory
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 observatories in the United States, Canada, Japan
and Italy have observed the planet for the past few months, and
determined that its location in the solar system is just double
the distance from a synchronous communications satellite to the
Earth, Li revealed.
</P>
<P>
So far, only three planets have been found to be so close to
the Earth. The other two were found in 1947 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
1997BR's diameter is one to two km, according to the
scientists' studies, and its orbit has a radius of about 200
million km. The planet's perihelion is about 140 million km, and
the aphelion, 260 million km.
</P>
<P>
The planet and the Earth will orbit close to each other after a
long time, as they have different orbiting cycles. Their orbits
are not in the same plane, although they are very close to each
other, scientists point out.
</P>
<P>
1997BR was the 401st minor close-to-the-Earth planet found in
the world, and the first one discovered by China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing Observatory has sighted a total of
1,142 minor planets over the past two years, ranking third in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Mortality Rate of Cancer Patients on Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Cancer has become China's second
leading health predator after respiratory disease, causing the
deaths of 1.3 million people every year, according to the National
Cancer Prevention and Control Office.
</P>
<P>
The annual figure of cancer deaths will rise to 1.4 million by
the early 21st century, the office announced in a report recently
released in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The mortality rate of people suffering from malignant tumor
will be 106 people per 100,000 people in 2000, when the country's
population reaches some 1.3 billion," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Changed lifestyles and the rapid growth of the aging population
in the past two decades are responsible for the soaring increase
in the number of patients with malignant tumors, it said, citing
cancer of the stomach, the liver, the lung and the esophagus, as
becoming more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
The death rate of cancer patients increased to 108 persons per
100,000 people in the 1990s, from 84 persons per 100,000 people 20
years ago, a rise of about 30 percent, the report said, quoting
results of a national survey.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate of lung cancer patients has doubled the
1970s' figure to reach about 15 persons per 100,000 people at
present, according to the survey which was conducted from 1990 to
1992 to research disease-related causes of death.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, lung cancer has become the most deadly cancer in
China's urban areas, a result of serious air pollution, use of
chemical products and smoking, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Death rates from liver cancer, stomach cancer and leukemia were
also on the rise, while those from cancers of the cervix and the
nasopharynx showed a remarkable drop, it said.
</P>
<P>
The increase of cancer mortality in China's vast rural areas
was even faster than that in cities in recent years, a situation
which experts believe will make the country's cancer control work
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
"Despite great achievements we've made in cancer prevention and
control in the past decades, we are facing a greater challenge at
present," said Li Liandi, director of the office.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that more effective measures should be taken to
launch health education among the Chinese people and to combat
environmental pollution.

<P>
On some people's doubt about whether Hong Kong courts can deal
with cases concerning "national security," the spokesman said both
the Public Order Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance provide
for an appeal mechanism.
</P>
<P>
He said people who are aggrieved by the decision of the
administration can also apply for a judicial review. In response,
the government must provide the court with sufficient evidence to
prove that its decision was based on "national security"
considerations.
</P>
<P>
On the concept of "political organizations," he said that
before 1992, the Societies Ordinance had provisions prohibiting
societies from having links with foreign political organizations,
but the term "political organizations" was not defined.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We propose to define 'political organizations' as
societies whose main objective is to participate directly in
elections to the three tiers of government institutions and
comment on public policies."
</P>
<P>
"We envisage 'political organizations' to include political
parties only," he said. "Professional organizations taking part in
 functional constituency elections are also excluded because they
have their own professional pursuits. Participation in politics is
not their primary objective."
</P>
<P>
On the concept of "foreign ties," he said the purpose of
prohibiting local political organizations from establishing
foreign ties is to prevent foreign political forces from
controlling Hong Kong's societies.
</P>
<P>
He said the spirit behind the proposals is to prohibit
financial assistance of a political nature. The inclusion of
prohibition of donations from an individual is to prevent
political organizations from bypassing the law.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that in the next two weeks, the Chief
Executive's Office will continue to meet various organizations and
individuals and listen to their views.

<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China, preparing for its opening
World Cup qualifying match in May, whitewashed Myanmar 5-0 in a
soccer friendly here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China, which dominated the game from the outset, opened scoring
through defender Fan Zhiyi in the 30th minute when he converted a
penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, Li Ming headed the ball into the net after
receiving a long pass from Hao Haidong.
</P>
<P>
The last minute of the first half saw two consecutive goals
that put the Chinese at 4-0 before the break, with Li Jinyu
netting with a close-range shove and Zhang Enhua scoring with a
header.
</P>
<P>
Li Tie scored a goal 15 minutes into the second half to
complete the mauling.
</P>
<P>
The game is one of the three warm-ups for China to tune up for
its World Cup Asian Zone qualifying tournament in May, which
begins with a clash against Turkmenistan in Ashkhabad,
Turkmenistan, on May 4.
</P>
<P>
China played Myanmar because it to certain extent bears
similarities to China's Asia zone qualifying Group 8 opponent
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Learn Democracy Through Village Election (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- When farmers in Hanbei Village in
north China's Shanxi Province tried for the first time to choose
their village chief through democratic election, their "ballots"
were only small handfuls of beans.
</P>
<P>
"There were several big bowls on the table, all wrapped in red
paper on which names of the candidates were written. The villagers
queued up, and one by one threw the beans into the bowl of the
candidate they supported," recalled 80-year-old villager Han
Junhong.
</P>
<P>
They dubbed the method "bean-dropping," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hanbei belongs to Wuxiang County, in the Taihang Mountainous
Area in southeast Shanxi, a well-known anti-Japanese base area
founded by the Communist Party of China during the period of the
War Against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
Between 1939 and 1943, in order to promote democracy in the
rural area and add impetus to the anti-Japanese struggle, local
governments led by the CPC introduced the idea of democratic
election to over 260 villages in Wuxiang.
</P>
<P>
Villager Han said that before 1939, by order of the Kuomintang
Shanxi provincial government, anyone who wanted to be appointed as
village chief must have assets worth more than 500 silver dollars,
a huge figure for ordinary farmers, who had difficulty even
finding food for themselves.
</P>
<P>
"After the Communist Party started the democratic election,
every adult in our village, regardless of property and social
status, had one vote, as well as the chance to be elected village
chief," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
The democratic election which began in Hanbei and other
villages in the anti-Japanese base areas more than half a century
ago now has become a regular practice in the nearly one million
villages across the Chinese countryside.
</P>
<P>
It is the direct election of the villagers' committees, held
once every three years.
</P>
<P>
The villagers' committee is the lowest-level management
organization in rural China today. Under the leadership of the
township government, it takes charge of the village's public
affairs and welfare undertakings, mediates quarrels and disputes,
and maintains local public security.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rural economic restructuring, which started
in 1979 and gave farmers more freedom, the direct election of the
villagers' committees began in the late 1980s, and has been
regarded as a major step taken by the Chinese government to
promote democratic politics at the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
To date, the latest round of elections has been completed in
some 20 provinces across the country. In the fourth village
election of Shanxi, which ended early this month, farmers in over
27,000 villages, including Hanbei, have chosen new village
leadership by ballot.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese icebreaking ship named
"Xuelong" (Snow Dragon) has returned to Shanghai port after
successfully completing a scientific mission at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
This was the 13th expedition to the Antarctic continent since
the first trip in 1984. The Xuelong left Shanghai Port on November
18, 1996, sailing 17,605.5 nautical miles in 154 days.
</P>
<P>
The vessel has shipped fuel, equipment, food and personnel to
the Chinese research base on the South Pole and conducted
scientific research there.
</P>
<P>
Chen Liqi, leader of the polar expedition, said the current
mission was based on an in-depth research plan listed in China's
1996-2000 guidelines for Antarctic study.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in the first Sino-Japanese cooperation
in high-altitude physical observation. Team members have spent two
weeks selecting a location, surveying ground and building an
observation center on the peak of the western slope of the South
Pole.
</P>
<P>
They have also obtained data on the influence of sunspots on
the Earth and the role of sunspots in the Earth's magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
Eight Chinese and foreign team members have travelled 400 km on
sleds to collect over 100 samples.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Zairean Warring Factions Can Never </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean civil war has
unfortunately been raging for months and showing no sign of an
end, which, however, does not mean impossibility of peace
settlement to the bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
This is because both the rebel leader Laurent Kabila and
embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko never refused international
mediation though they are fighting each other in a tit-for-tat
way.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the major mediator in the Zairean crisis, was
preparing for the first face-to-face talks between Mobutu and
Kabila, scheduled in Cape Town on April 23.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela had formally invited
Mobutu to hold peace talks with Kabila in South Africa as soon as
possible, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad made the
announcement following Mandela's meeting with Kabila and Mobutu's
special envoy Honore Ngbanda last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu has made it clear that he would accept Mandela's
invitation while Kabila kept reiterating his commitment to a
peaceful and negotiated settlement to the crisis in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, While Mandela was reportedly confident that the talks
would be held soon, local analysts are still doubtful about any
obvious results of the forthcoming peace talks, if held as
planned, as Mobutu and Kabila are still miles away with each
other over what they are talking about at the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said he would only talk with President Mobutu about how
Mobutu steps down, whereas cancer-stricken Mobutu declared he
would not give up power except through the internationally
supervised general elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers of the Zairean crisis said the sharp differences
between them are very much likely to put the talks into deadlock.
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally on Saturday in Lubumbashi, the second largest
city in Zaire, Kabila vowed to continue military offensives
against Mobutu until the rebels take over capital of Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"Mobutu must give up power, give up his army, put down the
arms so there can be a peaceful transfer of power," Kabila
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Kabila's fiery speech will more or less
bring some new difficulties to the Zairean peace talks sponsored
by South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Learn Democracy Through Village Election (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comparing village elections from two different eras, elderly
villager Han said that current election process is "more formal
and modernized."
</P>
<P>
"For example, today's ballots have the candidates' names
printed on them, and you can make your choice by marking circles
or crosses. They also leave blank space for you to suggest new
candidates. This is convenient and democratic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhikuan, author of the Wuxiang County Annals, attributed the
popularity of "bean-dropping" in the past to the then high
illiteracy rate among farmers, and to the wartime shortage of
materials necessary for a formal election, such as paper,
blackboards and chalk.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of voting method has not been practiced for a long
time in Shanxi," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, in some poverty-stricken mountainous villages, people
are still fashioning simple and thrifty ballots.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Huluanling Village, several kilometers away from
Hanbei, voted with hand-written ballots, using red sheets and
duplicating paper that cost less than 20 yuan (2.5 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li said that village elections in the 1940s had no concrete
regulations nor set procedure, and the villagers usually decided
some simple principles and stipulations themselves.
</P>
<P>
"For example, most villages forbade people who collaborated
with the Japanese or had venereal diseases to participate in the
election," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the National People's Congress, China's top
legislature, adopted a Law on the Organization of the Villagers'
Committee. The Provincial People's Congress of Shanxi then
formulated the "Methods of the Election of the Villagers'
Committee."
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, many Shanxi farmers have used the two
legal documents to fight against illegal activities in village
elections.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the fourth village election, the Shanxi Provincial
Department of Civil Affairs, overseer of the election, compiled a
"Handbook on the Procedure of the Village Election," which
demanded that special booths for secret balloting be set up.
</P>
<P>
"We intended to fully guarantee the villagers' freedom to
express their individual wishes," said an official with the
department. "Most villages set up the booths, though not all
villagers could understand its significance."
</P>
<P>
Booth styles varied from village to village. Some were
makeshift, made of plywood. Others were offices of the villagers'
committee or classrooms in the village school.
</P>
<P>
The simplest booth was just a desk with bamboo poles tied to
the legs and covered with red cloth.
</P>
<P>
One farmer said after casting his vote, "Secret balloting is
really a good idea. It enables us to choose whomever we want to
choose without any interference."

<HEADLINE> Imports of Syria's Private Sector Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The imports of Syria's private
sector increased from 140 million U.S. dollars in 1987 to some
803 million dollars in 1995, according to a latest economic study
published here.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's import share in the total national
imports rose from 21.5 percent in 1987 to 65.3 percent in
1995. This enormous rise is due to the measures taken by the
Syrian government to encourage the private sector to import
commodities from abroad, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the export of Syria's private sector also
increased from 52.2 million dollars in 1987 to 295 million
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Excluding oil exports, the private sector's exports in Syria's
total national exports rose from 33 percent in 1987 to 69 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The study noted that the imports of Syria's private sector
rise at a rate higher than that of the exports.
</P>
<P>
The decline in Syrian exports is due to the fact that Syrian
products are unable to compete with those of Western countries.
</P>
<P>
So the Syrian government has taken measures, in collaboration
with the European Union (EU), to improve the quality of Syrian
products.
</P>
<P>
Syria is due to establish a common free market with the EU in
the year 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Tamil rebel leader is worried
about the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) isolation in the
 international community, according to reports reaching here from
the north this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Velupillai Prabhakaram, the LTTE leader, is
very worried that the LTTE's international image has reached its
lowest point and the rebel organization has been heavily
criticized by the international community for its campaign of
naked, brutal terror in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakaram had summoned rebel leaders to discuss the situation
faced by the LTTE and order them to prevent it from being totally
isolated and ostracized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year guerrilla war for a
separate Tamil state in the northeast of the country and more than
55,000 people have reportedly been killed in the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Calls for Proper Arrangement for Laid-offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Council urges that
proper arrangements be made for laid off workers by setting up
re-employment service centers that would seek more job
opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has issued a circular asking experimental
cities that they optimize capital structure to care about the
lives of laid-off workers and to maintain social stability. It
asked the experimental cities to set up re-employment service
centers at various levels in accordance with reform on employment
and social security systems and local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Expenses used to arrange workers of bankrupt enterprises should
be allocated from legal payment the bankrupt enterprises receive
from transfer of the right of land use, said the State Council in
the latest statement on the experiment carried out in dozens of
cities with the mergers and bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises
and the re-employment of their workers.
</P>
<P>
China started optimizing capital structure and revitalizing
enterprises in 1994 when 18 cities were selected for a trial
study. The number of experimental cities increased to 50 last
year, and eight more were chosen as comparable cities.
</P>
<P>
On enterprises who leave the right of land use as a mortgage,
the State Council said that the priority of distributing the
transfer earnings should be given to the arrangement of
employees. The insufficient part will be met successively by the
income from handling mortgaged and unmortgaged property.
</P>
<P>
Local government will have to pay for the arrangement of
employees if a bankrupt enterprise affiliated to the government
can not afford the arrangement even after it is auctioned.
</P>
<P>
The fund for arrangement of employees will be appropriated to
the re-employment service center for comprehensive use. Each laid-
off worker can receive a sum of arrangement money that equals to
three times the average annual income of a worker in the previous
year in the same city.
</P>
<P>
Pensions and medicare costs of retired workers of the
bankrupted enterprise will be paid by local social welfare and
medical insurance organizations, or local social mutual-assistance
foundations will take the responsibility if the bankrupt
enterprises have paid into the social mutual-assistance fund.
</P>
<P>
If the enterprise did not pay the fund or local social
mutual-assistance foundations can not afford the payment, the
enterprise will compensate its retired workers with payment by
transferring the right of land use. Incomes from handling
mortgaged property and unmortgaged property will be candidate
resources if the land use money is not enough to pay
compensation.

<HEADLINE> Principles for HK Civil Liberties, Social Order Outlined (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chief
Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) today issued a statement on the background and guiding
principles of the proposals on the amendments to the Societies
Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, the HKSAR Chief Executive's Office issued a
document titled "Civil Liberties and Social Order" to solicit
suggestions from the communities on the proposals on the
amendments to the two ordinances.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on February 23, the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress resolved that major amendments
to the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance
introduced in 1992 and 1995 shall not be adopted as the laws of
the HKSAR. Therefore Hong Kong needs to enact laws on its own to
avoid any legal vacuum on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that in enacting the laws, Hong Kong must ensure that
they are consistent with the Basic Law and the U.N. International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as they are applied to Hong
 Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We also aim to strike a balance between civil liberties and
social order," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that to protect Hong Kong's own interests and in view
of the close geographic, economic and social links between Hong
Kong and China's inland areas, Hong Kong should introduce measures
to prevent foreign political forces from using Hong Kong to
conduct political activities targeted at China and to prevent
political organizations in Hong Kong from being controlled by
foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also clarified a few concepts including "national
 security," "political organizations" and "foreign ties."
</P>
<P>
On the concept of "national security," he said that as early as
 1991, the Bill of Rights Ordinance laid down that freedom of
assembly and freedom of association may be subject to some
restrictions which are necessary in a democratic society in the
interest of national security.
</P>
<P>
These stem from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which relates "national security" to measures enacted with a view
to safeguarding territorial integrity and national independence
from any external threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposals in the Consultation Document regarding
assembly and association are strictly in accordance with the Hong
Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
On some people's worries that the HKSAR government might base
its interpretation of "national security" on China's National
Security Law, he said Article 8 of the Basic Law guarantees that
the common law system will continue to be adopted in the
HKSAR. Since the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order
Ordinance are Hong Kong laws, any interpretation of "national
security" will have to be based on common law principles and
precedent cases.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Document on Enterprise Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Both the principal and interest
of bank loans extended to bankrupt state enterprises can only be
cancelled after the enterprises' qualification of legal persons is
abolished, their land-use right and property are auctioned, and
their employees are well arranged, according to a State Council
document.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the land and property of bankrupt
enterprises should be assessed by institutions approved by the
concerned department of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The property and land-use right should be transfered according
to state regulations, generally, by auction.
</P>
<P>
Concerned government departments should investigate the cause
of the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Those who are responsible for the bankruptcy should never be
leaders of other enterprises, and those who have violated the law
should be punished, the document says.
</P>
<P>
The document bans evasion of debts by such tactics as
announcing bankruptcy, or doing the same job after the enterprise
has declared bankruptcy.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
(IOC) officials will examine the budget for the Sydney 2000
Olympic Games on Monday, local organisers said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 16 members of the IOC co-ordination commission arrived at
the weekend for informal talks ahead of the official start of
their inspection tour on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commission will examine the budget of the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the New South Wales
(NSW) state government's planned Games spending.
</P>
<P>
Senior IOC official Thierry Sprunger was quoted in The Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper last week as saying he thought it was
important for Olympic Games to break even and "not dig too much
into the taxpayers' pockets".
</P>
<P>
Whether that will happen has become the focus of attention for
politicians and media observers. SOCOG said 10 days ago they
expected a budget surplus of up to 50 million Australian Dollars
(38.5 million U.S. dollars) and had set up a 150 million
Australian Dollars "rainy day" fund.

TOKYO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Richard Krajicek defeated
Lionel Roux of France to win the men's singles title at the Japan
Open tennis tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch reigning Wimbledon champion needed three sets to beat
his French rival 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's event, local player Ai Sugiyama took the
title by beating American Amy Frazier 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek looked unstoppable as he roared away with the first
set 6-2 but at the start of the second set his serve started to
fail him and Roux broke for 2-1 -- the first time Krajicek had
dropped serve all tournament.
</P>
<P>
Roux went on to take the set 6-3 with a flurry of stinging
returns and accurate passing shots.

<HEADLINE> Doohan Wins 500cc at Japan Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Triple world champion Michael
Doohan led a Honda works team for a sweep of the Japanese 500cc
Grand Prix motor cycling in Suzuka on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Works and private Honda machines also won the 250cc and 125cc
races while Japanese riders dominated the top four places in each
category.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, who won the season-opening Malaysian round last week,
slipped down the field with a stiff clutch and was four seconds
off the front pack after two laps.
</P>
<P>
But he charged back to take the lead from Japanese teammate
Tadayuki Okada on the 10th lap, and survived a wheel-to-wheel
battle with Spaniard Alex Criville in the final five laps to notch
his 36th career Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
He finished the 21-lap race in 45 minutes 11.995 seconds on the
5.86-kilometer Suzuka circuit, at an average speed of 163.465
kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Criville, second overall last season and at Malaysia behind
Doohan, trailed home 0.431 seconds behind. Okada, who has started
the first two Grand Prix of the season on pole position, was third
5.616 seconds further back.
</P>
<P>
A fourth member of the Repson Honda team, Japanese rider Takuma
Aoki, was fourth ahead of his elder brother Nobuatsu on a
non-works Honda.
</P>
<P>
Wildcard Daijiro Kato on a factory Honda outfoxed regulars to
take the 250cc event and Noboru Ueda steered a private Honda to
his first Grand Prix win in three years in the 125cc.

DAMASCUS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian official newspaper
today called on the United States to honor its obligations and
pledges to establish a fair and overall peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should take a fair attitude to set things right and
to put an end to Israel's provocative actions, the official
newspaper Al-Thawrah said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. can do so if it is willing to force Israel to comply
with principles and foundations of a fair and overall peace in
the region, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It denounced the Israeli government for its continued policy
of arrogance, saying that only a fair and overall peace capable
of lifting injustice, ending occupation and ensuring the
restoration of land and rights of the Palestinians will provide
security and stability for peoples of the region.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Persistent Efforts Needed to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 20 (Xinhua) -- It seems that Pakistan's
spiraling trade deficit has not been properly checked as the trade
gap for the first nine months of the current fiscal year stands at
2.62 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the trade gap declined by 1.87 percent from the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, a mere 3.39
percent increase in exports in the first three quarters of the
1996-97 fiscal year is way behind the anticipated target.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the current fiscal year, the Pakistani
government fixed an export target of 10 billion dollars,
expecting an increase of 15 percent in exports over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that with only three months to go before the end
of the current fiscal year, the export target is extremely hard to
be reached. And it also seems to be a tough task for the
government which hopes to contain the trade deficit within less
than three billion dollars by the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's export industry, which has long been in a depressed
situation, is facing quite a number of problems which have
hampered an adequate growth in this vital sector.
</P>
<P>
The problems facing the export industry as identified by the
government include macroeconomic instability, high input costs,
high transport and infrastructure costs, poor port facilities,
high rates of local taxes, shortage of skilled labor, and lack of
efficient promotion agencies.
</P>
<P>
These problems are believed to be broad-ranging, and the
government will have to formulate meaningful and comprehensive
plans to overcome the hurdles that have long hindered a robust
export growth.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that the genesis of the depressed
situation in Pakistan's export sector lies in the country's
industrial development not being export-oriented from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
This situation, unfortunately, still persists in a protected
domestic market, rendering industry inefficient both technically
and financially in facing competition from foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports are rather limited to a few products like
raw cotton, cotton manufactures and rice which in recent years
have accounted for 60 percent of merchandise export receipts.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, deficient in value-added exports, is still largely a
cotton-based economy which makes it vulnerable to vagaries of
nature and developments in international cotton market.
</P>
<P>
And insufficient incentives to the downstream textile sector,
which produces higher value-added goods and is lack of adequate
access to export finance, are believed to be among the dampening
factors impeding growth in exports.
</P>
<P>
A narrow base, small exportable surplus and lack of
diversification deprived the country of its full potential in
exports when its share stands at only 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of the slow growth in exports and ever increasing
imports, the trade gap has been rising steadily while the current
account deficit stood at 4.6 billion dollars in the last fiscal
year, compared with 905 million dollars in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that while export expansion depends on
output growth and a competitive cost and pricing structure,
domestic financial stability and avoidance of demand-pull
inflation are necessary pre-conditions for sustained progress.
</P>
<P>
To sustain a high rate of export growth, the country's
industrialization should proceed on the basis of efficiency,
competition and comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
The government, led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif which came
to power in mid February, has rightly given high priority to the
task of vigorously boosting exports by concentrating on
macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is also hoping to cut down imports of
a number of agricultural products including wheat, sugar and
edible oil to reduce ever increasing import bills.
</P>
<P>
However, to accelerate the pace of exports to a respectable
level, persistent efforts must be made to achieve a technological
breakthrough, particularly in the sphere of value added items.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Scholars Oppose Human Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A number of Muslim scholars
attending a seminar for debates on cloning held here Saturday
were opposed to human cloning, saying human cloning is prohibited
in Islam.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar organized by the Kuwait-based Islamic
Organization for Medical Sciences, dozens of scholars from
various Muslim Arab states said that although human cloning
technique had not advanced as yet, it would clash with Islamic
Sharia.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Rejai Al-Jundi, Assistant Secretary General of the
Islamic Organization, declared earlier that the seminar would be
aimed at shedding light on medical and legal aspects of the
internationally controversial issue and seeking to take a stand
on it.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held in the context of a recently reported
sheep cloning case in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in Britain have recently succeeded in cloning a
sheep. This triggered widespread debates on potential
ramifications of the medical breakthrough and aroused fears about
possible application of the technique to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Cloning has been widely used in the West to improve quality of
seeds. The latest breakthrough resulting in the production of a
sheep called "Dolly" has triggered outcries on necessity of
drawing ethical limits on scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
Al-Jundi said Islamic scholars held a seminar themed
"Reproduction in Light of Islam" in 1980 on cloning. Participants
voiced no opposition to applying cloning to animals and plants
for the sake of enriching the globe's food wealth. But they
opposed to human cloning.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday seminar was the first of its kind held by the
Islamic organization which was founded in 1984 with the aim of
boosting coordination between theologians and medical
scientists.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Use Bacteria to Treat Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed a technique that uses bacteria to treat wastes from the
petro-chemical industries, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The technique developed by the Haifa Technion offers an
solution to the problem of raw waste material that would otherwise
contaminate the earth.
</P>
<P>
The petro-chemical industries near Haifa, north Israel, have
accumulated over 10,000 tonnes of such poisonous waste products
without knowing how to dispose of them.
</P>
<P>
The sticky, oily contaminants are sediments from the process
of separating crude oil from water in storage vats.
</P>
<P>
Every year, approximately 600 tonnes of the stuff are
produced. If the material entered underground aquifers or the
land, it would pose a serious danger to people's health and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
At the initiative of the petro-chemical industries, researchers
of the Haifa Technion sought a technique called bioremediation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very simple idea," said the researchers. "The earth
is rich in bacteria, some of which are able to decompose the
contaminants."
</P>
<P>
By adding oxygen, water and fertilizer, the bacteria can feed
on the waste products even more enthusiastically. The climatic
conditions here allow maximum benefits as the bacteria thrive in
warmer temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yoram Avnimelech, who is responsible for the project,
noted that below the heaps of earth, wastes and bacteria is
plastic sheeting that prevents poisons from reaching groundwater.
</P>
<P>
In addition, bacteria that are natural to the environment are
used, so the ecological balance is not disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Once the petro-chemical industries are convinced, he said, all
factories that produce such contaminants will hopefully adopt the
technique.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Media Responses Positively to German, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian official media today made
a positive response to the statements by German and French
foreign ministers, saying "Neither Iran nor EU wants
deterioration in their relations."
</P>
<P>
The official English daily Tehran Times said in its editorial
that "the Iranian nation expects the foreign ministers of EU to
take a rational stance in their April 29-30 meeting to pave the
way for a dynamic cooperation between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
"Any irrational stance by the EU foreign ministers will
definitely serve the interests of the Zionist and the U.S. which
will be virtually to the detriment of the European countries,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Another English daily Kayhan International, which is very
close to the Information Ministry, said that the recent tension
between Iran and EU is coming down and "Iran will respond
positively to EU and German overtures and will avoid cutting off
relations with Germany."
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette have made statements in the past few
days, stressing on maintaining cordial ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said at Bundestag Thursday that it was imperative
to maintain links with Tehran. "We don't have the right to break
off lines of dialogue with Iran ... A ban period must not
destroy what it has taken years to put in place ..."
</P>
<P>
Herve de Charette said Saturday that "Iran is a great country
which occupies a strategic position in the Middle East... Its
people have a major role to play in the future and we wish to
have a mutually beneficial dialogue with this country and this
people."
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times' editorial said that the statements of the
two foreign ministers indicate that both of them are determined
to maintain cordial ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
It said "without any doubt Iran too does not want a
crisis in its ties with the EU provided European countries
realize the sensitivity of our people to any sacrilege of our
values."
</P>
<P>
"Basically, there is an understanding between the two sides
that Iran-EU cordial ties are in both sides' interests," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that Iran has time and again proved
its sincerity in maintaining good relations with the EU which
has thus far paved the way for an active German-French role in
the crisis management in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court verdict on the Mykonos case, which charged
top Iranian leaders with involvement in killing the four Kurdish
opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant five years ago,
sparked a crisis in relations between Iran and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Iran had recalled their ambassadors and expelled
four diplomats from each side. Ambassadors from EU member
nations have also been recalled from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Saturday
expressed Iran's welcome to the return of Australian and New
Zealand ambassadors, saying "we will take into account the steps
taken by these two countries in determining their future
relations with Iran."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Complains Over Tanzania-Zambia Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said the
system of collecting and disbursing Tanzania-Zambia Railway
Authority (TAZARA)'s revenue is "cumbersome" and can not be
allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
Keli Walubita, acting minister of the Zambian Communications and
Transport said in Mpika, northeast Zambia, on Saturday that the
revenue should not be sent to Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania,
and banked in Germany before disbursement.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to complaints by the TAZARA management that it has
failed to pay its workers on time because the money collected is
banked in Germany, Walubita said the system is bureaucratic and
had better change.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) that
ZCCM will not be at risk in transporting its cargo on TAZARA
railway because measures are being taken to improve its
operations.
</P>
<P>
The official warned that the government will not spare TAZARA
managers who have been implicated in thefts of transit goods from
the wagons.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM and other major companies in Zambia are now less willing
to move their goods on TAZARA because of the rampant thefts,
Walubita said.

<HEADLINE> Top Ugandan Commander Shifts Northward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Major General Salim Saleh, army
commander in northern Uganda, shifted northward as the clashes
between the government troops and the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) rebels intensified, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Saleh has moved from Gulu to Kitgum, and Colonel James Kazini,
commander of the fourth division, has moved from Gulu to Ngoromo
close to Uganda-Sudan border, "the Monitor" newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The fourth division is the main forces of Ugandan armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Saleh has moved last month from Gulu to Arua in the northwest
before rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) had been
defeated. His movement was considered by local observers as a
indicator of intensity of army action.
</P>
<P>
The move was in the wake of a series of fightings between the
government troops and LRA rebels. The Ministry of Defense said
earlier on Wednesday that the government troops have killed 128
Sudanese soldiers and LRA rebels and captured another 164 in a
clash on Uganda-Sudan border.
</P>
<P>
LRA has sent 600 rebels to northern Uganda recently, said
another local newspaper "the New Vision" reported today.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Predicts 7.5 Percent Non-Oil Growth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank report under
preparation has predicted a 7.5 percent annual growth for
Nigeria's non-oil sector if reforms of 1995-1996 are sustained
and others quickly put in place.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said by the year 2010, Nigeria's economy
could be less dependent on oil with manufacturing almost doubling
its share of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth coupled with a drastic redirection in public
expenditure would lower not only the percentage of people living
in poverty, but also the absolute number of Nigerians living
below the poverty.
</P>
<P>
The bank suggested a continuation of current policy of
deregulation as opposed to the restructured policies introduced
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The precondition for renewed growth can be found in recent
government decisions to retain fiscal discipline, create a
market-determining exchange rate, remove impediments to foreign
investment and ownership, start strengthening the banking sector
and eliminate interest rates and credit controls.
</P>
<P>
However, additional policies, including consistent fiscal
surpluses of around two percent to three percent, removal of
subsidies and unification of the nominal exchange rate, would
facilitate rapid growth and a reduction in poverty in the
Africa's most populous country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Media Predict No Indictment Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is likely to escape an indictment today by
state prosecutors, but he will still face a crisis of survival,
local media predicted.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Edana Arbel and Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein are due to announce their decision this evening on
whether to endorse the police recommendation of indicting
Netanyahu and other officials for their involvement in the
Bar-On scandal.
</P>
<P>
Police charges against Netanyahu, together with Justice
Minister Tzahi Hanegbi and Prime Minister's Office
Director-General Avigdor Liberman involve breach of trust and
fraud in the short-lived appointment of former Jerusalem lawyer
Roni Bar-On as the attorney-general in January.
</P>
<P>
Shas party leader Aryeh Deri was accused of blackmailing in
pushing for the appointment of Bar-On in hope for obtaining a
plea bargain deal in his bribery trial.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Radio reported today that while three
prosecutors in the State Attorney's Office supported the police
indictment against Netanyahu, but it seemed that Arbel and
Rubinstein decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi and Prime Minister's Office
Direcotr-General Avigdor Liberman will also probably not be
indicted, but Deri is almost certain to be charged with
blackmailing. But Hebrew newspaper Maariv said that Liberman was
likely to be charged also.
</P>
<P>
The state attorney' decision to drop the indictment against
Netanyahu, Hanegbi and Liberman was because they apparently
thought that the police accusations of breach of trust, an
offense restricted to public servants for acting for reasons
other than the public good, would be difficult to prove in the
court, The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
However, even if no indictment is filed against Netanyahu,
the current government will still face a crisis of survival,
because the State Attorney is expected to criticize harshly the
prime minister for his role in the scandal. The leading Hebrew
newspaper Yediot Ahronot said the state attorney Arbel would
mention in her final report the opinion of the three
prosecutors in her office on indicting Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In that case, according to Israel Radio, five ministers will
possibly quit the coalition: Finance Minister Dan Meridor and
Communications Minister Limor Livnat of the Likud, Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky and Absorption Minister Yuli Eldestein
of Yisrael Baaliya, and Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani of The Third Way.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- In anticipation of today's
decision, there was a flurry of contacts over the weekend by all
sides of the political spectrum. The Likud began a dialogue with
Yisrael Baaliya and The Third Way in an attempt to prevent their
walkout in the event of a censorious report.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Baaliay and The Third Way have planned to convene
urgent meetings tonight following the state attorney's
announcement to decide their future participation in the
Likud-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's aides meanwhile issued signals that the prime
minister would not take revenge on the ministers who failed to
support him during the crisis. This is apparently aimed at
preventing defections by ministers such as Meridor and Livnat.
</P>
<P>
On the front of the opposition camp, Labor and Meretz were
already planning petitions to the High Court of Justice in the
event that no one is indicted. The High Court can overrule the
state attorney's decision to drop charges against the prime
minister and other officials. The Labor is demanding a state
inquiry commission be set up to examine the whole affair,
regardless of whether or not there are indictments.
</P>
<P>
Meretz activists have put up banners at major junctions
throughout the Tel Aviv area, saying: "Corruption trumps with
Bibi (Netanyahu)." Labor officials are also making hectic
attempts to contact central figures in both Yisrael Baalia and
The Third Way, trying to persuade them to bolt the coalition to
pave the way for new elections.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, if the government loses its majority of 61
seats in the 120-seat Knesset (Parliament), new elections should
be held both for the prime minister and the Knesset within 60
days.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Invests Heavily in Water Conservancy Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province is
to earmark 2.47 billion yuan to harness the Minjiang, Jinjiang and
Jiulong rivers in the coming three to five years.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 hydraulic engineering workers have set off for
the three rivers to make early preparations.
</P>
<P>
The move aims at bringing floods under control in early next
century.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, mountainous areas in Fujian have frequently
been hit by rainstorms and floods and suffered huge economic
losses. Nanping, Sanming and Longyan, three grain producers in
Fujian, were stricken by four extraordinary floods in five years.
</P>
<P>
To date, the 57 riverside cities have not completed
flood-control facilities. Thirty counties sit at places below the
warning lines. Possible floods pose hidden threats to five million
people and local industry and agriculture with a combined output
value of hundreds of billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the provincial government has listed water
conservancy high on its agency since the beginning of this year.
It plans to add 20 million yuan in river-harnessing in each of
next few years, in addition to previously-set annual investment of
20 million in this regard.

A circular issued by the Industry Ministry recently said air
service on domestic routes would be opened to the private sector
in phases.

The state-run Bangladesh Biman, which is finding it difficult
to cope with the increasing demands of air passengers to different

As more and more visitors are arriving in the country and
visiting different areas looking for business and investment
opportunities, the demand for services of small aircraft and
helicopters is increasing, said an official of the Industry
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some companies, both local and foreign, would prefer now to
procure and operate light aircraft in view of their increasing
activities and the new decision would facilitate it, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The circular said the government's move is aimed at speeding up
the privatization policy, and the relevant provisions of the
Industrial Policy had been amended.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Set to Open 58 km Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has completed the work
of laying the 58 kilometer Ashuganj-Bakhrabad (AB) gas pipeline
which is expected to improve the energy supply situation in the
country's southeastern region, said officials of the Energy
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline is expected to ensure an additional supply of
80 to 85 MCFD (million cubic feet daily) to the southeastern
Chittagong region where power generation as well as fertilizer
production have suffered due to a gas shortage.
</P>
<P>
The contractors and engineers had completed the most crucial
phase of the work by crossing the river Titas and connecting the
new AB pipeline with the national grid at Bakhrabad point, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting for a few minor works like tying, welding,
cleaning and testing to be completed before the pipeline can be
put on stream by the end of this month," said Energy Minister
Nooruddin Khan last week.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5 billion taka (about 375 million U.S. dollars) project,
implemented with a World Bank credit, was designed to bring
surplus natural gas from the reserves in the northeastern Sylhet
region and put them onto the national grid to reinforce gas supply
in the Chittagong region.
</P>
<P>
Work on the project started in 1995 and was scheduled to be
completed by June 1996. But the contractors suspended their work
since early 1996, due largely to political unrest.
</P>
<P>
However, the work resumed on a fast-track basis in November
1996 to augment gas supply to the Chittagong region which
experienced a serious energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the commissioning of the AB pipeline would
enable the authorities to resume operation of the 210 megawatt
gas-fired Raozan Power Plant by the first week of next month, said
the officials of the Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that AB pipeline would help resume
production at the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Ltd. The plant has
remained inactive for months due to the shortage of gas supply,
the officials added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Poor performances in other parts
of the world will not alter Apple Computer International's
strategy in China where the US company is experiencing robust
sales, general manager Vincent Tai said.
</P>
<P>
"Apple's business in China is very encouraging," Tai, who is
responsible for mainland and Hong Kong operations, was quoted by
today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Its sales rose 35 percent in the first and second quarters of
the 1997 fiscal year, Tai said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore were the most
profitable areas for Apple, he said. That's why it doesn't include
them in its world-wide layoff plan.
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, chairman and CEO Gilbert Amelio announced that
the company would cut 4,100 jobs worldwide. Of them, 2,700 were
permanent staff and 1,400 were temporary staff.
</P>
<P>
Half the layoffs will be in the United States, Tai said. In the
Asian-Pacific region, 20 employees in Australia will lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Apple will continue to recruit staff in China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates our commitment in China will not be
altered," he said.

<P>
More than 60 Chinese software developers have signed

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Poland Sign Pacts on Judicial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Poland signed two
agreements here to promote their cooperation on judicial matters
as well as bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two pacts -- one on the transfer of prisoners and
enforcement of penal sentence and another on narcotics control --
were signed by Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and
visiting Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, a prisoner requested to be transferred
must serve a minimum sentence in the country where the crime was
committed and the remaining jail time must not be less than one
year, according to a statement released by the Thai Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the documents, the two countries also will cooperate on
drug suppression, including control of chemicals used for illegal
drug production and launching of rehabilitation and technical
training programs.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Prachuab and Rosati also discussed
several other issues when they met on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab proposed that Poland set up an action plan to promote
political, economic and cultural cooperation between Thailand and
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Ministry officials said that the action plan will
cover cooperation among Poland, Thailand and other countries in
the Mekong region.
</P>
<P>
Poland could be a distribution center for Thai products to
other Baltic and eastern European countries, Prachuab said.
</P>
<P>
Rosati expressed support for the Thai proposal, saying that he
would see bilateral cooperation through the two nations' chambers
of commerce.
</P>

Poland reportedly also expressed interest in joining the
25-nation Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM).

<HEADLINE> Commentary on Dalai's Activities: Religious Leader or Obstacle to Building Religious Order? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another clear piece of evidence that proves the Dalai's
sabotage of Tibetan Buddhism is that he preached "Tibetan
independence" in the name of religion, and wantonly instigated
Buddhist monks and nuns who are ignorant of the facts to engage in
activities to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai repeatedly claimed, "To confirm a living Buddha or
control a temple means having an entire area in hand."
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the Dalai and his followers in recent years
stepped up their efforts to infiltrate Tibet and monasteries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
His sutras broadcast on radio abroad were often mixed with
numerous speeches that advocated "Tibetan independence" and the
splitting of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also personally wrote a great deal of so-called "religious
scriptures" or propaganda materials, which contained many
political rumors against the government and seditious comments
inciting separatist activities, and had them smuggled into Tibet
for distribution in the monasteries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Dalai's sabotage, the normal religious
activities in some monasteries have been seriously affected, and
the religious atmosphere there has been deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Monasteries, monks and nuns bewitched by Dalai's separatist
speeches and ideas were eager to act as "political monasteries"
and "political monks and nuns," and engaged at will in political
activities for splitting the country.
</P>
<P>
In these monasteries, little attention was paid to monks'
religious attainment, religious discipline was loose and
management was in chaos.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these monasteries had neither rules and regulations
nor proper procedures for the initiation of new monks, and illegal
and decadent activities were rampant there.
</P>
<P>
These monasteries and their monks no longer bore the basic
characteristics of Buddhist temples and monks. All eminent and
respected personages in the circle of Tibetan Buddhism were
heavy-hearted and deeply discontented about this situation.
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the Dalai seemed to have a special interest in
"religious activities," but it's not hard for discerning people to
see that the Dalai's religious activities have not only become
extremely absurd in form, but also strayed far from the essence
of Tibetan Buddhism in design.
</P>
<P>
According to news reports, the Dalai in recent years has
frequently held "time-wheel abhiseka grand summons ceremonies."
Four such occasions were held in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
This not only went against the long-practiced concept of the
time-wheel doctrine, which uses a year as the basic time unit in
the universe and stipulates that the time-wheel grand summons
ceremony should be held no more than once a year, but also
violated religious rituals that should be strictly followed in
grand abhiseka summons ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
More seriously, the Dalai, turning a blind eye to the Buddhist
commandment that Buddhists should always embody kindness and
goodwill, unceasingly and wantonly attacked the central
government, spread various lies, and stirred up animosity between
different ethnic groups, thus turning the ceremony into a
political gathering.
</P>
<P>
This has fully exposed the hypocrisy of the Dalai's so-called
qualities of "mercy," "kindness" and "non-violence," as well as
his malicious activities of breaking religious commandments and
rules at will, and using religion as a cover to serve his
political plot to split the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Commentary on Dalai's Activities: Religious Leader or Obstacle to Building Religious Order? (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dalai's relationship with the Japanese religious cult Aum
Shinrikyo (Supreme Truth), which gained notoriety after launching
a lethal serine gas attack in a Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995,
showed more clearly that he would not hesitate to harm the
reputation of Tibetan Buddhism to attain the goal of boosting
publicity for "independence of Tibet."
</P>
<P>
According to overseas media, the Dalai Lama met five times with
Shoko Asahara, head of Aum Shinrikyo, and twice asked Asahara to
go to Tibet to "do missionary work."
</P>
<P>
Even when the Tokyo District Court started public legal
procedures against Asahara in connection with the Tokyo subway gas
attack, the Dalai Lama still maintained that Aum Shinrikyo was
publicizing Buddhist doctrines, and Asahara was his friend.
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder that a newspaper commentary said, "without
the Dalai's support, Asahara could not have established his cult
empire, nor could he have been skyrocketed so successfully from a
quack and a petty swindler to a cult guru in Japan over a period
of only a few years."
</P>
<P>
The mass of religious believers and religious figures in Tibet,
seeing these facts, have come to realize that the Dalai, despite
his masquerade as a "religious leader," is actually a politician
in exile who seeks to lead Tibetan Buddhism astray, and that the
Dalai is using Tibetan Buddhism as a political tool to aid his
separatist activities rather than promote the religion.
</P>
<P>
The activities of the Dalai Lama have had a seriously
detrimental impact on Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
In China, every individual and every organization, including a
religious one, must defend the dignity of the law and the
interests of the people, ethnic unity and national unification.
</P>
<P>
No individual and no organization, including a religious one,
is allowed to violate state law, infringe upon the interests of
the people, attempt to split the nation, or sabotage national
unification. These are the basic codes of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai's activities over the past decades were totally
contrary to these principles. He has been crying out his
grievances everywhere abroad, complaining that the Chinese
government has belittled his religious status and damaged his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the Dalai's own doings that have revealed his
true colors as one who uses religion for separatist purposes.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that any attempts to conduct separatist
activities that endanger the interests of the people and damage
ethnic unity, using religion as a political tool, will only come
to naught.  (

<HEADLINE> Commentary on Dalai's Activities: Religious Leader or Obstacle to Building Religious Order? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A commentary by Xinhua
commentator today repudiated the Dalai Lama's activities over the
past decades which have disrupted and hindered the development of
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The commentary entitled "A Religious Leader or the Biggest
Obstacle to Building the Normal Order of Tibetan Buddhism" reads
in full as follows:
</P>
<P>
In Buddhism, including the school of Tibetan Buddhism,
religious disciplines have been honored for thousands of years,
and the spreading of the Buddhist doctrines in an effort to
benefit all living beings is the religion's lofty ideal.
</P>
<P>
But take a look at what the Dalai Lama has done.
</P>
<P>
He has never performed a single act in the interests of the
monks and laymen in Tibet, nor has he made any contribution to the
development of the region.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, flaunting the banner of a "religious leader"
of Tibetan Buddhism, he has carried out various political
activities for splitting the motherland, actuated by his political
needs for plotting to achieve the "independence of Tibet" and
restoring the old serfdom.
</P>
<P>
By using Tibetan Buddhism as a political tool to incite
separatism, the dalai Lama has been engaged in a number of
activities to wreck Tibet and the Buddhist religion, to destroy
the religion's normal order, and to willfully violate religious
disciplines. He has done many evils to betray the religion's goals
as well as Buddhist doctrines.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Dalai Lama has stood as the biggest obstacle to
building the normal order of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious example of this was his attempt to disrupt and
ruin the search for the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen by
trampling on historical customs and religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has knowledge of Tibetan history knows that Tibetan
Buddhism has finally formed a system of the reincarnation of a
major living buddha like the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in
the course of the development of the religion and with the
approval of the central government.This is a unique system of
Tibetan Buddhism for religious inheritance.
</P>
<P>
According to the system, the seeking of the reincarnated soul
boy of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama follows a set of strict
procedures and special rules. And the reincarnation's enthroning
has to be approved, without exception, by the central government.
</P>
<P>
In 1793, Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty of China
promulgated the "29-Article Statutes," which clearly stipulated
that the affirmation of the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the
Panchen Lama and big Huutuketuu, or "living buddha" in Mongolian
language, must be approved after drawing lots from a gold urn
offered by the emperor in front of the statue of Sakyamuni. The
central government's resident minister in Tibet must preside over
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Fraudulent appointments made as a result of selfish motives or
for personal gains are strictly banned, according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
Many historical documents kept by the Tibetan local government
and the central government have recorded in detail the fact that
the choosing and affirmation of the reincarnation of the Dalai
Lama and the Panchen Lama must obtain the approval of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
This rule holds that the central government has sovereignty
over Tibet, and the system itself is an important historical
custom of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
However, the 14th Dalai Lama, who himself was affirmed and
approved by the central government according to the religious
rules, went his own way and declared "the Reincarnation of the
Panchen Lama" overseas, without any authorization, by colluding
secretly with certain people in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
By doing this, he ignored the religious ritual and historical
norms, actuated by his political plot of splitting the motherland
and creating the "independence of Tibet."
</P>
<P>
The act turned the grand Buddhist event into a political farce
for "independence of Tibet." This was not only an attempt to defy
the authority of the central government, but also a betrayal of
the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran has expressed interest in
strengthening its economic cooperation with Thailand, particularly

Iran's new ambassador to Thailand Ramin Mehmanparast.
</P>
<P>
Iran has proposed several projects of mutual benefits,
including the establishment of an oil refinery and petrochemical
complex in southern Thailand, Mehmanparast said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Thailand to consider Iran as an entry point to the
markets in central and west Asia.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Thailand is the third largest
trading partner with Iran after Japan and South Korea, and it
imports 70,000 barrels of oil from the gulf country each day.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parties on Campaign for Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nepal's major
political parties are busy visiting different parts of the country
to garner voters' support with the forthcoming local elections
only nearly one month away.
</P>
<P>
Leadership of the country's over 4,000 local administration
bodies at village, municipality and district levels will be
changed through the elections scheduled to begin from May 17.
</P>
<P>
Almost all parties, big or small, have already started their
local election campaigns by deploying party workers to vast rural
areas in order to maintain or increase their control over local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) party, which currently
controls most of the local bodies, Saturday declared its election
manifesto, making clear its positions on various local issues like
development, employment and people's empowerment.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party appealed to all voters to fight
"regressive and undemocratic forces," referring to the two major
ruling parties -- the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist and
Leninist, CPN-UML) and the National Democratic Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government under RPP leader Lokendra
Bahadur Chand came to power last month after an NC-led government
lost the parliament's confidence.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, the biggest party in the ruling coalition, has
become the NC's arch rival in the hung parliament since the 1994
mid-term elections, but at local levels the NC party still have an
overwhelming advantage.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary by-elections held in five constituencies
across the country early this year indicated that the CPN-UML
could gain considerable control over the local bodies through the
coming local elections, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> 15 Rebels Killed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 Muslim rebels were
killed when their camps in Zamboanga del Norte province, the
southern Philippines, were attacked by government troops during
the past two days, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Col. Glicerio Sua, commander of the Army's 101st Infantry
Brigade based in Zamboanga del Norte, was quoted as telling
reporters Saturday that troops began to shell the camps of the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the province's northern
hinterlands late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commander said gunbattles were going on and his troops had
started clearing operations in the village of Sipakti in northern
Zamboanga del Norte after capturing several camps of the MILF
there.
</P>
<P>
The military said this offensive was in retaliation for an
ambush Tuesday by the MILF rebels against a patrol of the Army in
Sirawai town in Zamboanga del Norte.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's attack, two soldiers were wounded and six MILF
rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, warned
Saturday that the scheduled third round of low level talks between
the government and the MILF would be affected by the ongoing
shelling of MILF camps by the military.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government have agreed to resume their
third-round of low level talks in Cotabato city in Maguindanao
province to discuss issues regarding cessation of hostilities
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest rebel group in
the Philippines, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which has sought to establish an Islamic state in the
southern Philippines, was not part of the peace deal forged by
Manila last September with the MNLF.

But the government and the opposition FSLN face a more

MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military has
ordered police and soldiers to resume operations against all
rebels in the country, with Saturday's expiry of the government's

</P>
<P>
The reports said Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo
Acedera and National Police Director-General Recaredo Sarmiento
Saturday issued directives to their field commanders to resume
operations immediately.

Last December, President Fidel Ramos declared a unilateral

</P>
<P>
According to the directives, operations will also be resumed
against the Communist Party with whom the government are holding
peace talks in the Netherlands.

<P>
Earlier, the military accused the Communist Party of
"duplicity" in its peace talks with the government, citing a call
from its chairman, Jose Sison, for renewed offensives by his
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence said the Communist Party and its military
wing, the New People's Army, have opened more guerrilla fronts in
southern and central Luzon to gain more bargaining power in the
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Besides the New People's Army, there are several more

its work and extend its influence over the state power and
society, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, also chairman of "Our Home is Russia", called on

<HEADLINE> China to Set Base Price for Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese customs will set minimum
prices for exported containers as from May 1, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to limit unfair prices and protect the
interests of container producers in the wake of a price cut
at domestic market as a result of inflow of foreign-funded
container makers.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of 1996, container producers have been
cutting prices, which barely cover production costs. Some
production lines have been shut down temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Meng Hui, chairman of the China Container Industry Association
(CCIA), suggested the State Planning Commission and the State
Economic and Trade Commission consider drafting a regulation that
will require foreign-funded container enterprises to apply for
central government approval, instead of from local governments.
</P>
<P>
The state should encourage container producers to merge so that
they can operate more efficiently, Meng said.
</P>
<P>
Although production capacity worldwide exceeds demand, it is
particularly serious in china, he said.
</P>
<P>
With restructuring of the world container industry since 1990,
many foreign container producers have shifted their production
lines to China.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial statistics indicate there are more than 40 dry-goods
container producers and seven refrigerated container enterprises
in China, 85 percent of which are foreign-funded. Too many
container producers have led to a price landslide in early 1996,
said CCIA secretary-general Qiu Huihui.
</P>
<P>
Despite plunging prices, production in 1996 slid 2.1 percent
and container exports went down 13.37 percent to 350,000
containers.

<HEADLINE> Russia not to Yield to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia has not made any
concessions over NATO's planned eastward expansion, the
presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhemsky said today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came amid media reports alleging President Boris
Yeltsin had made significant concessions on the issue during talks
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kohl discussed some unresolved issues between
Moscow and NATO, in particular, the military one in bilateral
relations, Yastrzhemsky told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Yeltsin's announcement during his Germany visit that he
would sign in Paris a treaty defining Russian-NATO ties on May 27,
the press secretary said the announcement showed that the
president hoped to conclude Russia's dialogue with NATO smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"The president hopes to sign a treaty defining a special
relationship (between Russia and NATO), and so does the NATO," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived Wednesday in Germany's southwest town of
Baden-Baden on a two-day visit, reiterated Russia's opposition to
NATO's expansion at a press conference Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Changes Aid Customs, Businesses in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) -- China will halt individual
tariffs on beer, crude oil, some film, videocassette recorders and
video cameras on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it will levy import duties on those items according to
how much is imported, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Videocassette recorders and video cameras will be tariffed
according to their prices if their duty values are less than 3,000
US dollars. If the values are more than 3,000 US dollars, China
will impose a three percent tariff, plus a fixed amount for each
videocassette recorder or video camera.
</P>
<P>
The decision is intended to comply with international tariff
practices and domestic tax policies, tariff officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949,
tariffs have been levied according to import prices.
</P>
<P>
However, in most countries, large-quantity imports similar in
quality and price usually are tariffed according to volume.
</P>
<P>
To standardize trade practices, it is necessary for China to
try the more popular method of levying import duties, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The new tariff method ill make it easier for Customs to
compute duties, as domestic consumption and value-added taxed are
calculated according to the amount of imported beer.
</P>
<P>
The method also will ensure tariff payments for crude oil are
in line with international duties. It also will control film
imports at low prices and reduce duty payments for imported
videocassette recorders and video cameras, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, China to Further Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and China will
further their mutually beneficial economic cooperation and the
interchange between the two government legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
The view was expressed by Marat Ospanov, speaker of the Mazhlis
(lower house of Kazakh parliament), in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua on the eve of his visit to China, scheduled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament of Kazakhstan, formally established in January
last year, is keen to learn from the experience of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress in enacting
laws and coordinating ties between the legislature and other
organs of state power, Ospanov said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the need of interchange with other countries'
parliaments, 11 permanent groups were set up in Mazhlis to study
the experience of foreign parliaments, he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the groups specializes in legislative cooperation with
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Kazakhstan-China ties, Ospanov said bilateral relations had
improved very quickly since the establishment of diplomatic ties
between the two countries on January 3, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between the two leadership and the
signing of a series of documents on cooperation had laid a solid
foundation for furthering bilateral ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Giving examples, the speaker said Chinese President Jiang Zemin
paid his first official visit to Kazakhstan last year, holding
talks with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and speakers of
the senate and Mazhlis, and making a speech at the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev met with Jiang Zemin in Beijing in February this
year and both sides stressed the need to promote bilateral
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the enhancement of economic cooperation between the
two countries, Ospanov considered China one of the best markets
for Kazakhstan's machinery products, and its chemical industry as
another attractive field for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is attracting Chinese investment in its
petrochemical works, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ospanov hoped to see contacts in more fields between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the domestic political and economic situation, the
speaker said a stable and powerful government had been set up in
Kazakhstan, which was able to safeguard the political stability,
introduce economic reforms and improve legal system.
</P>
<P>
The economy of Kazakhstan had recovered from the slump of
previous years, and production in several key economic sectors
rose in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Ospanov also showed a positive attitude
toward the idea of political and economic integration in the
Commonwealth Independent States.

45 percent. The ruling Conservatives, on the other hand, garnered
31 percent, up three.

The poll could be the first sign in NOP of the expected
narrowing of the gap between the two main parties as the election
approaches to May 1 polling day.
</P>

The poll showed voters preferred the Conservatives as the best
party to manage Britain's booming economy and keep taxes down. A

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian ruling party has won
more than half of the town and municipal councils in Eastern
Slavonia, according to preliminary results announced by the
country's election commission on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Out of 29 town and municipal councils, the Croatian Democratic
Union (HDZ) won 17, while the Serb Independent Democratic Party
(SDSS) garnered 10. The remaining two were shared by HDZ with
either SDSS or independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
A swath of fertile land on the Croatian side of the Danue
river, Eastern Slavonia was taken over in 1991 by local Serbs who
objected Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing fighting, thousands of people were killed and
many more Croats and other ethnic people fled the region in what
was one of the most tragic events of the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, an agreement was reached between the
Croatian government and the Serb authorities under which the
region would be returned to Croatia after a maximum of two years
of administration under a UN transitional government.
</P>
<P>
The elections were regarded as a crucial step towards the
reintegration of Eastern Slavonia into Croatia.

LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
has sent three teams of gunmen to Britain to try to assassinate
leading political figures in the run-up to the general election,
according to senior security officials.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times newspaper reported that M15 counter-terrorist
officers had issued detailed warnings in the past fortnight to
senior parliament members of the ruling Conservative Party, former
Northern Ireland ministers and close political associates of
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, advising them of the
imminent threat from IRA gunmen.
</P>
<P>
"Security sources say nine IRA terrorists, believed to be
gunmen and snipers, have gone missing from their homes in Northern
Ireland and the South. They say this is a classic intelligence
indication they have been sent to carry out missions on the
British mainland."
</P>
<P>
Security officials fear the IRA may be planning to extend its
strategy of causing chaos on the road and rail networks to the
murder of a prominent figure.
