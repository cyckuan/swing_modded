   NEW YORK _ After a long morning of drills in reading,
third-graders at Public School 156 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent
an hour last Friday dancing to the urgent flutter of flamenco
music. Their small hands spiraled and their sneakers thumped as a
professional dancer, Andrea Del Conte, guided them through stomps
and whirls in a classroom with mirrored walls and glossy floors.
</P>
<P>
   Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750
students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative
writing. Poems paper the school walls, parents sew costumes for
special dance performances, and teachers gamely join students in
daily artistic experiments linked to the subjects they are
studying. Flamenco, for example, ties into social studies and
language arts lessons on the history and culture of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The school has developed a comprehensive arts program in
partnership with several of New York City's nonprofit cultural
institutions whose employees have advised the teachers, helped
write the curriculum and frequently visited the classrooms to teach
students about different art forms.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have
increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and
theaters for lessons in art, music and dance. They began to do so
in the 1970s, when the city's near-bankruptcy eliminated hundreds
of arts instructors. Now, cultural institutions as large as the New
York Philharmonic and as small as neighborhood dance troupes have
become a permanent part of the city's educational landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the city is investing in arts education again, the
institutions are playing a greater role than ever, not just giving
occasional performances or tours as they once did, but helping
schools retool their curriculums to integrate art, music and dance
into every academic subject.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions are involved not just to improve arts
education, but out of self-interest: They want to cultivate future
audiences and impress potential donors at a time when improving
public education is considered an especially pressing and honorable
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall spends close to $1 million a year training
teachers to use music in the classroom, putting on concerts for
school children and sending musicians to 22 schools across the city
for seven visits per class over a school year. The Roundabout
Theater sends teaching artists to 40 classrooms in the city for 10
visits each. Those artists teach students about reading, writing,
directing and acting in plays as part of their language arts and
social studies curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Artists from Lotus Music and Dance Studios in Chelsea work
intensively with six schools across the city, including Public
School 156, teaching students about the music and dance of
different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for such programs is striking at a time when city
schools are under intense pressure to prepare students for
increasingly rigorous standardized tests. While Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on
reading and math, they have also increased the arts education
budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and
music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That investment is not enough to bring the arts into every
classroom, but in this flush economy, private foundations are
joining cultural institutions in spending money on arts education
partnerships. Most notably, the philanthropist Walter Annenberg
pledged $12 million to New York City schools in 1993 for academic
offerings in the arts in a matching-fund program that is to total
$36 million. So far, 81 schools have received grants, most of them
$75,000 a year, to develop programs with nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is not whether to teach the arts, but how to
put them at the core of everything a school does,'' said Hollis
Headrick, executive director of the Center for Arts Education,
which oversees the Annenberg partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Even with the infusion of money and the enthusiasm of cultural
institutions, progress in arts education is slow. Some institutions
report tensions with teachers who say the programs occupy too much
time. So far, only the most motivated schools are truly integrating
the arts into their curriculums, a process that requires extra work
and money and a willingness to drastically change teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   This week, educators from 40 countries are discussing how to
speed the progress at the International Conference on the Future of
Arts Education, sponsored by the New York International Festival of
the Arts, at IBM's conference site in Palisades, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need to teach the basic skills, but students today
need an education that recognizes a much wider range of
intellectual abilities and ways of communicating,'' said Ken
Robinson, co-chairman of the conference and a professor of arts
education at the University of Warwick in England.
</P>
<P>
   Most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their
expertise, ranging from a few dollars per student for a single
lecture or performance to upward of $50,000 for ongoing classroom
visits and teacher training by several teaching artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes so much extra work to start something like this,''
said Verano LaRue, the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and
Dance Studios, which Public School 156 is paying about $40,000 this
year to incorporate dance into the school's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 156 last week, the principal, Martha
Rodriguez-Torres, nodded approvingly at a teacher and an aide who
were learning steps with the young flamenco dancers, then walked
down the hall to offer encouragement to fifth graders writing poems
about things that comfort them _ part of a project on Native
Americans that uses the help of another cultural group, Teachers
and Writers Collaborative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Dennis, let the ideas flow through you!'' she told a
boy who had put down his pencil after writing one line. She clapped
loudly when another student read a poem that began, ``Oh dresser
drawer, you smell so good with your aroma of fried chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said that reading and math scores at Public
School 156, while still relatively low, have improved since the
school won an Annenberg grant two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reading scores have improved every year, and I can say
that our children now enjoy writing,'' Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the
arts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students
that they are as important an academic subject as math, reading and
science. After ebulliently whirling to the flamenco music last
week, Katherine Nevarez, a third grader, solemnly said that while
the rhythms lingered in her mind all day, dancing was not her
favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do it, it's fun,'' she said. ``But my uncle told me
that if I study math I'll get a college degree.''
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they
value math is to measure student progress with traditional
assessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by
introducing standards that outline what students should learn
through arts instruction. But Terry L. Baker, an education
consultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the
Annenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess
a student's grasp of such ``abstract, emotional and spiritual''
subjects as music and painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be
held accountable in the same way that other disciplines are,'' he
said. ``But we are still some distance from figuring out the best
way to do that.''

HORRY RETURNS FROM INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Robert Horry's unexpected detour into NBA limbo
probably will end today, but his week of rest hasn't ended concerns
over his ailing left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Horry has served the minimum five games on the injured list and
Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson indicated the veteran forward
will be activated for tonight's game at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As for that sore left knee? Still sore. But Horry, who said he
``could have played'' last week, proclaimed himself ready to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, it's really about the same,'' he said.
``If you go on a scale of what it was hurting, it was at 100, now
it's probably like 65, 70. So the pain has gone away some, but it
still hurts. I still can't bend it all the way back like I normally
can.''
</P>
<P>
   From what Horry has been told, the knee might never be the same.
Officially, the diagnosis is tendinitis. Jackson worried last week
that the injury had also become a mental burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't messing with my head,'' Horry said, ``it's just that
I wasn't able to do things that I wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects me mostly when I'm trying to hold somebody off or
when I'm trying to stop quick. I just have to slow down. That's why
I don't run as fast as I can, because I know if I do it's going to
take me a while to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the Lakers need Horry's athleticism and
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this team to be functioning at its best capabilities, I
think he's a really needed entity in our lineup,'' Jackson said.
``He gives us a mobile (power forward), a person that can run the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry's health is a concern off the court as well. He's a spare
part with a salary ($5 million) that makes him a likely candidate
to be packaged in a trade for a starting power forward.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Horry, the Lakers will have to come up with an
injury or waive someone. The likely candidate in either case is
second-year guard Sam Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Homecoming: Reunion Arena lived up to its name, as Lakers
forward A.C. Green and assistant coach Jim Cleamons returned to
Dallas for the first time since each left _ Green in a trade this
summer, Cleamons after he was fired as head coach in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Green got a warm reception, Cleamons a handful of hoots.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Despite Kobe Bryant's own glowing report on his
rehabilitation from a broken hand, Jackson isn't proclaiming an
early return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got pretty rapid healing around the joint, which we're
happy for, but for precautionary sake, we'll probably be close to
Thanksgiving'' before Bryant will play again, Jackson said.

MICROSOFT PROSECUTORS SEEK END OF OPERATING-SYSTEMS MONOPOLY AS
REMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct state of which James Doyle is attorney general
from Illinois to Wisconsin, in 7th graf. Inserts new 5th graf
defining operating system.)  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state and federal officials prosecuting the
Microsoft antitrust case now say that their goal in any settlement,
or court-imposed remedy, will be to break Microsoft's monopoly in
personal computer operating systems, or limit the power to wield
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officials and state attorneys general
have not decided how that should be done. Several proposals are on
the table, ranging from forcing Microsoft to publish the
proprietary code for Windows so other companies could design
competing systems, to breaking up the company. And in the end, the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, would be the one to approve a
settlement or select a remedy, after receiving recommendations from
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But even before a final verdict, expected in February, the
plaintiffs have been emboldened by the judge's findings on Friday
that Microsoft had used its operating-system monopoly to stifle
innovation, reduce competition and harm consumers. The officials
say their goal is to create competition in the operating-system
market _ or to put severe limits on Microsoft's ability to exercise
monopoly power with its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a position to get a rather dramatic remedy,''
Elliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, the lead
plaintiff of the 19 states in the case, said Tuesday. ``And it's an
overwhelming opinion now that it has to address their monopoly in
operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   An operating system is a sequence of programming codes that
gives a computer information about its various parts and the
auxiliary devices connected to it, like keyboards, monitors and
printers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months since the Justice Department and the states
filed suit against Microsoft, much of the discussion about the case
has involved Web browsers and Microsoft's decision to build one
into Windows. But Jackson's findings of fact made explicit what had
been implicit before: The case is really about the operating-system
monopoly and Microsoft's use of its monopoly power to promote other
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this case, we had nowhere near as specific and
clear an idea how serious and far reaching the evidence of this
abuse of their monopoly would be,'' said Richard Blumenthal,
attorney general of Connecticut. ``The case showed that Microsoft's
abuse of its power in the operating-system market is endemic to its
conduct, and any remedy has to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   James Doyle, the attorney general of Wisconsin, agreed, saying,
``Any remedy has to talk about the operating system monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-eminent among the judge's findings was Microsoft's abuse of
its monopoly power, a finding that swept some of the softer
remedies _ like forcing it to revise some of its contract
agreements with other companies _ out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge released his preliminary verdict last Friday,
Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general who heads the antitrust
division, said that any settlement or remedy would have to ``fully
and properly address'' the problems cited by Jackson, though he has
not elaborated on how to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Friday, the state attorneys general seemed to be
taking a tougher line than the Justice Department. For months they
have called for a strong remedy that would restructure Microsoft or
its products, but were not necessarily focused on the operating
system. But now they are unified in the position that the problem
is the Windows monopoly, and they say the Justice Department has
joined them in that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's findings have moved the states from rabid hawks to
mainstream,'' said Wayne Klein, head of the antitrust division in
the Utah attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who stood on the podium with Attorney General Janet
Reno and Klein during a news conference on Friday, just after the
judge's findings were published, said Tuesday: ``I don't detect any
difference or divergence of viewpoint on remedies between the
states and the federal government. We are in total unanimity on how
to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe it is
premature for anyone to be talking about regulatory steps before
the court actually issues a ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California, said that
``the rigorous analysis'' of possible remedies ``is now just
beginning in a very serious way, by academics and experts, and we
will all want to review what they have to say before we go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One academic advising the states, Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor
at the University of Iowa College of Law, said: ``In my opinion, if
the findings show significant abuse of monopoly power, then the
appropriate remedy is to break up the monopoly _ not to hobble the
company or try to regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``breaking up'' a company is not such an extreme
concept for the federal government. Quite often recently, the
government has required companies to spin off divisions to win
approval for a merger or acquisition of another company. But
splitting up Microsoft is hardly the only proposal under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he believes it is possible to compel Microsoft to
live within the law with its current structure, even though he says
he worries about the effectiveness of agreements limited to
changing the company's conduct, like Microsoft's 1995 consent
decree with the Justice Department to end an earlier antitrust
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we could devise conduct guarantees that are
more enforceable than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other attorneys general disagree, saying such guarantees
would not be effective. But among the conduct guarantees still
under discussion at state and federal levels are proposals that
would force Microsoft to charge every computer manufacturer the
same price for Windows, so the company could not impose higher
prices to punish competitors or those who do business with them.
Such a proposal would also have to include clear guidelines on what
Microsoft products and services it could build into Windows,
government officials say. But those ideas would require constant
regulatory scrutiny that many government officials oppose. The
Justice Department and the states have not said how they will come
to agreement on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government officials say four additional remedies are under
discussion, though each of them could be applied in a variety of
ways and might be combined with elements of others. Not
surprisingly Microsoft says it opposes all of them.
</P>
<P>
   One idea would be to force Microsoft to publish the secret,
proprietary source code that makes up the Windows operating system.
The goal would be to allow other developers to design competing
operating systems that are compatible with Windows and the many
thousands of software titles that are written for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when IBM was trying to sell OS/2, a
competing operating system, the company said it was stymied because
software companies were unwilling to rewrite their programs for
OS/2. And without access to the Windows source code, IBM could not
make OS/2 compatible with the existing library of programs written
for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea long favored by the states would be to force
Microsoft to auction the source code to Windows so that two or
three other companies could begin selling competing operating
systems. In that case, Hovenkamp noted, the newly competing
companies would have to set up a ``joint venture for compatibility
standards'' so that computers and software would work equally well
with each of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the officials are discussing two proposals for
breaking up the company. One would divide the company into several
equal parts; each new company would hold all of the software code
and intellectual property from all of Microsoft's products. But
after the breakup, all of the new companies would begin competing
with the others, immediately creating a competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A final alternative is that of breaking Microsoft into three
different companies. One would control the operating system; one
the applications programs, like Word and Excel, and the third would
control the Internet and related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this idea is that one company would still have
an operating system monopoly. And even if this company's business
were limited to selling operating systems, presumably it could
still bundle other products with the operating system _ the very
problem that spawned Microsoft's current problems with the
government. Monitoring that would also require continuing
government involvement, something no one in state or federal
governments want.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, should the judge find Microsoft guilty and impose a
remedy, the company will certainly appeal. But the plaintiffs _ the
state and federal governments _ also have the right to appeal,
should they be unhappy with the judge's decision.

EDITORIAL: REMEMBERING GORBACHEV'S ROLE IN BRINGING DOWN THE BERLIN
WALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall was bound to fall eventually. But that it came
down as bloodlessly as it did 10 years ago this week is largely a
tribute to one leader. Today Mikhail Gorbachev is a political
pariah in Russia and increasingly forgotten in the West. But
history will remember him generously for his crucial role in ending
the Cold War and pulling back the Iron Curtain that Stalin drew
across Europe in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Liquidating the Soviet empire was not what Gorbachev had in mind
when he came to power in 1985. He was shrewd enough to recognize
that radical changes were urgently needed to stave off economic and
political bankruptcy in Russia and its European satellites. But he
vainly imagined that the demoralized, terrorized and lawless
society created by Stalin and stifled by Leonid Brezhnev could be
reformed in an orderly, controlled way in which the government set
the pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   Once Gorbachev lifted the lid with the openness of glasnost and
the attempted economic restructuring of perestroika, change took on
a dynamic of its own. Similar energies were unleashed in the
once-captive nations of Eastern Europe as it became clear that he
would not send Soviet tanks to bail out the unpopular client
regimes that had held sway there since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As political pressures began to build in the late 1980s,
Gorbachev was left with two options. He could hurtle ahead toward
full political and economic freedom. Or he could reverse course and
crack down, as so many previous Soviet leaders had done. He chose
to do neither. He was too much a creature of his Soviet Communist
upbringing to subject his own power to the test of electoral
democracy. But he was too enlightened to unleash the kind of
thorough repression that might have preserved the Soviet empire for
a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Others stepped in to accelerate the transformations Gorbachev
had begun, and in 1989 the fixtures of the Soviet empire began to
crumble. Free elections in Poland brought the once-banned
Solidarity union to a share of government power. Hungary opened its
borders to the West, and Eastern Europeans streamed through. In
November, with East Germans demonstrating in several cities, the
Berlin Wall was breached. Before the year ended, Czechoslovakia had
had its peaceful Velvet Revolution, and violent clashes had toppled
Romania's Communist tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Gorbachev and his like-minded foreign minister,
Eduard Shevardnadze, stayed their hand, reflecting not only their
idealism about reshaping East-West relations but also a pragmatic
calculation that the Soviet Union could no longer afford an empire.
For permitting its dissolution, Gorbachev paid a high price. Within
two years he had been pushed from power in Moscow. The first blow
came from a failed military coup that aimed to undo his changes.
The second and decisive shove came from Boris Yeltsin, a more
radical though less scrupulous reformer, bold enough to do what
Gorbachev would not.
</P>
<P>
   History has passed Gorbachev by. But this week, especially, he
deserves to be remembered for what he did and, perhaps more
important, what he refused to do. With a wisdom and decency that is
sadly rare in international power politics, he chose not to defend
a dying system with a final, futile spasm of murderous force.

EDITORIAL: SEN. BYRD'S ENVIRONMENTAL SNEAK ATTACK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 10:
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when members of Congress scramble to
promote pet projects even if it means delaying adjournment. One new
roadblock standing in the way of completing the federal budget is a
last-minute effort by Sen. Robert Byrd to attach a rider to one of
the final spending bills that would favor strip mining in his home
state of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has vowed to veto anti-environmental
measures pushed by Republicans, has merely frowned on the Byrd
rider. President Clinton should make clear that the administration
does not have two standards, one for Republicans and one for
powerful Democrats like Byrd, and that it will veto any bill to
which the Byrd measure is attached.
</P>
<P>
   The Byrd amendment would in effect overturn a decision by a
federal judge in West Virginia that found that the state's mining
companies, with the complicity of the federal government, had for
years violated federal clean water and surface mining laws by
dumping rock waste into valleys and streams. The judge, Charles H.
Haden II, stayed the decision pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling would not shut down existing mining operations. But
it could hamper them in the future by greatly limiting the areas
where the companies can dump waste. The Byrd amendment would allow
the dumping to proceed. The White House says that such an amendment
is unnecessary while the judge's decision is being appealed. But
that is less than a clear threat to veto the bill. Some
environmentalists fear that Clinton is trying to placate Byrd, a
party ally who stood by him during the impeachment battle. Byrd is
also the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other important budget disagreements remain. The administration
is right to hold firm on its demand for money to help states hire
teachers and police officers. Yet another stumbling block to
adjournment is a Republican effort to hold the payment of back U.N.
dues hostage to an agreement by the administration to withdraw
support for aid to family planning groups abroad that lobby for
changes in their countries' abortion laws. The White House should
stand firm. But at the moment, its top priority is to make it clear
that it will resist further encroachment on the nation's
environmental laws.

DREIFORT'S AGENT HAS A REQUEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ A day after shaking up baseball with their
annual offseason blockbuster, the Dodgers tried to keep their focus
on other possible outside moves but found their attention drawn
inward.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said Tuesday he was meeting
with every club to discuss possible matchups for potential trades
to bolster the bullpen and bench.
</P>
<P>
   But one day after trading Raul Mondesi to the Blue Jays for
Shawn Green, Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort's future with the
club came to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was shut down with a fatigued shoulder in mid-September
after going 13-13 with a 4.79 ERA in his second year as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson suggested the
hard-throwing Dreifort _ who had Tommy John elbow surgery in 1995 _
might better serve the club as a reliever, a role Dreifort
disdains. Tuesday, at the general managers' meetings, agent Scott
Boras pulled Johnson aside in a hotel hallway to make clear that
Dreifort wanted to be a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort can become a free agent after next season, but Boras
said he wasn't trying to use his future with the team as leverage
to pressure the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to dictate what clubs do,'' Boras said. ``You
just don't want a talent like Darren on your team and not
fulfilling the role that he wants. He's too gifted. And I think
he's too important to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And certainly Darren's position is that if he isn't going to
start for the Dodgers, he'd want to start somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Malone: ``We're going to do what is best for the Los
Angeles Dodgers. We'll figure that out. As of right now, Darren
Dreifort is a starter. But we have to explore all options. The
great thing about Darren is he can do both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren wants to start at this time. But I have to talk to the
manager. He might be more valuable as a reliever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already were looking to bolster their bullpen, and
then included reliever Pedro Borbon in Monday's deal with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   If Dreifort did join the bullpen, disappointing left-hander
Carlos Perez (3-3, 5.92 ERA before sent to the minors) would likely
have to join a rotation of Kevin Brown, Ismael Valdes, Chan Ho Park
and Eric Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short hops:The Angels, the only team in baseball without a
manager, continued interviewing their list of seven candidates.
Tuesday, GM Bill Stoneman interviewed ex-Dodger Mike Scioscia and
interim Angels manager Joe Maddon. . . . Malone said it was
unlikely the Dodgers will make any additional moves before the
meetings end Thursday. . . . Green might get company: Blue Jays GM
Gord Ash said first baseman Carlos Delgado took his offer for an
extension off the table. . . . Braves GM John Schuerholz said the
Braves won't likely be able to participate in the Ken Griffey Jr.
derby.

STUDENTS CHARGED IN A BRAWL THAT DIVIDES DECATUR, ILL.

lawsuit and to correct information re arrests and charges. Also

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It started as a melee among high school students in
the bleachers at a football game in the small Illinois city of
Decatur. But it has grown into a bitter debate over race and rules,
drawing in the likes of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. George
Ryan. And it has closed high schools for two consecutive days and
resulted in charges against some of the students.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the disagreement is whether school officials were
justified in handing down two-year expulsions to seven students,
all of them black, who were involved in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   The students rejected an offer by the school board early Tuesday
to reduce the expulsions to one year, with an option to attend an
alternative school for troubled students immediately. Their lawyer
filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against the school district,
charging that its zero-tolerance policy against violence was
arbitrary and unreasonable. Six of the students were arrested but
not charged after the fracas. Four were charged Tuesday with
criminal behavior, and two now have cases pending in juvenile
court.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called the arrests another ``attack on the students,''
saying the students were already being punished too harshly by the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Arndt, the Decatur school superintendent, has made it
clear that the local authorities resent Jackson's interference.
Arndt ordered the city's three public high schools _ MacArthur,
Eisenhower and Decatur _ closed on Monday when Jackson planned a
protest march. The superintendent said he feared that the march
would result in a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rev. Jackson has done a lot of wonderful things for our
country, but I think he's really picked the wrong case here,''
Arndt said. ``This is not Selma.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Decatur, a city of about 83,000 people in central
Illinois, have an enrollment that is about 35 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Around this blue-collar city, views about the standoff were
divided largely along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   Cleopatra Sibley, who is black, described Decatur as a ``very
prejudiced town'' that needed someone like Jackson to bring
unfairness to light. If the students involved in the fight had been
white, she said, ``nothing would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Mehr, 17, a white student, said it was ridiculous to make
the incident a racial matter. ``No matter what color you are, you
can't get in a fight in the middle of a crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say the students involved in the fighting were
known as truants. Arndt described three of them as ``third-year
freshmen,'' and said the seven students, among them, had missed 350
days of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If education were such a high priority for these students,''
Arndt said, ``why wouldn't they have gone to school?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who led a rally at a church here on Monday night, said
the punishment was disproportionate for an incident that involved
no serious injuries. ``A fistfight is different from a knife fight
is different from a gunfight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called for the schools to allow the students to return
and submit to counseling, and said it was the obligation of
education officials to try to save troubled young men from going
further astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do these 17-year-old youths go when they're left out of
school uncounseled?'' he said. ``They can't graduate, they can't go
to college, they can't get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Arndt said the school board would stick by its offer to allow
the students to return immediately to an alternative school.
``Hopefully, they'll avail themselves of that opportunity,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the governor, had waived certain education requirements so
that the expelled students could attend an alternative school. A
spokesman for the governor, Dennis Culloton, said Ryan had left
Decatur after getting both sides together, saying there was little
more that he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the students involved in the fight, which occurred on
Sept. 17, were charged as adults with mob action, a felony, said
Lt. James Anderson of the Decatur police. One was also charged with
battery and resisting a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the incident, taken by a parent at the football
game, was presented to reporters Tuesday by school officials.
</P>
<P>
   It showed a melee that swept through one end of the grandstands,
with kicking and punching, as some of the fighters tumbled over the
rails. A woman is shown trying to shield two young children from
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped, as players stood and gawked at the
fighting in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Bohem, the principal at MacArthur High School who attended
the game, described it as a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feared for the safety of our people _ my parents, my
students,'' he said, referring to the crowd in the bleachers. ``You
had people pushed through bars, people covering little children so
they wouldn't get hurt. It was violent.''

A SYMBOL OF A CITY'S TRUE WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The reopening of a Union Station restored to
its erstwhile grandeur brings to mind the social and economic
vitality of Kansas City that many locals overlook in their
unceasing worry about the area's future.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's doubtful Union Station will in and of itself add
much to the gross regional product, this huge community project
will bring priceless benefits that can't be measured in dollars and
cents. Most important, it has been a community project in the best
sense of the ideal, transcending political boundaries that often
are barriers to local progress.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, the cost of Union Station's restoration is being
shared by rich benefactors and average citizen-taxpayers alike.
Thus, when these contributors visit Union Station to marvel at what
they have been part of, it can't help but be a source of pride to
feed a continuing can-do community spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Even those with qualms about whether this was the best use of
economic resources cannot deny the symbolism of the station's
revival. After many years of struggle, the station's champions
prevailed against daunting odds to see their dream become a
reality. This is worth pondering, especially by those who tend to
take the dim view of Kansas City's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Citians are notable for not giving themselves enough
credit. It's always as though the community's accomplishments are
never enough. Even now, for example, as the dream of Union Station
is being realized, the luster of this grand moment is being
somewhat dimmed by the uncertain fate of the city's baseball team
and fears of what Sprint's takeover by a rival portends for the
area economy.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in these instances, however, should be as much
a source of pride as Union Station's triumphal rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Royals, the temptation is to lament the fact
that no hometown business or civic leader has emerged to guarantee
the Royals' continued presence here. This perspective, though,
ignores the gratifying fact that those who have emerged as the best
bets to save the Royals for Kansas City are from someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the community should feel blessed to have
attracted outsiders whose regard for Kansas City has motivated them
to take a leadership role in preserving an asset that gives this
town big-league status.
</P>
<P>
   The community also should feel blessed to have been home to
business leaders competitive enough to transform a relatively
small, unknown telephone company into a national telecom giant.
Granted, Sprint's emergence as an acquisition target by a bigger
fish isn't the optimum outcome for local interests. The other way
around would have been more promising. Nevertheless, Sprint's
economic dynamism will remain a critical component of area
prosperity for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Some two decades of observing the local scene have led to the
conclusion that Kansas Citians don't have nearly enough
appreciation for what they've done and what they're capable of
doing. Perhaps the most important aspect of Union Station's rebirth
could be as a source of renewed local pride and self-confidence
that will translate into newfound belief in Kansas City's ability
to do more great things.

ARMY SAYS STRAINED RESOURCES LEAVE TROOPS UNPREPARED FOR WAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army has described two of its 10 divisions as
ill prepared for war because of shortages of troops, equipment or
training in a report that may set the stage for a political battle
over whether the service should get more money.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strains caused by sending peacekeeping troops to
Bosnia and Kosovo, the 10th Mountain Division, based at Fort Drum,
N.Y., and the 1st Infantry Division in Germany were recently given
ratings of C-4, the lowest of four possible readiness grades.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who heads the
Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
expressed alarm over the situation in a statement issued on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Clinton administration of allowing military
readiness to deteriorate, Inhofe said, ``Unfortunately, today we
have a 10-division Army performing the workload of 14 divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator expressed dismay that no Army division was rated
C-1, the most combat-ready designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time the Army was facing a readiness crisis of this
magnitude was in the late 1970s, when the defense budget was
drastically slashed without any consideration of the impact that
this would have on our armed forces,'' Inhofe said.
</P>
<P>
   The C-4 grading of two divisions marks the first time in at
least seven years that any of the Army's divisions has received the
lowest grade, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday. The grade
means the two divisions are not considered ready for a major
regional war until their deficiencies are corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, a congressional staff aide familiar with the
report noted that the readiness ratings might have been affected by
congressional directives to place greater stress on the ability of
the military to wage two major wars at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that some Pentagon officials viewed the Army's
low self-grading as a way of lobbying for more money. Another
factor that must be considered in any attempt to assess the
military's readiness for battle objectively is the fact that the
military has shrunk by more than a third since the end of the Cold
War and has been forced to rethink what wars it may have to fight,
and how.

YELLOW CORP.'S CHAIRMAN LEAVES TO BECOME CEO OF WASTE MANAGEMENT
INC. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ A. Maurice Myers, who helped turn around
Yellow Corp., has left to become chief executive officer of
troubled Waste Management Inc., the country's largest trash
company.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who was Yellow's chairman, was replaced immediately by
William D. Zollars, president of Yellow Freight System Inc., by far
the largest subsidiary of the $2.9 billion Overland Park
transportation company.
</P>
<P>
   Zollars joined Yellow in 1996 after being recruited by Myers,
who also joined Yellow that year. Myers, 59, came to Yellow from
America West Airlines Inc., where he was president and helped lead
the carrier's turnaround after it emerged from a three-year Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceeding in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow's board of directors learned late last week that Myers
was leaving and met over the weekend to appoint Zollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this came up rather suddenly, we've always had a
very strong succession planning process here, so it was fairly
straightforward,'' Zollars said.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Yellow, Zollars spent three years with Ryder
Integrated Logistics at Ryder Systems Inc. Earlier he had spent 24
years with Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My background is really kind of eclectic,'' Zollars said. ``I
was in strategic planning and finance, marketing, general
management and logistics, so it's quite a varied background.''
</P>
<P>
   Zollars, 52, views Yellow as a company that has reinvented
itself over the past three years after the trucking industry was
deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent the last three years broadening Yellow's
capabilities and getting the company to be more market-driven and
customer-focused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Carole Neely was impressed with
Yellow's seamless transition and choice of Zollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, when I first heard about Mr. Myers
leaving, I was saying the stock is maybe slightly vulnerable, and
then I saw the immediate appointment of Mr. Zollars and I was
relieved,'' Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't settle. I don't view this as just a temporary
Band-Aid. I think Mr. Zollars is just a really excellent choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely noted investor reaction in Tuesday's volatile market.
Yellow closed at 16 7/8, up 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Zollars said Yellow would look at internal and external
candidates for a new Yellow Freight president. Meantime, he will
fill both roles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Waste Management wooed away Sprint Corp.'s No. 2
executive, Ronald T. LeMay, but he returned to his Sprint position
three months later.

PENALTY KILLING PLAY HELPS DEVILS DEFEAT FLYERS 2-1  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils can thank their penalty
killers, especially Scott Stevens, Scott Niedermayer and Ken
Daneyko, while the Flyers can blame their power-play units, which
entered the game between the division rivals ranked first in the
league in efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   With Stevens, Niedermayer and Daneyko leading the way, the
Devils proved why they are ranked first in the league killing
penalties. They denied the Flyers on five power plays, two of them
with two-man advantages, and skated away with a 2-1 victory at
Continental Arena Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Devils said his team's
penalty &UR;  &LR; killing ``was a real key to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Scotty and Dano did a great job,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and Daneyko made the Flyers look particularly inept
during their first two-man advantage, which lasted two minutes and
started in the 13th minute of the game. The two Devils were on the
ice for all but the last seven seconds of Philadelphia's edge and
were cheered loudly when they came to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juices were flowing,'' Daneyko said. ``Having Nieder up
front brings an element with his speed.'' Niedermayer played
forward during the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup was a chance for Randy McKay of the Devils to get
revenge against the Flyers; he was making his return after a
three-game league suspension for tripping Flyer defenseman Ulf
Samuelsson so he would fall backwards. McKay said Samuelsson tried
to injure him earlier in that game on Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   McKay got even in the best way possible. He scored the first
goal to put the Devils on the path to victory before a crowd of
14,519. Jason Arnott scored the winner to help the Devils improve
to 8-5-2 and drop the Flyers, who got their goal from John LeClair,
to 8-7-2.
</P>
<P>
   McKay, a tenacious right wing, made up for lost time by opening
the scoring. His goal was typical of the his style: pure
determination in driving to the net. This time he followed up on a
shot by Claude Lemieux and beat John Vanbiesbrouck over the glove
for his fourth of the season with 8:56 left in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair tied it for the Flyers with his 10th of the season, at
6:01 of the second period, when he converted Mikael Renberg's pass
from the left during a two-on-one breakaway that came about when
Brad Bombardir, a defenseman for the Devils, slipped and fell on
his blue line.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils scored the game-winner on Arnott's second goal of the
season and first in more than a month. It came with 4:28 left in
the second, the puck sailing between Vanbiesbrouck's pads. Arnott's
expression showed surprise that the shot went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big victory for us,'' Arnott said. ``I thought we
played the best defensive game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils made very few mistakes defensively, keeping the
Flyers away from Martin Brodeur, who faced only 16 shots, and
denying second chances.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams are tied atop the Atlantic Division with 19
points, but the Devils have two games in hand on the Flyers, who
suffered their first loss in their last six games. They had started
the season without a victory in their first six games.

 Sprint chairman reassures business leaders about pending merger  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Corp. Chairman William T. Esrey
reassured Kansas City business leaders Tuesday that the pending
$129 billion merger with MCI WorldCom Inc. would not reduce his
company's commitment to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City will be a more vibrant town and the new WorldCom
will be a bigger part of this town than Sprint would be going
forward,'' Esrey said in a speech at the annual meeting of the
Kansas City Area Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks are Esrey's first public comments to the Kansas City
business community since last month's blockbuster merger proposal,
which would combine Sprint with MCI WorldCom in the biggest deal in
U.S. corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would combine the second- and third-largest
long-distance phone companies in the country, and the headquarters
would be in Clinton, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said WorldCom would have workers spread across the
country, with a large number of them based in the Kansas City area,
where Sprint has more than 18,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is going to be the largest center of operations
for WorldCom,'' Esrey said. ``The chairman of the company is going
to be here. The chief operating officer of the company is going to
be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey, who would be chairman of the merged company, said
WorldCom intended to grow so fast that the pace would be like
creating a company half the size of Sprint every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is not that we have too many people but that we do
not have enough talented people'' to fill new positions, Esrey said
at a news conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he has allayed some of the fears and concerns of
the business community,'' said Robert Marcusse, president of the
Kansas City Area Development Council. ``I think he made a pretty
bold statement about the continued pre-eminence of the Kansas City
area to WorldCom.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the merged company would have employees with
overlapping job responsibilities, the growth of the company should
cushion any job losses caused by the merger, Esrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proposed merger, there are no plans to halt
construction at Sprint's 3.9 million-square-foot office campus in
Overland Park, Kan. Esrey said construction would continue because
Sprint had already projected filling the space in the office park.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger has caused uncertainty among rank-and-file
employees worried about the security of their jobs, and the
combination has already induced regulators and elected officials to
review the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard has
said the merger deserves a close inspection by federal overseers.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said the merger would withstand the scrutiny of federal
antitrust and telecommunications regulators because the consumer
long-distance market would not be too concentrated as a result of
the combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are comfortable that the facts will be overwhelmingly
convincing,'' Esrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said Sprint and MCI WorldCom officials could establish
transition teams as soon as the first quarter of 2000 if the
Department of Justice signals its acceptance of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Sprint's Global One alliance with France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom, Esrey said the previously stated goal of
resolving the ownership issues by the end of the year was
optimistic.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL TO ADD EMPLOYEES TO MARKET HIGH-TECH SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Southwestern Bell is adding about 100
employees in Kansas City to market the communication company's
newest high-tech services.
</P>
<P>
   Regional President Bill Bailey said Tuesday that the call center
customer service representatives _ some in training already _ would
handle inquiries and orders from four states about Bell's
high-speed Internet access service and Simple Solutions, a bundled
billing service that rolled out last month in 12 Southwestern Bell
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the new workers in Kansas City would meet ``the
changing needs of more tech-savvy and convenience-minded
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, on hand for the announcement along
with other business and civic leaders, praised Bell's century of
doing business in Kansas City and said, ``Today's employment boost
fortifies this global company's solid local roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes called the new jobs ``another bit of good news'' for
Kansas City, which among other things this fall is seeing the
rebirth of Union Station as a science center.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs add to Bell's local payroll of 4,600 workers, as well
as the inventory of about 40,000 people estimated to be employed in
Kansas City's flourishing call center industry.
</P>
<P>
   As testament to that, the Professional Teleservice Management
Association of Greater Kansas City was founded in March by
executives of nearly 100 call centers based in the area.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, call center officials told The Kansas City Star
that nonunion wages started around $9 an hour, with experienced
call center workers making nearly twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't entry-level people,'' Bailey said Tuesday of the
new jobs at Bell. ``They will be marketing some of our most
advanced services.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will be housed at Bell's offices and existing call
center at 101st Terrace and Holmes Road. The center will handle
incoming calls from Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's Internet service allows customers to surf the Net while
talking on the same telephone line. Simple Solutions bundles all
Bell services into package deals, starting at $39.95 per month.
Those packages include various telephone services such as call
waiting, Internet access and DirecTV connections.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 call center workers are in training, and Bell is
looking to hire more.
</P>
<P>

275-3379.

</P>
<P>
   Why did the Soviet Union reconcile itself to ``peaceful
revolution'' in the nations of central and eastern Europe? Why did
we not do everything in our power to keep hold on East Germany?
Should we have fought to keep it in our sphere of influence?
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union understood the abnormality of having the German
nation divided in two. In fact, more than once in the past, Soviet
leaders had submitted proposals for consideration by its Western
partners that would provide for the unification of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the West rejected these, considering them to be mere
propaganda, or trickery, on our part. To a certain extent, the
proposals did have a propagandistic, or self-promotional, purpose.
But our Western partners never once tried to take Moscow at its
word.
</P>
<P>
   During my tenure, in the first years of perestroika, the
question of German reunification did not arise as a specific
problem. East Germany was a place where the people lived better in
material terms than the population of other ``socialist'' countries
of central and eastern Europe. In terms of political freedom,
however, the situation was bad.
</P>
<P>
   As we got under way with perestroika _ the movement that was to
bring freedom to our own people _ the Soviet leadership could not
apply different criteria to the other countries in our domain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the process of democratization in the Soviet Union made
the East German citizens' unhappiness with their own repressive
regime increasingly manifest.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean that there were any kind of hints of pressure from
us. When changes began in eastern Europe, the expression of the
people's will was recognized as legitimate and as the expression of
the freedom of any people to choose their own path of development.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leadership made its own domestic plans and actions
known during visits to the Warsaw Pact countries. But the Soviet
leadership nonetheless did not wish to export its own aims and
intentions, its own experience.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the truth is that interference in the internal affairs
of our neighbors was ended. No longer was advice given from Moscow,
let alone orders or commands.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, sometimes certain politicians even took offense at
this _ especially those who wanted Moscow to push in a certain
direction. But Moscow remained true to its position.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the leaders in Bonn would make a point of commenting
on the division of their country. Our attitude was that the
division of Germany was a product of history and that history would
take care of it some day. Without categorically denying the
possibility of reunification, the Soviet side suggested that time
be allowed to solve the problem. This same idea was repeated during
my visit to Bonn in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, however, events began to develop at a rapid
pace. There were outbreaks of discontent and mass demonstrations.
Support for the East German regime was rapidly collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The East German citizens fled the country en masse, even at the
risk of death. There was an exodus to West Germany _ at first
through Hungary and later Czechoslovakia. Some people left the
country by any means available, even crossing the Berlin Wall,
which separated West Berlin from East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the East German citizens understood that the Soviet
Union would not use force to prevent the unification of their
country. This was a signal to them that their will to have unity
could be realized.
</P>
<P>
   From our standpoint, any effort to try forcibly to preserve this
system would have only vastly weakened the Soviet position and
discredited us in the eyes of the Germans, our people and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In early November 1989, Moscow still hoped that the East German
leadership would be able to cope with the situation, preserving
East Germany as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But events developed in a much more precipitous way. A process
began in which the government structures of East Germany began to
fall apart. The pressure grew, resulting in the resignation of the
old leadership under Erich Honecker, the opening of the Brandenburg
Gate and, on Nov. 9, the fall of the Berlin Wall _ that symbol not
only of the division of Germany but of all Europe into East and
West.
</P>
<P>
   I can say now that Moscow conducted itself optimally in these
circumstances. It ruled out the use of force, including the use of
Soviet troops deployed on East German territory.
</P>
<P>
   It did everything possible to allow the process to develop along
peaceful lines, without violating the vital interests of the Soviet
Union or those of East or West Germany, and without undermining
peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that we lost our allies in eastern Europe,
that we surrendered these countries too easily and without
compensation. This is folly. After all, to whom did we surrender
them? To their own people.
</P>
<P>
   Any use of force to oppose the will of the German people for
unification would have been fraught with the risk of war, perhaps
world war. How was the Soviet Union to ``save'' this regime? By
revving up the tank motors?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was a heavy concentration of armed forces
stationed in Germany. This nation was important to both the East
and West. And its system could be ``saved'' in only one way _ by
once again sending in the tanks, as we did in Czechoslovakia in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such action _ such unjustified action _
could have included a general European war. And for what? Was it
not so that the nations of eastern Europe, amid a free expression
of the will of the people, chose their own path of development
based on their own national needs?
</P>
<P>
   The system that existed in eastern and central Europe, as well
as in our country, was condemned by history; it had long since
outlived itself. It was a burden on the people.
</P>
<P>
   And so we allowed reunification to proceed calmly, without
complications or disruption of European stability.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty on the final normalization of relations with Germany
was signed in Moscow on Sept. 12, 1990, and on Oct. 3 German
unification became a fact.
</P>

its collapse in 1991 and Nobel Peace Prize winner, now heads the

SLAYING SUSPECT MAY TURN TO INSANITY DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Defense lawyers on Tuesday opened the door to
a possible insanity defense for Keith D. Nelson, the man accused of
killing 10-year-old Pamela Butler and dumping her body near a Grain
Valley church last month.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing, Assistant Federal Public Defender Larry Pace asked
U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Hays for more time to study such a
defense before ruling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time I don't believe the defense team has enough
information to make a decision,'' Pace replied, when asked if he
planned to base his defense on his client's competence.
</P>
<P>
   Hays granted his request for more time.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Nelson pleaded not guilty to charges that he
kidnapped Pamela from her Kansas City, Kan., home, then sexually
abused and killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno for
permission to seek the death penalty against Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Still using a wheelchair because of a leg injury, Nelson smiled
at his four lawyers as he was wheeled into the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   That angered Pamela's mother, Cherri West, who sat with family
members in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the smile on his face,'' West said afterward.
``As a mom, I wanted to jump up and grab him.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wasn't impressed with his plea of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep that under my skin,'' she said. ``I wanted to smack
him. He acts like he just doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Little new about the case emerged during the hearing. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Sheryle Jeans disclosed that prosecutors have a
videotape of Pamela taken before the abduction as she shopped at a
nearby convenience store. Motions to compel Nelson to produce hair
and blood samples for DNA testing remain pending.
</P>
<P>
   West said prosecutors have not shared any new evidence with her
and said she hopes the case moves to trial swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to linger out,'' West said. ``I don't want
this to become the O.J. (Simpson) trial.''

HACKETT WON'T SHIFT BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although he acknowledged that he has come under
criticism, USC coach Paul Hackett said it was important to look at
the long-term situation when assessing his performance the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen overnight,'' Hackett said. ``I told
(athletic director) Mike Garrett when he and I first talked that,
first, I wanted to finish what I was doing (as an assistant) in
Kansas City, and second, I wanted a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't just pull that out. I know that after the four-year
mark, you're able to say here's where we're headed. We've basically
been a .500 team, except for the Keyshawn (Johnson) year, for a
long time. It's going to take a few years. It's not going to happen
in two.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he is willing to take responsibility for USC's
current five-game losing streak and 3-6 record, but it takes more
than two years to rebuild a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept the fact we are not where we want to be. But I do not
accept (critics saying) that we are not laying the foundation,''
Hackett said. ``In football generally, it is dangerous to make a
judgment too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Palmer cleared to throw: Quarterback Carson Palmer was
cleared by doctors to begin throwing today, although USC's medical
staff might not allow him to until he has done some upper-body
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on Palmer's broken collarbone revealed he is healing on
schedule, although it appears ambitious that he would be able to
play against UCLA on Nov. 20, despite his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have no idea. It's coach Hackett's decision,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hackett: ``When you look at it realistically, we're going
to run out of time. It's probably not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he tried to throw a ball last week but experienced
too much pain and immediately stopped.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was unsure how it would feel to begin throwing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling,'' Palmer said. ``After not using my
shoulder for six weeks, I'll do whatever's tolerable. Nothing more
than 10 yards to get my range of motion back.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said if he can't return for the UCLA game, there was no
reason to return and burn his redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lawsuit update: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled
a trial must take place over USC's right to sue former radio
broadcasters Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   USC's motion for a summary judgment was denied, meaning a trial
will take place in January. Judge Richard C. Hubbell already ruled
that a company owned by Kahn and Lamb owed USC at least $720,000
for breach of contract under the terms of a three-year radio
contract that expired last year.

STATE DISCIPLINES WORKERS ON CASE OF BOYS' DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At least three Missouri Division of Family
Services employees have been suspended for 20 days without pay for
failing to properly handle the child abuse and neglect suspected in
the deaths of Larry and Gary Bass.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old Kansas City brothers, two of a set of triplets,
died three weeks ago from infected burns and starvation.
Prosecutors charged the boys' mother, Mary Bass, 31, with child
abuse and two counts of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Social Services officials, who announced the
disciplinary action Tuesday, also ordered further training for
employees and a review of department procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Family Services had contact with the Bass family
for years, according to teachers who called the child-abuse hot
line as early as 1995 to report bruises and other problems. What
action the division took after those hot-line calls remains
confidential under state law.
</P>
<P>
   However, the suspensions are related only to what happened after
Family Services received a final hot-line call about the Bass boys
this fall. Not only did the person who took that call make
mistakes, but so did other workers up the line, an internal
investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staff failed to properly review prior reports and base their
decisions on a growing pattern of abuse and neglect,'' said Denise
Cross, director of the division.
</P>
<P>
   Cross declined to elaborate on the mistakes. She previously has
said that a caseworker who talked to Mary Bass this fall apparently
did not meet with the abused boys. Under department procedures,
abuse and neglect investigators are to interview the children, and
they should interview them without the alleged abuser being in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-line worker no longer is employed by the division. Cross
suspended one caseworker and that person's supervisors. Citing
personnel reasons, officials declined to say how many supervisors
were suspended, but confirmed the number was more than one. All the
suspended employees work in Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-day suspensions were the maximum allowed without
triggering an appeals process, said Gary Stangler, director of the
Missouri Department of Social Services. Family Services is one of
the department's divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Stangler, department director for 10 years, could not recall
previously suspending child-abuse staff for failing to properly do
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary action is a good first step toward correcting
what went wrong, said state Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City
Democrat who last week called for Gov. Mel Carnahan to investigate
Family Services' handling of the Bass case. Wiggins spoke to
Stangler Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised me action,'' Wiggins said. ``He certainly came
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation should continue, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Mary Bass told police that for discipline, she
locked the boys in a bedroom for up to two weeks at a time, fed
them only bread and water and allowed them out only for restroom
breaks. Larry weighed only 30 pounds when he died at their
Northeast area home. Gary died two days later in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys also had infected burns on their feet from being
dipped in scalding water.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson County medical examiner's office ruled both deaths
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bass' boyfriend, Tony Dixon, 36, also faces six counts of
various types of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The system failed the Bass brothers because workers did not
follow department procedures, Stangler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot emphasize enough how badly the system served these
kids,'' he said. ``There is no worse day for us, personally and
professionally, than the day a child dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stangler said the Division of Family Services would take several
steps to avoid future tragedies:
</P>
<P>
   Require all child-abuse staff in Jackson County to attend
training sessions in the next two weeks. That training will
reinforce division procedures, including the need to review prior
reports, interview all alleged victims, contact relatives and other
individuals regarding reports and give timely feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Give hot-line workers additional training, which will emphasize
that all critical information be collected consistently and passed
correctly to local Family Services offices.
</P>
<P>
   Send Jackson County staff to a new training program provided by
Children's Mercy Hospital. That training will focus on indicators
of abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Hire a specialist from the National Resource Center on Child
Maltreatment to review the state's training. Family Services wants
to make sure employees are learning necessary skills and
competently can fulfill their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Build a stronger relationship to deal with abuse and neglect
cases with the Kansas City School District and Superintendent
Benjamin Demps Jr., a former social-service director in Oklahoma.
Demps said Tuesday that he welcomes the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The school district is conducting its own investigation into how
its staff handled the Bass case. A spokesman did not know when that
investigation would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Gary Bass enrolled with their triplet brother, Jerry,
to attend third grade at Swinney Elementary School this year.
Jerry, who now is in foster care along with two older siblings, did
attend classes. The district is declining to say whether the other
triplets attended at all this year.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when enrolled children miss a great deal of school,
the school will report the problem to Family Services. Child-abuse
workers then investigate the family for educational neglect.
</P>
<P>
   All the Bass case records, including actions taken as a result
of prior hot-line calls, are confidential under state law _ a law
some child advocates want changed next legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   A state child-abuse review panel has recommended that case
records become public when a child dies. The Jackson County
prosecutor's office also supports a law change that would give
Stangler discretion to open records in cases where children have
died. Wiggins said Tuesday that he would be willing to sponsor the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Stangler agrees that in some cases, records need to be opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bitterly criticized for hiding behind
confidentiality,'' he said. ``We would rather be able to share
information and take away that vacuum that gets filled by
misinformation.''

MISSOURI GOVERNOR ACCUSED OF EMBELLISHING MILITARY RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A former Republican leader in the Missouri House has
accused Democrat Mel Carnahan of embellishing his military record
for ``apparent political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Brockfeld, a commander of a VFW post in Warrenton, Mo.,
said the governor's official biography states that he served in the
Air Force ``during the Korean war.'' In fact, Carnahan began his
two-year service as a second lieutenant in 1954, more than a year
after the armistice that ended the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Carnahan, who is engaged in a heated Senate race
against Republican John Ashcroft, denied any impropriety and
pointed to U.S. statutes and the Department of Veterans Affairs
documents that say the conflict was not officially over until early
1955.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Farinella, Carnahan's campaign manager, suggested that
Ashcroft's own military record was more newsworthy. That record
shows that the incumbent senator received a series of seven
deferments between 1963 and 1969 and avoided military service in
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Ashcroft absolutely would have served in the armed
forces had he been called,'' said Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton.
``His draft status was a common status for that period.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish over military background is the latest in a contest
that has drawn national attention for its tone. Most recently,
accusations of racism arose after Ashcroft helped scuttle the
appointment of Ronnie White, the first black member of the Missouri
Supreme Court, to a seat on the federal bench. Shortly afterward,
newspaper photos that depicted Carnahan performing in blackface at
a 1960 minstrel show circulated around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The military-record issue stems from Carnahan's biography in the
1997-98 official state manual known as the Blue Book. The one-page
backgrounder says that, following college graduation, the governor
joined the Air Force, ``serving as an agent for the Office of
Special Investigation during the Korean War.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who had joined ROTC at George Washington
University, entered active duty in October 1954, well after the
Korean armistice was signed on July 27, 1953. He was stationed in
the United States and never entered Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The government considers the Korean War's duration to be from
June 27, 1950, to Jan. 31, 1955. Military experts say tensions
remained high along the North Korea-South Korea border for years
following the signing of the armistice and that America kept its
troops in place through early 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing a semantic game here regarding the phrase
`during the Korean war,''' Farinella said. ``He never suggested to
anyone that he fought in Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Brockfeld, a former House minority leader who served in the
General Assembly for 20 years until 1993, remained unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed that the governor...would give an account of
his military service which cannot be supported by the facts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to the Korean war is dropped in the governor's
biography that appears in the 1999-2000 Blue Book that has just
been published. Farinella said that as fresh information was added,
some trims, such as the clause about the war, had to be made to fit
on the single page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got changed in the course of a natural rewrite of the
biography, which has to happen periodically,'' Farinella said.
</P>
<P>
   He countered Brockfeld's charges by releasing a document of
Ashcroft's draft classifications. Ashcroft apparently received
seven deferments as a student, or because of his civilian
occupation (lawyer), or because he became a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of nerve for a guy who deferred his way through
the Vietnam War draft to be criticizing the military record of a
man who served his country honorably,'' Farinella said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hilton: ``Mel Carnahan has just been caught misrepresenting
his military service record. He needs to assume responsibility for
his own behavior instead of trying to attack someone else.''

ISRAELI SOLDIERS BEGIN CLEARING A WEST BANK SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the dark before dawn Wednesday, Israeli soldiers
and the police began forcibly removing people from an illegal
outpost in the West Bank where some 200 militant Jewish settlers
had gathered to protect a makeshift community of about four
families.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders, who had assisted the government in dismantling
11 other outposts, were unable to persuade the renegade group at
the Maon Farm to leave without a struggle. Although Prime Minister
Ehud Barak extended the deadline for their removal to avoid the use
of troops, he ordered the army to move in on Tuesday night after he
returned from a trip to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred soldiers and police officers maneuvered through
flaming cars to reach the hilltop, dotted with tents, some mobile
homes and a synagogue hastily built several weeks ago. The settlers
resisted passively, screaming but letting their bodies go limp as
armed officers, three to a settler, carried them from rooftops and
dragged them from the makeshift synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refuse orders,'' the settlers and their supporters screamed.
``This is a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, as a helicopter circled overhead, security
forces surrounded a house where a last group of militant holdouts
barricaded themselves in a room and released a cloud of cooking gas
from a canister to deter efforts to remove them. Preparing to empty
the house, hundreds of soldiers and police officers ordered
onlookers to stand back.
</P>
<P>
   The Maon Farm had turned into the sole symbol of resistance to
Barak's unprecedented compromise agreement with the settler
leadership to remove 12 illegal hilltop encampments while
legitimizing some 30 others. Settlers leaders agreed to cooperate
in the removal, but they met fierce resistance from a small
community of religious settlers and second-generation settlers more
radical than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   With reports late Tuesday that the removal was ready to begin,
sympathizers showed up by the scores to help the settlers reinforce
the site, which is an old military firing range. They began
late-night construction of some prefabricated houses, and blocked
the road up the hill with boulders, large branches and junked cars,
some on fire.
</P>
<P>
   As the soldiers moved into the encampment, some settlers,
crying, pleaded with them to leave, and one man vowed that blood
would be shed. But as the soldiers started moving the people, they
did not use force and were not met with force.
</P>
<P>
   A group of rabbis for the settlements issued a ruling on Tuesday
night forbidding the use of force against the soldiers. But at the
same time, the rabbis called the imminent removal a ``crime against
the Torah and the homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers at Maon, and their supporters, have been portrayed
here as a fringe group. Settler leaders have walked a fine line
between distancing themselves from the militants at Maon and from
the defense of their cause in general. They were eager to avoid a
confrontation among Israelis that would have the potential to
escalate into violence.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sensitive moment for their movement, which is trying
to portray itself as more mainstream so that Israelis will back
them down the road, when final talks with the Palestinians
inevitably raise the issue of dismantling more established
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to defend the existence of large blocs of
settlements in the West Bank, but acknowledged that many isolated
ones will have to be taken down. He has said that the dream of a
Greater Land of Israel, with which he empathizes, no longer matches
the ``realpolitik'' of the diplomatic situation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he ordered the first army dismantlement of a
settlement since his mentor, the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
provoked the right wing by tearing down encampments. But it is
unlikely that Barak will face a political backlash over this move
if the removal proceeds without violence. The hard-core elements of
the right wing have crumbled, and many on the right stand behind
the more moderate position of the settler leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As for the prospect of violence, many Israelis were waiting to
see if Barak was willing to use force against any of the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have raised the settlement issue as one of
their key concerns as final status talks opened this week.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Barak's crackdown on illegal outposts, while better
than nothing, does not go very far toward addressing the real issue
of what they say is the illegal presence of almost 200,000 settlers
in the West Bank.

STATE COMMISSIONER PURSUES HOLOCAUST INSURANCE PAYMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Dorrit St. John recalls the terror she felt 61
years ago when Nazi storm troopers burned and looted Jewish-owned
homes and shops across Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   And she recalls bitterly how an Italian insurance company
refused to pay her father's policy on their home and department
store.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the woman who lives in the Studio City section of
Los Angeles stood defiantly with California Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush to demand that insurance companies pay the
Holocaust-era claims they've ignored for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad in 1960 tried to get his insurance policies paid, and
they more or less told him, drop dead,'' said St. John, 75.
</P>
<P>
   The company that insured her family's belongings still hasn't
paid a dime for their losses on Kristallnacht _ ``the night of
broken glass'' _ when Nazi thugs vandalized and ransacked
businesses, homes and synagogues Nov. 9-10, 1938.
</P>
<P>
   St. John fled Austria the following year and moved to Studio
City in 1959. Now she says it's the principle, not the money, that
drives her to demand restitution from her father's insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to not let them get away with it, and never again let
them do this to us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said next week he will begin subpoenaing records of
the German, Italian, French and Swiss insurance companies who wrote
policies in Europe from 1920-1945 to compel them to pay outstanding
claims to Holocaust survivors and their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't charity. This is money actually owed to these
policy holders,'' he said Tuesday at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center-Museum of Tolerance in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said the companies have dragged their feet instead
of providing policy information to possible claimants, but a state
law enacted last month and sponsored by Assemblyman Wally Knox,
D-Los Angeles, will force them to release that information by April
6. Otherwise, he'll revoke the certificates they need to do
business in California.
</P>
<P>
   And Quackenbush said he'll convene a hearing in Los Angeles on
Dec. 1 to determine how well the companies are complying with the
information demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was cooperation from the insurance companies, we
wouldn't have to take this step. This would be a very businesslike
situation. Now, it's a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said the insurance companies must decide if it's
more worth their while to deny payments to Holocaust survivors,
rather than continuing to do business in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is, good riddance to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The information about war-era insurance will go into a registry,
so survivors and family members can look up parents or relatives
and see if they had unpaid policies, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper,
associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Until now, most of
the information about the holdings of Jewish families came from
Nazi audit records uncovered and organized recently by Viennese
students doing research, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironies abound. Every family had a Gestapo file on them,
as a prelude to taking their assets,'' Cooper said. Now those
records may help survivors recover at least the insurance payments
on their families' lost belongings.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Insurance calculated that survivors
should receive payments about 10 times what was stated in the
original policies, after factoring in inflation and lost interest
income for the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   St. John said she has no idea of the value of her father's life-
and property-insurance policies. But she said many destitute
survivors would benefit from the war-era windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people living in California, truly living from hand
to mouth,'' she said. ``And they truly need every penny that could
come to them.''

TWO MORE KINGS INJURED

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five minutes into Tuesday's game against the
Edmonton Oilers, it looked like the Los Angeles Kings, who already
have lost Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel, might be without two
more of their big names.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Stephane Fiset was a late scratch when he was struck
on the right hand by a puck in warmups. The puck somehow got
underneath the blocker of Fiset, who was taken for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   No fracture was found, but Fiset suffered a bruised right hand
and was unable to start. Jamie Storr took over in net, starting
just his fifth game of the season. Fiset is expected to be
available for Thursday's game against the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Edmonton was physical throughout the first
period, which should have worked against the Oilers quickness. But
with 5:15 gone in the period, Oilers defenseman Jason Smith
flattened Kings right-winger Ziggy Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, the only healthy member of the Kings first line, stayed
down for almost a minute, but the action didn't stop. Ian
Laperriere went after Smith, and both were tagged for five-minute
fighting penalties. Laperriere also received two minutes for
instigating and a 10-minute misconduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shot, Palffy was not hurt and did not miss a shift.
</P>
<P>
   As the center on the third line, which is responsible for
defending the opponent's top unit, Laperriere is expected to defend
his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kings 3-1 victory at Chicago on Oct. 30, Laperriere twice
fought the Blackhawks' Bryan McCabe for taking shots at Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Laperriere fought McCabe four years ago when
McCabe, then a teammate of Palffy's with the New York Islanders,
went after Laperriere for hitting Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update:Robitaille, who will miss at least three weeks
with a broken left foot, was getting around before the game with
just one crutch. During his time off, Robitaille is scouting the
games for coach Andy Murray by watching in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   __ Comeback Kid:Peter Forsberg, Colorado's injured top center,
will begin contact drills today in Los Angeles when the Avalanche
workout in preparation for Thursday's game against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg, who is earning $9 million this year, has been
sidelined all season after undergoing shoulder surgery last summer.
He is not expected back until early December.
</P>
<P>
   Linemate Joe Sakic could score his 1,000th career point in
Thursday's game. Sakic, who is in the final year of his contract,
would become just the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000
points. He has 19 points this season.

   TOKYO _ Nobody pushes Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura around,
including his own political party.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the most outspoken U.S. state administrator flew
halfway around the world to promote trade with Japan despite his
independent party's protectionist platform.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through his first official overseas trip since taking
office one year ago, Ventura spoke with Asahi Evening News on Nov.
5 about his 10-day trade mission to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Puffing on a Cuban cigar _ a product prohibited in the United
States because of trade restrictions _ Ventura, known to the world
as ``The Body'' and ``The Brain,'' made it clear his Reform Party's
isolationist views do not reflect his personal agenda of free trade
and opening new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the best job I can do for Minnesota is to
isolate us,'' Ventura said. ``In fact, I treat Minnesota like it is
my own nation. That's why...we're here to trade with Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's economy, one of the strongest among all the nation's
states, is also healthier than 75 percent of the world's countries.
Only next-door neighbor Canada does more trade with Minnesota than
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Minnesota's soybean, pork and corn
interests also accompanied Ventura to Japan. Minnesota's
agriculture industry has suffered more than other private sectors
from Asia's economic downturn. Last year, food and farm exports
were down 14 percent from 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is timed to catch Japan as it rebounds from recession.
``I firmly believe they're going to recover from it, and we want to
be on the ground floor when that recovery takes place,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's first deal of the trip, cemented in Tokyo on Nov. 5,
is an agreement by food distributor Nichimen Corp. to buy 110 tons
of pork each month from a Minnesota meat company. But when asked
what other visible developments might result from this visit,
Ventura said most of the benefits will take time to see fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese might better recognize Ventura from his days as a
bad-guy professional wrestler who performed in Japan during the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Still others might know him as a supporting actor in action
movies _ either stalking Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``The Running
Man'' or being stalked in ``Predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura, also a former mayor, says he receives more respect
in Japan than back home, where he finds it difficult to escape his
celebrity past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me with a great deal of dignity here _ more dignity
than I get in the United States,'' he said. ``(Japanese] address me
as `governor.' Not for my own ego but because it's the office that
I hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who served for six years with the U.S. Navy's elite
SEAL organization, was also asked his thoughts about controversies
surrounding of U.S. military members stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that while U.S. servicemen should be held to high
behavior standards, Ventura acknowledged certain disruptions will
inevitably occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to remember that (these are) young men serving in the
military who have access to alcohol and things of that nature.
They're going to misbehave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that compromise must be carefully evaluated by
Japanese and U.S. officials, Ventura reckoned, ``It's a price that
Japan pays for having our protection.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BOTH teams are in transition, one on the floor and the other on the
bench. Both teams are early in the process of reinventing
themselves, so far with markedly opposite results.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the power balance hasn't shifted any. In the first
round of the playoffs last spring, the Lakers under Kurt Rambis
were better than the Rockets were when saddled with Scottie Pippen.
And the Lakers under Phil Jackson are still better than the Rockets
are sans Pippen after the current season's first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to compare us to the Lakers,'' Charles Barkley
warned Tuesday. ``There's no way you can compare us to the
Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not favorably, he meant. Ever the realist, Sir Charles thinks
this is a very bad time for the Rockets to be getting a double shot
of Shaquille O'Neal's tough love, even though the Lakers' other
marquee attraction, Kobe Bryant, won't be in uniform tonight at
Compaq Center or Friday in LA because of a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets lost their fourth game, to Orlando, in four starts
Monday night. They have shown no cohesion and little comprehension
after receiving an offseason face lift that turned over more than
half the roster and three-fifths of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, on the other hand, are 4-1 despite Jackson's mission
to alter their offense and locker-room karma. Regarding the former,
he has installed his famous triangle. Regarding the latter, he
expects an unbroken circle.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a foreign concept to the Lakers. However, coach Zen
comes with the credentials to turn them into true believers.
O'Neal, harder on coaches than he is on opposing centers, went on
the record to say it's ``an honor'' to play for Jackson, who gave
Michael Jordan the green light to win six titles for him.
</P>
<P>
   Although the triangle thrived in Chicago, where the center, Luc
Longley, mostly just occupied space, it has allowed Shaq Daddy to
do his thing, too, as his 25 points per game will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Face it. The Lakers and Rockets are coming from opposite
directions. Their respective stars, as Rudy Tomjanovich points out,
``are in different places in their careers.'' Don't think for a
moment the Rockets would be in a disheveled state if Hakeem
Olajuwon and Barkley were in their late 20s like Shaq, instead of
closing in on their late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are young and good. The Rockets are a polyglot mix of
young and old that is proving to be more bad than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a bad time to see Shaq,'' Barkley contends. ``But
when Phil gets the Lakers to play with the discipline he expects,
they're going to be scary. Phil's a great coach. He'll get it out
of them. You play hard for Phil Jackson, and smart, or you don't
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Rockets are playing hard for Rudy T remains open to
debate. (Smart? No way.) There seemed to be as much lethargy as
confusion in their spotty effort against the Magic. Barkley
suggests it's less about what the Rockets are doing than how they
are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play better, that's all,'' he said. ``I'm tired
of the excuses. We've got to make plays when the game's on the
line. We need to stand up and be men.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' miserable start draws comparisons to the 1982-83
season, when an 0-10 stumble from the gate begat a franchise-worst
record of 14-68 despite the presumably inspirational presence of
two Hall of Famers to be, Elvin Hayes and Calvin Murphy, clinging
to roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was in his final season, Hayes in his next-to-last.
Similarly, Barkley will put a wrap on his career at year's end, and
Olajuwon figures to hang it up after next season. Based on what
we've seen to date, it may already be too late for them to reap the
benefits of the roster makeover centered on the ascendant skills of
the flashy point guard, Steve Francis, and slashing Shandon
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three years from now,'' Barkley said, ``I'll be working
for NBC and telling people how good I knew Steve Francis could be.
But this year
</P>
<P>
   this year could be a long year for the Chuckster. I'm going to
enjoy it, though. I'm always upbeat. I'm not going to make myself
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A game like tonight's only stands to add to the melancholy. If
Hakeem couldn't chew up and spit out the stiffs Orlando pestered
him with, what kind of ordeal might he face vs. the monstrous
O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   Five seasons ago in the Finals, Olajuwon was the teacher and
Shaq the student. Their dynamic had reversed itself by last spring,
and you fear the mismatches their remaining meetings will bring.
Dream's nightmares?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to give him some help,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   You will probably see Kelvin Cato on the court with Olajuwon a
bunch tonight. Alas, said strategy creates other matchup problems
for the Rockets because of the bevy of small, quick guys who buzz
around Shaq for the Lakers. The Rockets appear ill-suited to
prevent 0-4 from becoming 0-5. And then 0-6 on Friday.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
There is a tension in the locker room Rudy Tomjanovich can feel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Guys are going crazy,'' he said of his search for a solution.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take three decades in the game to sense these things.
It also doesn't take an 0-4 record. The winless Rockets are facing
the Lakers twice in three days and a torrent of second-guessing
every day.
</P>
<P>
   They expected struggles, but they never expected 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down in the dumps right now,'' forward Walt Williams
said. ``It's something we have to fight through. It's a combination
of a lot of things. It's everything. We're not executing. We're not
getting calls. We're not hitting shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich can feel the search for answers. The natural
starting point has been the offense. Revised nearly as much as the
roster, the Rockets have found their new schemes unreliable at
best, a disaster at worst and replaced almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   If fans pine for the motion that seemed to fit the new talent
better than the old post-up-and-pass game, Tomjanovich knows the
new talent must also be wondering what happened to that brave new
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some of our guys are getting anxious,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``(The players say) `I thought we were going to be more
versatile.' The only way we can do that is get some leads and work
on some of the new stuff where the pressure isn't on us. It's been
slower than I thought (it would be) as far as getting some of that
stuff in. Some of the half-court stuff we were trying to develop
hasn't come along as quickly as we'd like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because some of the things aren't going smoothly with
turnovers, we've been trying to keep it close to the vest. The
things we normally do and have done in the past have been pretty
successful. Our post-up plays, we've gotten positives (baskets or
fouls) 50 percent of the time. The other plays we're trying to put
in have been much less.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have tried, Tomjanovich said, to take advantage of
rookie point guard Steve Francis' quickness in the half-court. But
that has not worked, and when not running a break Francis has
become more of a stationary shooter than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to get some penetration off the dribble into the
offense has not been a high-percentage deal right now,''
Tomjanovich said. ``Part of it is the new rules with the zone. It's
hard to get it to the middle of the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis has struggled with balancing the need to defer to the
veterans and to lead them, all while providing the offensive punch
he expects to deliver. Contrary to all expectations developed in
the preseason, Tomjanovich has had to instruct Francis to look for
his shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis said he has no complaints with his role, or
balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel handcuffed,'' he said. ``My time will come. I'm
going to be patient and continue to play basketball. It's all about
the transition of being a rookie coming into the NBA. It's going to
be hard to find your balance early.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tomjanovich, ``I want to get Steve in creative situations.
So far, that hasn't developed. They knock us out of that play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets ran pick-and-rolls nine times in Monday's 102-97
loss to the Magic. It worked once. They broke out two new plays,
and both showed promise. But the shots they generated missed.
</P>
<P>
   With the game on the line, the Rockets went back to the post-up
offense and chased a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times there isn't that feel of sharpness and
confidence on those (new) plays,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We really
haven't had anybody except for Cuttino (Mobley) in this last game
get off. Walt got it going a little (against the Spurs). But boy,
we had shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder, `Why are you running those same things?' It's
because those are the things that are working. Would I like to have
a more versatile deal? Well, doggone right. It's not exhibition
season. I can't just be experimenting all the time. Once I start
getting some positives in the game, then I run them more.''
</P>
<P>
   But if players are frustrated with the slow change, they cannot
demand the ball more when they are not doing much with it. No
regular is making half his shots. Seven are averaging at least 2.3
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we've been getting good shots with the post-ups
and things of that nature,'' Williams said. ``We just haven't been
hitting the shots. I just have to get myself more involved, get
more touches and just get more into the flow. That's the dilemma
I'm dealing with right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can do a lot of things offensively as far as shoot
the 3, handle it, penetrate, pass. I can do a lot of things. I have
to put myself in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets also have been putting out forest fires only to
be forced to chase another. Friday, Charles Barkley outplayed young
Spurs superstar Tim Duncan. Monday, he had 18 points and 17
rebounds but was outscored by Chris Gatling, and Barkley had eight
turnovers, including one in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Jazz, the Rockets were burned by a variety of
pick-and-rolls. Against the Spurs, they defended the pick-and-roll
better but strayed from shooters. Against the Magic, they defended
well but struggled late offensively.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every game, they have faded down the stretch. In a
four-minute stretch of the fourth quarter in Utah, the Rockets
missed four shots and committed four turnovers. In the last eight
minutes against the Spurs, they missed all five attempts. In the
last six minutes against the Magic, they made one of five shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early, too,'' Barkley said. ``We screw up early, and we
screw up late.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Tomjanovich said, is to keep working and
searching. Guard Shandon Anderson has not found his place in the
offense, averaging 5.8 points per game. But Tomjanovich said that
is typical of the process of discovering what will work best for a
team with three new starters and eight new players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the five-man things (Anderson) would be better at,
we're making a very low percentage at,'' Tomjanovich said. ``Guys
are going crazy. So every day we come up with different wrinkles,
different plays other than a Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) post-up and a
Charles post-up that these guys can get involved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to say right from the beginning I knew what
would work for them, but I don't. They're new. They have different
skills. They have different sides of the floor. Today (Tuesday) we
worked on some new deals. Hopefully, something will click.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It was inevitable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since he stormed into the NBA in 1992, people have compared
Shaquille O'Neal to Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   At 7-1 and 320 pounds, O'Neal comes close to Chamberlain's
massive physical presence. And like Chamberlain, O'Neal is a big
man who can run, jump, use finesse or overpower his opponent to
score in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   Houston fans got a good look at that last spring, when O'Neal
averaged 28.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and four assists to lead the
Lakers to a four-game romp over the Rockets in the first round of
the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll have another opportunity to see the second coming of
Chamberlain tonight when the Los Angeles Lakers (4-1) hit the
Compaq Center floor for the first of home-and-home games that will
pick up again Friday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man,'' said the Rockets' Charles Barkley. ``He comes at
you all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because O'Neal is still hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in yet another parallel to Chamberlain's career, O'Neal,
27, is still seeking his first NBA championship as he enters his
seventh year in the league. Chamberlain won the first of his two
titles in his seventh year, leading the Philadelphia 76ers to the
1966-67 NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, the Lakers' new coach, is another who looks at
O'Neal and envisions another Chamberlain. Only Jackson would like
to add to the comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who guided the Bulls to six NBA championships during
his nine-year stay in Chicago, is introducing O'Neal not only to
the triangle offense that won the Bulls all those rings, but to a
bit of league history as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Shaq that a lot of people think this (triangle) offense
is (Lakers assistant) Tex Winter's invention,'' Jackson said. ``But
it was first brought into the NBA by Alex Hannum, who coached the
76ers in 1966-67, and one of the first things I told Shaq was Wilt
went from something like 34 points a game to 24, but he also was
the first player to lead the league in assists who wasn't a guard
and he won a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `This offense gets you the ball. Your
responsibility is to your teammates. You can get them better shots.
You don't have to do it. You can be a director, leader, not just by
getting 30 points but by being the trusted person in the
offense.'''
</P>
<P>
   The facts might be a bit off _ Chamberlain led the league in
assists the following year, averaging 8.6 per game; in 1966-67 he
was third, averaging 7.8 assists along with 24.1 points and 24.2
rebounds per game _ but you get the idea Jackson was trying to get
across.
</P>
<P>
   The question becomes, Did O'Neal get the message?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, O'Neal said. You can't help but get the idea when Jackson
is trying to get his message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil is to the point,'' O'Neal said. ``If he says something,
he expects you to listen. If you don't listen, you will be
punished. You will be yelled at. It's cool. I'm not going to go
running off, crying and saying, `Oh! Phil yelled at me!'''
</P>
<P>
   What gets everyone in Lakerland running and crying these days is
another trait O'Neal shares with Chamberlain _ lousy free-throw
shooting. O'Neal's career free-throw percentage is .536, far below
his field-goal percentage of .578. What that means is opposing
coaches have not been afraid to employ what has come to be known as
the ``Hack-a-Shaq'' defense.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal, Jackson and a lot of other people in Los Angeles
think the Hack-a-Shaq has evolved into the Attack-a-Shaq,
especially because Kobe Bryant is out with a broken right hand he
suffered in the preseason. That pretty much means O'Neal against
the world, and that's what it has often seemed to be lately.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal took exception when the Portland Trail Blazers vigorously
fouled him Saturday in a 97-82 Lakers loss, getting ejected with
just over nine minutes to play for tussling with the Blazers'
Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neal was miffed again when the Mavericks did likewise
Sunday, even though he stuck around long enough to pile up 30
points and 20 rebounds in a 105-97 win.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mavericks' strategy proved to be sound because O'Neal
went 10-of-23 from the line, making only six of 14 in the final
7:02 as the Mavericks really went at him in an effort to rally.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, O'Neal was 3-for-14 from the free-throw line
on his way to 27 points in the Lakers' 123-101 win over the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun to watch (intentional fouling), but the guy
shoots 57 percent from the field and 35 percent from the
(free-throw) line,'' said Dallas coach Don Nelson. ``It makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only weakness in his game is free-throw shooting. That's
the only one I've found. I don't want to beat him up, (but) I do
know that he's going to shoot a lot of free throws against us.''
</P>
<P>
   To a point, Jackson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (O'Neal) has to complete his all-around game,'' Jackson
said. ``It has to be intimidation inside, rebounding and blocking
shots. Passing will be a natural for him in this offense because
he'll get the ball a lot. He's a good passer and likes to pass. And
then his ability to make free throws at the end of the game. To be
a contributor, that is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal smiles and shrugs when he hears such critiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he said. ``I understand. (Jackson's goals are
the) same goals I set for myself. I set higher goals than any other
human being sets for me.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LUBBOCK _ The valleys have been nearly as numerous as the peaks for
Texas Tech during the 1999 college football season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet chat rooms and bulletin boards have of late been
littered with calls for Spike Dykes to retire at the culmination of
his 16th year in charge. And persistent rumors over the past three
weeks say the coach is so dismayed about the uneven season that
he's thinking of heading for the rocking chair once the last cow
has been chased into the barn.
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, Dykes continues to smile, not completely
satisfied with a 5-4 record, mind you, but fulfilled and a little
thrilled. Fulfilled because in December, 12 of his Red Raiders will
graduate early. Thrilled because despite the roller-coaster ride,
as Tech approaches ``Texas Weekend,'' it still has an outside shot
at the Big 12 championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the season) has been a little better than I expected,''
Dykes said Tuesday. ``Having played nine games and being in control
of our own destiny, we'd have taken that in a heartbeat back in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our guys have done a great job getting where they are
today. Even though we weren't picked this high (second in the South
Division), it's a pretty good compliment to our football team, I
think. I just hope we can go finish these last two.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Red Raiders travel to Austin for their annual
clash with the Longhorns, who lead the Big 12 South by a game over
Tech and 1{ games over Oklahoma. The regular-season finale is Nov.
20 at Jones Stadium against the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   Those who might think Dykes is off his rocker for speaking of
5-4 in such glowing terms are the same ones who have been calling
for his scalp. But Dykes is serious and sincere, considering all
the adversity his team has battled.
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener, the penalty-prone Raiders lost 31-13 at
Arizona State. Two weeks later, North Texas came to Jones Stadium
and walked off with a 21-14 victory. And two weeks ago, the Red
Raiders traveled to Missouri, played dismally and were whacked
34-7.
</P>
<P>
   But what could have been the torpedoes to the entire season
occurred in that first game with the Sun Devils. Star running back
Ricky Williams suffered a sprained left knee. Starting fullback
Sammy Morris suffered a bruised shoulder. Starting right tackle
Matt Heider injured a hamstring. Starting right guard Jason May
sprained a knee. All left the game in the first three quarters and
did not return.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the end for Williams, and the Red Cross
roll only got worse during the loss to North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Five players _ I-back James Easterling (left knee bruise),
cornerback Antwan Alexander (right knee bruise, right ankle
sprain), guard Dan Martin (bruised ribs), quarterback Rob Peters
(bruised right hand) and tight end Tim Winn (right ankle sprain) _
were sidelined, though not all of them for the season like
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lowest point to the season, I believe,'' said defensive
end Taurus Rucker, ``was mainly when we got a lot of guys hurt,
especially when Ricky got hurt. And then we came into the North
Texas game. That was the lowest point we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``After losing to North Texas, we knew we really had to have a
win. It couldn't have come at a better time than when we beat Texas
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right now, we're in position to go to the Big 12
championship. We've got to go through Austin, but we feel like we
have a great chance to go down and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes' Raiders are 5-5 in their last 10 meetings with Texas.
Included among the Tech wins was a 42-35 triumph last year at Jones
Stadium that knocked the Longhorns out of contention for the Big 12
title.
</P>
<P>
   Tech will travel to the state capital having been struck by
another twist of adversity just last week. Tech players Derrick
Briggs and Dorian Pitts were arrested on drug-related charges and
have been suspended from the team indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Raiders can even talk about a championship, given
the prevailing circumstances, is great, said Dykes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have ever thought we would be where we are today
without Ricky Williams?'' he asked. ``And we may be the champions
of the conference. So I would think, shoot, we're doing great.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Texas offensive lineman Cory Quye tuned in to ESPN on
Sunday, and as the scroll at the bottom of the screen continued by,
he saw ``10. Texas'' and thought, ``Wow.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wow is right.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mack Brown was supposed to turn the Texas program around.
Yes, he had the nation's top-rated recruiting class. And yes, The
Eyes of Texas would again be a song of triumph, as opposed to the
funeral march it had become.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not supposed to happen so soon.
</P>
<P>
   With a home game against Texas Tech this Saturday, the Longhorns
find themselves listed among the top teams in the country, with
their first Top 10 ranking since early in the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   A win over Tech would guarantee the young Longhorns a spot in
the Big 12 Championship Game. Another win the next week at Texas
A&AMP;M would give Texas (8-2) a better regular-season record than last
season's 8-3 finish. A victory in the Big 12 title contest would
send the Longhorns to Tempe, Ariz., and the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After surprising Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game in
1996, Texas advanced to the Fiesta Bowl, only to be trounced by
Penn State. That began a string of 15 games, including the first
three of Brown's tenure, in which the Longhorns had only five wins.
Opponents averaged 35.8 points during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown and his staff have turned things around, going 16-3
since. How did they do it?
</P>
<P>
   They may not be Penn and Teller, but it seems as if the Texas
coaches just said, ``Abracadabra.'' It took more than that. It took
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is so much better than it was a couple of years
ago that you can't even compare them,'' UT linebacker Anthony Hicks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at the two biggest problems with Texas' defense
and how they were fixed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The problem: Stopping the run. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was more indicative of Texas' futility before Brown's
arrival than its inability to stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't play good run defense, you can't win games _
period,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams averaged 234.3 yards per game on the ground against Texas
in the 22 games prior to Brown's arrival. In his 22 games at the
helm, the Longhorns have given up just 120.9 rushing yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take pride in being able to stuff the run,'' defensive
tackle Sean Rogers said. ``If you clog up the middle, teams have
trouble getting going. That's what we do _ clog up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Carl Reese could not have anticipated the
rapid development of Casey Hampton and Rogers at tackle, but their
emergence as possibly the best inside tandem in the country makes
his defense go. They were the solution. Foes now are usually forced
to pass to be successful against the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas finished 104th in the country against the run in 1997. It
is 16th in the nation this season against the run, allowing just
99.5 yards per game on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   This year's primary run stoppers were not major factors in 1997.
Hampton, a junior, was out with a knee injury. Rogers was a true
freshman who played in eight of 11 games off the bench. Sophomore
linebacker De'Andre Lewis sat out that season as a redshirt. And
sophomore linebacker Everick Rawls was dominating high school
offenses at Texas City.
</P>
<P>
   Those four, paced by Hampton's 72 tackles, are among Texas' top
six tacklers this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The problem: Forcing turnovers. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns created few turnovers before Reese erased their
passive defensive system and installed an attacking, blitz-filled
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   With that scheme came an attitude adjustment. Still a work in
progress, the Longhorns get after the ball with more passion than
they did before Reese changed the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 games under Reese, Texas has recovered more than three
times as many fumbles (32) as it did in the previous 22 games (10)
and picked up nearly three times as many sacks (75-28).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just get after people,'' Rawls said. ``It's more fun
knowing you are expected to go out there and make something happen
instead of waiting for an offense to make mistakes. We're supposed
to force mistakes. We're still not where we want to be, but we're
flying to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve Longhorns have caused fumbles this season for a team
total of 23. Texas caused four fumbles against Oklahoma State this
past weekend, matching the team total for the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to cause more turnovers,'' said safety Greg
Brown, who returned an interception for a touchdown against OSU,
the first such return for Texas since 1995. ``We haven't done it as
much as we would like. When we start (forcing turnovers) as much as
we want to, we will really be dangerous.''

CITING RESERVE, FIRM IMPROVES CREDIT RATING FOR NEW YORK STATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, La.)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY _ Citing New York state's reserve fund of nearly $3
billion, a major Wall Street firm raised the state's credit rating
a notch Tuesday, although the rating remains among the lowest for
the states.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's upgraded the state's general obligation bonds
from A to A+, raising New York to a tie with Hawaii for the
second-worst rating. The only lower rating for a state belongs to
Louisiana, at A-. The firm also raised the ratings for several
state authorities, along with the general state rating.
</P>
<P>
   The change will probably save the state in interest costs on
bonds it sells, though how much is unclear. Rather than merely
relying on rating agencies, the market tends to make its own
judgments of well-known debtors like New York, and in fact, New
York's bonds have tended to sell at slightly higher values than
their ratings would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, at Gov. George Pataki's insistence, the state did not
spend any of its $1.8 billion surplus from the last fiscal year,
instead reserving it to pay for future tax cuts. That brings the
amount the state has salted away to almost $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to spend the surplus was ``perhaps the most
significant change in fiscal management'' that prompted the rating
change, said Colleen Woodell, a director in S&AMP;P's Public Finance
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Tuesday that ``our efforts to restore fiscal
stability to this state are paying significantly for the people and
taxpayers of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is in considerably better fiscal shape than in 1995,
when the governor took office, inheriting a $5 billion deficit. But
independent fiscal monitors have warned that, despite the large
reserve fund, the long-term outlook has not improved in the last
two years, and may in fact have worsened, because the state has
substantially increased spending and has enacted deep tax cuts that
will take effect over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service, another of the three major rating
firms, has not changed its rating for the state since it was
downgraded in 1990. Moody's rates New York at A2, equivalent to an
A in the S&AMP;P system.
</P>
<P>
   Fitch IBCA, the third rating firm, rates New York at A+, the
same rating adopted Tuesday by S.&AMP; P., and a judgment that has not
changed since the company was formed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P last changed its New York rating in 1997, when it upgraded
the state from A- to A.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AT least nobody is complaining about Chan Gailey being too
conservative this week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the bigger question for the Cowboys is whether they will
even have a full complement of NFL players to square off with Green
Bay on Sunday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they'll be wearing the officially licensed uniforms. But
then, so did some of the little trick-or-treaters who showed up at
your front door recently.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett at quarterback. Chris Warren at running back. Jeff
Ogden or James Tucker at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind ski masks. This gang is so anonymous, they could
probably rob banks with their birth certificates pinned to their
chests and never even think about turning up on America's Most
Wanted, let alone the Super Bowl pre-game show.
</P>
<P>
   So it is fitting that the Cowboys' record at the midway point in
the season _ 4-4 _ is equally nondescript, neither making you sit
up and take notice for any real accomplishments nor being simply
horrid like, say, the New Orleans Saints. Give Mike Ditka's Saints
credit. At least they perform their late-game swan dives with a
flamboyant flourish, giving us the thrill of seeing a ``Hail Mary''
touchdown pass completed as time is running out. The Cowboys'
collapses have had all the suspense of a Honda stuck on the tracks
as a slow-moving freight train approaches. You know there's going
to be a mess, but there doesn't seem to be anything that can be
done about it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is only one thing that the Cowboys' .500 level of
accomplishment to date has told us. Which is that the Washington
Redskins are the most overrated collection of hot air to come out
of the nation's capital since, well, any member of the 106th
Congress. That the Redskins have lost twice already to the Cowboys
yet at 5-3 remain one game ahead in the standings speaks more to
the deficiencies of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first half of the season, the Cowboys have been a
team that has moved the ball only in fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have also been a team unable to put enough
consistent pressure on opposing quarterbacks to rattle them and
have been so frail in the secondary that teams are now even daring
to pick on the heretofore untouchable Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Vikings veteran Cris Carter lit the second-half
flame of his moribund team by catching a couple of slants in Prime
Time's face. Eight days earlier, Indianapolis second-year man
Marvin Harrison flashed by Sanders to catch a 40-yard touchdown
strike that highlighted the Colts' comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   In its four losses this season, Dallas has blown leads in the
second half. What we're looking at here is a Cowboys team that is
being run down from behind by the only unbeatable opponent _ time.
They are the Central time zone's equivalent of the San Francisco
49ers, trying to hold on to faded glory on name alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the struggling Cheeseheads come to Texas, even the names
will likely be missing, as for the first time since the '80s the
Cowboys will probably line up without Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith or
Michael Irvin in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, of course, has been out of action since the Oct. 10 game
at Philadelphia, his appearances relegated to standing on the
sidelines or sitting in the press box dressed like he's preparing
for a second career as either a horse-blanket model or somebody's
sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was having a resurgent season and a wonderful first half
at the Metrodome with 140 yards on only 13 carries. But he broke a
bone in his right hand on a spectacular 63-yard touchdown run in
the second quarter. When Smith was taken off the field for X-rays a
short time later, the Cowboys were in a world of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When Aikman followed with an early exit in the third quarter
after getting smashed by Viking Jerry Ball, the Cowboys were
through for the night and maybe for the year, depending on how long
the bells continue to ring inside his head.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was questionable for much of last week after taking a
blow in Indianapolis, and the list of concussions he has suffered
in his career _ like that of 49er Steve Young _ is growing as long
as his passing arm. In the worst scenario of all for the Cowboys,
it may be time for Aikman to give serious thought to his life after
football and long-term health.
</P>
<P>
   Can you really see them as anything more than fodder in the
wild-card round?
</P>
<P>
   For Jerry Jones, for their fanatical following, for all of them,
it may be time for the Cowboys to acknowledge that as the clock
runs down on the 1900s, so too should the great expectations of a
shining decade that is almost past.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Cowboys thought they had plenty of time before they had to
think about replacements for their trio of aging offensive
superstars.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That time is suddenly here.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to injuries Monday night to quarterback Troy Aikman and
running back Emmitt Smith, the Cowboys expect to be without all of
their triplets when they host the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.
Receiver Michael Irvin is still out indefinitely after suffering a
neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is the only one of the three who might play Sunday, but
after suffering his second head injury in as many weeks he is
doubtful. Smith is expected to miss two to five weeks after
breaking a bone in his right hand Monday. There is no timetable for
Irvin's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to hear about injuries,'' center Mark Stepnoski
said. ``But when you look around the huddle, Troy Aikman, Emmitt
Smith, Mike Irvin, Daryl Johnston (out for the year with a neck
injury) aren't there. That's a lot of weapons, and with those guys
out, we are kind of shooting blanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in second halves this season. The Cowboys lost
Smith in the second quarter Monday night. Aikman went down early in
the third. The Cowboys didn't score another point and watched a
17-point first-half advantage turn into a 27-17 loss to the
Vikings. It was the fourth such second-half collapse this season,
the first coming in Philadelphia after Irvin went down, the others
at the hands of the New York Giants and Indianapolis Colts. It
leaves the Cowboys 4-4 at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman suffered a concussion on a sack Monday night, one of two
hits he took behind the line. It came on the heels of a
helmet-to-helmet collision in the previous game against
Indianapolis that had Aikman suffering from headaches for nearly a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suffered the broken hand when he stiff-armed a defender
during his first of two touchdown runs Monday. A turnover put the
Dallas offense back on the field before he had time to have the
hand examined, and Smith carried once more for a second touchdown.
He then left to have the hand X-rayed, and the break was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy is being tested today, and we'll have those results
tonight or tomorrow morning,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said
Tuesday. ``Emmitt is seeing a hand specialist today and is getting
tests there. We'll see what that brings, too. Obviously, it's not a
good situation right now with both those guys banged up, but we
have some people who can go in and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was running as well as he has in years, scoring on
touchdown runs of 63 and 24 yards only 18 seconds apart in the
second quarter. He carried 13 times for 140 yards before being
replaced by Chris Warren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been carrying the ball all my life, and I can't ever
remember breaking a bone,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren carried seven times for 52 yards in Smith's stead,
including a long of 24. He will start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed 14 of 24 passes for 129 yards before leaving in
the third quarter. Replacement Jason Garrett completed only three
of 11 attempts for four yards and was intercepted once. Garrett is
expected to start this week, with Mike Quinn the backup and
receiver Ernie Mills the emergency quarterback if Aikman is
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to run our offense,'' Gailey said. ``Just like last
year (when Garrett started five games while Aikman was nursing a
fractured clavicle), we won't change things drastically. But we do
do things a little differently. We'll go in there with both (game
plans) until (Aikman) decides what direction he's going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him last night after the game, and he was not
feeling well, to say the least. I understand from talking to the
trainers that he was feeling much better when he got up this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was supposed to be an uplifting day for the Cowboys.
They had it circled on their calendars for weeks, since it marked
the first time Leon Lett was eligible to return to the team from
his eight-game suspension after a failed drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Bowl defensive lineman can't fill any of the offensive
holes, but his superior run-stopping ability could be appreciated
as soon as Sunday. Lett will practice with the team for the first
time today and will play as many as 25 snaps against Green Bay
while backing up starting defensive tackles Alonzo Spellman and
Chad Hennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get into playing shape,'' Gailey said of Lett,
``but a guy that talented will obviously be able to help us.
Hopefully, it's this week.''

TCU's Tomlinson returns to practice 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU junior tailback LaDainian Tomlinson
returned to practice Tuesday for the first time since spraining his
left ankle against Hawaii on Oct. 30.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Dennis Franchione said Tomlinson should be
ready for the game against North Texas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, who is fourth in the nation in rushing with an
average of 155.5 yards per game, worked out last week on a
stationary bike wearing a protective boot on his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson was recently named one of 15 finalists for the
Football News offensive player of the year award. Others running
backs on the list include Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, Alabama's Shaun
Alexander and Virginia's Thomas Jones. Tomlinson is the only
underclassman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner was Texas running back Ricky Williams.
Basketball hopes Men's basketball coach Billy Tubbs could sign as
many as three players today on the first day of the early signing
period.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Hightower, a 6-foot-8 sophomore swingman from Indian Hills
(Iowa) Junior College, heads the list of probable signings.
Hightower is the top junior college small forward in the country,
according to Street and Smith's magazine. Hightower was the MVP of
the NJCAA National Tournament last season as a freshman when Indian
Hills claimed its third consecutive national championship. He
averaged 13.3 points and three assists, shooting 49 percent from
the field and 84 percent from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team is expected to sign four high school players:
Ebony Shaw, a 5-10 guard (Southwest); Tiffany Evans, a 6-3 forward
(Carrollton Newman-Smith); Demetria Favors, a 5-10 guard
(Dangerfield); and Catriece Montgomery, a point guard (Memphis
Hamilton). nn

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The UnitedHealth Group's decision to let doctors decide _
without the approval of the insurance company _ what care a patient
should receive could signal a major change of course in the
managed-care revolution. When the managed-care concept first burst
upon the American health scene a decade or so ago it was touted as
the best way to control runaway medical costs and to assure that
all patients received the care they needed but not unnecessary
care.

   As one key element of ``managing'' costs, insurance plan
administrators were given the power to approve, in advance, any
costly procedures and hospitalizations recommended by doctors
participating in the plan. Whatever merit this approach had as a
management tool, it was despised by both patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in a move that some describe as heralding a wave of
change in the evolution of health care, United, one of the nation's
largest managed-care companies, has said it will abandon the
practice of questioning doctors' decisions before approving payment
of medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be both economic and political reasons for the
decision. Surprisingly, United concluded that the bureaucracy it
had set up to second-guess the doctors cost more to operate than it
saved in denying claims. More than 99 percent of all the cases
reviewed got approved in the end, suggesting that the overwhelming
majority of doctors were making the right decisions to begin with.
True, some suggest that United had been overly lenient in reviewing
its doctors, while others suggest that the doctors were making the
right decisions in part because they knew they would be
second-guessed. But when United conducted some experiments around
the country, they clearly showed that costs went down when the
reviews were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor forcing change was the uproar among patients
and doctors who despised this element of managed care above all
others and whose protests put pressure on Congress to enact a
patients' bill of rights. The managed-care reviews angered many
consumers, who were happy with lower premiums but choked when they
felt they were denied needed care at the whim of faceless
bureaucrats. The reviews also outraged doctors and their powerful
professional associations, which resented second-guessing of
medical decisions by administrators they deemed unqualified to make
such judgments, not to mention the resulting loss of income.
</P>
<P>
   The change at United does not, by any means, mean that the
managed-care industry is giving up on the goal of cost containment,
nor should it. United itself does not plan to abandon all cost
controls over participating physicians. What United will do now is
review physicians' decisions and patterns of practice after the
fact. Where it feels doctors are resorting to needless or overly
costly procedures, United will lean on them to change their
practices. The long-range effectiveness of that approach remains to
be demonstrated. Nor is it clear whether the rest of the industry
will follow United's lead or wait and see what happens. If United
starts marketing itself as the hassle-free plan, others may feel
compelled to follow, or if Congress passes a patients' rights bill
allowing all health insurance plans to be sued, many plans may wish
to duck liability by leaving all medical decisions to the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever course is taken by the health insurance industry,
some form of cost control remains desirable. The managed-care
companies have already achieved substantial cost savings by
reducing hospital stays and negotiating prices with hospitals and
medical groups. They will need to retain some tools to prevent
another explosion of health care costs on the scale that spawned
managed care to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, United's action does not eliminate the need to pass a
strong patients' rights bill in Congress, a bill that will apply to
all health insurers and will deal with matters of access and
liability that have little to do with the issue United has laid to
rest for its own customers and physicians. United's action is not a
final solution to the problems of managed care, nor does it mean an
abandonment of the goal of cost containment. It does suggest that
the mechanism of insurance companies telling doctors what to do is
being revised as a result of consumer and political pressures,
economic efficiency and practical experience.

Rodriguez, Palmeiro win Gold Gloves again 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez won his eighth
consecutive American League Gold Glove award because of his
excellent defense. Rafael Palmeiro won his third consecutive,
apparently because of his excellent reputation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palmeiro won at first base, despite only playing 28 games at the
position during the season. Knee surgery during spring training
limited him to designated hitter for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was honored because of what I've done in the past,
not what I was not able to do this year in the field,'' Palmeiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Gloves are determined by a vote of the managers and
coaches in each league, who also honored Palmeiro in 1997 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens was the Rangers' regular first baseman, and ranked
second in double plays, third in total chances and fifth in
fielding percentage. Late in the season, Palmeiro endorsed Stevens
for the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him,'' Palmeiro said. ``I truly believe that he
deserved it for this year. He played really well, probably better
than anybody else in the American League. But it was a goal of mine
to be a Gold Glove first baseman, and now I've established myself.
I'm proud of that. I feel bad that Lee wasn't honored with this,
but at the same time I feel proud that I've earned the respect of
the coaches and managers around the league.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that Rodriguez would win his eighth Gold
Glove, the second most ever for a catcher behind Johnny Bench's 10.
Rodriguez threw out 54.2 percent (39-72) of runners attempting to
steal, the best percentage since figures first were kept in 1989.
He picked off 10 runners, had only one passed ball and was second
in the AL in putouts and total chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the defense I had this year,'' Rodriguez
said. ``I can keep working hard so I can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   He faced competition this season from Charles Johnson, who was
traded to the Baltimore Orioles after winning four consecutive Gold
Gloves in the National League. But Rodriguez won again.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Gloves usually go to players who have won before. The
only first-time winners in the AL were New York Yankees third
baseman Scott Brosius and Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Shawn Green,
who was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The other winners were outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (10th) and
Bernie Williams (third), second baseman Roberto Alomar (eighth),
shortstop Omar Vizquel (seventh), and pitcher Mike Mussina
(fourth).
No tax for Rangers Salary figures released by the commissioner's
office yesterday showed the Rangers with the second-highest payroll
in baseball. The top five teams in each league are subject to the
luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   However, general manager Doug Melvin said the Rangers won't have
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get taxed,'' Melvin said. ``We stay out of that tax
bracket.''
</P>
<P>
   The figures released yesterday included prorated signing
bonuses, which don't count toward the tax, and include salary
numbers for players on the roster at the end of the season. Thus,
Jeff Fassero's entire $5 million salary was assigned to the
Rangers, even though he only played with them the final two months.
Briefly _ The club acquired right-handed pitcher Brian Sikorski on
waivers from Houston, and added him to the 40-man roster. Sikorski,
25, was 7-10 with a 4.95 earned-run average at Triple-A New Orleans
last year. _ The Rangers hired former Houston general manager Bill
Wood as a professional scout, and promoted Rudy Terrasas to
special-assignment scout. _ Greg Biagini, the manager at Triple-A
Oklahoma, resigned to pursue other opportunities. Biagini managed
the RedHawks to a club-record 83 victories last season and was
chosen Pacific Coast League manager of the year. He was 332-381 in
five seasons with Oklahoma. _ Lee Tunnell, the pitching coach at
Double-A Tulsa, was promoted to Oklahoma to replace Brad Arnsberg,
who was hired by the Montreal Expos as their bullpen coach. nn

<P>
   DALLAS _ Talk about foul moods.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson sent an army of spare parts to hug, bang and hang on
Shaquille O'Neal. The Lakers' big man retaliated with attempts to
wreck the Reunion Arena rims, alternating earth-shaking dunks with
torpedo-shot free throws _ and it was a toss-up which method does
more damage to the iron.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest fouls of all came afterward, in the angry words
spilling from O'Neal's lips.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Mavericks once again spared no hack in a vain attempt
to slow the Lakers on Tuesday, but Nelson's unorthodox methods only
amounted to a 123-101 loss and an extremely irritated 340-pound
center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal amassed 27 points despite missing 11 of 14 free throws.
And though Nelson's strategy failed to produce a win, it succeeded
in embarrassing O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't take it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting real (bleeping) (bleeped) off at myself,'' O'Neal
said, after watching his free-throw percentage drop to .354.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel I'm the nastiest big man in the league,'' he
said. ``Yeah, I am struggling from the line, but I find a way to
come in and do my thing every night. But I'm going to start hitting
them. I'm going to get (ticked) off and I'm going to start hitting
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried. . . . I've been averaging 27 (points), so
once I step up and start hitting them, then I'll be averaging 37,
47 and 57. But no matter what any human tries to throw at me, it
won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence supports Mr. O'Neal's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson employed the foul strategy toward the end of the first
half, throwing 235-pound Rick Hughes at the 340-pound O'Neal with
orders to grab him as soon as the ball was inbounded. The tally:
three fouls in 1 minute, 31 seconds. Six O'Neal free-throw
attempts. Zero made.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks reduced a seven-point deficit to five, if that can
be considered progress, and trailed 54-49 at halftime. O'Neal's
line read 1 for 10 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   It took a teamwide effort to make sure Nelson's Mavericks
couldn't get close enough to try the strategy again. The Lakers
accomplished that with a 14-0 run early in the third quarter _
including four points and a blocked shot from a bleeped-off O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The lead stayed in double figures the rest of the night,
allowing O'Neal to avoid more adventures at the foul line. He had
plenty of friends to thank for the cushion, from Rick Fox (18
points, four steals, five rebounds) to Glen Rice (21 points) and
Derek Fisher (12 points). Tyronn Lue (13 points) and Ron Harper (10
points) rounded out the six-pack of double-figure scorers in the
Lakers' highest point production of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lapses aside, coach Phil Jackson was moderately
pleased after watching his team improve to 4-1. But he took the
fifth when the matter of O'Neal's free throws came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll comment on that publicly, because I know
it's very disarming for him and also very distressing in some
sense,'' Jackson said. ``It was a very frustrating first half,
going 1 for 10. I know that's embarrassing for him, so I'd just as
soon not comment on it.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were also sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't no damn basketball,'' Harper said of the
intentional fouling. ``That's some ugly (bleep) basketball. Let's
play real basketball, your five guard our five. . . . Until he
starts to hit half of his foul shots, they're going to keep fouling
him. So I feel for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower O'Neal's percentage sinks, the greater the temptation
for other teams to follow Nelson's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might do it,'' O'Neal said, ``and it's just my job to
step up and hit them. . . . Right now I'm real upset, especially
with my play, because I know I'm better than this. I'm probably
just trying too hard to shut you (reporters) up, because its all
you seem to talk about. I'm going to get real upset here.''

Lett rejoins Cowboys, expected to play Sunday 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett made his first
appearance at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch training complex since
spring yesterday, as his eight-game substance-abuse suspension
expired following the Cowboy's 27-17 loss to the Vikings on Monday
night. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lett spent the majority of the day watching film and going over
strategy with defensive line coach Jim Bates. He is expected to
play Sunday against the Green Bay Packers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Lett on the roster, the Cowboys released
defensive tackle Nathan Davis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he's happy with the way defensive tackles Alonzo Spellman
and Chad Hennings have played this season, Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said there's no question that Lett will be a big boost for
the team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys believe Lett, who been suspended three times by the
league for violating the substance-abuse policy and has missed 28
of the past 60 regular-season games because of suspensions, has
done well in his rehabilitation and is ready to concentrate on
football. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their only concern is his conditioning. Lett has worked with a
trainer, but the Cowboys don't know what type of football shape
he's in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can get a player like that back, it helps,''
Gailey said. ``He can have a big impact. How quickly and how much?
He's got to get in playing shape.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys don't know how much Lett will play against the
Packers. They are calculating about 20-25 plays. The good thing is
that because Spellman, Hennings and backups Brandon Noble and
Michael Myers have played so well, they don't have to rush Lett
into the lineup. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smith's hand examined &QL; 
Running back Emmitt Smith was examined yesterday by a hand
specialist, who is to determine if the fractured fourth metacarpal
in Smith's right hand will require surgery. Smith injured the hand
on the first of two long touchdown runs Monday night as he reached
back and stiff-armed a Minnesota defensive back on the way into the
end zone. Smith, who had never broken a bone before, is expected to
miss two to five games. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cowboys back Cunningham &QL; 
Before the season, kicker Richie Cunningham was anticipating a
luxurious free-agent contract in the off-season. After his
performance against the Vikings, he might be unemployed before
Christmas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, whose two missed field-goal attempts against the
Vikings make him 6-for-13 on the season, was given the benefit of
the doubt for his poor play early in the season because of his
superior play the past two years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' patience is running thin. However, it has not yet
run out. &QL; 
``He's our kicker,'' Chan Gailey said. ``We've got to get him
straight. It's not easy on him or us. We've got to fight through
this.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Secondary limping &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey said it best: ``You don't ever like facing a good
quarterback without your own weapons and all your defenders.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But ``that's the way its going to be'' when Packers quarterback
Brett Favre comes to town for Sunday's game at Texas Stadium,
Gailey said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders is hobbled with a strained hamstring.
Cornerback Kevin Smith has a bruised left knee and cornerback Kevin
Mathis has a strained hamstring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was severely limited against the Vikings Monday night
and Mathis and Smith spent much of the second half on the sideline.
Smith had an MRI on his burised left knee and the results were
negative. Gailey doesn't anticipate them healing a lot before
Sunday. &QL;

A&AMP;M players support back's dismissal 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Texas A&AMP;M players spoke yesterday in support of coach R.C. Slocum's
decision to dismiss tailback Dante Hall from the team and vowed not
to let the latest setback in a disappointing season distract them
in preparations for Saturday's game at Missouri.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A&AMP;M (6-3, 3-3 Big 12) meets Missouri (4-5, 1-5) at 11:30 a.m.
Saturday in Columbia, Mo., in the Aggies' first game since being
dethroned as Big 12 champs and falling out of The Associated Press'
Top 25 rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum dismissed Hall on Monday for an unspecified violation of
team rules. Slocum said he reached his decision after a Sunday team
meeting. Privately, players said Hall showed insubordination and
disrespect to coaches during the meeting, continuing an ongoing
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Hall had become a divisive element in maintaining team
unity, offensive guard Chris Valletta said: ``Obviously, coach
Slocum thought Dante was not at that same point as the rest of us.
I hope this is a wake-up call that you can't put individuals ahead
of the team. If the head man thinks this is the best thing, then I
support him.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M linebacker Jason Glenn said: ``Some leaders need to step up,
beginning today. We just need to win out and not let this Dante
thing affect us. I don't think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Limited by back and ankle injuries, Hall has missed three games
this season and has gained only 179 yards on 53 carries. The senior
ranks seventh on A&AMP;M's career rushing list with 2,718 yards.
</P>
<P>
   With the Aggies out of the Big 12 title race for the first time
since finishing 6-6 in 1996, wide receiver Matt Bumgardner said
spirits are low in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like someone died around here,'' said Bumgardner, a
fifth-year senior. ``A&AMP;M is used to competing for championships. It
feels a lot like it did in 1996. But we won't finish up like that
team.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Aggies missed out on a bowl bid by losing their
season finale to Texas, 51-15. This team, players said, remains
focused on earning a postseason berth and winning a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M administrators stressed that Slocum, who signed a seven-year
contract extension in June, is in no danger in terms of job
security. Asked about mounting criticism from fans, Slocum said:
``I know I'm a good coach. As long as there's a coaching job out
there, I can have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, in his 11th season at A&AMP;M, ranks as the winningest coach
in school history with a record of 100-31-2. nn

Recruiters turn to Texas for some of the best prospects 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Gary Blair speaks from experience on girls basketball in Texas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has either coached or recruited in the state for nearly 30
years. And he's certain this group of Texas high school seniors _
which can sign binding collegiate letters-of-intent starting today
_ is easily the best he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing compares to the group in Texas _ anywhere in the
nation,'' said Blair, the women's basketball coach at the
University of Arkansas. ``You can go through 20 players that can
help any Division I program in the country. Any program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is the best ever. Everybody hopes to get just
one.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that players such as Ashley Robinson, Jia
Perkins and Shereka Wright will eventually make a WNBA roster. But
in the inexact science of recruiting, this group is as close as it
gets to a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was named a preseason All-American by more than one
publication, and there are 23 players from Texas in the top 200 of
the ``All-Star Girls Basketball Report's'' Top 1,000 of 2000. There
also is a collection of West Texas players who became the first
team in Amateur Athletic Union history to win three consecutive
national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a powerhouse group, and very balanced,'' Granbury coach
Leta Andrews said. ``If they all came together in one spot, they
might go whip any college team.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading the class is Robinson, the 6-foot-4 standout from South
Grand Prairie. Ranked in the top five nationally by some recruiting
services, Robinson hasn't been the most dominant high school player
of the group. But with her height and athleticism, she was No. 1 on
the wish list of many national powers.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, ranked third out of 1,000 nationally in the ``All-Star
Girls Basketball Report'', gave Tennessee an oral commitment last
week and is expected to sign with the Volunteers tomorrow. Opposing
coaches in District 5-5A already know what coach Pat Summitt is
getting out of this recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to take one kid, it would be Ashley,'' said Marcus
coach Kit Kyle, who recruited for Blair while an assistant at
Arkansas. ``I don't know another player that totally changes the
other team's offensive scheme. When we play them, I have to
rearrange what we do offensively because of her. I can't say that
about anyone else we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, however, is far from the lone star.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a 6-foot post from Copperas Cove who is expected to
commit to Purdue today, grabbed national attention last year by
averaging 30 points per game at a preseason tournament in
California against some of the nation's best teams. Perkins, a 5-8
guard from Granbury, has been watched by recruiters since her
freshman year and gave Texas Tech an oral commitment this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech also has oral commitments from three Amarillo-area
players who helped make AAU history. All three _ Canyon's Jolee
Ayers (6-2), Amarillo High's Natalie Ritchie (5-9) and Amarillo
Palo Duro's Casey Jackson (5-10) _ are considered among the state's
top 10 recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue coaches should be in good spirits when they come to the
Metroplex next month to face North Texas. In addition to Wright,
the Boilermakers received an oral commitment yesterday from Lubbock
Coronado's Erika Valek, an AAU teammate of the Amarillo trio. Valek
is considered one of the nation's top point guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erika can get you the ball in any situation,'' Ayers said.
``We played at nationals, and through 10 games, all five starters
scored within 20 points of each other. That's how good she is at
distributing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Those players, as well as Bay City's Chandi Jones (5-9, orally
committed to Houston), Dallas Adams' Amber Obaze (5-9, Louisiana
Tech) and Winnsboro's Staci Stephens (6-1, Texas), make Texas' top
10 not just as talented, but as balanced as any group in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   There are physical posts and athletic ones. There are big,
strong guards and smaller, quicker guards that can burn anyone from
the perimeter and play great defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pretty good variety,'' Texas Tech coach Marsha Sharp
said. ``I think any coach could come to Texas and fit whatever
needs they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The talent doesn't stop in the top 10. Also orally committing
are Georgetown's Dionne Brown to Texas Tech, Sugar Land
Willowridge's Lakeisha Beard, ranked No. 14 by ``Texas Hoops''
magazine, to Arkansas, Dallas Skyline's Chelsea Whitaker, No. 16 in
``Texas Hoops'' magazine, to Virginia, and Grapevine resident
Brittany Wolfgang of Dallas Bishop Lynch, ranked No. 18, to New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's Ebony Shaw is ranked 27th in the state and has
committed to TCU.
</P>
<P>

LACKLUSTER, INJURED KINGS TIE OILERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Next to losing, the worst thing for the Los
Angeles Kings in their new arena, is to be boring.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Kings attempt to regroup without injured top players
Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel, they had little to show in
Tuesday's 1-1 tie against the Edmonton Oilers. In front of 13,282,
by far the smallest crowd to see a hockey game at the Staples
Center, the Kings weren't muscled the way they were last Saturday
against the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   They were lulled to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille should be back in three weeks after suffering a
broken left foot, but Stumpel will be sidelined two to three months
recovering from abdominal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest thing is not the occasional flat game. It's not
even the way the Kings were beat up by the Flyers. Without
Robitaille and Stumpel, they are no longer among the NHL's elite
teams. Just a week ago, they led the league in goals and were tied
for the best record in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Without starting goaltender Stephane Fiset, who suffered a
bruised right hand during pregame warmups, the Kings weren't
challenged very often. Fiset's replacement Jamie Storr faced just
10 shots in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   But without Robitaille and Stumpel, the Kings clearly are a
different team. Aside from Bryan Smolinski's goal that tied the
game midway through the first period, there wasn't much to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   Kings defenseman Garry Galley hit the post late in the second
period. Third line center Ian Laperriere received two 10-minute
misconduct penalties. Does that count?
</P>
<P>
   The two teams played three weeks ago in Edmonton, an exciting
end-to-end 5-4 victory for the Oilers, who are one of the league's
quickest teams.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a winnable game for the Kings, no matter who was on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton came in as the league's only winless team (0-5) on the
road this season. But the Oilers did get back leading scorer Bill
Guerin, who missed the first month in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, who was named NHL Player of the Week earlier this
month, centers the Kings' second line, which is being asked to pick
up the scoring. But part of the reason for the Kings 9-3-3 record
after the first five weeks was balance.
</P>
<P>
   First liners Robitaille, Stumpel and Ziggy Palffy were all in
the league's top 10 in scoring. The second unit of Smolinski, Glen
Murray and Donald Audette had 30 points in 10 games before facing
the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Palffy was rarely seen after the first period when he
was flattened on a check by Edmonton's Jason Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kings power play, which was ranked second in the league
heading into this three-game homestand, was scoreless in two
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first period was marked with physical play and
several fights, at least there was some scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers got the first goal when Mike Grier poked in a loose
puck in front against Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when only the goalie was allowed in the crease,
Grier would not have gotten a goal. But in an effort to increase
scoring, the league now allows offensive players into the blue area
in front of the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Grier muscled his way in and stayed there as Storr battled
several attempts by Ryan Smyth on the left side of the net. When
the puck squirted free, Grier had his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 seconds later, Smolinski tied the game with his fifth of
the year. Donald Audette dug the puck out of the corner and fired a
cross-ice pass to Smolinski waiting the slot. Smolinski let it rip
and beat Oilers goalie Tommy Salo, who beat the Kings on Oct. 16 in
Edmonton.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's short, plump and yellow, with limpid black
eyes and pointy ears.
</P>
<P>
   Even the New Yorker magazine took notice of its looming
pop-culture presence, putting the star of this alternative animal
kingdom on its Halloween cover, dragging a bagful of cash from
house to house.
</P>
<P>
   That cash, by the way, is yours and your children's.
</P>
<P>
   And the short, yellow creature doing the hauling is Pikachu, who
functions as something of a poster child cum mascot for the 151
different kinds of Pokemon, or pocket monsters, whose universe is
the latest to consume kids' consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon kingdom was created in Japan for a graphically
simple pair of role-playing adventures on Nintendo's hand-held Game
Boy video game machine.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's seemingly everywhere, in top-selling video games,
trading cards, an animated TV show and, today, in theaters around
the United States with the release of ``Pokemon: The First Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   So how did this overstuffed set of line drawings get to be so
popular?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the fascination,'' freely admits James LoCicero of
North Hills, whose 9-year-old son, Joshua, is an avid fan. ``When
he was into `Beast Wars,' I got that. As a kid, I could see how you
would like that animation. But this is the one thing he is into
that I don't understand kids being fascinated with. I've kept
myself separated from this more than any other hobby he's been
into.''
</P>
<P>
   And LoCicero said he's not alone in his adult bafflement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I (hear) this from most adults. They don't get this.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect kids to explain it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just watch the show all the time,'' said LaJuan Dorsey, an
11-year-old from Northridge. ``I like the Game Boy game, but I
don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started in Japan about three years ago, when a pair of
similar games debuted on Nintendo's Game Boy. ``Pokemon Red and
Blue'' shotgunned through Japanese kid culture, spawning more than
1,000 kinds of related merchandise and other goodies, including a
No. 1 movie, TV show, album and more. About 14 months ago, the
games and TV show came to the U.S. and caused the same sort of Hot
Zone mass culture explosion, infecting American kids' brains with
Pokemon fever at a rate that would make a viral warfare expert
proud.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nintendo has expanded its red-hot franchise with
other Game Boy titles (``Pokemon Pinball'' and the million-selling
``Yellow'' version of the original game) and a game on the Nintendo
64 console machine (the equally successful ``Pokemon Snap!'').
</P>
<P>
   The animated Pokemon TV show (whose same characters are in the
movie) has proven equally successful, dominating its time slots.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, a trading-card game based on the Pokemon
creatures became its own all-consuming fad, successor to Beanie
Babies in the hearts and piggie banks of many children. So far,
about $5 billion in Pokemon-related gear has been sold worldwide,
more than $1 billion of it in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King, in the biggest promotion in the company's history,
is offering Pokemon toys and cards with its kids' meals. Some
outlets are featuring special trading card nights.
</P>
<P>
   Just another attraction for kids like Cynthia Costanzo, 5, of
Glendale who watches the TV show a lot (it's on 11 times a week
now) and has 41 of the trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua LoCicero plays the Game Boy game when he can, has
collected hundreds of the cards, watches the TV show whenever he
can and liked the movie, though he had some understandable
9-year-old-boy reservations about the part where the Pokemon cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like how you catch Pokemon and how it's very hard to beat
the whole game,'' Joshua said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' said Joseph Costanzo, 24, Cynthia's
father. ``You've got all these characters. Where you have fighting
and battles, it's still not as violent as a lot of shows. It seems
like so many kids got into it because it's not as violent and not
as scary as other stuff. And if they're going to get into
something, they can do this without killing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Celina Nunez, 27, of Paramount uses the Nintendo 64 console to
entertain her nephews, who bring over their ``Pokemon Snap!'' game
cartridges. She even loved the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the message it gave to everyone,'' Nunez said. And
unlike young LoCicero, ``I actually cried when the Pokemon were all
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that is truly baffling.

FISET'S HAND NEARLY BROKEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Moments before Tuesday's game against the
Edmonton Oilers, it looked like the Los Angeles Kings, who already
have lost Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel, might lose goalie
Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was a late scratch when he was struck on the right hand by
a puck in warmups. The puck somehow got underneath the blocker of
Fiset, who was taken in for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just seven minutes before game time and one of the
trainers ran into my office and said, `Steph just broke his hand,'
'' coach Andy Murray said. ``It was crazy in there.''
</P>
<P>
   No fracture was found, but Fiset will be examined again today
and is unlikely to play Thursday against the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   __ Payback: Ian Laperriere, who has defended Kings winger Ziggy
Palffy several times already this year, upset Murray by receiving
two 10-minute misconduct penalties Tuesday in defense of Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need him on the ice,'' said Murray, who did not play
Laperriere in the overtime. ``I was disappointed in his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   As the center on the third line, which is responsible for
defending the opponent's top unit, Laperriere is expected to defend
his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, Palffy was nailed by Oilers defenseman
Jason Smith along the far boards and remained on the ice for a
minute. Although he got up and did not miss a shift, Palffy had
only one shot after the incident. That is why Laperriere felt the
need to get physical.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kings' 3-1 victory at Chicago on Oct. 30, Laperriere
twice fought the Blackhawks' Bryan McCabe for taking shots at
Palffy. Interestingly, Laperriere fought McCabe four years ago when
McCabe, then a teammate of Palffy's with the New York Islanders,
went after Laperriere for hitting Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   __ New rules: The Oilers scored the first goal midway through
the first period when Mike Grier poked in a loose puck in front
against Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when only the goalie was allowed in the crease,
Grier would not have scored. But in an effort to increase scoring,
the league now allows players into the blue area in front of the
goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Grier muscled his way in and stayed there as Storr battled
several attempts by Ryan Smyth on the left side of the net. When
the puck squirted free, Grier had his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Robitaille, who will miss at least three weeks
with a broken left foot, was getting around before the game with
just one crutch. During his time off, Robitaille is scouting the
games for coach Andy Murray by watching from the press box.

JOURNEY TO THE BRIDGE _ AND BACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ On a recent Friday morning, sunny and cool, Ron
asked an acquaintance to keep his suitcase while he went for a
haircut, then he took a bus to the Golden Gate Bridge and jumped.
<P>
   Before he climbed over the bridge railing, Ron took off his cap
and laid it on the sidewalk; he's still not sure why. It was a Nike
cap, and Nike's slogan, coincidentally, is also the Bridge's siren
call to the desperately lonely and hopelessly depressed _ Just Do
It.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the world's most popular
suicide spots, but what a lot of jumpers don't realize is that the
bridge is no sure thing. On average, a couple of people jump off
every month _ there were 28 known jumpers within the past 12 months
_ and every year, one or two of them survive.
</P>
<P>
   It's San Francisco Roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Ron suffered hairline fractures of an ankle and a rib and jammed
his back. But within a month of slamming into the bay at about 75
mph, he'll probably be back out on the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   His friends, the other regulars at the Moscone Playground courts
in the Marina, are looking forward to seeing Ron come back. He's an
excellent player, an easygoing and likable guy, and he's out there
playing every day, at least six hours every afternoon. Since he
doesn't have a home, you could say Ron lives on those courts.
</P>
<P>
   He's 48, looks 10 years younger. He's been playing tennis
seriously for only about two years and he's pretty good, a low
``A'' player, he says. At the end of the tennis day, he packs his
racket and balls into his suitcase, hops a bus and checks into a
Tenderloin hotel, $20 a night. When he's out of dough, he sleeps
behind the Veterans Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a common classification of homeless person, which is
one reason homelessness defies easy solutions _ the diversity and
complexity of the people. You can't fix 'em all with one type of
Band-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Ron's not great at holding a job, and he has had certain cosmic
revelations that caused him much pain and confusion. He believes he
is one of 12 people in the world chosen for a special role, but the
details have not been revealed. The torment, anxiety and pressure
became too much. He had used up all his food and shelter money, and
decided it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   THE BRIDGE seemed the ticket. Ron chose it because it was there
and it was easy. He read somewhere that when you hit the water from
that high up, about 220 feet, the impact can drive the leg bones
into the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Ron walked well onto the bridge, climbed over the railing and
stood on a pipe. He looked down into the water, saw a seal and
waited for it to swim away. There were some windsurfers, and Ron
certainly didn't want to hurt anyone else, but he was sure they
were far enough away from where he would splash down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 10 minutes or more to build up my confidence,'' he
says. ``Some guy up on the bridge said, `Do it if you want.' There
was a huge cable and I grabbed it, and one hand was slipping,
slipping, slipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron said to God or whomever it may concern, ``If you want me to
end it now, this is your chance,'' and his hand slipped off.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless tennis player jumps off bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The drop takes less than four seconds, and seemed like an
instant. Ron doesn't remember if he lost consciousness when he hit
the water, but he remembers being deep under the water, opening his
eyes and having no idea which direction was up.
</P>
<P>
   He thought, ``I don't want to drown and wind up floating to the
Farallones.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he fought his way to the surface. Everything hurt. Legs,
knees, elbows, ribs, back. A windsurfer paddled over, held Ron
until another windsurfer came and the two of them helped Ron
straddle their boards until a Coast Guard boat arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a hospital in Marin, then transferred to a psych
hospital in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   NOW RON SAYS he knew all along that he wasn't going to die in
his jump, and that the picture is much clearer now, and that there
is zero chance he will try to kill himself again. But he
understands why they're keeping him under observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped off the bridge, and that's kind of a major thing to
do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he'll be released. He lost his tennis shoes in the jump, so
he'll go to the Salvation Army and buy a pair, maybe pick up a
tennis hat, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then he'll hobble back to the Moscone courts and begin
reclaiming his game. Hit balls off the wall for a few days,
gradually ease back into doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The other court regulars say they'll be glad to see Ron, that
he'll be welcomed back.
</P>
<P>
   Homelss tennis player returns home.

SLOW BURN OVR FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If new Major League Soccer commissioner Don
Garber needed another reason to eliminate the shootout, he was at
the right game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' season was extended after the shootout clock stopped
prematurely, allowing Jorge Rodriguez to beat Galaxy goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman before the allowed five seconds ran out. That paved
the way for a 3-2 Burn victory to even the best-of-three Western
Conference final at a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Garber, who replaced former commissioner Doug Logan on Aug.4,
talked before the match about eliminating the shootout, shortening
the season and making other changes that will help the league move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to eliminate the shootout and go to a short
overtime period and end our games in ties during the regular season
if we have to,'' Garber said. ``There's a lot of constituencies
that play into that. Our broadcast partners at ESPN and ABC need to
give us the time to do it, but I feel confident that we will get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major priority is shortening the season, perhaps
ending in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, and every media person, fans, players and coaches
believe, our season is way too long,'' Garber said. ``Not too long
in the world of international soccer, but in our early stage of
development, it's almost impossible to be playing games in the late
fall up against other major sports and expect people to be paying
attention to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to not necessarily reduce games, but to end our
season two months prior to where it's ending now.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber, 41, comes to MLS after spending the past 15 years as a
senior executive with the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   He had a wide range of responsibilities, including television
production and distribution, marketing, fan development activities,
sponsorship, licensing and the execution of exhibition games as
well as managing NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Garber says MLS has overlooked the core soccer fan base in this
country, claiming that ESPN polls and other polls indicate there
are 60 million people in this country who follow soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he says, is delivering the game to them. Instead of
just putting the game on television, he feels the league needs to
invest money in highlight shows and games-of-the-week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get ABC and ESPN to get to the kind of model
that we have with Univision, which is why our ratings are higher on
Univision,'' Garber said. ``Everyone knows that Sunday afternoons
at 1 p.m. there's an MLS game. We need everyone to know that on
such and such a date on ESPN and ESPN2 there's an MLS game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also working with them (ABC and ESPN) on hour-long shows
similar to the English Premiership show that's on Fox Sports World.
The idea is to have a Game of the Week, potentially airing on
Monday night and having other highlights of games throughout the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, MLS will have to fork over the cash for the
highlight and preview shows. But in time, Garber thinks it will pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ESPN, we're not important enough right now,'' Garber said.
``So, we can't expect that other people are going to do our job for
us. It would be an expensive project for us to embark on, no less
than 15 or 16 hours of programming throughout the year, but it's a
step we have to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our fan base increases and we become more credible, ESPN is
going to be forced to promote us more because they're going to want
to pump ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber says the hard core fan demands this kind of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tens of millions of hard core soccer fans and, for
some reason, we've taken a step above those fans and have gone to
this constant that we need to get the casual fan,'' he said.
``There's not a business in the world that doesn't build its
product around its core constituency. We need to build a foundation
and then build beyond it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also finds it amazing that the so-called experts think MLS is
struggling to survive, while the WNBA is supposedly flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looks at the WNBA and thinks they have great
success,'' he said. ``We're outdrawing the WNBA on average
significantly, and yet nobody doubts the credibility of the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that, in time, we will get the right people to start
paying attention. We will make small improvements in the short
term, then work extremely hard to build that fan base.''

 WINE'S SUCCESS NOW IN SOIL  &HT;     By JANET FLETCHER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Consumers who thought they had the wine thing
down _ Chardonnay before dinner, Merlot with the lamb _ are about
to find they have more to learn. To be in the know, they may have
to study state maps to find the precise location of Howell
Mountain, the North Coast and the Russian River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   These place names and others, known as appellations, are the new
clues to quality, some winemakers say. Concerned about a flood of
inexpensive competitors from California's Central Valley and
abroad, the state's vintners are increasingly focusing on place to
remind consumers that great wines don't come from just anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As wineries succeed in building prestige for areas such as
Carneros and Rutherford, consumers can expect to see prices for
wines from those regions soar. And, predictably, as appellations
rise in value, disputes are emerging over who's in and who's out.
</P>
<P>
   The approval earlier this year of a San Francisco Bay
appellation _ which some vintners derided as a political favor to a
single winery _ and recent proposals designed to protect the Napa
Valley name have brought appellation issues to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   The growing emphasis on appellation represents a fundamental
shift in California winemaking philosophy _ a shift that gives less
credit to the winemaker and the grape, and more credit to the soil
and the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask us (years ago) in Napa Valley why our wines
were so good, people would say, `I did this. I did that.' It was
all winemaking,'' said Tim Mondavi, who directs winemaking at
Robert Mondavi Winery. ``The magic was in the cellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Mondavi and other winemakers talk of  &UR; terroir  &LR; _ a French
term referring to a vineyard's environment, from slope and soil to
sun, wind and rain. And if their vineyards aren't already in a
prominent appellation, vintners are eager to define and promote
their own to assure consumers that their grapes are grown in a
worthy place.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of American Viticultural Areas (the
official term for an appellation) in California has risen from 48
to more than 80, with six pending.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders say the push to promote viticultural areas
reflects the pressure of the globalization of the wine trade.
Today's shoppers face retail shelves stocked with Merlots from
Chile, Argentina and Italy, often priced below their California
counterparts. Adding to the flood of imported varietal wines,
growers in California's Central Valley have recently pulled out
undistinguished grapes and are planting premium varietals.
</P>
<P>
   Although these high-end grapes rarely perform well in the hot
interior valley, consumers buy wines made from them on the strength
of their varietal name.
</P>
<P>
   Without appellations to establish pecking order, ``it's one
cabbage competing with another,'' says Gerald Asher, a San
Francisco wine writer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences, say Asher and others. Some wine
regions in California confer a distinctive character that
sophisticated tasters can identify and articulate. ``You only have
to taste one of those fat, juicy Chardonnays from Alexander Valley
and one from Carneros, all lean and steely, to see it,'' Asher
says.
</P>
<P>
   The growing recognition of these differences may help explain
why viticultural areas are assuming more prominence. Like a photo
gradually emerging in a developing tray, the true portrait of
California's vineyards _ which grapes belong where _ has become
sharper with each vintage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when Warren Winiarski's Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
Cabernet Sauvignon beat all the French wines in a Paris tasting,
there was no such thing as a Stags Leap District, now one of Napa
Valley's most prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew there was such a place?'' asks Matt Kramer, an Oregon
wine writer who writes frequently about the pre-eminence of site.
``We knew there was a winemaker who was really good and a wine we
really liked, but no one could know whether it was particular to
Warren and his site or part of some larger force of nature. Now
there are enough wineries (in the Stags Leap District) and enough
vintages have passed that if you set them up and taste them blind,
as I have, you can say there's a `Stags Leapness' there. And if you
introduce a Rutherford or Oakville Cabernet, the wine will stand
out. You'll say, `Whose kid is this?'''
</P>
<P>
   For appellation advocates, this identifiable character _ Kramer
calls it ``somewhereness'' _ is worth promoting. If consumers come
to know what Carneros Chardonnay or Rutherford Cabernet tastes
like, then those appellations become not just a quality seal, but a
useful shorthand for what's in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Others say consumer education isn't motivating the appellation
movement as much as profits are. As consumers seek out Russian
River Valley Pinot Noirs, wines with that appellation rise in
value. Whether the wine is better or not, wineries know they can
charge more for it than for a bottling with the broader Sonoma
Valley or California designation.
</P>
<P>
   How much more?
</P>
<P>
   Silverado Vineyards, for example, sells its Napa Valley
Chardonnay for $20. A new Carneros-appellation Chardonnay will be
priced near $30, says general manager Jack Stuart. And the story is
similar elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there's at least a 20 to 25 percent (appellation)
premium,'' says Jim Regusci, a Napa Valley grape grower. Cabernet
Sauvignon grapes from the prestigious Rutherford or Stags Leap
District areas can fetch $3,500 a ton, he points out, whereas
grapes with the broader Napa Valley appellation may be worth only
$2,800.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that premium represents hype or real quality, it's
transferring quickly to the marketplace. Regusci says that new
growers in these regions are getting high-priced offers even before
they produce a crop. Nevertheless, vineyards in a great appellation
aren't uniformly great, he warns; poor farming practices, even in a
top area, will compromise the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given their value, appellations frequently
become mired in ego, politics and greed. When a group decides to
make the case for a new appellation, the winery just outside the
proposed boundary always wants in.
</P>
<P>
   Appellation disputes already have generated some bitter fights _
such as in the Stags Leap District, where owners of properties not
included in the original application filed their own application
with boundaries that included them _ and more battles are on the
horizon. The Napa Valley Vintners' Association is asking the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to prohibit geographic brand names
such as Napa Ridge (owned by Beringer Vineyards) and Rutherford
Vintners (owned by Bronco) unless the fruit in the bottle comes
from those regions. In both these cases, it doesn't. Vintners'
Association president Tom Shelton says his group is concerned about
wineries ``trading unfairly on the reputation that we've built over
the last 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most observers say appellations are a positive sign of
the industry's maturation, the system is not without critics. For
one thing, an appellation is, in reality, only a guarantee of
origin, not of quality.
</P>
<P>
   According to Richard Mendelson, a Napa Valley lawyer who has
helped many groups prepare applications for American Viticultural
Areas, the bureau makes no quality demands of applicants, such as
restricting wineries to maximum yields or specific grapes, as is
done in France. All the agency asks is that the proposed area have
some distinguishing geographical characteristics, that it have a
recognized name such as Anderson Valley, and that the proposed
boundaries correspond to the name.
</P>
<P>
   Given this approach, California appellations may have limited
usefulness to consumers. For an appellation to be meaningful, says
Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards, a pioneer in promoting site over
grape, ``it has to reflect the region.''
</P>
<P>
   When the wineries within the appellation make wine of
identifiable and shared character _ as in Carneros, for example _
the appellation can be a useful shopping guide. But when an
appellation's wines don't exhibit much of Kramer's
``somewhereness'' _ and, observers say, many don't _ consumers are
justified in viewing that viticultural area as little more than a
marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do names like South Coast, Central Coast or North Coast really
serve a purpose, let alone something like Coastal?'' asks Draper,
who views these appellations as marketing tools for large wineries
that can't afford fruit in the better districts. The Coastal
appellation, for example, is being sought by Kendall-Jackson and
others to distinguish their wines from those made with
lower-quality Central Valley fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay American Viticultural Area, in Draper's
view, was a political favor accorded to Wente Vineyards, which
sells a lot of wine overseas. ``Abroad, the words `San Francisco'
can instantly sell a bottle of wine, whereas Livermore Valley
(where Wente is located) could not,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want AVAs to have extraordinary value,'' Shelton concedes.
``We want them to become the basis of differentiation. How much the
consumer will rely on AVAs really depends on how good a job we do
in defining them so they mean something.''

NHRA SEEKS RUN IN FAST LANE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ No sport has enjoyed more growth in the past 10
years than NASCAR Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   The once-regional stock car series has risen from the back roads
of the South to become a Fortune 500 company that annually draws
almost 3 million spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hot Rod Association, which concludes its 25th
championship season at Pomona Raceway this weekend, believes it's
ready to make a similar move early in the next millennium. It's
joined forces with several groups to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest challenge (in the next decade) is not to
fundamentally change what we think is a great product. It's to make
people more aware of it,'' said NHRA executive vice president Tom
Compton, who will become the non-profit company's third president
in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an incredibly talented group of people in place now at
the NHRA. The bottom line is that we have an extremely powerful
combination, and I think it's going to be a good few years at
NHRA.''
</P>
<P>
   First, the NHRA must find solutions to problems that have halted
its growth in recent years. The biggest is the defection of major
sponsors for the green pastures of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   To halt those defections and help place NHRA on the next level
of mainstream sports, the Glendora-based organization has enrolled
the services of three outside firms _ Hill &AMP; Knowlton public
relations firm; the SFX Sports Group, a New York consulting firm;
and Integer Dallas, which is working on advertising and promotions.
All were introduced as part of Compton's three-year plan earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NASCAR just leap-frogged CART, IRL, everybody,'' said
John Force, the NHRA's brightest star. ``It made all the rest of us
look like we're standing still. Our crowds are as big as they have
ever been. We have 100 hours of (television coverage).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a few thorns that need to be straightened out.
They're not major thorns, but the NHRA knows that and they are
fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most believe the key is the television package, which this year
has included coverage on six networks and featured 75 percent live
or same-day telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we have to have and what really drives sports
today is the television package,'' said five-time champion Kenny
Bernstein, who is concluding a 20-year association with Budweiser.
``And that's where we've been the weakest in. That has to be fixed
and, if we get it fixed, everything else will come around.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is generated by TV numbers and, if the
numbers are not there, it's very difficult for the sponsors to say
there is return on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the television package has to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton said it will. He said last week that a new television
deal will be announced in the coming weeks. The deal not only will
include 100 percent live or same-day coverage, but also will be
limited to one or two networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team in place, including some outside expertise in
New York and two production companies, to work on ways we can best
convey what someone experiences at a national event,'' Compton
said. ``That's a challenge, and we've set out to make a noticeable
change to our (TV) program next season.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just a part of the plan Compton has for getting the NHRA
to the next level. It also includes promoting NHRA standouts like
Force and Bernstein and updating some of the 21 racing venues the
series visits each season.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the addition of new tracks, like state-of-the-art
facilities in Chicago, Bristol and Las Vegas, will speed up the
growth process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better stadiums are going to bring corporate America in,''
Force said. ``NASCAR just didn't get smart one day and say we're
going to leap-frog everybody. They built super stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look back in the old days at the old tracks they had. The
sponsors didn't want to go there, either. So they started building
and investing. You had guys like (Roger) Penske, Bruton (Smith),
all these people. Then, the sponsors start saying, `Wow, I get to
sit in the suites. I don't have to walk in the mud today?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a party at the race track. They spent the money.
These guys were smart, and so too is the NHRA. They are going to
build bigger, fancier race tracks and that's going to make
corporate America take a look. And when they want to put signage on
it, they have to buy some race cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton and others also believe the key to the sport's on-going
success lies with its stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an important part,'' Top Fuel veteran Mike Dunn said.
``I've attended a few NASCAR events, and I've noticed the
difference in the crowds from Saturday to Sunday. What's the
difference? The cars are going fast both days. Well, the difference
is the stars _ the Jeff Gordons, the Dale Earnhardts. That's what
we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton said all future marketing promotions will include hyping
stars like Force, Ron Capps and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring our stars to everything we do,'' Compton
said. ``I think it's absolutely critical to any effort to promote
this sport and its stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The selling of the stars is nothing new. The NHRA used the same
promotion in the 1970s, which enhanced the careers of Don ``The
Snake'' Prudhomme and Tom ``The Mongoose'' McEwen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what the NHRA is doing, building up the stars,'' Capps
said. ``We grew up loving the Snake, the Mongoose, Big Daddy (Don
Garlits), Cha Cha (Shirley) Muldowney. That's what got us kids into
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport may need something like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA's other big issue deals with series sponsor R.J.
Reynolds and its Winston brand. Per last year's tobacco agreement,
each tobacco company is entitled to sponsorship of only one series.
It's been speculated that RJR, which also is series sponsor to the
NASCAR Winston Cup series, will choose the stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working extremely close with (RJR) on this whole
subject,'' Compton said. ``No matter how this shakes out, if and
when Winston does go away from NHRA drag racing, we think we have
an incredible opportunity out there to associate with a mainstream
sponsor from corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not sitting with our heads in the sand. We're
preparing for that day as prudently as possible.''

</P>
<P>
   Why did the Soviet Union reconcile itself to ``peaceful
revolution'' in the nations of central and eastern Europe? Why did
we not do everything in our power to keep hold on East Germany?
Should we have fought to keep it in our sphere of influence?
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union understood the abnormality of having the German
nation divided in two. In fact, more than once in the past, Soviet
leaders had submitted proposals for consideration by its Western
partners that would provide for the unification of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the West rejected these, considering them to be mere
propaganda, or trickery, on our part. To a certain extent, the
proposals did have a propagandistic, or self-promotional, purpose.
But our Western partners never once tried to take Moscow at its
word.
</P>
<P>
   During my tenure, in the first years of perestroika, the
question of German reunification did not arise as a specific
problem. East Germany was a place where the people lived better in
material terms than the population of other ``socialist'' countries
of central and eastern Europe. In terms of political freedom,
however, the situation was bad.
</P>
<P>
   As we got under way with perestroika _ the movement that was to
bring freedom to our own people _ the Soviet leadership could not
apply different criteria to the other countries in our domain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the process of democratization in the Soviet Union made
the East German citizens' unhappiness with their own repressive
regime increasingly manifest.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean that there were any kind of hints of pressure from
us. When changes began in eastern Europe, the expression of the
people's will was recognized as legitimate and as the expression of
the freedom of any people to choose their own path of development.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leadership made its own domestic plans and actions
known during visits to the Warsaw Pact countries. But the Soviet
leadership nonetheless did not wish to export its own aims and
intentions, its own experience.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the truth is that interference in the internal affairs
of our neighbors was ended. No longer was advice given from Moscow,
let alone orders or commands.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, sometimes certain politicians even took offense at
this _ especially those who wanted Moscow to push in a certain
direction. But Moscow remained true to its position.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the leaders in Bonn would make a point of commenting
on the division of their country. Our attitude was that the
division of Germany was a product of history and that history would
take care of it some day. Without categorically denying the
possibility of reunification, the Soviet side suggested that time
be allowed to solve the problem. This same idea was repeated during
my visit to Bonn in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, however, events began to develop at a rapid
pace. There were outbreaks of discontent and mass demonstrations.
Support for the East German regime was rapidly collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The East German citizens fled the country en masse, even at the
risk of death. There was an exodus to West Germany _ at first
through Hungary and later Czechoslovakia. Some people left the
country by any means available, even crossing the Berlin Wall,
which separated West Berlin from East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the East German citizens understood that the Soviet
Union would not use force to prevent the unification of their
country. This was a signal to them that their will to have unity
could be realized.
</P>
<P>
   From our standpoint, any effort to try forcibly to preserve this
system would have only vastly weakened the Soviet position and
discredited us in the eyes of the Germans, our people and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In early November 1989, Moscow still hoped that the East German
leadership would be able to cope with the situation, preserving
East Germany as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But events developed in a much more precipitous way. A process
began in which the government structures of East Germany began to
fall apart. The pressure grew, resulting in the resignation of the
old leadership under Erich Honecker, the opening of the Brandenburg
Gate and, on Nov. 9, the fall of the Berlin Wall _ that symbol not
only of the division of Germany but of all Europe into East and
West.
</P>
<P>
   I can say now that Moscow conducted itself optimally in these
circumstances. It ruled out the use of force, including the use of
Soviet troops deployed on East German territory.
</P>
<P>
   It did everything possible to allow the process to develop along
peaceful lines, without violating the vital interests of the Soviet
Union or those of East or West Germany, and without undermining
peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that we lost our allies in eastern Europe,
that we surrendered these countries too easily and without
compensation. This is folly. After all, to whom did we surrender
them? To their own people.
</P>
<P>
   Any use of force to oppose the will of the German people for
unification would have been fraught with the risk of war, perhaps
world war. How was the Soviet Union to ``save'' this regime? By
revving up the tank motors?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was a heavy concentration of armed forces
stationed in Germany. This nation was important to both the East
and West. And its system could be ``saved'' in only one way _ by
once again sending in the tanks, as we did in Czechoslovakia in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such action _ such unjustified action _
could have included a general European war. And for what? Was it
not so that the nations of eastern Europe, amid a free expression
of the will of the people, chose their own path of development
based on their own national needs?
</P>
<P>
   The system that existed in eastern and central Europe, as well
as in our country, was condemned by history; it had long since
outlived itself. It was a burden on the people.
</P>
<P>
   And so we allowed reunification to proceed calmly, without
complications or disruption of European stability.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty on the final normalization of relations with Germany
was signed in Moscow on Sept. 12, 1990, and on Oct. 3 German
unification became a fact.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union before
its collapse in 1991 and Nobel Peace Prize winner, now heads the
Gorbachev Foundation, a political think tank in Moscow. He
addressed the German Parliament on Nov. 9 in a special ceremony to
honor the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.) &LR;

the freedom of any people to choose their own path of development.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leadership made its own domestic plans and actions
known during visits to the Warsaw Pact countries. But the Soviet
leadership nonetheless did not wish to export its own aims and
intentions, its own experience.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the truth is that interference in the internal affairs
of our neighbors was ended. No longer was advice given from Moscow,
let alone orders or commands.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, sometimes certain politicians even took offense at
this _ especially those who wanted Moscow to push in a certain
direction. But Moscow remained true to its position.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the leaders in Bonn would make a point of commenting
on the division of their country. Our attitude was that the
division of Germany was a product of history and that history would
take care of it some day. Without categorically denying the
possibility of reunification, the Soviet side suggested that time
be allowed to solve the problem. This same idea was repeated during
my visit to Bonn in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, however, events began to develop at a rapid
pace. There were outbreaks of discontent and mass demonstrations.
Support for the East German regime was rapidly collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The East German citizens fled the country en masse, even at the
risk of death. There was an exodus to West Germany _ at first
through Hungary and later Czechoslovakia. Some people left the
country by any means available, even crossing the Berlin Wall,
which separated West Berlin from East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the East German citizens understood that the Soviet
Union would not use force to prevent the unification of their
country. This was a signal to them that their will to have unity
could be realized.
</P>
<P>
   From our standpoint, any effort to try forcibly to preserve this
system would have only vastly weakened the Soviet position and
discredited us in the eyes of the Germans, our people and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In early November 1989, Moscow still hoped that the East German
leadership would be able to cope with the situation, preserving
East Germany as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But events developed in a much more precipitous way. A process
began in which the government structures of East Germany began to
fall apart. The pressure grew, resulting in the resignation of the
old leadership under Erich Honecker, the opening of the Brandenburg
Gate and, on Nov. 9, the fall of the Berlin Wall _ that symbol not
only of the division of Germany but of all Europe into East and
West.
</P>
<P>
   I can say now that Moscow conducted itself optimally in these
circumstances. It ruled out the use of force, including the use of
Soviet troops deployed on East German territory.
</P>
<P>
   It did everything possible to allow the process to develop along
peaceful lines, without violating the vital interests of the Soviet
Union or those of East or West Germany, and without undermining
peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that we lost our allies in eastern Europe,
that we surrendered these countries too easily and without
compensation. This is folly. After all, to whom did we surrender
them? To their own people.
</P>
<P>
   Any use of force to oppose the will of the German people for
unification would have been fraught with the risk of war, perhaps
world war. How was the Soviet Union to ``save'' this regime? By
revving up the tank motors?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was a heavy concentration of armed forces
stationed in Germany. This nation was important to both the East
and West. And its system could be ``saved'' in only one way _ by
once again sending in the tanks, as we did in Czechoslovakia in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such action _ such unjustified action _
could have included a general European war. And for what? Was it
not so that the nations of eastern Europe, amid a free expression
of the will of the people, chose their own path of development
based on their own national needs?
</P>
<P>
   The system that existed in eastern and central Europe, as well
as in our country, was condemned by history; it had long since
outlived itself. It was a burden on the people.
</P>
<P>
   And so we allowed reunification to proceed calmly, without
complications or disruption of European stability.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty on the final normalization of relations with Germany
was signed in Moscow on Sept. 12, 1990, and on Oct. 3 German
unification became a fact.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union before
its collapse in 1991 and Nobel Peace Prize winner, now heads the
Gorbachev Foundation, a political think tank in Moscow. He
addressed the German Parliament on Nov. 9 in a special ceremony to
honor the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.) &LR;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Erase from your mind the image of ``earthy'' botanical skin-care
products sitting and gathering dust on the bottom shelf at
health-food stores, occasionally perused by the Birkenstock crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Think instead of creams that inspire the same fashion rush as a
pair of Manolo Blahniks _ and that are at least as costly, like
Shiseido's $450 La Creme from its Cle de Peau line, or botanical
leader Sisley's $300 Sisleya.
</P>
<P>
   Both have strong reputations and gorgeous packaging, but what
you're paying for are the ingredients: herbal enzymes and chestnut
rose fruit extract and the highest-quality vitamins, antioxidants
and essential oils that stimulate circulation and purify the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Plants, without a doubt, have become the latest trend in skin
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural products are now more fashionable,'' concedes
Christian Courtin-Clarins, international vice president of Clarins
and the son of its founder, Jacques Courtin-Clarins, who used plant
extracts in the treatment oils of his physical-therapy practice,
the still-existing Institute Clarins in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very comfortable using plant extracts,'' says
Christian, who just introduced Energizing Morning Cream with
ingredients of ginseng, horse chestnut extract, peach and pineapple
extract and sage, to name but a few. ``They've been used for 3,000
years, and we know all of the side effects, both good and bad. When
you work with chemicals, you just don't know the long-term side
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Other botanical lines used by European women for decades, like
Decleor, Gatineau and Guinot, are only now starting to hit their
stride in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Europeans have an inside-out approach to
skin care, while their American counterparts prefer
laboratory-concocted quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans are into an evolution rather than a revolution when
it comes to skin care,'' says aesthetician Regina Viotto of the
Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   An American faced with a pimple, for example, would go to a
dermatologist for a cortisone injection. A European would adjust
her diet and schedule a facial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy skin isn't a quick fix,'' says Susan Kurz, president
of Dr. Hauschka Skin Care, the organic line from Germany. ``If you
apply a cortisone cream for acne, it will go away, but the problem
still exists within the system. You must look at what the skin is
doing and support that activity. The American consciousness is just
starting to understand this holistic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, question the efficacy and scientific credibility
of botanicals and essential oils. Ancient tales of perfumers spared
from the Black Plague due to their contact with essential oils, or
modern-day ones of Decleor aestheticians never catching winter
colds and flu, are intriguing but hardly conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Botanicals have been proven to have a therapeutic effect at a
certain level, but the concentration can fluctuate wildly from
batch to batch,'' says Dr. Nicholas Perricone, an assistant
professor of dermatology at Yale University Hospital and a
dermatologist in private practice in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   (Perricone is also the founder of a line of skin care called
N.V. Perricone, M.D. Cosmeceuticals and the chairman of the
International Symposium on Aging Skin.)
</P>
<P>
   However, he does point to breakthrough research being conducted
in Europe on the anti-aging effects of polyphenols, such as grape
seed extracts, and he's very pleased with the reparative abilities
of alpha-lipoic acid, which is derived from potatoes and
</P>
<P>
   is featured prominently in his own collection.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to another misconception: Just because a treatment
is ``natural'' doesn't mean it was cooked up in a country kitchen.
In fact, the very opposite is often true.
</P>
<P>
   Hauschka is known for its stringent harvesting techniques, while
the Swiss homeopathic medicine manufacturer Weleda, a favorite of
Meryl Streep, cultivates its ingredients using ``bio-dynamic''
gardening: Plants are insecticide-, pesticide- and fertilizer-free,
and harvesting is done only on certain days and under certain moons
when plant energy is said to be at an optimum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yon-Ka in France manufactures its products in a
``white fabrication zone,'' a bacteria-free, filtered-air setting
that is normally required for pharmaceutical formulations that
involve the handling of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in the study of aromatherapy have demonstrated the
compatibility of highly concentrated plant extracts with the human
body both internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essential oils are much more than a surface moisturizer,''
says Laura Peck Fennema, founder and president of Essentiel
Elements, a spa line out of San Francisco that recently introduced
a facial skin care collection that is ripe with botanical
ingredients. ``When applied topically, these oils enter into the
dermal layers quickly, deliver moisture more efficiently and
balance the skin, but they also work on a deeper level via the
olfactory system to relax and boost overall well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, America's curiosity is overcoming a natural
reticence to ``go botanical.'' Recent studies indicate that 50
percent of the population is now accessing some sort of alternative
medicine, from reflexology to acupuncture to ayurvedic spa
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Such phenomena aren't lost on the American skin care industry.
Skin-care lines are being introduced daily incorporating everything
from feng shui to ayurvedic principles _ and, in the case of
Elizabeth Arden's Millenium Energist Revitalizing Emulsion, even
organic food ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Senior vice president of research and development John McCook
believes women are looking for natural solutions. Their new cream
with a soy complex claims to alleviate ``energy crises'' in the
skin caused by menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Arden's studies found it outperformed traditional estrogen
replacement therapy in curing severely dry and rough skin often
associated with menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can deliver performance through a natural, topical
route, then this is more acceptable than treating with a
pharmaceutical silver bullet,'' McCook says.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular French skin-care line, Guinot, uses a similar
soy derivative for the same purpose in its Pleine Vie cream.
</P>
<P>
   But with all of the technology available to us, why not whip up
synthetic versions of these ancient extracts that mimic the magic
of the originals?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple. ``Have you ever tasted fake crab?''
Fennema asks. ``It doesn't taste anything like the real thing.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE LAMOND: HOOKED ON SALSA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George LaMond isn't exactly new to the music scene. In the late
1980s he was something of a teen sensation as a freestyle singer.
But today he's switched gears to tropical salsa _ and singing in
his native tongue, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   His new album, ``Entrega,'' released under the Prestigio
Recordings label, and its first single ``Que Te Vas'' (a salsa
version of the song originally composed by Mexican superstar Juan
Gabriel), has placed LaMond as a rising star within the Latino
music genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc Anthony gave me my inspiration,'' said LaMond, when asked
about his decision to enter the salsa music arena. ``We were in Los
Angeles and Marc told me he had just finished his first
Spanish-language production. He said, `You have to listen to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And though he's been hooked on salsa ever since, LaMond knew
music was going to be his career long before he ever heard of Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to sing,'' LaMond
said. ``I would mimic Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross. I used
to put shows together in my house. I have four sisters and I would
charge their friends 25 cents to watch me perform in my living
room. I would put our Christmas lights on the floor, turn the other
lights off and perform Menudo songs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LaMond came close to being one of the members of the
popular teen Latin group that give Ricky Martin his start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 13 when I tried out for Menudo,'' LaMond recalled. ``I
made it to the 100 finalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But that brush with rejection didn't stop LaMond from pursuing
his music career. He began networking and that soon paid off,
courtesy of a good friend's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang for Marilyn Rodriguez,'' he said. ``She had already
written a hit single for C Bank called `I Won't Stop Loving You'
and was looking for people to manage. She had connections with a
lot of independent labels. I eventually did a demo and that turned
into a label deal.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 19, LaMond had sold 180,000 copies of his single, ``Bad
of the Heart,'' also written by Rodriguez, and in 1990 he signed
with Columbia, which released an album, also called ``Bad of the
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia also rereleased the single, which sold another 200,000
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from a guy who used to work at Blimpie making $150 a
week to making $15,000 a week.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his sartorial style, it's a lot different than when he
was in his late teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wear belts with gold plates, Lee and Adidas as a
kid,'' he said. ``When it came time to be the performer, everything
was suits. Coming from the Bronx, I used to buy suits at Oaktree.
Then I started going into little boutiques and to stores like
French Connection and Armani.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, LaMond likes to dress ``back to hip-hop'' with brands
such as Fubu, Timberland and Avirex. Onstage, however, he wears
Italian-made suits as well as Diesel's vintage clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not wearing suits 24 hours a day,'' said LaMond, when
discussing the new look for the modern salsero. ``We're
accessorizing and wearing brands such as Kenneth Cole. But I'm very
plain, simple. I don't like loud colors.''
</P>

 &UR; MICHAEL FREDO: NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've never heard Michael Fredo, you've probably seen
him _ in the most recent Tommy Jeans ad campaign for television.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old Fredo is more than just a pretty face. His
just-released first album, ``Introducing Michael Fredo,'' on AH!
Records (a joint venture between Andy Hilfiger and Quincy Jones)
has earned positive reviews and he was a big hit with fans when he
opened for pop sensation Britney Spears this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of his songs will be on the soundtrack of the
film ``Black and White,'' to be released in March.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, when most boys are thinking about dating, grades and
cars, Fredo was singlemindedly concentrating on his music career _
so much so that he decided to move to New York City from his
hometown of Elmira, N.Y., just to pursue a music education at the
Professional Children's School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning a lot, Fredo made an important
connection. ``I went to school with Paul Ellington, Duke's
grandson, and he introduced me to his father, Mercer,'' recalls
Fredo. ``Just as a goof, he (Mercer) asked me to sing with his band
for rehearsal and I was then asked to join the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredo performed with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for the next
year. But shortly after Fredo graduated high school, his father
passed away, and Fredo turned to songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, another connection contributed to his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Quincy Jones at a party in L.A.,'' Fredo said. ``Andy
Hilfiger introduced me to him and asked if I could sing to him with
my guitar. He heard me sing in my hotel room and then I flew back
to New York to cut a demo for Quincy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his fashion style, Fredo has given up cargo pants for
leather, and sneakers for snakeskin boots. But above all, ``I'm now
attracted to more of the fitted look. The year 2000 is the fitted
age,'' he said. ``People are sick of baggy clothes. It's cool but
sometimes they drag on the ground and the bottom gets you filthy
dirty.''

   &UR; GEORGE LAMOND: HOOKED ON SALSA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George LaMond isn't exactly new to the music scene. In the late
1980s he was something of a teen sensation as a freestyle singer.
But today he's switched gears to tropical salsa _ and singing in
his native tongue, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   His new album, ``Entrega,'' released under the Prestigio
Recordings label, and its first single ``Que Te Vas'' (a salsa
version of the song originally composed by Mexican superstar Juan
Gabriel), has placed LaMond as a rising star within the Latino
music genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc Anthony gave me my inspiration,'' said LaMond, when asked
about his decision to enter the salsa music arena. ``We were in Los
Angeles and Marc told me he had just finished his first
Spanish-language production. He said, `You have to listen to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And though he's been hooked on salsa ever since, LaMond knew
music was going to be his career long before he ever heard of Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to sing,'' LaMond
said. ``I would mimic Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross. I used
to put shows together in my house. I have four sisters and I would
charge their friends 25 cents to watch me perform in my living
room. I would put our Christmas lights on the floor, turn the other
lights off and perform Menudo songs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LaMond came close to being one of the members of the
popular teen Latin group that give Ricky Martin his start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 13 when I tried out for Menudo,'' LaMond recalled. ``I
made it to the 100 finalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But that brush with rejection didn't stop LaMond from pursuing
his music career. He began networking and that soon paid off,
courtesy of a good friend's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang for Marilyn Rodriguez,'' he said. ``She had already
written a hit single for C Bank called `I Won't Stop Loving You'
and was looking for people to manage. She had connections with a
lot of independent labels. I eventually did a demo and that turned
into a label deal.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 19, LaMond had sold 180,000 copies of his single, ``Bad
of the Heart,'' also written by Rodriguez, and in 1990 he signed
with Columbia, which released an album, also called ``Bad of the
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia also rereleased the single, which sold another 200,000
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from a guy who used to work at Blimpie making $150 a
week to making $15,000 a week.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his sartorial style, it's a lot different than when he
was in his late teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wear belts with gold plates, Lee and Adidas as a
kid,'' he said. ``When it came time to be the performer, everything
was suits. Coming from the Bronx, I used to buy suits at Oaktree.
Then I started going into little boutiques and to stores like
French Connection and Armani.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, LaMond likes to dress ``back to hip-hop'' with brands
such as Fubu, Timberland and Avirex. Onstage, however, he wears
Italian-made suits as well as Diesel's vintage clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not wearing suits 24 hours a day,'' said LaMond, when
discussing the new look for the modern salsero. ``We're
accessorizing and wearing brands such as Kenneth Cole. But I'm very
plain, simple. I don't like loud colors.''
</P>

 &UR; MICHAEL FREDO: NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've never heard Michael Fredo, you've probably seen
him _ in the most recent Tommy Jeans ad campaign for television.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old Fredo is more than just a pretty face. His
just-released first album, ``Introducing Michael Fredo,'' on AH!
Records (a joint venture between Andy Hilfiger and Quincy Jones)
has earned positive reviews and he was a big hit with fans when he
opened for pop sensation Britney Spears this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of his songs will be on the soundtrack of the
film ``Black and White,'' to be released in March.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, when most boys are thinking about dating, grades and
cars, Fredo was singlemindedly concentrating on his music career _
so much so that he decided to move to New York City from his
hometown of Elmira, N.Y., just to pursue a music education at the
Professional Children's School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning a lot, Fredo made an important
connection. ``I went to school with Paul Ellington, Duke's
grandson, and he introduced me to his father, Mercer,'' recalls
Fredo. ``Just as a goof, he (Mercer) asked me to sing with his band
for rehearsal and I was then asked to join the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredo performed with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for the next
year. But shortly after Fredo graduated high school, his father
passed away, and Fredo turned to songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, another connection contributed to his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Quincy Jones at a party in L.A.,'' Fredo said. ``Andy
Hilfiger introduced me to him and asked if I could sing to him with
my guitar. He heard me sing in my hotel room and then I flew back
to New York to cut a demo for Quincy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his fashion style, Fredo has given up cargo pants for
leather, and sneakers for snakeskin boots. But above all, ``I'm now
attracted to more of the fitted look. The year 2000 is the fitted
age,'' he said. ``People are sick of baggy clothes. It's cool but
sometimes they drag on the ground and the bottom gets you filthy
dirty.''

 &HT;    Honk, or sue, if you are tired of wild goose chases
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I've been taking a gander at that goose
lawsuit from suburban Boynton Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   What goose lawsuit, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   I know, it's hard keeping up with the local personal-injury
suits that involve animals.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, you were just getting over that rhino-bumps-the-car
personal-injury lawsuit at Lion Country Safari, and didn't realize
that it has been eclipsed by the goose from Bay Estates at Rainbow
Lakes condominium.
</P>
<P>
   I guess you'd call the goose lawsuit a slip-and-fowl case.
</P>
<P>
   The goose is described chillingly in court papers as
``beige-colored.''
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't make your skin crawl _ like it did the first
time you saw Jaws _ I don't know what would.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you tell me about the goose that attacked you,
ma'am?'' you can almost hear the personal injury lawyer ask his
prospective client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was . . . beige.''
</P>
<P>
   (A goose from the Martha Stewart collection?)
</P>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to the lawyer here, Daniel Jacobson of
Fort Lauderdale. A lesser attorney might have run a client out of
his office after hearing about the perils of crossing paths with a
beige goose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beige? C'mon. You've got to do better than that,'' a less able
lawyer might have said. ``I can work with a dirty brown, maybe. A
mottled gray, certainly. But beige? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   When you've got a rhino for your perpetrator, you might take a
beige. But with geese, you'd hope for something better than a
decorator color.
</P>
<P>
   It may be redundant to mention it, but the alleged victim here
is from Boca Raton. This might explain why the goose is described
as beige. Someone from, say, Loxahatchee, might have identified the
bird with less pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color? Heck, I don't know. It was just a big ol' buzzard, the
kind that wears them orange snorklin' shoes all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the goose chased Denise Mosseri and
bit her legs while the Boca woman was visiting her daughter at Bay
Estates. Mosseri hurt herself ``when she tripped and fell over the
goose trying to escape its attack,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The goose belonged to Donald and Marylee Drotar, who failed to
``post any warning signs'' about the aggressive goose, and allowed
the goose to ``wander the community,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where I feel a bit of sympathy for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, when's the last time you saw a house with a
``Warning: Dangerous Beige Goose'' sign posted on the fence?
</P>
<P>
   You can get those bad dog signs that picture a snarling dog
face. But the hardware stores don't stock dangerous-geese signs.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Mosseri didn't do anything to provoke the goose,
although I'd expect a defense lawyer to explore whether the Boca
woman was carrying a down pillow to her daughter's condo.
</P>
<P>
   Mosseri is also suing the condo for note roads to prevent geese
from running after people?
</P>
<P>
   I guess you could put up something to slow down these wild goose
chases. What would you call these roadway devices?
</P>
<P>
   Goose bumps, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to watch this case closely to see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I've got some squirrels in my front yard, and lately
they've been acting bold, maybe bold enough to warrant a ``Warning:
Dangerous Squirrels'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, there's something else about them that's
beginning to seem ominous.
</P>
<P>
   They're almost . . . beige.

 &HT;    The gift is thanks to UD
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When I heard about the largest-ever gift in
University of Dayton history, the number simply staggered me.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the $10 million pledge, $2 million a year over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   It was that class of '78 number that stunned me. My class. e
$10,000 that Lighthouse Elementary gave to their school.

</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Elementary Principal Ann Wark (left) could hardly
believe her ears when her 'mentor,' Lighthouse Elementary Principal
Una Hukill, told her about the gift.
</P>
<P>
   , about what's happening at Wark's school right now. ``That's
something they didn't have there. And sometimes morale is better
than money.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a lede in for this story. It will go is in here.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a lede in for this story. It will go right through here
like this in here.
</P>
<P>
   The call came one morning during the last week in October, and
Jupiter Elementary School Principal Ann Wark could hardly believe
what she was hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teachers over here have decided something,'' said Una
Hukill, Wark's ``mentor'' in the district and the principal at
another grade school in Jupiter, Lighthouse Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to give your teachers $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Wark, in her first full year as principal at Jupiter Elementary,
had been on the receiving end of other nice gestures from
Lighthouse, but still she couldn't believe this. This was too
gracious, too kind, too heartwarming. Ten thousand dollars. Out of
the sky. What her staff could do with that! But even more
important, Wark loved the message the gift sent.
</P>
<P>
   It meant they were all in this teaching thing together.
</P>
<P>
   Wark didn't say a word about the money to anyone except a few
administrators. She wanted her teachers to hear it from the
Lighthouse teachers.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lighthouse teachers invited the Jupiter teachers to
lunch. Each one got a lovely note in the mailbox. The Jupiter
teachers were a little puzzled. ``Some of the teachers here
honestly thought we were going to go there, and they were going to
try to tell us how to (teach),'' said fifth-grade teacher Mike
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Wark, of course, knew better. And so, on Oct. 15, just
before the Caesar salad and the chicken and the good bread was
served, out walked the Lighthouse folks with the big pretend check.
All the Jupiter teachers started looking around. What the heck was
up? they wondered. And the Lighthouse teachers looked like they'd
swallowed the canary. And then the Jupiter teachers realized what
was going on, and everyone started applauding and hugging and
saying, I can't believe this, and that's pretty much when every
single person in that room got a decent case of the goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional,'' said Laurie Vacchiano, another Jupiter
fifth-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand dollars. No strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   If you want to start a lively conversation with anyone who knows
even a little something about Florida's education system, bring up
The Money.
</P>
<P>
   The money the state gives out to schools that get an A.
</P>
<P>
   The A-B-C award system is the work of Gov. Jeb Bush and his
lieutenant governor, former Martin County Superintendent of Schools
Frank Brogan. Get a good grade, and we'll give you state money, the
Bush administration told schools earlier this year. The grades are
based on student test scores. But what happens is that the schools
that have already been blessed with active parents and
two-parent-home students and middle- to upper-class districts end
up getting the bulk of the money.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lighthouse Elementary got $120,593. Jupiter
Elementary School, a D school by test-score standards, got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got that (state) money, we all looked at each other
and said, 'It's too much,''' said Giovanna Christian, a former
Lighthouse PTO president and one of the many parents who volunteers
so much at the school that she practically lives there.
</P>
<P>
   The two schools might be within the boundaries of the same tony
little town, but the contrasts are all over the place. Lighthouse
is the school President Clinton visited. Lighthouse is the school
Celine Dion visited. Lighthouse has the gifted program and the
incredible PTO that raises oodles of money at its spaghetti dinner.
Heck, it made $35,000 on gift wrap alone this year, and its book
fair makes more money than any other in the state. Lighthouse draws
from privileged, upper-class, mostly white neighborhoods. Only 2
percent of its students are black. Only a smattering get a free and
reduced lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But Una Hukill would like us all to add this to our Lighthouse
Elementary list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents and staff are very, very giving,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Elementary, on the other hand, is exactly what you don't
think about when you think of the town of Jupiter. It's 44 percent
free and reduced lunches. A lot of kids come from families where
both parents work. A lot of kids come from single-parent houses.
It's about 16 percent Hispanic. The building is old; it was built
in 1926. And it's truly, truly a neighborhood school, serving a
lower-to-middle class pocket of Jupiter that's neither on the water
nor on the town's pastel beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say Jupiter you don't think of this school,'' says
Assistant Principal Rich Myerson.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this year, Jupiter Elementary was the only school in
town not to get an A. Lighthouse. Limestone Creek. Jupiter Farms.
Jerry Thomas Elementary. All the other grade schools in town got
A's, and, therefore, money. Then there was Jupiter, the old scrappy
school with the smart new principal who's trying to turn it all
around. They got a D. They got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard being the only one,'' says Wark.
</P>
<P>
   Says teacher JoAnn Parizek: ``ools. Many of its kids come from
affluent homes whose parents are involved with school activities
and raise money at school events.

 &HT;    Bush's record just substantial enough to be target
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I realize that when you raise $56 million you have
some intention of spending it. But someone should have advised
George W. Bush to sit on his money for a few more months.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, he's gone ahead and made some TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   With the greatest political minds available, Bush surely knows
that nothing draws attention like a TV spot. No, not from voters.
They hit the mute. The attention is from rivals and pundits. They
will biopsy a new TV spot as if were a suspicious mole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has prospered thus far in being a name and a number. Did I
say $56 million? The more attention he draws to anything else, the
more questions. Who needs those?
</P>
<P>
   Someone tell the governor he also errs by bringing attention to
his record as governor in the TV spots, instead of simply saying
something like. ``Bush: How swell can a guy be?''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, one of the new spots touts Bush as having held the
line on spending in Texas. To this, rival Steve Forbes has asserted
that Bush ``makes big-spending Bill Clinton look like a fiscal
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, said Forbes, federal spending is up 21 percent.
Under Bush, Texas spending is up 36 percent. Forbes is comparing
apples to papayas, but that is how things work when a candidate
brings up his record in TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   We won't be seeing that from Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a magazine publisher, Forbes increased the use of white
space in copy and changed body-type fonts to a new and more
readable style. He will do the same as your president.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, at least Bush has a record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problem, of course, is that he wants to show that he's
accomplished a lot, but he hasn't, partially because Texas
historically is a low-tax, do-nothing state when it comes to some
of the things fiscal conservatives don't want government doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Try as one might, it's hard to make less of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true if you're in a w

 &HT;    Investors, biotech firms hope to lift industry in Southeast
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A select group of biotech companies will meet in
Atlanta this week with potential investors in one of the most
ambitious efforts yet to boost the biotech industry in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and scientists from the 21 companies will present
their ideas and plans Thursday and Friday at the Ritz-Carlton in
Buckhead, hoping to connect the best of the region's ideas with the
money needed to take them through the arduous process to the market
where they might have an effect on thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   A biotech process typically can take from six to a dozen years
to go from laboratory, clinical trials, federal approval and
finally to the shelves. Meantime, a company must still pay the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies require a lot of capital,'' said Martin
Tilson, a partner at Kilpatrick Stockton, who said he got the idea
for the gathering a year ago while attending a biotech conference
in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a core of good companies, the state by itself could not
spur enough interest from national investors to draw the needed
capital _ but neither could any of the other Southeastern states,
he said. Yet scattered from Knoxville to Florida were other pockets
of biotech with the same problem in places like Research Triangle
Park, N.C., Knoxville, Athens and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the conference will be a mix of regional investors,
venture capitalists and executives from deep-pocketed
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 companies asked to be considered as participants in
the conference, Tilson said. Organizers looked for those whose
technology was closest to commercialization, who had a mature
management and who were ready for a financial boost. Selected were
three companies from Alabama, two from Florida, eight from North
Carolina, one from South Carolina, two from Tennessee and five from
Georgia: Alpharetta-based AtheroGenics, which develops treatment
for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases; AviGenics an
Athens-based company that uses genetic research to produce
improvements in poultry traits; CareLinc Corp., an Atlanta company
that makes health care management software; Alpharetta-based
Inhibitex, a biopharmaceutical company developing products for the
treatment of infectious diseases; and Proxima Therapeutics Inc., an
Alpharetta company that makes technology enabling doctors to treat
cancer close to the cancer site, diminishing damage to surrounding
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   While a regionwide association may be one outcome of the
gathering, Tilson said that is not his intent. ``I'm not interested
in organizations; I'm interested in action.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections created by the meetings will themselves go a
long way toward cultivating biotech in the Southeast, he said.
``The main goal is to pull the region together so we can build a
critical mass of companies. Focus attention on the companies with
the intent to get them funded, raise the region's visibility for
the life sciences. You move the region, and everybody benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors include Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, Ernst and Young, the Georgia
Research Alliance, Silicon Valley Bank, Kilpatrick Stockton and the
Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The conference starts with a reception at 6 p.m. Thursday and
continues at 7:30 a.m. Friday. For information call Kari Lampka at
617-761-6707.

 &HT;    Hotels see market for 'healthy' rooms
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole

   ATLANTA _ Dezirae Bridges gets sick of traveling.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Delta Air Lines flight attendant doesn't like
her job. She does. But when she travels, Bridges often gets a
headache, runny eyes and a sore throat.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit? Her hotel room. Cleaning solutions, dust mites on
carpet and draperies, mold and other chemicals make Bridges sick.
To counter the effect, she sprays her sheets and air ducts with
Lysol, brings her own soap and packs plenty of allergy medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably don't realize how it can affect
them,'' said Bridges. ``You might start sneezing and not make note
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges and thousands of other travelers like her may soon find
relief. Several hotel chains, including Atlanta-based US Franchise
Systems, are creating chemical-free, environmentally safe rooms
that they hope will attract travelers such as Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   US Franchise Systems recently unveiled a pilot program in which
it will offer ``healthy'' rooms. The program includes five of its
Best Inns &AMP; Suites properties in Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina,
Oregon afd Idaho. The rooms cost $5 extra per night, said USFS
spokeswoman Barbara Wiener. The company will roll out the program
systemwide if it is successful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At USFS' Best Inns in Lake Charles, La., 10 of its 111 rooms are
part of the new program. ``They're selling out,'' said general
manager David Rothschild. ``People are now asking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the entire Sheraton Rittenhouse Square Hotel is
considered environmentally smart. The 193-room property features a
40-foot-high bamboo garden, which oxygenates the air in the lobby.
Guest rooms have filtered air and recycled carpeting. The hotel
uses organically grown, dye-free linens and natural shampoos and
soaps. Guests must sign a form that they will not smoke in the
hotel. The housekeeping staff only uses natural, ``environmentally
friendly'' cleaning products.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Bernstein, a spokeswoman for Sheraton Hotels &AMP; Resorts,
said the price is competitive with other hotels in the area. ``We
don't want people to have to pay extra to breathe fresh air,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While most people are not acutely sensitive to environmental
contaminants, it's a severe problem for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members have told us that they can go into a hotel lobby and
start having trouble breathing or get itchy eyes,'' said Louise
Kosta of the Atlanta-based Human Ecology Action League. ``In that
case, chances are this is not a good bet for you. It can really
limit people's ability to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, said Kosta, the efforts, though well-intentioned,
can lack focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not sure if they're dealing with things that are
environmental, like biodegradable products and recycled containers,
or things that deal with human health,'' she said. Kosta said it
benefits the traveler little to have soaps that aren't tested on
animals but a ventilation system that is not properly maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers on this one, I'm afraid,'' she said.
``You may have a chain that has a really good policy, but have
conditions within individual properties that can be either
spectacularly good or spectacularly awful.''
</P>
<P>
   But until more hotels get on the bandwagon, Dr. Gloria
Campbell-D'Hue, an Atlanta dermatologist, will continue to advise
some of her patients to take their own linen and towels. ``It's a
nuisance, but it makes them a lot more comfortable.''

 1111 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Up early to catch a glimpse of Troy

   TROY, Ohio _ This time of year, before sunlight and before
homeroom, when only an occasional car fills one of Troy's diagonal
parking spots, the city has its routines and rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not bustling between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. But
neither is it asleep, as cars darting around Downtown Square prove.
</P>
<P>
   Early-morning Troy is the domain of people immersed in a variety
of activities _ some already feeling the stress of the day or
wrapping up graveyard shifts at factories, others basking in
leisure or gathering themselves with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Dudley's Pastry Kitchen illustrates both.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described non-morning person, manager Janice Dent,
usually at work about 6:30 a.m. but sometimes arriving far earlier,
hustles to get the rushing, doughnut-craving customers out the
door. At a table against a wall several men, mostly retired, gather
daily to chew the fat over coffee and pastries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get all kinds come in here early in the morning _ lawyers,
bankers, retired judges,'' said Dent. ``We try to hurry, take care
of them, so they can get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathered at that wall-side table by about 7 a.m. each day are a
teasing, playful and opinionated bunch including Hobert Hinkle, Don
Isern, and Frank Whidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they come in here, so they can argue with each
other,'' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said he likes the chance to ``find out all the news going
on all over Troy.'' The group's habits are almost automatic,
including whether each has a doughnut. ``He does. He does. He
doesn't,'' Hinkle said, pointing out each man.
</P>
<P>
   Isern, said: ``Got to get out early in the morning when you're
retired. It's a good physical thing. Don't stay in bed too late in
the morning when you're retired because you have very little to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, Bus Allen, gets a doughnut at the shop between 5:30
a.m. and 6 a.m., then attends service at St. Patrick's Catholic
Church, returning to the shop about 7:20 a.m. Then he's off for a
full breakfast elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Pastry Kitchen is replicated at casual restaurants
throughout downtown.
</P>
<P>
   At K's, a similar bunch fills up a booth next to the front door.
``Reserved, D.O.M. of Troy,'' the table is marked. ``D.O.M.'' is
``Dirty Old Men.''
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Dale Henning has made Stager's on South Market
Street his first stop. ``I let him in. I don't know why,'' joked
co-owner Charles Beard. Like clockwork, Henning is the day's first
customer, arriving when it opens at 5 a.m., eating his regular two
eggs over medium and rye toast with strawberry jam. He always pores
over a newspaper and periodically glances up from his counter seat
to take in a highlight on TV's Sportscenter above and behind Beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always gotten up at 4:30 in the morning, since I was
about 15 years old,'' the 54-year-old Henning said.
</P>
<P>
   Stager's co-owner Tracy Lee said the morning is ``time to gather
my thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, locals engage in fairly ordinary activities they
value or even treasure.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., Miami County employee Matt Wills puts fist over fist
on the ropes that raise a U.S. flag on each side of the county
courthouse. ``It's one of the nicer parts of the job,'' he said.
Asked why, he said, ``I've done my tour in the service'' _ four
years in the Air Force in the 1970s. He must wait until daylight
for the task because flag etiquette bars flying the flag in
darkness, and the pole is not illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courthouse and adjoining safety building, the offices
of the county board of education, laboratory for the courts, and
the sheriff begin to show signs of life. Wills goes on ensuring
outside lights are on, and in the winter he sometimes must clear
out snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta make it safe for the people that come in 7:30, 8,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest of birds is Bakehouse Breads owner Margaret
Begg. On the solitary cruise from home to her shop about 5 a.m.,
she said she sees little more than ``a lot of cats' eyes and
raccoons' eyes in the gutters.'' With its peak hours before dawn,
Emery Worldwide's planes light up the sky above her car.
</P>
<P>
   Once at Bakehouse, Begg launches into her routines, the first
adding flour and water to her sourdough starter, a wild yeast that
makes sourdough bread taste the way it does. ``It has to come
first. It's like milking cows,'' she said. Listening to National
Public Radio with flour powdered on her face and arms, Begg said
she enjoys the ``rhythmic'' physicality of her work.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, about 7 a.m. a woman walks herk. Jan, a
mental-health professional who asked her last name not be used,
said she likes how early-day exercise makes her feel. ``It takes
the stress away,'' she said. ``I love the peacefulness. I love the
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the street from Bakehouse and Stager's, the UDF
convenience store is a crossroads for those bleary-eyed from work
or bleary-eyed from having just awakened.
</P>
<P>
   Those on a traditional schedule cast sidelong glances at the men
who've just finished late shifts, said manager Betsy Hutchinson.
``They look at them like, 'How can you buy beer so early in the
morning?' But you can't look at it that way. They've been up all
night.'' Hutchinson is at UDF at 4:30 a.m. and calls her home about
5:15 a.m. to wake her son to feed their few farm and house animals.
</P>
<P>
   Some city workers reach work a few hours before daylight. One
recent morning, city employee Bill Gearhart painted the stripes
that frame downtown parking spots. Standing in the square, he said
his main observation about early-morning Troy is that he must watch
out for his own safety because commuters generally drive to work
with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are wild in the morning, wouldn't you say?'' he said to
co-worker Ralph Wa

 &HT;    Red-hot cooking show host to kick things up
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A shopper strolling through Books &AMP; Co. stopped
in front of the pile of Emeril Lagasse's latest cookbook. Then she
noticed the poster announcing that Lagasse will be in Dayton to
sign books on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The color drained out of her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``She turned absolutely white,'' says bookstore employee Sharon
Kelly Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper turned to her companion, and barely able to get the
words out of her mouth, kept repeating, ``He's coming, he's
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Emeril Lagasse, the messiah _ an evangelist preaching the
gospel that eating, and maybe even cooking, should make you happy.
</P>
<P>
   Make that ``happy happy happy,'' one of the mantras echoed by
the fans who battle for seats at the ``Emeril Live'' cooking shows
he tapes for the Food Network. He's known simply as ``Emeril,'' his
last name having become superfluous like those of other icons of
taste, such as Julia Child and Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami Valley, his fans were talking about taking off work
to attend a midday book signing of ``Every Day's a Party,'' a book
with Emeril's name on it and co-authored by Marcel Bienvenu and
Felicia Willett.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Madewell, the owner of the Dayton area's four Bagel Cafes,
vowed to be at the signing with her 13-year-old son Matt, who's in
the seventh grade at Van Buren Middle School and more likely to be
found most days on the football field or basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Mom, you gotta get me out of school for that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Emeril, he says, is ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Madewell says her son introduced her to ``Emeril Live'' and now
she watches if she's at home when the nightly show comes on at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a riot,'' she says. ``He makes cooking fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's made any of Emeril's recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn techniques. You learn things like roasting
peppers.''
</P>
<P>
   And you learn to follow his enthusiastic lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts garlic in everything. I find myself doing this,''
Madewell says. ``I say, `Hey let's kick it up a notch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though Emeril has credibility with his peers, he is as much a
phenomenon as he is a chef. Trained at the culinary school at Rhode
Island's Johnson &AMP; Wales University, he adopted New Orleans when he
went to the Commander's Palace to take the place of chef Paul
Prudhomme, another superstar who he eventually eclipsed. Emeril
started opening his own restaurants in 1990 and eventually hosted
his own television cooking show.
</P>
<P>
   But the cult developed when the Food Network made him the
centerpiece of its lineup, providing a huge support staff and even
a band.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with six restaurants scattered in New Orleans, Las Vegas
and Orlando, the nightly ``Emeril Live'' show plus ``Emeril
Essence'' reruns, five cookbooks and a regular appearance on ``Good
Morning America,'' he has an annual income Forbes magazine
estimates at $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The twice-divorced chef, whose age is reported between 40 and
43, gets plenty of press. He was just featured in his ``bachelor
pad'' in People magazine's sexiest men issue.
</P>
<P>
   He has parlaes as intently as if he were setting diamonds. They
applaud even the mention of garlic or pork fat. They are insiders
who know the running gags.
</P>
<P>
   All this inspires intense loyalty for the man who has been
called a blue-collar gourmet and the rock star of cooking. Groupies
of a more sedate style _ they may be seniors who think of him as a
son _ have thronged to book signings in midsized cities this year,
starting with Rochester and Albany, N.Y. The stores ran out of
books in both and in Rochester a fire marshall estimated the crowd
at 4,000 to 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   All of Lagasse's previous books have been best sellers, and
Morrow, the publisher, did a first printing of 400,000 for the new
book.
</P>
<P>
   And this Dayton Books &AMP; Co. has ordered 2,500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Enough _ they hope _ for Emeril's fans.
</P>

 &HT;    For groovin' chef Emeril and friends, every day's a party
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Emeril Lagasse's newest book ``Every Day's a Party''
(Morrow, $26) is the fifth for the New Orleans chef, and it's
focused on his adopted home and that city's preoccupation with the
joy of eating.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense tells you that authors who produce a cookbook a
year don't have all those recipes in their back pocket. Though the
book is written in the first person, many of the recipes are
clearly attributed to co-authors Marcelle Bienvenu and Felicia
``Flo'' Willett and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Among the three of them, they have parties for every month.
Thanksgiving, Christmas and the millennium New Year's Eve are
obvious occasions, but others range from an October Pepper Fest,
with a recipe for homemade pepper sauce, to Mardi Gras street food
offerings of andouille corn dogs and Frito pie. A Sugar Bowl
tailgate party features garlic meatball poorboys. A millennium
party is long on foie gras, truffles and caviar _ not exactly
standard fare for the target audience of his show.
</P>
<P>
   One chapter features a wedding party for Dayton born-and-raised
Anne Kearney, who's now a New Orleans chef with her own
award-winning restaurant, Peristyle. Before she broke out on her
own she worked for Emeril.
</P>
<P>
   Here are several recipes that capture the spirit of the book.
They have not been tested by the Dayton Daily News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains two recipes for poorboy sandwiches. One tucks
both french fries and shredded roast pork inside the sandwich.
Another recipe, for Garlic Meatball Poorboys, is a favorite from
Bienvenu.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC MEATBALL POORBOYS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound each ground veal, ground beef chuck and ground pork
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped green onions, green part only
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fine dried bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon cayenne, divided
</P>
<P>
   16 small cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups thinly sliced yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   1 12-ounce bottle amber beer
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 loaf French bread, 26 to 28 inches long (not a thin baguette)
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons whole grain or Creole mustard
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound provolone cheese, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl combine the ground meats, chopped onion,
chopped garlic, green onions, egg, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, 1
teaspoon of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne. Mix well with
your hands and form into 16 meatballs. Insert a garlic clove in the
center of each meatball and pinch the meat around it.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour and Creole seasoning in a shallow plate. Roll
the meatballs evenly in the flour mixture, tapping off any excess.
Reserve any remaining flour.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet heat the oil over medium heat. Add the
meatballs and brown evenly, using a spoon to turn vhem. Remove the
meatballs and set aside. With a wooden spoon scrape the bottom of
the pan to loosen any brown bits. Stir in the reserved seasoned
flour. Stir constantly for 3 to 4 minutes to make a dark brown
roux. Add the sliced onions and season with the remaining teaspoon
salt and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Cook, stirring, until the onions are
slightly softened, about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly pour in the beer and water and mix well. Bring to a boil
and return the meatballs to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium
low and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour until the gravy is
thick, turning and basting the meatballs with the pan gravy about
every 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and skim off any fat that
has risen to the surface. Add the parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the loaf of bread in half lengthwise. Spread one half with
the mustard and the other half with the mayonnaise. Arrange the
provolone on the bottom half of the bread, overlapping the slices,
then arrange the meatballs on top. Spoon the gravy over the
meatballs. Top with the remaining bread half, cut into 6 equal
portions and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Though Emeril calls this drink a martini, think of it as an
after-dinner drink that happens to include some vodka, as well as
Chambord, the raspberry liqueur. He serves it with sugar cookies.
</P>
<P>
   EMERIL'S MARTINI
</P>
<P>
   WITH CHOCOLATE GRAPES
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 small clusters white grapes, washed and patted dry
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted and kept warm
</P>
<P>
   4 cups shaved ice
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces Absolut currant vodka
</P>
<P>
   8 splashes Chambord
</P>
<P>
   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dip each cluster of
grapes into the chocolate, allowing the chocolate to cover half of
the grapes. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate until the
chocolate sets, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mound 1 cup of the shaved ice in the center of each martini
glass. Pour 2 ounces of vodka over each mound of ice. Add a splash
of Chambord to each. Garnish with a cluster of the chocolate
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Scallops are suggested for a New Year's Eve dinner and covered
with a highly seasoned mayonnaise. While the recipes calls for
homemade mayonnaise, the home cook could spike up commercial
mayonnaise. It is suggested the scallops be served on large
scallops shells, available at gourmet shops, but you can use other
small ovenproof dishes.
</P>
<P>
   HOT MAYONNAISE-GLAZED
</P>
<P>
   SCALLOPS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 appetizer servings
</P>
<P>
   Mayonnaise:
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon pepper sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil (use a mild oil)
</P>
<P>
   Scallops:
</P>
<P>
   24 large sea scallops, each cut in half horizontally
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped green onions, green part only
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor or blender, combine the egg, mustard, hot
sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire, salt, black pepper and red
pepper flakes. Process until smooth, about 30 seconds. With the
motor running, pour in the oil in a slow, steady stream. The
mixture will thicken. Refrigerate until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Season both sides of the scallops with salt and pepper. Put 2
scallops in each shell or individual dish, and place on a baking
sheet. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the mayonnaise over them. Bake
on the top rack of the oven until the mayonnaise is golden, about
10 minutes. Garnish with the green onion and serve hot.

 &HT;    Don't decline an invitation to recline
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At the risk of sounding pathetic, let me grovel
at your feet and scream, ``PLEASE HELP ME!''
</P>
<P>
   My hope is that The Remote, my male statement performance arts
piece with guys sitting in recliners during football, will attract
enough national media attention to become ESPN's Play of the Day.
</P>
<P>
   See, my bosses at this newspaper have gone to a lot of trouble
(make that expense) to close off the Congress Avenue Bridge on
Friday, Nov. 26, for this event.
</P>
<P>
   And if the only people who show up are me, a handful of winos
from under the bridge and Leslie, I'll be writing obits, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it this way. The more fannies we have sitting in
recliners on the bridge for my spoken word and dance piece, the
better chance we'll have of getting some big shot like Dan Rather
to cover it. And instead of jumping off the bridge, I will be able
to sit on it.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you are asking yourself, ``Kelso, how can I
help?''
</P>
<P>
   I thought you'd never ask. If you want to keep me out of the
soup line, just attend The Remote's ``cattle call'' at 10 a.m.
Saturday, Nov. 20, at the old Electric Lounge, 302 Bowie St.,
Austin, Texas, and sign up for The Remote. No artistic skills are
necessary, unless you consider being sucked to the furniture by
gravity a skill. If you have a recliner, bring it. But leave your
ballet slippers at home.
</P>
<P>
   We've already got about 15-20 spots filled, by dancers, actors
and a handful of football fans working with choreographer Andrew
Long of the Johnson/Long Dance Co.
</P>
<P>
   But, since we want 100 guys in recliners to make a real big
artistic splash, we still have 80-85 chair vacancies. So PLEASE, if
you don't want me to do something rash, like take up reading L. Ron
Hubbard, come to the Nov. 20 ``cattle call.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I shouldn't be so paranoid, because I've gotten some
media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Andrews, a staff writer for Furniture Today, the furniture
industry's newsletter, interviewed me about The Remote. Maybe I'll
get a mention in her column ``Speaking of Springs.'' (I just made
that column name up.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'll bribe you with free stuff. We'll also have an
ugliest recliner in Central Texas contest. I'll take whoever brings
the funniest-looking, most beat-up recliner to The Remote to dinner
at Ray's Steakhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Remote will have a star-studded lineup. I'll probably get up
and say a few words, all of them small. Ray Benson of Asleep at the
Wheel will sing the National Anthem. I called Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura's office to invite him. But he's on a trade mission in
Japan, where earlier this week he met with his former tag team
partner, Masa Faito, a k a Mr. Torture.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if Jesse can't make it, Mr. Torture can fill in.
</P>
<P>
   For The Remote, we'll have big-screen TVs so we can watch the
Texas-Texas A&AMP;M game on TV. There will also be junk food, such as
Cheez Whiz.
</P>
<P>
   If you participate, you could become a movie star. Ramona Kelly,
Dea Eggleston and the Inks Production Co. on Westlake Drive are
making a documentary about The Remote that they hope will take off
like that classic, ``Hands on a Hard Body.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I guess this one would be called ``Butts in a Chair.''

 &HT;    Sport sinking in pool of controversy
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis get ready to
square off once again Saturday night for the undisputed heavyweight
title, their sport is flat on its back, eyes rolled up, tongue
lolling out, legs giving a fading quiver as the ring count begins
to sound too much like a death knell.
</P>
<P>
   Even promoter Don King, who boasted Tuesday night he can take
``any lemon and make lemonade,' knows boxing is reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through troubled waters right now,'' King said as
he watched Lewis work out in a cramped and steamy makeshift gym in
the back recesses of the Mandalay Bay hotel. ``Boxing is taking a
lot of bumps and bruises. There's innuendo, inference, indictments.
Right now with this fight, everyone is under pressure...the
commission, the officials, the fighters themselves. Holyfield and
Lewis can quiet the waters with a distinctive knockout or a
distinctive decision. This is no time for poising or posturing.
Every one _ and I mean EVERYONE - in this fight has a lot to win
and a lot to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone here in Vegas this week for the fight admits the
sport is in trouble. Talk about being down and almost out.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the count:
</P>
<P>
   _One _ Four top officials of the International Boxing Federation
_ including president Bob Lee, the man who assigned the infamous
Eugenia Williams to judge the first Holyfield_Lewis fiasco _ have
been indicted on federal racketeering and bribery charges for
soliciting payments up to $100,000 from seven promoters and 23
boxers, who, in turn, got favorable IBF rankings. The boxers and
promoters, yet to be named, are rumored to include several of the
boxing's top figures.
</P>
<P>
   _Two _At least 30 prize fights in the past dozen years have been
fixed or tainted by fraud, alleged the Miami Herald in a lengthy,
but lightly-reported story published 10 days ago. The Herald
claimed two of the biggest beneficiaries of some of the bogus bouts
have been George Foreman and Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch, two of the
game's most popular heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   _Three _ Mike Tyson _ once the highest paid figure in sports _
has been urged by the Nevada State Athletic Commission to take his
foul act out of Vegas for a while. The champ turned chomp has worn
out his welcome after yet another of his fights _ his
hit-after-the-bell stoppage of Orlin Norris _ ended in no-contest
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   _Four _ Saturday night's riotous ending to heavyweight Oleg
Masakev's stunning eighth-round knockout of Hasim Rahman, who was
belted through the ropes in Atlantic City, onto the scorer's table
and then bounced off the floor. Instantly, someone threw a chair at
the ring and soon up 70 people were brawling with security guards
and other fans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Five _ The riot in the crowded MGM casino after Tyson was
stopped by Holyfield two years ago. Gaming tables were robbed,
employees said gunshots were fired, patrons were trampled and the
mammoth resort, as well as parts of the Vegas Strip, was shut down
for a few hours as order was restored.
</P>
<P>
   _Six _ The Fight of the Millennium match-up between Oscar De La
Hoya and Felix Trinidad _ considered two of the three best
pound-for-pound fighters in the game _ was so self-deflating, it
wasn't even the best fight on the card that Vegas night two months
ago. De La Hoya, who sas dominant early, did nothing the last three
rounds, Trinidad was lackluster the entire fight and the judges _
who gave Trinidad the controversial decision _ again seemed inept.
</P>
<P>
   _Seven _ Prince Naseem Hamed, one of the flashiest boxers in the
game, turned into wrestling heel in his title fight with Cesar Soto
two weeks ago. After body slams, tackles and head butts, Hamed got
the decision, prompting Soto's promoter Bob Arum to say: ``You can
criticize Mike Tyson, but at least between bites, Tyson threw some
decent punches.''
</P>
<P>
   _Eight _ The emergence of bouts pitting women against
specially-picked men, a promotional practice as contrived as
Butterbean's success.
</P>
<P>
   _Nine _ The suspect scoring of the first Lewis-Holyfield bout at
Madison Square Garden last March that turned the Englishman's romp
into an unexplainable draw.
</P>
<P>
   ....Now, just before the 10-count is complete, the flattened
fight game has shown a flicker of life that could get it upright.
Hope, this week, comes on a one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Muhammad Ali Boxing Act _ the reform bill that's the
brainchild of Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Bryan (D-
Nev.) and has been retooled in the House of Representatives by
Rep., Mike Oxley (R-Ohio) _ is ready for a final decision in the
Senate and could land on President Bill Clinton's desk this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because of the urgency of the moment, Saturday night's
Lewis-Holyfield fight at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas is
almost more important for boxing to begin to right itself.
</P>
<P>
   Every one _ from the people paying $50 to watch fights on
Pay-Per-View at home to those shelling out up to $2,000 a seat to
watch this sold-out fight _ are fed up with getting played the
sucker time and again.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Holyfield and Lewis _ both of whom are making $15
million Saturday night _ must deliver the kind of spectacle that is
expected from a contest to unify the heavyweight title for the
first time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, for one, said that will happen. He sees a difference from
the first uninspired confrontation and this fight: ``The
difference? Holyfield's going down this time. I'm not saying I'm
going out there for the knocknut. I'll just let it come to me _ and
it will. It's time for Evander Holyfield to retire and I'm going to
make him retire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then hopefully after this fight, when I'm the undisputed
heavyweight champ of the world, I will be a great ambassador for
this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   And more than ever before, the sport needs one.

REDMOND HIT WHERE IT HURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LYNDA GOROV   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Tyler Oppenheim, a self-described computer whiz
at 16, has a theory about why the cineplex where he sells popcorn
was all but empty Friday night: Microsoft Corp. employees were too
stunned over the company being branded an evil empire to enjoy a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was packed for the early show, but then it just emptied
out,'' Oppenheim said. ``Three new movies were opening, but after
that it was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, Redmond had come roaring back to life. The Town
Center mall was crowded. A line snaked outside the movie theater.
Men and women competed on the Microsoft campus soccer field.
Traffic was stop-and-go as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city with more than 17,000 Microsoft employees, where
everyone has a friend or relative working for the software giant,
an undercurrent of disbelief threatened to ruin the weekend. No one
could quite believe that a federal judge had declared Microsoft a
monopoly that used its power to reduce competition, sabotage
innovation, and harm consumers _ accusations that the people who
develop software, design graphics, and stand to become millionaires
at Microsoft called unfounded and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came across looking like big ogres, but you work there
every day and you see it's not like that,'' said Fabio Yeon, a
24-year-old software developer who joined Microsoft three years
ago. ``We're not the big bully. We don't win because we're so big.
We win because of our product and what we deliver to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee after employee displayed similar loyalty to Microsoft's
desktop computer operating systems and its challenging work
environment, although most refused to be identified. The company
asked them not to speak to the news media in the wake of Friday's
devastating ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the competitors that have sprung up in Redmond,
just northeast of Seattle, said they were surprised, confused, and
dismayed by the scope of the judge's condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say Microsoft is the best _ it's definitely not the
best _ but it saw the need, made the right product available, and
people bought it,'' said John Coyle, a software development manager
at another firm. ``I just can't understand it. How can you fault
somebody for being better at marketing?''
</P>
<P>
   The 207-page ruling issued by US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson is not a final ruling but a declaration that he believes
the Justice Department's version of events. Attorney General Janet
Reno hailed the ruling as ``a great day for American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the historic antitrust case is far from over. A
settlement could yet be reached, although Microsoft spokesman Jim
Cullinan said the company stands by the core defense. Either side
could appeal the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who
``respectfully'' disagreed with the judge's decision, told
employees in a companywide e-mail that it's business as usual. The
average age of emplyees at Microsoft is 34.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `OK, don't worry, our legal team is handling this, go
back to what you do best. We don't believe this is a disruption to
our day-to-day operations or to what you do,' '' said Cullinan, who
lived out of a Washington, D.C., hotel during the trial, which
began in October 1998. ``We know if we don't keep working hard and
stay focused we may miss the paradigm shift in where this industry
is going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Those constant shifts _ a product is hot one minute, outdated
the next _ were frequently cited as evidence that no one can
monopolize the computer industry. Competition, Microsoft supporters
in Redmond said, comes from every corner. At Borders Books &AMP; Music,
a software engineer who is working on a top-secret new product for
Microsoft underscored that point by gesturing toward shelves of
computer books, many of them touting software offered by
competitors of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous competition out there, and we're losing on
a number of fronts,'' said the engineer, 25. ``I remember three
years ago we were losing the so-called browser battle. People take
it for granted today that we're number one, but an awful lot of
hard work went into making that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jim Francis, 36, a former software developer whose stock
options enabled him to retire in March after eight years with
Microsoft: ``You have to go out of your way to make Microsoft into
a monopoly. You have to ignore everybody else. Obviously, this
judge doesn't feel obligated to give Microsoft a break on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few can believe Microsoft won't triumph, even if many
conceded that Microsoft bungled much of its presentation before the
court. They can't believe the company could ever be forced to break
up along the lines of AT&AMP;T or Standard Oil. Some are so confident
that they say they haven't even bothered to follow the case closely
_ a difficult indifference in a region where every twist has been
front-page news and thousands are counting on Microsoft stock for
their children's college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I work with are more interested in getting the job
done than in politics,'' said a graphic artist who has been
designing computer games for Microsoft for 10 months. ``It's all
geeks, and that's what we care about. I heard about (the decision)
in the hallway and most of us treated it with a certain amount of
scorn. No one's taking it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   That casualness, however, does not extend to elected officials.
From the governor on down, they have rushed to Microsoft's defense.
After all, they have come to rely on the taxes Microsoft pays as
much as local charities have come to rely on donations from Gates
and his employees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boeing Corp.'s longtime presence in greater Seattle,
many described Redmond as rural before Microsoft set up shop in
1975. Net revenues for the fiscal year ending June 1999 reached
almost $20 billion; net income exceeded $7.7 billion. Microsoft
will match up to $12,000 a year in employee gifts, whether in the
form of computer software or cash. This year's in-house fund drive
raised more than $17 million, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, Microsoft is a good neighbor, although I don't
like what it's done to the local real estate market,'' said Redmond
native Shaun Whiteman, a Chrysler Corp. manager who's hoping his
Microsoft stock doesn't plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrew Bjorn, who lives on nearby Mercer Island and works
as a construction cost estimator: ``Microsoft is our economy. It's
our area. Lots of us work for Microsoft or know people who do. It's
only natural that we'd want it to go in there favor. No one would
be happy to see them hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say that no one, not even the mighty Microsoft,
could dampen the competitiveness of the computer market. As Tim
Donovan, who works on Microft products at another software company,
put it, new technologies hit the market daily. But, he added, there
might be more if Microsoft was not so dominant. Then again, he only
moved to Redmond from Houston a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't say this, but I take a little bit of
satisfaction in the decision,'' Donovan said. ``They're just so
huge. It's kind of like, `Ha. Just because you're that big you
can't rule the world.' ''

MICROSOFT TACTICS LEFT LOTUS, IBM OUT IN THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It began as a hostile takeover. But when IBM Corp. struck a deal
to acquire Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, many in the computer
industry saw a potentially rich and profitable marriage ahead. IBM
had the deep pockets to continue expanding Lotus' flagship Notes
software for helping business groups work together efficiently. And
the deal might even mean a revival of the Cambridge, Mass.
company's moribund office-software business, with IBM driving
additional sales of Lotus SmartSuite.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no joy 3,000 miles away, at the Redmond, Wash.
headquarters of Microsoft Corp. Microsoft had its eye on the
groupware market too; knocking off Lotus Notes would now be much
tougher with the power of IBM behind the product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was a new threat from Lotus' SmartSuite. The
high-quality set of office software programs had never posed much
of a problem for Microsoft's dominant Office suite. But IBM could
change that. IBM produced millions of desktop computers each year,
and it could easily grow the market for SmartSuite by including a
copy of the program on many of those machines.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the view of US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, Microsoft decided to strike. In last week's findings of
fact in the Microsoft antitrust case, Jackson found that
``Microsoft consistently pressured IBM to reduce its support for
software products that competed with Microsoft's offerings, and it
used its monopoly power in the market for . . . operating systems
to punish IBM for its refusal to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   When IBM insisted on distributing SmartSuite, Jackson found,
Microsoft withheld its new Windows 95 software from IBM until 15
minutes before the product's official release. Other, more
compliant manufacturers had gotten the software weeks earlier, so
they could begin building computers around it. The delay cost IBM
millions in lost sales. And for years thereafter, Microsoft charged
IBM a higher price for its Windows software than the amount paid by
other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, Lotus and Microsoft executives all declined to comment on
the findings, but the episode illustrates the range of tactics
that, in Judge Jackson's view, Microsoft was willing to use to
perpetuate its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   IBM wasn't the only company to feel Microsoft's wrath. The
antitrust case grew out of claims that Microsoft gave away its
Internet Explorer browser, and later incorporated it into the
Windows operating system, in order to crush a competing product
made by Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As the US Justice Department investigated further, it uncovered
more stories of sharp practices, and incorporated them into their
case. Justice Department lawyers say that Microsoft threatened to
stop making Microsoft Office for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh
unless Apple made the Internet Explorer its preferred browser. They
say the company persuaded Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of
computer chips, to abandon a new chip design that might have
undercut Windows. And they say that Microsoft threatened to
withhold access to Windows 95 from Compaq Computer Corp., one of
the world's largest PC makers, unless Compaq configured the desktop
of their computers in accord with Microsoft's specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson sided almost entirely with the Justice Department.
``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others,'' he wrote, ``Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use
its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm
that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify
competition against one of Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus chief technology officer John Landry says that Microsoft's
unfair dealings began long before the IBM acquisition. By that
time, Lotus had already lost its long-standing dominance in the
market for spreadsheet software, and has been playing catch-up in
the office suite market ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, says Landry, was a Microsoft tactic he calls ``a
head fake,'' similar to the way a football quarterback glances in
one direction, only to throw in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, now an IBM Corp. vice president and chairman of the
internet startup AnyDay.com, said the head fake persuaded Lotus to
focus on making a new version of 1-2-3 for OS/2, an operating
system jointly developed by Microsoft and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   According to Landry, Microsoft's intent was to distract its
competitors while it focused on Windows, an operating system that
belonged to Microsoft alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a situation where Gates had publicly announced to that
world that he and IBM were going to build a new operating system
called OS/2,'' said Landry. ``That was one of the most duplicitous
statements that ever emanated from a company known for them.
Because of it, they had all their competition writing software for
the operating system they knew wasn't going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus devoted most of its development effort to the creation of
a version of 1-2-3 that would run on OS/2. But by May 1990 Windows
3.0 was ready, and became a major success. By year's end, Microsoft
announced an end to its OS/2 partnership with IBM. OS/2 became
IBM's sole property, but despite a huge marketing campaign, the
product was a flop.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1991, Microsoft began offering the Excel spreadsheet
for Windows 3.0. The product was an immediate success, taking vast
amounts of business from 1-2-3. Only in late 1991 did Lotus finally
bring out a Windows version of 1-2-3. But by then the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a brilliant strategic move,'' Landry admits,
``and it took real kahunas to do it.'' But at the heart of
Microsoft's success, he believes, was a deliberate strategy to
deceive other software makers into focusing on the OS/2 market,
instead of writing programs for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's head fake story doesn't figure in Jackson's scathing
decision, and a former colleague of Landry's says that Microsoft
did nothing wrong in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ingari, president of Wheelhouse, an Internet marketing
firm in Burlington, Mass., ran Lotus' spreadsheet business from
1987 to 1990, when he was put in charge of worldwide marketing. ``I
have never put much stock in the head fake,'' said Ingari. ``You
had to be asleep in 1988 not to know that Microsoft was focused on
Windows 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, stories like Landry's about real or alleged
double-dealing by Microsoft are legion in the computer industry.
Many of the examples cited in Jackson's decision have been
circulating for years. IBM's troubles with Microsoft following the
Lotus acquisition are among the most significant examples cited by
Jackson because they suggest Microsoft was powerful enough to
intimidate the world's largest computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson said in his decision, IBM could resolve its problems
with Microsoft only ``by de-emphasizing those products of its own
that competed with Microsoft and instead promoting Microsoft's
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, meanwhile, under its current CEO Jeff Papows, has been
careful to avoid direct confrontations with Microsoft. But last
year, Papows testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
saying that Microsoft's inclusion of its Outlook Express electronic
mail program with the Windows 98 operating system gives Microsoft
an unfair advantage over Lotus' flagship messaging program Notes.
Papows also said that Microsoft was trying to stifle Lotus
SmartSuite by threatening to raise the price of Windows to computer
firms that included SmartSuite on their machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is absolutely clear,'' Papows told the comittiee.
``If we don't deal with it now, we're going to be dealing with a
single software company.''

MICROSOFT PROSECUTORS SEEK END OF OPERATING-SYSTEMS MONOPOLY AS 
REMEDY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state and federal officials prosecuting the
Microsoft antitrust case now say that their goal in any settlement,
or court-imposed remedy, will be to break Microsoft's monopoly in
personal computer operating systems, or limit the power to wield
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officials and state attorneys general
have not decided how that should be done. Several proposals are on
the table, ranging from forcing Microsoft to publish the
proprietary code for Windows so other companies could design
competing systems, to breaking up the company. And in the end, the
trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, would be the one to approve a
settlement or select a remedy, after receiving recommendations from
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But even before a final verdict, expected in February, the
plaintiffs have been emboldened by the judge's findings on Friday
that Microsoft had used its operating-system monopoly to stifle
innovation, reduce competition and harm consumers. The officials
say their goal is to create competition in the operating-system
market _ or to put severe limits on Microsoft's ability to exercise
monopoly power with its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a position to get a rather dramatic remedy,''
Elliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, the lead
plaintiff of the 19 states in the case, said Tuesday. ``And it's an
overwhelming opinion now that it has to address their monopoly in
operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   An operating system is a sequence of programming codes that
gives a computer information about its various parts and the
auxiliary devices connected to it, like keyboards, monitors and
printers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months since the Justice Department and the states
filed suit against Microsoft, much of the discussion about the case
has involved Web browsers and Microsoft's decision to build one
into Windows. But Jackson's findings of fact made explicit what had
been implicit before: The case is really about the operating-system
monopoly and Microsoft's use of its monopoly power to promote other
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this case, we had nowhere near as specific and
clear an idea how serious and far reaching the evidence of this
abuse of their monopoly would be,'' said Richard Blumenthal,
attorney general of Connecticut. ``The case showed that Microsoft's
abuse of its power in the operating-system market is endemic to its
conduct, and any remedy has to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   James Doyle, the attorney general of Wisconsin, agreed, saying,
``Any remedy has to talk about the operating system monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-eminent among the judge's findings was Microsoft's abuse of
its monopoly power, a finding that swept some of the softer
remedies _ like forcing it to revise some of its contract
agreements with other companies _ out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge released his preliminary verdict last Friday,
Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general who heads the antitrust
division, said that any settlement or remedy would have to ``fully
and properly address'' the problems cited by Jackson, though he has
not elaborated on how to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Friday, the state attorneys general seemed to be
taking a tougher line than the Justice Department. For months they
have called for a strong remedy that would restructure Microsoft or
its products, but were not necessarily focused on the operating
system. But now they are unified in the position that the problem
is the Windows monopoly, and they say the Justice Department has
joined them in that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's findings have moved the states from rabid hawks to
mainstream,'' said Wayne Klein, head of the antitrust division in
the Utah attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who stood on the podium with Attorney General Janet
Reno and Klein during a news conference on Friday, just after the
judge's findings were published, said Tuesday: ``I don't detect any
difference or divergence of viewpoint on remedies between the
states and the federal government. We are in total unanimity on how
to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe it is
premature for anyone to be talking about regulatory steps before
the court actually issues a ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California, said that
``the rigorous analysis'' of possible remedies ``is now just
beginning in a very serious way, by academics and experts, and we
will all want to review what they have to say before we go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One academic advising the states, Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor
at the University of Iowa College of Law, said: ``In my opinion, if
the findings show significant abuse of monopoly power, then the
appropriate remedy is to break up the monopoly _ not to hobble the
company or try to regulate it.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``breaking up'' a company is not such an extreme
concept for the federal government. Quite often recently, the
government has required companies to spin off divisions to win
approval for a merger or acquisition of another company. But
splitting up Microsoft is hardly the only proposal under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he believes it is possible to compel Microsoft to
live within the law with its current structure, even though he says
he worries about the effectiveness of agreements limited to
changing the company's conduct, like Microsoft's 1995 consent
decree with the Justice Department to end an earlier antitrust
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we could devise conduct guarantees that are
more enforceable than in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other attorneys general disagree, saying such guarantees
would not be effective. But among the conduct guarantees still
under discussion at state and federal levels are proposals that
would force Microsoft to charge every computer manufacturer the
same price for Windows, so the company could not impose higher
prices to punish competitors or those who do business with them.
Such a proposal would also have to include clear guidelines on what
Microsoft products and services it could build into Windows,
government officials say. But those ideas would require constant
regulatory scrutiny that many government officials oppose. The
Justice Department and the states have not said how they will come
to agreement on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   The government officials say four additional remedies are under
discussion, though each of them could be applied in a variety of
ways and might be combined with elements of others. Not
surprisingly Microsoft says it opposes all of them.
</P>
<P>
   One idea would be to force Microsoft to publish the secret,
proprietary source code that makes up the Windows operating system.
The goal would be to allow other developers to design competing
operating systems that are compatible with Windows and the many
thousands of software titles that are written for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when IBM was trying to sell OS/2, a
competing operating system, the company said it was stymied because
software companies were unwilling to rewrite their programs for
OS/2. And without access to the Windows source code, IBM could not
make OS/2 compatible with the existing library of programs written
for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea long favored by the states would be to force
Microsoft to auction the source code to Windows so that two or
three other companies could begin selling competing operating
systems. In that case, Hovenkamp noted, the newly competing
companies would have to set up a ``joint venture for compatibility
standards'' so that computers and software would work equally well
with each of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the officials are discussing two proposals for
breaking up the company. One would divide the company into several
equal parts; each new company would hold all of the software code
and intellectual property from all of Microsoft's products. But
after the breakup, all of the new companies would begin competing
with the others, immediately creating a competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A final alternative is that of breaking Microsoft into three
different companies. One would control the operating system; one
the applications programs, like Word and Excel, and the third would
control the Internet and related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this idea is that one company would still have
an operating system monopoly. And even if this company's business
were limited to selling operating systems, presumably it could
still bundle other products with the operating system _ the very
problem that spawned Microsoft's current problems with the
government. Monitoring that would also require continuing
government involvement, something no one in state or federal
governments want.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, should the judge find Microsoft guilty and impose a
remedy, the company will certainly appeal. But the plaintiffs _ the
state and federal governments _ also have the right to appeal,
should they be unhappy with the judge's decision.

FORMER HEAD OF NETSCAPE FEELS VINDICATED BY MICROSOFT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jim Barksdale's moment of vindication came this
past Friday while he was sitting in bumper-to- bumper traffic near
the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone was one of his public relations executives with
some interesting news for the 56-year-old former president of
Netscape Communications Corp. A federal judge had just ruled that
Microsoft Corp. was a monopoly determined to dominate the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies the judge said Microsoft had savaged was
Mountain View-based Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't sink in,'' said Barksdale in a telephone
interview Sunday. ``It took a few minutes to absorb what had
actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, in his ``findings of fact,'' showed that he believed
Barksdale and others who had testified against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, a former FedEx and AT&AMP;T executive, was the first
witness called to the stand during a yearlong trial to determine
whether Microsoft had used unfair and predatory practices to gain a
monopoly hold of the market for computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling is the first of a multistage determination of
Microsoft's legal liability and punishment, if any, for its
business actions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judge's ruling, Microsoft targeted Netscape
because it feared that Netscape's browser software, which debuted
in December 1994, would diminish a computer user's need for the
Microsoft Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   A browser lets computer users view and navigate the World Wide
Web. Netscape's software also was letting users surf the Web
independent of the computer operating system. An operating system,
or OS, is the basic software a computer needs to run other
programs. Microsoft's Windows is the OS on 95 percent of the
world's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wrote that Microsoft, fearing an erosion of its Windows
market, set out to destroy Netscape's market lead by bundling its
rival Internet Explorer browser with the Windows OS. Microsoft also
offered its software free to users.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, Jackson found, eroded Netscape's market share.
</P>
<P>
   That decline led to the company's sale to America Online earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   With its actions toward Netscape, Jackson wrote, ``Microsoft has
demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition against one of
Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to read those words,'' said Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape _ under the leadership of Barksdale, flamboyant tech
entrepreneur Jim Clark and boy computing wonder Marc Andreessen _
had ushered in the Internet age with its browser.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, just eight months after the software's
publication, Netscape kicked off a new financial era. Its shares,
priced at $28, peaked at $74.75 during the first day of trading,
pumping the market value of the 16-month-old company to $1 billion.
That launched a stampede of high-flying Internet stocks _ and the
start of the new digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really changed the world with that company,'' said
Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape had set a course that would put it squarely in the
path of the Microsoft juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   In late May 1995, according to Jackson's ruling, Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and chief executive officer _ and the world's
richest man _ sent out a company memo titled ``The Internet Tidal
Wave.'' That memo described Netscape as a new rival ``born'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was in direct conflict with Gates' testimony during the
trial, when he claimed he had been unaware of Netscape during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, Microsoft executives met with Barksdale and other
Netscape officials to try to determine if some accord could be
reached that would tie Netscape to Microsoft's Windows and let both
companies rule the emerging Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   That accord was never reached, wrote Jackson, because Microsoft
officials failed to get Netscape to commit to incorporating its
browser into the Windows OS.
</P>
<P>
   Gates _ labeling one executive ``naive'' for believing an accord
could be forged _ cut off negotiations and set out to wreck a
potential competitor by predatory pricing, bundling its own browser
with its Windows OS and requiring computer makers to install
Explorer at the exclusion of the Netscape software, the judge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale was accused by Microsoft lawyers of making up details
of those meetings after his testimony in a Washington, D.C.,
courtroom last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft lawyers said I was making all this up,''
recalled Barksdale. ``But I told them: `I was there, you
weren't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has contended that its Explorer dominance was based on
aggressive, but fair and legal, business tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, determined otherwise, saying that Microsoft's
actions ``hobbled'' innovation and were ``harmful'' to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The former Netscape president, who now heads the Barksdale
Group, an investment advisory firm, said he hopes Jackson's ruling
will put to rest a question that's been a favorite at Silicon
Valley cocktail parties: Was Netscape's slide due to misdirection
from company executives, or did the company fall victim to a
voracious monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vindication of what we've been saying,'' said
Barksdale. ``We did not fumble the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But that vindication doesn't seem to have totally soothed
Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shame what happened to our company,'' said Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real shame.''

MANY CONSUMERS DON'T AGREE WITH JUDGE'S FINDING AGAINST MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Justice Department and some in the technology
industry celebrated a federal judge's finding that Microsofthad
hurt consumers by abusing its Windows monopoly, Bob Mirell was
browsing the software aisles at CompUSA in midtown Manhattan
feeling decidedly unwounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why knock down a company that has a superior product?'' asked
Mirell, 52, who uses Microsoft's software at home and in his
printing business. ``If they've cornered the market, that's because
they're better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirell and his 8-year-old daughter, Jacqueline, were among many
software users interviewed around the country over the weekend who
voiced some apprehension, even downright distress, at the notion
that Microsoft would be punished for what Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson deemed its direct and indirect harm to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already hard enough getting everything to work
together,'' said Simon Smith, a department store salesman from
Queens. ``Maybe Microsoft set it up that way, but breaking up the
company would just make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 18-month antitrust battle against Microsoft, the
government introduced mountains of e-mail, documents and testimony
from business partners and competitors to show that the company had
a monopoly in computer operating systems and that it had illegally
leveraged that position to muscle its way into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   But proving that the software giant's tactics had resulted in
harm to consumers often seemed the fuzziest part of the case. Many
software users see one of the government's key complaints _
Microsoft's inclusion of a Web browser with Windows _ as a boon.
And unlike the century's first landmark antitrust trial, which
resulted in the breakup of Standard Oil, the government's case
against Microsoft was not fueled by a public outraged over rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   That may be in part because a relatively tiny portion of the
consuming public were Standard Oil shareholders in 1911. In 1999,
Microsoft is one of the nation's most widely held stocks, and for
many investors, the impact Jackson's findings could have on their
portfolio was of more concern than some nebulous notion of fair
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too dramatic here, but I think it's a
miscarriage of justice,'' said Chris Bauer, 30, a programming
consultant from Dorchester, Mass., who was shopping at Microcenter
in Cambridge, Mass. Bauer, whose Microsoft stock has appreciated
considerably in recent months, added, ``The computer business is
such that there's always going to be competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was unequivocal in his findings, stating that Microsoft
had created ``confusion and frustration for consumers'' by ensuring
that its own Web browser would be continuously activate in Windows
98 even when a consumer was running a competing browser. The judge
also found that Microsoft was harming consumers ``indirectly by
unjustifiably distorting competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people agreed with the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' said John Rockfellow, the director of the
Cancer Foundation in San Francisco, who was shopping on Saturday
for video games for his children at Good Guys, an electronics
store. He said he thought one result would be more competition
among operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Patrice Booker, 30, said she was glad to know that
the government might put controls on Microsoft, even though she
thought Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates was a genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I wanted to get into the computer business?'' wondered
Ms. Booker, who teaches English in Japan. ``If you limit the
ability for people to compete, it's no good for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users took particular relish in the judge's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so glad they finally got what's coming to them,'' said
Matt Fuller, 26, an Apple Macintosh devotee in Manhattan who said
he was forced to switch to a Windows-based machine two years ago
because the software he needed was not available on the Mac. ``It's
about time.''
</P>
<P>
   But a large contingent of those interviewed took a more
philosophical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft probably does have a monopoly, but I'm not going to
lose any sleep over it,'' said Mike Johnson, a federal government
employee who was shopping at Circuit City in Denver on Saturday
evening. ``I'm skeptical that the government's accomplishing
anything by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Chapman, a bond trader in Manhattan, figured he'd make
money on the situation no matter what. ``I don't care if they go up
or down,'' said Chapman, who said he planned to buy Microsoft stock
if it went down as expected on Monday. ``I also own some of their
competitors, like America Online, so either way it will work out.''

A TOP GOVERNMENT LAWYER PUTS A BREAKUP ON THE TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department's top antitrust enforcer said for the
first time on Sunday that a break-up of Microsoft Corp. was within
a range of remedies being considered in the government's antitrust
suit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, said on the ABC News program
``This Week'' that a wide range of remedies were being considered
in the wake of highly favorable court findings on Friday, and that
a break-up ``is in the range.'' But he cautioned that Justice
officials had not decided on any tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a lot of remedies, and it is premature for us
now to get ahead of the story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court on Friday
handed the Justice Department a huge victory in its antitrust
lawsuit, concluding that Microsoft had a monopoly in the
operating-system market and used it to bully competitors and stifle
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is Jackson's verdict, in which he will determine
whether the facts he set out in his findings violate antitrust
laws. If he rules against Microsoft early next year, as now seems
likely, the verdict will be followed immediately by hearings on
what remedies would be needed to ensure competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has vowed to appeal any unfavorable decision. Some
experts said they thought the harshness of the judge's findings
last week were intended to pressure Microsoft into a settlement,
and over the weekend both Justice Department and Microsoft
officials expressed some interest in settling.
</P>
<P>
   In a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post on Sunday,
presented as a letter ``to our customers, partners and
shareholders,'' Microsoft's co-founder and chairman, Bill Gates,
said, ``Microsoft is committed to resolving this matter in a fair
and responsible manner, while ensuring that the fundamental
principles of consumer choice and innovation are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if there is no settlement? After all, every
attempt to reach an agreement, both before the trial and in the
weeks after testimony concluded, came to nothing. Now, a settlement
would seem even less likely, given that Jackson's findings give the
Justice Department little incentive and Microsoft little room to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an eventual verdict in the government's favor, the case
will move to the remedies phase.
</P>
<P>
   On another Sunday talk show, CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Klein ruled
out financial penalties against Microsoft. ``We're concerned with
competition,'' he said. ``This is not a penal action.'' He added
that a proper remedy ``will make sure the market remains maximally
competitive so that consumers can have real choices and so that
everyone can innovate in this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers say it is far too early to talk about
remedies. ``After all, the court still hasn't drawn any legal
conclusions,'' said Charles Rule, a Washington lawyer and Microsoft
adviser who held Klein's job at the Justice Department during the
Reagan and Bush administrations. ``Everybody gets way ahead of
themselves talking about remedies at this stage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The potential remedies that have been discussed by analysts and
Microsoft critics fall into two categories: ``behavioral'' changes
in the way the company interacts with customers and competitors,
and more sweeping ``structural'' changes to the corporation itself.
</P>
<P>
   The first route would basically compel the company to ``sin no
more.'' It could, for example, prohibit Microsoft's contracts with
computer manufacturers from requiring the purchase of other
Microsoft products. It could require the publishing of pricing
lists. It could require that Microsoft publish specifications for
the Windows application program interfaces, or APIs, the
operating-system code that rival software manufacturers must know
if their products are to run on Windows as well as Microsoft's
programs do.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department could also ask that Microsoft be
required to license the source code of its Windows operating-system
to competitors, effectively selling the code and the brand to the
highest bidders and creating instant competition in Microsoft's
monopoly market.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest remedy would be divestiture. One option could split
Microsoft into three companies _ one to produce the Windows
operating system, one to produce application software like Excel,
Powerpoint and Word, and one to run its Internet and multimedia
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Another break-up scenario would be the creation of a handful of
new companies that would each have proprietary information for
Windows and Microsoft's other software products. Starting on equal
footing, these ``Baby Bills'' _ a pun that combines Gates' first
name with ``Baby Bells,'' the local phone companies created by the
1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T _ would compete with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Each potential remedy has pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The behavioral changes could institute a regulatory-oversight
morass and, some fear, might not go far enough. Leaving the
operating-system business under one roof, critics say, might not
eliminate anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And licensing the source code to other companies _ or breaking
Microsoft into ``Baby Bills'' _ could lead to incompatible versions
of the operating system and other software, which would be a
nightmare for consumers and developers.

IN A WORLD OF CHIPS, A MAN FOR ALL MODEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation reacted with surprise upon learning late last month
that the Coca-Cola Co. has been testing a new kind of vending
machine that can be instructed to raise prices when the weather is
hot. But for companies like Eicon Technology, a Canadian maker of
wireless and cable modems that enable machines of all kinds to
follow orders, that was old news.
</P>
<P>
   Eicon paid just more than $6 million in January for a small
company called Trisignal that develops modems that can be worked
into an appliance's microprocessor, making it possible for a
machine in a remote location to respond to directives from someone
back at headquarters. For example, soft-drink vending machines
sitting in a patch of desert somewhere, or down at a mall, can be
reprogrammed or serviced based on reports they transmit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is that now, any appliance can have
communications,'' said Gad Elmoznino, the director of Eicon's
Trisignal division, which he founded with a friend in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to start your air conditioner before you get home
from the airport, you have to have a modem in it,'' Elmoznino said.
Telephones, toasters and other household products could use the
technology before long, as well, he added. ``The next step is to
increase the size of the pipe. We will go to higher-speed
protocols,'' he said, referring to faster transmission formats that
can pump more information through a wire or cable.
</P>
<P>
   The modems operate most inexpensively on wired networks but can
also be used with wireless systems, Elmoznino said. They are
programmed onto existing microchips for the most part, and should a
problem develop, they do not disable the entire processor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Brooks, an analyst with Aberdeen Group in Boston, said,
``The Trisignal acquisition really expands Eicon's reach from
computers into what I call device relationships.'' The devices
include the Casio Cassiopeia E-10, a hand-held organizer, and the
NEC Mobile Pro subnotebook.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major applications at the moment is the Sega
Dreamcast video-game console. About 2 million of the machines on
the market contain the Phantom embedded modem, developed by
Trisignal, Elmoznino said.
</P>
<P>
   The modem enables people to surf the Web on their television
screens, in addition to playing Sega Dreamcast games remotely with
other people.

   OFFICECLICK OFFERS AIDES A CLIQUE OF THEIR OWN
</P>
<P>
   Now that e-commerce companies are categorizing people every
conceivable way _ by sexual preference, foot size, lactose
intolerance _ and giving them a portal, it seems only right to
award a portal to administrative assistants.
</P>
<P>
   After all, administrative assistants _ a k a secretaries _
command about $200 billion in spending power in the workplace each
year. Executives of OfficeClick.com, a Web site that officially
opens Monday, say theirs is the first e-commerce site specifically
aimed at the estimated 10.5 million administrative assistants in
the United States, who procure goods on behalf of some 70 million
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That $200 billion figure certainly spoke to us pretty
powerfully,'' said Jamie Rapperport, OfficeClick's chief executive.
By comparison, other markets that dominate the e-commerce headlines
_ music ($15 billion), books ($20 billion) and even apparel ($125
billion) _ seem almost anemic.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into three categories: one for buying office
supplies and gifts, booking travel and arranging for corporate
services; one for coordinating tasks; and one for gathering
information, with news and tips on researching purchases and
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the information category, the site supports a bulletin board
and calendar program that can be coordinated among several workers
in an office. A secretary, for instance, could post an updated
meeting schedule on the site, along with comments about the meeting
agenda, for workers to check privately. Or, the secretary could
schedule reminders for birthdays, ``then have a link to an online
cake vendor right next to it,'' Rapperport said.
</P>
<P>
   For research, the site offers access to corporate annual reports
through Hoover's Online and breaking business news from Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Rapperport said OfficeClick would be free for users because it
earns money through advertising and revenue-sharing agreements with
vendors like Corporate Express, Staples and Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Some online diversions are also available on the site, in the
form of horoscopes and entertainment news, but notably, there are
no chat rooms. ``The whole idea,'' Rapperport said, ``is to make it
more work focused.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a forum section where secretaries can post
questions and exchange tips about the best places to eat, the best
health plans or proven methods for publicly embarrassing a boss.

ADVERTISING: MEDIA SERVICES FOR INTERNET COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It often seems these days as if dot-com companies are peddling
their wares by buying up every moment of commercial time and every
inch of advertising space everywhere from matchbooks to cyberspace
to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those purchases are usually the result of decisions
made by specialists in media planning and buying, who, despite
appearances, are trying to spend finite amounts of money as
efficiently and effectively as possible.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, one of the largest agencies devoted to media
services, Media Edge in New York, is forming a unit dedicated to
online media. The unit, Digital Edge, will focus on planning and
buying for Internet media, electronic commerce, fledgling
technologies like video on demand and the so-called convergence of
new and traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that there's so much going on here that we wanted
a group to concentrate on it as well as educate the rest of us
about it,'' said Beth Gordon, president of Media Edge, which is
part of Young &AMP; Rubicam, in an interview Monday. Details about the
formation of Digital Edge are to be announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Edge joins a growing list of operations specializing in
Internet media that are being set up by bigger media services
agencies to counter the competition from the new breed of Internet
agencies like Agency.com and Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, which was
spun off from True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in January, Starcom Worldwide, the media services
unit of the Leo Group in Chicago, opened Starcom IP to handle
online media planning and buying functions. (IP is from ``Internet
protocol''; the long strings of numbers known as Internet protocol
addresses are what enables computers to seek one another out.)
</P>
<P>
   Starcom IP is already ``becoming a global brand,'' said Wally
Petersen, a spokesman for Leo.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Edge, which like Media Edge will be based in New York,
is opening with a staff of 15, handling 13 accounts with billings
estimated at $30 million. Some clients like Gifts.com _ a new Web
site jointly owned by the Reader's Digest Association and Startek
Inc. _ are being transferred from Media Edge, which has worldwide
billings estimated at more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients like AT&AMP;T, with billings estimated at $10 million
to $15 million, and Wine.com, formerly Virtual Vineyards, are new.
AT&AMP;T had used Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in Norwalk, Conn., as its
interactive agency until July, when the Strategic Interactive Group
unit of Bronner.com in Boston was named to handle creative and
media duties in what was described as a mutual parting over
philosophical differences.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic Interactive will keep the AT&AMP;T Internet creative
assignment as the media duties shift to Digital Edge. Because Media
Edge is the agency of record for AT&AMP;T in traditional media, the
appointment of Digital Edge permits a closer integration of
interactive and mainstream campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The client roster for Digital Edge also includes Blink.com, a
bookmarking Web site; Celebrity Cruises, part of Royal Caribbean
Cruises; Ericsson, the cellular telephone company; interactive work
for Helzberg's Diamond Shops, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, and
Webstakes.com, a Web site that links consumers to promotional
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Three executives from Media Edge are being named to run Digital
Edge, reporting to Steve Lanzano, executive vice president at Media
Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the leadership is a troika, to use a term the Russian
digirati might, Ms. Gordon replied that ``because there's so much
to cover, it doesn't make sense to have a single leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Schanzer, 31, vice president and associate planning
director, will become vice president and managing director of
Digital Edge. David Adelman, 34, senior vice president and
technology director at Media Edge, will become senior vice
president and convergence media director at Digital Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What David will concentrate on,'' Ms. Gordon said, explaining
his title, ``is how TV and some combination of the Internet and
other media will ultimately converge.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Donnarumma, 28, vice president and associate technology
director at Media Edge, will become technology director at Digital
Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be looking into what systems do we need to run the media
operations of the future,'' Ms. Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like something for one of the ``In the Year 2000''
segments on ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''

WEB SITE PUBLISHERS AND AD AGENCIES SQUARE OFF ON CLICK DATA 
OWNERSHIP

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Internet, where information is king, some of the most
valuable information is data about user or customer behavior. Of
this, one of the most closely followed measurements is so-called
``click data,'' which focuses on who has clicked on an advertising
banner or some other particular link. Web site publishers,
advertising agencies and companies who buy those ads have relied
heavily on that data to build their businesses, and until now they
have been generous about sharing it freely with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the Internet's biggest advertisers is raising the
question of whether that data belongs to anyone but the
advertisers, and the resulting debate could shape the future of the
advertiser-publisher relationship.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives within the Internet advertising
industry, IBM is testing new techniques of serving its ads to
Internet users in a way that prevents publishers from knowing who
clicked on IBM ads displayed on their Web sites. IBM, these
executives say, may then withhold the click data from publishers
unless they can be persuaded to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   An IBM official declined to comment about the proposed policy,
saying it was ``premature to speculate.'' Indeed, industry
executives said the company had merely floated the idea of claiming
ownership of click data. But the IBM talk has brought the issue of
data ownership to a head, and given new impetus to a debate that
has loomed as one of the most important facing the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg; and the bottom of that
iceberg is the issue of who owns the data,'' said Michael Donahue,
executive vice president of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies. ``The ad agencies don't want to be cut out, because they
want access to that data. The advertisers say, `It's my money, so
it's my data,' and the publishers say, `That ad is part of my
site's content, so it's my data.'''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of losing access to click data has sent a shiver
up the spines of Web site publishers, who rely on these statistics
to gauge the effectiveness of advertising and to gather information
about the buying interests of their users. That data is
tremendously valuable to publishers, who can command high
advertising fees for showing, for example, a mortgage company's ad
to someone who has recently clicked on an advertisement for a
realtor.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers also fear that if IBM assumes such a stance, other
advertisers will follow suit. Beyond IBM's considerable spending
power _ industry executives rank the company as one of the top
three advertisers on the Internet _ it has been influential in
shaping industry policies. IBM spearheaded an effort earlier this
year, for instance, to force Web site publishers to post privacy
statements or lose the company's advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Internet advertising executives cite two potential
justifications for withholding click data. For one thing, their
traditional relationship with print publishers and television and
radio networks suggests that the data belongs to advertisers. The
ad buyers generally do not share the results of advertising
campaigns with networks or print publishers when those media run
so-called direct response advertisements _ for example, a
commercial that invites viewers to call an 800 number to buy a
product.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers acknowledge that Internet publishers play a far more
active role in bringing qualified buyers to their doorstep than
other media. But they also make the point that the Internet
ultimately resembles the direct response model, so they could be
justified in handling the data in a similar manner.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal importance for some advertisers is the suspicion that
publishers and other companies that deliver ads are not above
selling click data to an advertiser's competitor. These companies
espouse a so-called Chinese wall policy dictating, for instance,
that publishers do not sell information about people who clicked on
one car company's ad banner to another car company. But industry
executives say that there are violations. ``I don't think it's
pervasive, but there are people doing it,'' said Kevin O'Conn
</P>
<P>
   Most other advertisers, of course, lack the technological
wherewithal to deliver their own ads or to otherwise separate
publishers from click data. But publishers fear other advertisers
could eventually deliver their ads in a manner similar to IBM's new
technique. Or, even if they lack the technical expertise to block
access, advertisers might seek either to contractually prevent
publishers from using that data or to force publishers to pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say that IBM is sensitive to concerns about
causing a ripple effect, having staked a good measure of its
business future on the growth of the e-commerce industry. But as
the company joins others in pouring millions of advertising dollars
into the Internet economy _ and as the value of customer data
continues to rise _ IBM may decide that now is the time to
establish a precedent on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vivienne Bechtold, director of interactive
marketing for Procter &AMP; Gamble, the issue could force advertisers
to re-evaluate the role of publishers in helping to build ad
campaigns. Ms. Bechtold, who is also a member of a coalition of
Internet advertising and publishing leaders known as the Future of
Advertising Stakeholders, or FAST, stressed that Procter &AMP; Gamble
had not determined its own position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why IBM would consider this stance,'' she
said. ``On the other hand, the dynamics of the Internet raise the
question: If we share the data, would advertisers benefit more from
that collective expertise than if we treated them in the
traditional, customer-supplier way?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she said, ``advertisers could adopt a hybrid
approach, where we choose to share with some, while with others, we
treat it in the traditional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other trends are complicating the matter, including the tendency
of advertisers to establish so-called ``pay for performance'' deals
with Web sites. In those agreements, a publisher's payment is often
based on the percentage of users who click on ad banners, so
advertisers would naturally disclose click data to publishers.
Other advertising deals remain on a ``CPM'' model, whereby
advertisers pay a set rate, typically in the $25 range, for every
thousand banners shown on a site. But about half of Internet
advertising deals are a combination of pay-for-performance and CPM,
so disputes over who owns the data could quickly muddy the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, meanwhile, are using so-called ``collaborative
filtering'' technology to aim ads at consumers on their sites _ and
can offer even more precise targets when they know what ads their
customers are clicking on. Indeed, according to Anil Singh, chief
sales and marketing officer for Yahoo: ``We can target clusters of
our audince that have a higher propensity to click on certain types
of offers. That's a great service for advertisers. If we were
unable to collect data in that effort, it would hurt the services
we could offer our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a growing number of advertisers are choosing
to deliver their ads through third-party servers like Doubleclick
and Flycast, which also rely extensively on click data. Those
companies have much at stake as well. ``Are we willing to step back
and not have access to the data?'' asked Doubleclick's O'Connor.
``I'm not so sure. It could very well not be a good thing for the
advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this issue is Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry group that represents
Internet publishers. LeFurgy, who is also the chairman of FAST,
said the advertising bureau and IBM were seeking common ground.
``They understand our position, we understand theirs,'' he said.
``But this is stuff that's not to be underestimated in terms of its
importance and implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet publishers, however, have little leverage in the
debate, in the view of Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester
Research. ``Advertisers are ultimately the source of all the money,
so they hold the trump card in this,'' Nail said. ``If they want to
do it, they can.''

ONLINE COMMERCE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO SQUANDER PUBLIC'S TRUST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If dot-com companies are really trying to inspire consumer
confidence as they embark upon what could well be their
make-or-break holiday season, they must be taking oxymoron pills.
Under the hot light of recent scrutiny, their increasingly
questionable business practices are becoming public, casting long
overdue doubt on the credibility of much of the commercial
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Internet allows people and companies to
misrepresent themselves with impunity is well known to online
veterans, who after years of sending and receiving April Fool's
gags and imitation news releases look askance at everything they
get online unless they can verify its source.
</P>
<P>
   But the juggernaut that is now the consumer Internet has foisted
an avalanche of half-truths, lies-by-omission and outright fraud on
a new, more naive online population. Unsophisticated Net users
rarely question who or what is operating behind their computer
screens and, thus, are far easier to snooker.
</P>
<P>
   Their complacency is not completely unwarranted. The Internet,
particularly the Web, looks a lot like a computer version of print
or broadcast media. But it is neither. As a rule, it has not
adopted the kinds of standards and practices that are assumed in
traditional media, where advertisements and paid announcements are
labeled and conflicts of interest are, at least in theory,
disclosed as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   These disclosures are what provide readers, listeners and
viewers of traditional media the context to judge what they read,
hear or see. But it is not incumbent upon today's commercial
Internet, either by tradition or law, to provide such context.
</P>
<P>
   The online credibility issue first made international news in
early 1999, when Amazon.com was called to task for accepting money
from publishers for its purportedly independent book reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more examples of online half-truths and lies have
come to light. Most recently, The New York Times and USA Today both
reported that a ``fashion photographer'' was starting an e-commerce
auction Web site, selling fashion models' eggs to would-be parents.
He is also, apparently, an established merchant in soft-core
pornography, a fact that came to light after the global publicity
the stories had generated.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, DrKoop.com, the Web site of the former surgeon
general, Dr. C. Everett Koop, was publicly embarrassed for taking
commissions on products and services sold through the site without
disclosing such financial arrangements. Changes were made on the
site in response to the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Less visible but just as pernicious are the growing number of
``comparison shopping'' sites for products on the Internet, sites
that do not disclose the methods by which their listings are
derived. Although some of these sites are supported solely by
advertising revenues, many listings are based on which companies
paid to be listed with them.
</P>
<P>
   Equally rankling are the portals and search engines that deliver
Web addresses, ostensibly in response to a consumer's query but in
reality based on paid key words. Advertisers buy key words from
portals to make it to the top of the search-results list _ the
functional equivalent of companies that name themselves
``AAAAAAAcme'' for telephone directories _ but portals rarely tell
their users of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to assume that there is an advertising influence
on almost all the content they see online,'' wrote the online
newsletter eMarketer in March 1999, shortly after the Amazon story
broke. ``For instance, here is what comes up on a search for
`digital camera' on Lycos: A (paid) banner for digital cameras; a
(paid) link to an online bookstore offering books on cameras; the
(unpaid) search result links.''
</P>
<P>
   This is business as usual to people who know how the industry
works, but not to consumers, as seen in the Federal Trade
Commission's struggle to investigate hundreds of claims of
fraudulent practices and sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the FTC held a workshop to educate online companies
about disclosure regulations and, in particular, to inform them
that existing consumer protection laws did in fact apply on the
Internet and to explain how the laws would be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies are doing a good job of disclosure and,
in fact, are using it as a selling point for their services. For
example, the online bill paying service Paymybills.com, makes
virtually all information about its service, its company, its
policies, partners and business practices available within two
clicks of its home page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of consumer trust,'' says John Tedesco,
the chief executive of Paymybills.com. ``We consider the language
on our site to be a legal contract with our customers. If it ever
leaked out that we didn't abide by our policies, it would destroy
our business. So we clearly disclose, and we hold by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with Amazon.com, which promised after its
paid-reviews debacle to make the company's policy more visible.
Amazon has buried its disclosure at the very bottom of its lengthy
``Site Guide'' page, beneath a link called ``Co-Op Disclosure'' _
not exactly a descriptive title, or the first place a consumer
might look for such information.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility of online information is a growing concern both
within and outside the industry. Several organizations _ including
the Internet Content Coalition, the Online Privacy Alliance and the
Pew Charitable Trusts (in which this writer participated) _ have
addressed credibility by producing advertising and privacy
guidelines and projects focused on disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Ziff-Davis founded an industry group called the
Council for Internet Commerce (www.commercestandard.com) to try to
improve the customer experience online by implementing standards
for disclosure of business practices.
</P>
<P>
   James Hake, founder and chairman of the project, said that the
level of agreement between the 200 companies that voted on the
first draft of the standard was ``so high that I need to go back
and make sure they really meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm afraid they might have been answering from the
point of view of what the consumer wants to hear, instead of what
they were actually willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But if today's practices continue for much longer _ or, as
eMarketer put it, if the question as to what's fact and what's for
sale is not made clear to consumers _ the use of the Net as a
commercial medium could drop precipitously as consumers realize
they are being gamed.
</P>
<P>
   If dot-coms think it is too much trouble to implement disclosure
practices, they will soon discover it is a lot more trouble to win
back consumer trust once it is lost.

REPUBLICANS PLAN TO OFFER ONLINE ACCESS FOR LOYALISTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to raise money, embrace supporters and bypass the
news media, the Republican National Committee plans to begin
offering subscriptions in January to a ``family friendly'' Internet
service that will deliver the party's messages directly to
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials say they plan to market Internet access to
registered Republicans, political donors and subscribers of
political publications _ a target audience of as many as 8 million
people. The program is to be announced Tuesday in Washington. Big
contributors will qualify for free subscriptions to the service,
while other supporters will pay the standard Internet access fee of
$19.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The party will receive a small portion of those monthly
subscription fees as donations. Party leaders will not say how much
they will take, but they say the greatest benefits of the plan will
be political. Unlike Web sites, which require some degree of active
effort before they are viewed, the Internet service allows the
party to send specific messages to supporters whenever they connect
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al Gore double-speaks on his record on the nuclear test
ban treaty, we'll get our response in their hands the same minute
as it reaches a state party chairman,'' said Larry Purpuro, deputy
chief of staff for the Republican committee and director of what is
called the e.GOP program.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Democrats are considering proposals from several
Internet companies to offer a dial-up service, Joe Andrew, national
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said such a service
would be ``a very minor part'' of the party's online strategy. The
Democrats, Andrew said, are more interested in building
``communities of interest'' online using tools like Web sites and
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said the strategy of offering Internet service was
``irrelevant but for the dollars'' and illustrated the Republicans'
approach to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need money, and they win by raising money,'' he said.
``We need people who believe in our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to the Republicans' Internet service, in addition to
instant access to the party's stance on current events, will
receive an e-mail address, GOPnet.com, that identifies their
political affiliation. They will also get to see where, as donors,
their money goes. Subscribers will receive previews of the party's
television advertisements and political mailings, and the chance to
participate in members-only political discussions online.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican service will be family friendly, Purpuro said,
because pornographic Internet material will be filtered.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a party-sponsored Internet service resolves a
troublesome issue for political parties in the Internet era. Party
officials have been concerned that their role as purveyors of
political information would be threatened in a world in which
everyone can be a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good example of a 19th-century institution trying to
adapt to a new battleground,'' said Bruce Bimber, director of the
Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Internet service corresponds with the Republican
Party's tradition of treating membership like a club, said Michael
Cornfield, a research professor at George Washington University who
studies online politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bid for parties to gain a part in people's lives the
way they did before the decline of the machines,'' Professor
Cornfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The major parties are joining more and more groups that are
establishing Internet services for their members. Banks, sports
teams and even the rock star David Bowie have set up ``affinity
services'' for their customers and fans. The AFL-CIO recently
introduced an Internet service for its members.
</P>
<P>
   The downside for groups that offer these services is that
consumers might blame the groups for technical problems, not the
Internet companies that run the machinery. The Republicans'
service, for example, will be run by Big Planet, a national
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have people saying, `I was using the Republicans'
service, and it wasn't any good,''' said Zia Daniell Wigder, an
analyst for Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm.
``The customers don't know who to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Political parties also face legal issues in providing Internet
service. Federal election laws impose limits on parties' roles in
promoting candidates. For example, a party can present information
about polls and newspaper editorials, but if party officials
explicitly direct the public to vote for or against a candidate,
the act counts as a campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet complicates the legal issues further. The Federal
Election Commission is currently dissecting a number of
Internet-related questions, including whether a link from one Web
site to a campaign site can count as a contribution. If such
practices do qualify as contributions, then the act of promoting a
candidate on the Internet service can be counted against how much
cash the party could give to a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also, under campaign finance bills currently moving through
Congress, raising money through subscriptions to an Internet
service could be banned altogether. Such funds qualify as ``soft
money,'' which would be prohibited under at least one bill awaiting
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like that happens, we'll have to go back to the
drawing board,'' said Thomas J. Josefiak, chief counsel for the
Republican National Committee. ``If the law changes, we have to
change everything.''

NEW AOL MESSENGER ALLOWS INTERNET TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instant Messenger on America Online allows users to type
messages to one another while on the AOL network. Using America
Online Instant Messenger, users who aren't on the AOL network can
send instant messages, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, AOL introduced a beta version of the AIM program: AIM
3.5. It is also known as AIM Talk. Using a microphone and headset,
users can talk back and forth just as they would if they were on
the telephone. The sounds won't be ``pin-drop clear,'' but not much
is lost in the Internet imitator of the telephone. Then again,
``Watson, come here, I need you'' sounded pretty scratchy in the
early days, too. Things will improve.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``talk'' box on this version allows users to control
volume. It also can send images, much in the same way that files
can be attached to e-mail. The image, however, opens automatically
on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL spokeswoman said the product is only in the beta stage
and _ depending on what problems are encountered and how the users
accept it _ may or may not wind up being an AOL offering in final
form. (Beta is the version of the program that has passed in-house
testing but hasn't been subjected to enough testing for final
distribution.)
</P>
<P>
   But if AOL doesn't offer it, it may not be long before it pops
up somewhere else in the competitive online world.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Talk beta site has been closed because the company
already has enough participants in the beta-testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Saitek Offers New Gamepad
</P>
<P>
   Saitek Corp. is mainly noted for its electronic chess games.
It's the company that produces Chess Academy, a stand-alone unit
that offers more than 10 hours of oral instructions on chess rules,
openings and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes computer game controllers, too. The
latest offering is the P120 Action Pad, a gameport device for
Windows-based computers. It's pretty simple in its operation. And
while there has been some criticism because it doesn't have bells
and whistles, it also doesn't have the price tag that comes with
them. The P120 costs about $10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   It is shaped like a bat (the kind that hangs from cave ceilings,
not the kind used in baseball) with a small pad that gives
eight-way direction on the pad's left face and four buttons on the
right face. Two trigger buttons are underneath, so the index
fingers fit comfortably over them when the pad is gripped.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-way pad has a place in its center to attach a
mini-joystick. The stick, about an inch or so high, can be stowed
in a small compartment in the controller's base.
</P>
<P>
   The game pad is easy enough to set up and calibrate and the
controls are adequate for many of the popular games on the market.
The little joystick lacks the grip found in a full-size one, but
then again, the $10-or-less price tag should provide some
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   There are no drivers for the device (so it must be programmed
through the Windows' gameport interface), but some are available
for downloading from the Saitek site (www.saitek.com) that allow
better operation of trigger controls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current sophisticated games require more buttons
than the P120 has available, but playing many point-and-shoot
games, football sims and other sports games not requiring
fighter-pilot controls, the P120 delivers a product with a bargain
price.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Internet2 steers toward innovation 
By Heather Cocks  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last month, almost 30 years to the day after
Stanford University first logged onto a revolutionary 50
kilobits-per-second computer network, a new generation of Stanford
researchers sent video clips across a connection that was 48,000
times faster.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford zapped a continuous 40-minute feed of high-definition
television footage to a wall-sized screen in Seattle, where a rapt
crowd of 800 university and corporate Internet experts watched a
crystal-clear, real-time broadcast unfettered by Internet traffic
jams.
</P>
<P>
   Except that the broadcast didn't come across the Internet as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   This clip zoomed across a superfast private network built for
the so-called Internet2 project, for which a group of universities
and technology companies are developing programs for the next wave
of bigger, better, faster Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AM radio is today's Internet, then the technologies and
applications Internet2 is focused on are like high-definition color
TV with stereo surround-sound,'' said Greg Wood of the nonprofit
University Corporation of Advanced Internet Development, an
umbrella group coordinating Internet2 members. ``It's not just
better or really good. It's a completely different means of
communicating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 12 meeting of the Internet2 minds underscored the
project's emphasis on multimedia, viewed as the most fertile ground
for growing today's commercial Internet into tomorrow's powerful
and highly interactive entertainment, social and educational
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The HDTV movie broadcast in Seattle was one of several
demonstrations showing just how fast the online future could be.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd watched a band of Native American dancers in Alaska
perform on a live high-definition broadcast. Later, a virtuoso in
Washington gave personalized instructions to a music student in
Oklahoma. In the finale, a dancer, a musician, a poet and an
artist, sitting in four corners of the country, created and
choreographed a production featuring performers in Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual elements were all finely articulated, and it was
all live over the Internet,'' said Martha Russell, who as assistant
dean of the College of Communication at the University of Texas at
Austin attended the Seattle summit. ``We're creating new technical
and social frontiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet2 began in 1996, when 34 universities sought National
Science Foundation grants to connect to a very high-speed backbone
network created by the government agency and MCI Communications
Corp., now MCI WorldCom Inc. The Internet's explosive commercial
growth made it impossible to test advanced applications, the
schools argued, because too many users and information transfers
kept clogging the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The group proposed a private network linking only member
institutions, guaranteeing easy access and maximum network speeds,
and also letting researchers test technologies without disrupting
the widely used commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tech business, it's a 'Field of Dreams' issue,'' said
Bill Bard, who helped UT connect to the Internet in 1972 and who is
now director of Academic Computing and Instructional Technology
Services at UT. ``We figure if we build one of these things, people
and applications will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation agreed, offering two-year,
$350,000 grants to entice other institutions to join the new
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Internet2 membership swelled to 163 universities _ 10
in Texas, including UT _ and 60 corporate sponsors, all donating
time, money and manpower in exchange for an all-access pass to a
limitless technological playground. Cisco Systems Inc., one of the
biggest contributors, has donated about $15 million to date in
routers, switches and software that help handle network traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications Inc. is helping solidify the foundation. In
March, the Denver-based company switched on a $500 million
high-speed backbone that will be the main coast-to-coast network
available to Internet2 universities.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's Abilene Network, named for the Kansas city at its
midpoint, is capable of moving 2.4 gigabits of data per second _
the fastest speed available today. Qwest donated Abilene to
Internet2 for five years. ``Internet2 is rapidly becoming a
catalyst for application development and progress with the
Internet,'' said Guy Cook, Qwest's vice-president of Internet
services. ``This gives us a unique, direct window on all the
emerging intellectual capital and research-and-development
activities happening in this realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a push for richer, more in-depth Web content,
researchers have used their high-bandwidth test-bed to toy with
three-dimensional graphics and imaging technology. From there, the
possibilities broaden to everything from collaborative surgery to
virtual-reality rooms evocative of science fiction novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're turning up the social volume, dealing with more
computer-mediated environments,'' Russell said. ``With the speed
and the capabilities technology will bring, the only limiting
factor may be human cognitive bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   STARTING GATE
</P>
<P>
   If the origins of Internet2 and its network sound familiar, it's
because a similar scenario played out three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the federally funded Advanced Research Projects Agency
created its namesake ARPAnet to test whether computers could
exchange information across a network. The 50 kilobit-per-second
ARPAnet linked four U.S. universities: Stanford, the University of
California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa
Barbara and the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ARPAnet spawned a series of coast-to-coast networks that
connected educational institutions and which later merged into the
present-day Internet. The ARPAnet spawned technological inventions
like e-mail in 1972 and the World Wide Web in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Internet is successful because it went through that
large-scale testing,'' Wood said. ``It proved these technologies
could be widely deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning potential profits, companies quickly came knocking.
In 1991, the National Science Foundation agreed to allow commercial
use of its network.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it left universities and other researchers without
a test network to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It posed the question, 'What happens to all the research we're
doing?''' Bard said. ``A lot of institutions still wanted to keep
up with the hunt for the next Killer App.''
</P>
<P>
   From similar thinking at universities around the country,
Internet2 was born.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for a minimum investment of $500,000 per year, member
universities connect to either the MCI network owned by the
National Science Foundation or the recently donated Qwest backbone.
</P>
<P>
   A juiced-up clone of its research-oriented predecessor, the fast
Internet2 network gives companies and universities the freedom to
test high-tech innovations such as Web-conferenced college classes
without sweating the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep it separate because commercial service
providers aren't interested in experimenting with new technology
that could cause hiccups in the system,'' said Michael Turzanski of
Cisco Systems Inc.'s Advanced Internet Initiatives department.
``This way, if it breaks down, it's not as much a crisis as if
America Online breaks down _ and if it breaks, it gives us
something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite origins that closely mirror today's Internet, insiders
say the apparent cyber-circle of life probably won't repeat itself.
With the commercial Internet thriving and maturing at its own pace
_ the pace of its users _ the Internet2 networks can likely stay
private and a few gigabits ahead of the mainstream Internet without
ever actually supplanting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years from now, there will be a whole new set of
challenges for us to focus on,'' Wood said. ``The point of
Internet2 is to commercialize our technologies, but not the network
itself so we can still use it to meet those challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   PIPE DREAMS
</P>
<P>
   But for the average user, Internet2 technologies are pipe dreams
until current Internet technology gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Some phone companies and service providers are taking big steps
toward beefing up available bandwidth. SBC Communications Corp. is
planning to spend $6 billion to upgrade its Asymmetrical Direct
Subscriber Lines, or ADSL, so that 80 percent of its customers can
get those always-on Internet connections. Offered at either 1.5 or
7 megabits-per-second, ADSL connections are competitive with Time
Warner Inc.'s cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic still poses problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene Network guarantees end-to-end performance, meaning
downloads are fast and uninterrupted regardless of how many users
log on at a given time. In the real Internet world, there are no
such promises.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Internet2 point out that technology developed on a
high-speed private network with limited users might not transfer
well onto the commercial Internet _ even if it gets bigger and
faster and better in the future. That's because the commercial
Internet as we know it isn't limited to just 163 schools, but to
millions of users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   So at least for now, some of the sexier Internet2 applications
might have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable and DSL are raising the bar, but that's not enough,''
said Turzanski of Cisco. ``The reality is that yes, we're going to
need a whole lot more bandwidth, and it's got to be more
intelligent bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is studying a solution involving smarter management of
network traffic, whereby anyone making high demands on the network
_ like downloading the HDTV clip _ could get extra bandwidth for a
set amount of time, borrowing from users simply surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Oregon used the recent Net Aid concert to test
another technique for cutting traffic. Currently, servers respond
to requests for streaming video by sending one stream to each user
across the national network, creating huge traffic jams like the
one that last year stalled a live Victoria's Secret online fashion
show.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Oregon Internet2 team multicast Net Aid footage. It
sent one copy across the national network, and routers at each
member school knew to capture and copy the feed based on the number
of local users who wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who wanted a copy got one,'' he said. ``We could do
it over Abilene, but we can't do it with regular Net Aid servers
because all the networks in between aren't enabled. It would have
crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave new world
</P>
<P>
   When broadband connections catch on, the first Internet2
technology that becomes available will likely be multimedia
megaprograms that create interactive social situations from
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   That could carry with it a new set of interpersonal challenges,
as future generations inherit a medium that can build relationships
by giving voices and real-time conversations to e-mail pen-pals,
according to Russell of the UT College of Communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phenomenal opportunity for work groups to
collaborate across space and time,'' Russell said. ``But people are
hard-wired to communicate with other people, so the software and
hardware has to make things conducive to the trust and
understanding people need for collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell cited interactive distance-learning as one of the most
practical applications of high-bandwidth real-time Web conferencing
tested at the Seattle Internet2 member meeting. She also pointed to
social and political issues surrounding the definition of what's
public and what's private on an Internet that's no longer faceless
or anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   It could also introduce distance-based living, Russell said. For
families in which one or both parents travel frequently,
Web-enabled face-to-face interactions could shape the ways children
develop and maintain bonds with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers went a step further, theorizing that bandwidth
might one day transmit smell, touch, even taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so cool to get on the Internet and have the scent
of a pepperoni pizza delivered, or feel a brand-new leather
jacket,'' said Wood of the Internet2 research group. ``We can't
digitize that stuff now, but in the future, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the advanced, real-time applications
that researchers hope will be part of the Internet's future:
</P>
<P>
   _ Long-distance surgery. Specialists could watch and consult on
an operation across the Internet, advising the surgeons about
specific problems and reducing the need for on-site specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Real-time collaboration. Engineers and designers, working in
different cities, could tweak blueprints for things such as planes,
vehicles or even buildings. Scientists could watch each other's
experiments and share data, and doctors could transmit X-rays or
charts to each other for second and third opinions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teleimmersion. A person would walk into a small room right out
of `Star Trek,' don 3-D virtual reality goggles and communicate
with someone in the same type of room on the other side of the
world. This technology, on the high-end of Internet2 research, also
incorporates the sense of touch.

ONE-STOP CANDIDATE VIDEO SHOPPING DEBUTS ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the presidential election less than a year
off, an Internet site that provides equal video access to all the
2000 candidates went online Monday on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The new Internet site, freedomchannel.com, began webcasting as
President Clinton hosted a 90-minute virtual chat room,
inaugurating the first-ever presidential town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty pumped up about this,'' said Al From, executive
director of the Democratic Leadership Council, which co-sponsored
the event with Excite (at) Home, an online service provider. ``The
president sees this new technology as a highly effective way of
communicating with people,'' From added.
</P>
<P>
   From was interviewed at the media rollout of the new
not-for-profit political video site several hours before he
moderated the unique town hall cybermeeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bailey, one of the nonpartisan group's co-founders, said:
``This site offers voters the first-ever one-stop shop for the
video views of candidates and issue groups. ... It allows voters to
dial up the candidates they are interested in, on the issues they
care about, all at times of their own choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 12 years ago, Bailey, along with Roger Craver, the other
co-founder, also created the Hotline, a subscription-based briefing
service for political junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The videos-on-demand are being webcast on an ad-free web site
hosted by Yahoo!, a major Internet portal. In addition to Yahoo!,
several major foundations have agreed to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video-on-demand will change our culture, our entertainment,
our communications, our information _ and our politics,'' Bailey
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the change in our politics starts right here, right now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Users with access to older computers can access the data in
audio or in text form. By January, congressional and gubernatorial
candidates will also be online, with their full-frontal, 90-second
messages, along with a wide range of issue-orientated groups.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, was the only major candidate who had yet to submit
his 90-second video messages to the all-inclusive Web site. His
recent televised campaign ads were posted, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a challenger, this an opportunity. If you're the
front-runner, it's a risk,'' said Bailey, who was a well-known
figure in Republican presidential politics before embarking on
Hotline. He said he expected Bush to join up soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the video-on-demand site quickly elicited bipartisan
plaudits, Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute, sounded a note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well come a time when presidential candidates will
advertise exclusively on the Internet,'' Ornstein said. ``But we're
not there yet. Today, the broadcast networks remain by far the most
attractive option for candidates seeking to reach large numbers of
people with the messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, political operatives who spend much of their time
raising money to pay for political TV ads welcomed the site.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Joe Andrew said: ``This is big.
This is important, because it is not about raising money, it's
about raising interest. It's not about political contributions,
it's about political participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's views were largely echoed by Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Said
Davis:
</P>
<P>
   ``Several generations ago, people got their nearly all their
political information from pamphlets. Then along came newspapers
and, after that, they got it from radio and TV. Now we see more and
more voters getting their information online.''

Knowing how to narrow search important for finding Web data 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We're all searching for something. Unlike in the rest
of life, you're almost certain to find what you are searching for
on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the finding that is difficult on the Web. There your
problem is the enormous volume of references to your search topic
that are returned. Let's say that you just asked for information
about Brazil, since the family is considering a trip there.
</P>
<P>
   The information you need to make a decision on whether to go is
certainly in that long list of sites returned by your favorite
search engine. But along with that, you'll likely find dozens of
duplicated sites _ hits for pages that will tell you about Brazil
nuts and movies with Brazil in the title, and pages that have only
a one-sentence mention of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, today we'll talk about searching the Web and try to
come up with some ways to narrow your search.
</P>
<P>
   One problem you don't have is in finding a search engine. There
are the old reliables such as Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), Excite
(www.excite.com), Infoseek (www.infoseek.com), AltaVista
(www.altavista.com), and a relative newcomer, C/Net's Search.Com at
(search.cnet
</P>
<P>
   .com/). Then there are the sites that let you search using
several search engines at the same time. There's Dogpile at
(www.dogpile
</P>
<P>
   .com); there are pages such as the one at www.alpher.net.au
</P>
<P>
   /search.html that allow you to select the search engines you
want to use from a list, or the All-in-One Search Page at www
</P>
<P>
   .allonesearch.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll soon discover, if you are new to search engines, that
they are not all created equally. Search engines are like baseball
players; they're specialists that have different strengths and
weaknesses. Some search engines such as Yahoo are great for times
when you are using the Web to find something of general interest.
For instance, if you want to find out about a specific city, or
read the history of World War II, or learn more about Thomas
Edison, Yahoo is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be times when you have a really narrow search and
the topic isn't something as common or popular as the examples
above. Let's say that you are looking for an old friend named Bill
Husted. Bill isn't famous and is unlikely to have much written
about him.
</P>
<P>
   That's when AltaVista comes in handy. Since it (unlike Yahoo)
searches the text of the Web pages it returns, even a single
reference to Husted will be enough to get a hit. You can see why
the strength of AltaVista (the ability to scan every word) would be
a real liability if you were looking for information about Germany
in World War II. A broader search would give you a hit on each page
that mentioned those words. That's too much.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of too much, some search engines search only a portion
of the Web. The problem is that there are so many sites out there,
and many of them are not indexed by the major search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the problem of too muchness is what you may run into
on the multiple search engine sites. On the other hand, when you
are seeking hard-to-find information and don't mind the hassle of
getting some hits that are off-topic, the multiple search engines
(my favorite is Dogpile, mentioned above) can do a fine job.
</P>
<P>
   In the Web's early days, almost all search engines (there were
search engines used by researchers and academics that were notable
exceptions) were general purpose. Nowadays there's a trend toward
specialized search engines. Lycos, for instance, has a specialized
search engine at richmedia.lycos.com/ that will search out MP3
audio music, videos or electronic images.
</P>
<P>
   That's just an example since the Web is full of sites like that
these days. There are search engines specializing in finding
shareware (www.shareware
</P>
<P>
   .com); even for finding jokes (www.ezinecenter.com/Jokes
</P>
<P>
   andHumor/more2.html), and real estate listings (www.gts.com
</P>
<P>
   .tw/english/business/companies
</P>
<P>
   /real/).
</P>
<P>
   The secret is to first define your search and then to search for
a site that does the best job for that type of search.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The house in France that I live in was built in the 16th
century, and though I doubt any of the windowpanes are original,
some of them are quite old. People go all wavy as they pass my
office. Those vertical distortions in the panes remind me that
glass _ brittle, breakable glass _ is really a fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,''
says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide
in Australia. ``I was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a
class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me
the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you
can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think
that if it's a fluid, it flows. It's that notion that's false.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old
windows could not have flowed perceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of
truth _ and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite
unlike the three ordinary kinds.
</P>
<P>
   A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid
is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules
constantly dissolve and re-establish weak bonds; a solid is a
molecular army in rigid formation.
</P>
<P>
   But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid,
but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is
amorphous like a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid
and a glass. You form glass by ``supercooling'' a liquid below its
freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast
enough, the molecules can't organize themselves into crystals. As
the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the
molecules more sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Window glass is made mostly of sand _ with soda ash mixed in to
lower melting temperature and limestone to decrease solubility in
its final form _ but just about any liquid can be a glass if it is
cooled quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some liquids are easier to turn into glass than others, however.
The more viscous a liquid is at its freezing point, the more
trouble the molecules will have moving into crystalline formation,
and the more likely they are to end up a glass instead.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses are everywhere these days _ and yet researchers are
still arguing about their very nature. Is a glass simply a liquid
in solid clothing? Or, as chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of
Princeton University puts it, is the glass around us really a
``masked version of something more profound,'' something called an
ideal glass?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called ideal because no one has seen it,'' Debenedetti
says. But as a theoretical concept it might explain some of the
properties of real glass.
</P>
<P>
   Debenedetti says real glass is puzzling because both the
temperature at which it forms and its final properties depend on
the rate at which the liquid is cooled: ``In order to tell you that
water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or that it freezes at 32
degrees, I don't need to specify anything about the velocity of
heating or cooling. But the glass transition is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower you cool the melt, the lower the temperature at which
it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass cools, he removes it from the mold, scores it
lengthwise, reheats the glass and irons it into a single
18-by-25-inch pane. Each one contains air bubbles and large wavy
bands and sells for $27, because some people like the aesthetics of
old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, recalls Blenko's Lewis Powers, the company got
a large order for replacement panes from the White House: ``They
wanted the wavy look.''

it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass cools, he removes it from the mold, scores it
lengthwise, reheats the glass and irons it into a single
18-by-25-inch pane. Each one contains air bubbles and large wavy
bands and sells for $27, because some people like the aesthetics of
old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, recalls Blenko's Lewis Powers, the company got
a large order for replacement panes from the White House: ``They
wanted the wavy look.''

<P>
   Walk by Cynthia Breazeal's workbench in MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Lab, and you can't help but notice a hunk of aluminum
filled with silicon chips and electric motors, a machine purposely
shaped and sized like a human head.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what you can't help noticing is that it looks lonely.
Its eyebrows are heavy, its pink ears appear crestfallen. Its huge
baby-doll eyes are scanning the room, searching for someone.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that when Breazeal comes into the room and
sits down in front of her needy little robot named Kismet, its mood
begins to change. Looking straight into Kismet's eyes, Breazeal
offers a ``human face stimulus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's eyebrows go straight up, making its baby blues appear
even wider as it looks straight back at its creator with growing
interest. ``Mutual regard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kismet wiggles its ears up and down. ``Greeting behavior,''
Breazeal says.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's expressions alter into another state, the sort a parent
loves to evoke in a child. Happiness. Kismet is all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal, who created this creature, is not surprised:
``Happiness is the achievement of a desired stimulus,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask the question, Breazeal has the answer: ``The
behavior is not canned,'' she says. ``It is being computed and is
not a random thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Each interaction is different; each exchange has its own action
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seem to be some missing elements in this clever
personality. And Breazeal acknowledges that Kismet has not been
programmed for every emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she has been saving surprise for the day when she
installs the learning algorithms she is working on. Then learning
will become Kismet's desired stimulus; learning will make the robot
happy.
</P>
<P>
   As Kismet begins to learn, Breazeal says, it will slowly become
more socially sophisticated, like an infant becoming a small child.
That will bring Breazeal a lot closer to achieving her real goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' she says without hesitation, ``the ultimate milestone
is a robot that can be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Breazeal arrived at MIT in 1990 to begin working on her
master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science. She
didn't have a specific project in mind, only a general vision. She
knew she wanted to build a robot.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was fascinated by the robots being built by Rodney
Brooks, an MIT professor and innovator in artificial intelligence.
So she was elated when Brooks said he had one big project left in
him: an android inspired by Commander Data in the ``Star Trek'' TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided his masterwork _ a humanoid called Cog, for
``cognitive'' _ would be given human experiences and would learn
intelligence by interacting with the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the work began. Brooks' team built a body from the waist up.
He wrote a new computer language for programming it and designed a
new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal developed a stereo vision system. Another researcher
made a Ph.D. dissertation out of developing the robot's arms.
Breazeal and grad student Brian Scassellati worked on an attention
system, giving Cog the ability to distinguish between sound, color
and movement, and to orient itself toward a preferred source.
</P>
<P>
   They modeled the system on the Superior Colliculus, the part of
a vertebrate's brain that takes information from the senses, then
figures out where stimuli are coming from and which muscles to move
in response.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years Cog could make eye contact and move its head
to track a moving object. Then Cog could move like a human. Its
formidable but gentle arms could throw and catch a ball, play with
a Slinky, even listen to rock and roll and beat out a corresponding
rhythm on a snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Breazeal began studying the process of cognitive
development in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get interested in the idea that infants are the
simplest people. I wanted people to be able to naturally fall into
the mode of treating the robot as if it were an infant, to
naturally help the robot as much as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   And she began to think that the statuesque android was not right
somehow. ``Cog is 6-foot-5, with shoulders out to here,'' she says.
``Its face is way up there, you can't get close to it, and it has
no facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started thinking about building a separate robot platform
that focused on communication abilities that I cared about. I
wanted to have face-to-face exchange, with expressions and
eventually vocalization. That's when I started building Kismet, in
the summer of 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal took a spare Cog head and reengineered it, adding a
jaw. She got the eyes from a special-effects supplier in Los
Angeles. She set up small motors to move facial features _ eyebrows
that lift and arch, ears that lift and rotate, jaws that open and
close. A network of three integrated circuits control perception
and attention. Three more drive the facial motors, the motivational
system, and eye and neck motion.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal also had to write special software consisting of what
she calls ``drives'' and ``emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Drives are similar to needs, and there are three in Kismet. The
social drive becomes a need for people, the stimulation drive seeks
toys and other objects, and the fatigue drive creates a need for
sleep. Each drive has a normal position, a place it wants to be,
which Breazeal calls the ``homeostatic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   When unattended, the drives move into an understimulated regime,
so needs grow for social interaction and stimulation. Too much
activity and the drives drift into the overstimulated regime, and a
need grows for a break from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's emotions are not linear. They occupy a kind of
three-dimensional place Breazeal calls ``affect space.'' The
emotions break down into high and low values, positive and negative
states, open or closed positions, each conforming to research on
actual human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal says happiness, for example, is a ``positive state with
a neutral value and an open position.'' In human terms, free and
easy with no worries; life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is near the center of the homeostatic regime, a state
to which the robot aspires. The expression of interest is also
within the homeostatic regime. Calm is there too. Outside the
homeostatic regime lie other responses: sadness, boredom, fear,
disgust and anger.
</P>
<P>
   As drives move and shift and become satiated, other behaviors
rise and fall: ``engage toy,'' ``avoid toy'' and ``sleep.'' For
Kismet, the process of maintaining drives in the homeostatic regime
is never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing,'' Breazeal says matter-of-factly, ``is
putting humanity into the humanoid.''

 By ROBERT KUNZIG  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The house in France that I live in was built in the 16th
century, and though I doubt any of the windowpanes are original,
some of them are quite old. People go all wavy as they pass my
office. Those vertical distortions in the panes remind me that
glass _ brittle, breakable glass _ is really a fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,''
says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide
in Australia. ``I was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a
class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me
the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you
can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think
that if it's a fluid, it flows. It's that notion that's false.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old
windows could not have flowed perceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of
truth _ and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite
unlike the three ordinary kinds.
</P>
<P>
   A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid
is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules
constantly dissolve and re-establish weak bonds; a solid is a
molecular army in rigid formation.
</P>
<P>
   But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid,
but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is
amorphous like a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid
and a glass. You form glass by ``supercooling'' a liquid below its
freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast
enough, the molecules can't organize themselves into crystals. As
the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the
molecules more sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Window glass is made mostly of sand _ with soda ash mixed in to
lower melting temperature and limestone to decrease solubility in
its final form _ but just about any liquid can be a glass if it is
cooled quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some liquids are easier to turn into glass than others, however.
The more viscous a liquid is at its freezing point, the more
trouble the molecules will have moving into crystalline formation,
and the more likely they are to end up a glass instead.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses are everywhere these days _ and yet researchers are
still arguing about their very nature. Is a glass simply a liquid
in solid clothing? Or, as chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of
Princeton University puts it, is the glass around us really a
``masked version of something more profound,'' something called an
ideal glass?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called ideal because no one has seen it,'' Debenedetti
says. But as a theoretical concept it might explain some of the
properties of real glass.
</P>
<P>
   Debenedetti says real glass is puzzling because both the
temperature at which it forms and its final properties depend on
the rate at which the liquid is cooled: ``In order to tell you that
water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or that it freezes at 32
degrees, I don't need to specify anything about the velocity of
heating or cooling. But the glass transition is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower you cool the melt, the lower the temperature at which
it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass cools, he removes it from the mold, scores it
lengthwise, reheats the glass and irons it into a single
18-by-25-inch pane. Each one contains air bubbles and large wavy
bands and sells for $27, because some people like the aesthetics of
old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, recalls Blenko's Lewis Powers, the company got
a large order for replacement panes from the White House: ``They
wanted the wavy look.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The house in France that I live in was built in the 16th
century, and though I doubt any of the windowpanes are original,
some of them are quite old. People go all wavy as they pass my
office. Those vertical distortions in the panes remind me that
glass _ brittle, breakable glass _ is really a fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,''
says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide
in Australia. ``I was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a
class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me
the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you
can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think
that if it's a fluid, it flows. It's that notion that's false.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old
windows could not have flowed perceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of
truth _ and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite
unlike the three ordinary kinds.
</P>
<P>
   A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid
is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules
constantly dissolve and re-establish weak bonds; a solid is a
molecular army in rigid formation.
</P>
<P>
   But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid,
but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is
amorphous like a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid
and a glass. You form glass by ``supercooling'' a liquid below its
freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast
enough, the molecules can't organize themselves into crystals. As
the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the
molecules more sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Window glass is made mostly of sand _ with soda ash mixed in to
lower melting temperature and limestone to decrease solubility in
its final form _ but just about any liquid can be a glass if it is
cooled quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some liquids are easier to turn into glass than others, however.
The more viscous a liquid is at its freezing point, the more
trouble the molecules will have moving into crystalline formation,
and the more likely they are to end up a glass instead.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses are everywhere these days _ and yet researchers are
still arguing about their very nature. Is a glass simply a liquid
in solid clothing? Or, as chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of
Princeton University puts it, is the glass around us really a
``masked version of something more profound,'' something called an
ideal glass?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called ideal because no one has seen it,'' Debenedetti
says. But as a theoretical concept it might explain some of the
properties of real glass.
</P>
<P>
   Debenedetti says real glass is puzzling because both the
temperature at which it forms and its final properties depend on
the rate at which the liquid is cooled: ``In order to tell you that
water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or that it freezes at 32
degrees, I don't need to specify anything about the velocity of
heating or cooling. But the glass transition is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower you cool the melt, the lower the temperature at which
it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':

<P>
   Walk by Cynthia Breazeal's workbench in MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Lab, and you can't help but notice a hunk of aluminum
filled with silicon chips and electric motors, a machine purposely
shaped and sized like a human head.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what you can't help noticing is that it looks lonely.
Its eyebrows are heavy, its pink ears appear crestfallen. Its huge
baby-doll eyes are scanning the room, searching for someone.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that when Breazeal comes into the room and
sits down in front of her needy little robot named Kismet, its mood
begins to change. Looking straight into Kismet's eyes, Breazeal
offers a ``human face stimulus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's eyebrows go straight up, making its baby blues appear
even wider as it looks straight back at its creator with growing
interest. ``Mutual regard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kismet wiggles its ears up and down. ``Greeting behavior,''
Breazeal says.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's expressions alter into another state, the sort a parent
loves to evoke in a child. Happiness. Kismet is all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal, who created this creature, is not surprised:
``Happiness is the achievement of a desired stimulus,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask the question, Breazeal has the answer: ``The
behavior is not canned,'' she says. ``It is being computed and is
not a random thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Each interaction is different; each exchange has its own action
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seem to be some missing elements in this clever
personality. And Breazeal acknowledges that Kismet has not been
programmed for every emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she has been saving surprise for the day when she
installs the learning algorithms she is working on. Then learning
will become Kismet's desired stimulus; learning will make the robot
happy.
</P>
<P>
   As Kismet begins to learn, Breazeal says, it will slowly become
more socially sophisticated, like an infant becoming a small child.
That will bring Breazeal a lot closer to achieving her real goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' she says without hesitation, ``the ultimate milestone
is a robot that can be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Breazeal arrived at MIT in 1990 to begin working on her
master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science. She
didn't have a specific project in mind, only a general vision. She
knew she wanted to build a robot.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was fascinated by the robots being built by Rodney
Brooks, an MIT professor and innovator in artificial intelligence.
So she was elated when Brooks said he had one big project left in
him: an android inspired by Commander Data in the ``Star Trek'' TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided his masterwork _ a humanoid called Cog, for
``cognitive'' _ would be given human experiences and would learn
intelligence by interacting with the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the work began. Brooks' team built a body from the waist up.
He wrote a new computer language for programming it and designed a
new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal developed a stereo vision system. Another researcher
made a Ph.D. dissertation out of developing the robot's arms.
Breazeal and grad student Brian Scassellati worked on an attention
system, giving Cog the ability to distinguish between sound, color
and movement, and to orient itself toward a preferred source.
</P>
<P>
   They modeled the system on the Superior Colliculus, the part of
a vertebrate's brain that takes information from the senses, then
figures out where stimuli are coming from and which muscles to move
in response.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years Cog could make eye contact and move its head
to track a moving object. Then Cog could move like a human. Its
formidable but gentle arms could throw and catch a ball, play with
a Slinky, even listen to rock and roll and beat out a corresponding
rhythm on a snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Breazeal began studying the process of cognitive
development in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get interested in the idea that infants are the
simplest people. I wanted people to be able to naturally fall into
the mode of treating the robot as if it were an infant, to
naturally help the robot as much as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   And she began to think that the statuesque android was not right
somehow. ``Cog is 6-foot-5, with shoulders out to here,'' she says.
``Its face is way up there, you can't get close to it, and it has
no facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started thinking about building a separate robot platform
that focused on communication abilities that I cared about. I
wanted to have face-to-face exchange, with expressions and
eventually vocalization. That's when I started building Kismet, in
the summer of 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal took a spare Cog head and reengineered it, adding a
jaw. She got the eyes from a special-effects supplier in Los
Angeles. She set up small motors to move facial features _ eyebrows
that lift and arch, ears that lift and rotate, jaws that open and
close. A network of three integrated circuits control perception
and attention. Three more drive the facial motors, the motivational
system, and eye and neck motion.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal also had to write special software consisting of what
she calls ``drives'' and ``emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Drives are similar to needs, and there are three in Kismet. The
social drive becomes a need for people, the stimulation drive seeks
toys and other objects, and the fatigue drive creates a need for
sleep. Each drive has a normal position, a place it wants to be,
which Breazeal calls the ``homeostatic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   When unattended, the drives move into an understimulated regime,
so needs grow for social interaction and stimulation. Too much
activity and the drives drift into the overstimulated regime, and a
need grows for a break from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's emotions are not linear. They occupy a kind of
three-dimensional place Breazeal calls ``affect space.'' The
emotions break down into high and low values, positive and negative
states, open or closed positions, each conforming to research on
actual human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal says happiness, for example, is a ``positive state with
a neutral value and an open position.'' In human terms, free and
easy with no worries; life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is near the center of the homeostatic regime, a state
to which the robot aspires. The expression of interest is also
within the homeostatic regime. Calm is there too. Outside the
homeostatic regime lie other responses: sadness, boredom, fear,
disgust and anger.
</P>
<P>
   As drives move and shift and become satiated, other behaviors
rise and fall: ``engage toy,'' ``avoid toy'' and ``sleep.'' For
Kismet, the process of maintaining drives in the homeostatic regime
is never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing,'' Breazeal says matter-of-factly, ``is
putting humanity into the humanoid.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Already the master of the rope line and televised
town meeting, President Clinton took a technological leap into the
computer age Monday night by becoming the first president to
participate in a live Internet chat.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who describes himself as old-fashioned and
technologically challenged when it comes to computers, never
touched a keyboard or a mouse. He merely sat in front of a Toshiba
laptop on a stage at George Washington University and responded
verbally to questions sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks scrolled word for word across thousands of computer
screens, thanks to voice recognition software. The president
appeared in a tiny box, and could be seen putting his hand to his
chin, sipping from a soda can and looking amused at the entire
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like FDR's fireside chats and President Kennedy's live press
conferences, this first presidential town hall meeting on the
Internet taps the most modern technology for old-fashioned
communication between the American people and their president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a real town meeting, which allows back and forth between
the president and the audience, this one had plenty of stage
managing, with questions screened by the event's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was online but it wasn't a chat,'' said Mike Cornfield, a
professor at George Washington University who specializes in online
politics and watched the event from the audience. ``This could have
been a national conversation. Instead we had a bunch of politicians
telling us what they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the questions were softballs on health care, gun control
and other issues that Clinton has answered many times before. He
mixed serious policy answers with chuckles at occasional technical
glitches and some of the e-mail names of the questioners _ monikers
like T Love and Sissy Bill.
</P>
<P>
   A questioner using the name GBH1935 asked Clinton how people who
are not computer literate will be affected by the computer
revolution. The president spoke of the seriousness of the ``digital
divide'' between those connected to the Internet and those who are
unwired. Economic prospects for the poor would increase, Clinton
said, if ``we have the same density of computer and Internet access
that we have with telephone access.''
</P>
<P>
   Another questioner, Cynthia in Arizona, wondered whether Clinton
would stockpile food for the start of the new millennium if he were
a ``ordinary citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was no need for anybody to bunker down in
fear. ``The United States is doing fine and I wouldn't hoard food
and I wouldn't hide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's participation in the virtual town hall meeting
on Excite(AT)Home was another first in the rapidly changing world
of cyberspace, which has transformed entertainment, education and
commerce and is moving rapidly into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sitting president to do this is not only groundbreaking
but it shows how the Internet is becoming a fundamental tool in
politics,'' said Tom Hockaday, president of Campaign Solutions, a
concern based in Alexandria, Va., that helps candidates use the Web
to enhance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Web is already used by politicians to raise money, gather
volunteers and spread campaign themes to potential voters. Those in
the field envision a day when e-mail replaces 30-second television
advertisements and even voting takes place with the click of a
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the word telegenic to describe those skilled on
television and someday we're going to have a word for a politician
who is very good on the Net,'' said Cornfield, who heads an
Internet research organization called Democracy Online.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other celebrity chats, Clinton's event, limited to
50,000 participants, was modest indeed. Pop singer Britney Spears
drew a record 234,000 participants in her celebrity chat on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers for Clinton's town hall were about the same as those
for past Web chats with singers Michael Jackson and Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledges that he is better at talking Internet
policy than actually surfing the Net. Aides said that Clinton owns
a computer but does not use it on his desk in the Oval Office and
prefers to write notes longhand. ``He's definitely been on the
Internet,'' one aide said. ``He's sent e-mails but he basically is
from the era of the typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Clinton frequently mentions in speeches the need
to connect schools in poor neighborhoods to the Internet and
prepare for the next millennium with a technologically advanced
workforce. But Clinton has ceded technology to Vice President Al
Gore, who unlike his boss knows that spam is not a processed lunch
meat and that RAM is a computer storage device, not a horned
animal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who boasted in an interview that he helped invent the
Internet, held his first electronic town meeting in 1994 _ a
primitive event by today's standards that drew 900 people and was
held on a dinosaur of a computer, a Compaq 486. Midway through, the
transmission went haywire and ``Iba+iuXE ytoo'' appeared on Gore's
screen.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether history will make note of
Clinton's chat, perhaps alongside Woodrow Wilson's first formal
news conference, Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats and Dwight
D. Eisenhower's media briefings over that cutting-edge technology
called television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday this will look like the first flight at Kitty Hawk _
not too impressive, pretty crude, but it was the first,'' said
Craig Crawford, editor in chief of Hotline, the Web-based political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The event was as political and commercial as it was historic.
The idea was conceived at the Democratic Leadership Council, which
used the event to show off centrists it hoped would help fill
Clinton's shoes in the next century. Excite(AT)Home, the Internet
concern that provided the technology, saw the chat as a way to
publicize its Internet chat software.
</P>
<P>
   Participating from other sites across the country were Mayor Don
Cunningham of Bethlehem, Pa.; Mayor Ron Gonzales of San Jose,
Calif.; Assemblyman Antonio Riley of Wisconsin; Gov. Jeanne Shaheen
of New Hampshire; and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of
Maryland. Also involved in the chat were Al From, president of the
Democratic Leadership Council, who was the moderator, and Marc
Andreessen, the founder of Netscape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cunningham, who at 34 is one of the country's youngest mayors,
said he uses his computer every day, but understands why Clinton
may not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is in the same generation as my father, the
50-something baby boomers,'' Cunningham said in an interview.
``Some of them are into computers and some of them are not. My
father just got e-mail. But the world is changing and this event
shows that everyone has to get online, even the president.''

<P>
   Walk by Cynthia Breazeal's workbench in MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Lab, and you can't help but notice a hunk of aluminum
filled with silicon chips and electric motors, a machine purposely
shaped and sized like a human head.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what you can't help noticing is that it looks lonely.
Its eyebrows are heavy, its pink ears appear crestfallen. Its huge
baby-doll eyes are scanning the room, searching for someone.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that when Breazeal comes into the room and
sits down in front of her needy little robot named Kismet, its mood
begins to change. Looking straight into Kismet's eyes, Breazeal
offers a ``human face stimulus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's eyebrows go straight up, making its baby blues appear
even wider as it looks straight back at its creator with growing
interest. ``Mutual regard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kismet wiggles its ears up and down. ``Greeting behavior,''
Breazeal says.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's expressions alter into another state, the sort a parent
loves to evoke in a child. Happiness. Kismet is all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal, who created this creature, is not surprised:
``Happiness is the achievement of a desired stimulus,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask the question, Breazeal has the answer: ``The
behavior is not canned,'' she says. ``It is being computed and is
not a random thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Each interaction is different; each exchange has its own action
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seem to be some missing elements in this clever
personality. And Breazeal acknowledges that Kismet has not been
programmed for every emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she has been saving surprise for the day when she
installs the learning algorithms she is working on. Then learning
will become Kismet's desired stimulus; learning will make the robot
happy.
</P>
<P>
   As Kismet begins to learn, Breazeal says, it will slowly become
more socially sophisticated, like an infant becoming a small child.
That will bring Breazeal a lot closer to achieving her real goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' she says without hesitation, ``the ultimate milestone
is a robot that can be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Breazeal arrived at MIT in 1990 to begin working on her
master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science. She
didn't have a specific project in mind, only a general vision. She
knew she wanted to build a robot.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was fascinated by the robots being built by Rodney
Brooks, an MIT professor and innovator in artificial intelligence.
So she was elated when Brooks said he had one big project left in
him: an android inspired by Commander Data in the ``Star Trek'' TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided his masterwork _ a humanoid called Cog, for
``cognitive'' _ would be given human experiences and would learn
intelligence by interacting with the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the work began. Brooks' team built a body from the waist up.
He wrote a new computer language for programming it and designed a
new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal developed a stereo vision system. Another researcher
made a Ph.D. dissertation out of developing the robot's arms.
Breazeal and grad student Brian Scassellati worked on an attention
system, giving Cog the ability to distinguish between sound, color
and movement, and to orient itself toward a preferred source.
</P>
<P>
   They modeled the system on the Superior Colliculus, the part of
a vertebrate's brain that takes information from the senses, then
figures out where stimuli are coming from and which muscles to move
in response.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years Cog could make eye contact and move its head
to track a moving object. Then Cog could move like a human. Its
formidable but gentle arms could throw and catch a ball, play with
a Slinky, even listen to rock and roll and beat out a corresponding
rhythm on a snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Breazeal began studying the process of cognitive
development in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get interested in the idea that infants are the
simplest people. I wanted people to be able to naturally fall into
the mode of treating the robot as if it were an infant, to
naturally help the robot as much as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   And she began to think that the statuesque android was not right
somehow. ``Cog is 6-foot-5, with shoulders out to here,'' she says.
``Its face is way up there, you can't get close to it, and it has
no facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started thinking about building a separate robot platform
that focused on communication abilities that I cared about. I
wanted to have face-to-face exchange, with expressions and
eventually vocalization. That's when I started building Kismet, in
the summer of 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal took a spare Cog head and reengineered it, adding a
jaw. She got the eyes from a special-effects supplier in Los
Angeles. She set up small motors to move facial features _ eyebrows
that lift and arch, ears that lift and rotate, jaws that open and
close. A network of three integrated circuits control perception
and attention. Three more drive the facial motors, the motivational
system, and eye and neck motion.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal also had to write special software consisting of what
she calls ``drives'' and ``emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Drives are similar to needs, and there are three in Kismet. The
social drive becomes a need for people, the stimulation drive seeks
toys and other objects, and the fatigue drive creates a need for
sleep. Each drive has a normal position, a place it wants to be,
which Breazeal calls the ``homeostatic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   When unattended, the drives move into an understimulated regime,
so needs grow for social interaction and stimulation. Too much
activity and the drives drift into the overstimulated regime, and a
need grows for a break from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's emotions are not linear. They occupy a kind of
three-dimensional place Breazeal calls ``affect space.'' The
emotions break down into high and low values, positive and negative
states, open or closed positions, each conforming to research on
actual human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal says happiness, for example, is a ``positive state with
a neutral value and an open position.'' In human terms, free and
easy with no worries; life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is near the center of the homeostatic regime, a state
to which the robot aspires. The expression of interest is also
within the homeostatic regime. Calm is there too. Outside the
homeostatic regime lie other responses: sadness, boredom, fear,
disgust and anger.
</P>
<P>
   As drives move and shift and become satiated, other behaviors
rise and fall: ``engage toy,'' ``avoid toy'' and ``sleep.'' For
Kismet, the process of maintaining drives in the homeostatic regime
is never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing,'' Breazeal says matter-of-factly, ``is
putting humanity into the humanoid.''

IN ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE WEB, CAUTION REIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Regis and Kathie Lee, watch out. The hosts of a
new talk show are none other than the Lord and Satan themselves. In
``The God &AMP; Devil Show,'' they interview guests like John Wayne _
one needn't be alive to be a guest on this show _ and viewers then
vote whether to send the guest to heaven or hell.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which features cartoon characters with realistic
voices, is coming soon to a screen near you _ a computer screen. It
is scheduled to appear on Entertaindom.com, a Web site that the
Warner Bros. studio is expected to start this month as the
entertainment industry begins a bold attempt to turn the Internet
into its next big medium.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hollywood has used the Internet mainly to promote
films and television programs, rather than to transmit them.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of players, from big studios to small
entrepreneurs, are starting to provide entertainment on the Web,
either by delivering existing movies and television shows or by
creating programs specifically for online viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts could allow for development of new types of
interactive entertainment not possible on television and in movie
theaters and could give voice to artists not seen or heard through
those traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as different from television as television is from
radio,'' said Jim Banister, executive vice president of Warner
Bros. Online.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, formidable technical and business
challenges. With standard modems, it can take hours to download a
feature-length film onto a personal computer, and video usually
appears in a small box on the screen with blurry images that often
suddenly freeze.
</P>
<P>
   These problems will diminish as more people gain high-speed
access to the Internet, though it is not clear even then whether
people will want to watch shows at their desks rather than from the
sofa.
</P>
<P>
   And as happened when home video recording appeared on the scene,
much of Hollywood is wary of the new technology, considering it as
much a threat as an opportunity. Jack Valenti, the industry's chief
lobbyist, said in congressional testimony recently that piracy of
movies over the Internet could ``dwarf'' the existing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is that program creators can communicate
directly with audiences, bypassing the studios. Hollywood got a
taste of that when ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a low-budget movie
by unknown filmmakers, became a huge hit after an Internet
publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically your own TV station,'' said Joseph Shields,
38, of Grand Rapids, Mich., who failed as a comic-strip creator but
gained a cult following on the Web with his offbeat interactive
cartoons, like the one in which a foul-mouthed frog in a blender
taunts the viewer into grinding him up.
</P>
<P>
   Shields' cartoons, or word of them, have spread like wildfire
through e-mail, and his Web site, www.joecartoon.com, gets as many
as 500,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Bit players like Shields have led the way; a dozen or more Web
sites, for instance, already show movies by independent filmmakers
who have trouble getting their work into theaters. But now,
heavyweights are jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   America Online announced a $30 million investment last week in
the Web site of Blockbuster Inc., the video-rental unit of Viacom.
The investment is aimed in part at developing video for Internet
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   And Seagram Co., owner of Universal Studios, recently held a
meeting of 100 top executives to draw up plans for internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks SKG, the studio started by Steven Spielberg, said
last month that it would form a Web entertainment venture with
Imagine Entertainment, the production company started by Ron
Howard. The new company, Pop.com, is being financed initially by
$50 million from Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Dell Computer have invested in Digital
Entertainment Network, a start-up in Los Angeles that creates
original Web programs. WireBreak Entertainment, another such
start-up, counts Michael Jordan, the former chief executive of CBS,
among its backers. And Frank Biondi Jr., the former chief executive
of Universal Studios, has invested in such companies as Atomfilms
and SightSound.com, both of which offer movies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' Entertaindom, the biggest effort by a major
studio, will offer the studio's own Looney Tunes cartoons as well
as shows licensed from others, like ``The God &AMP; Devil Show'' from
Mondo Media of San Francisco. It will also draw on the magazines
and record company of its parent, Time Warner, to provide
entertainment information and to sell concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Moloshok, the president of Warner Bros. Online, said studios
need to become more active on the Web or lose out to Internet
start-ups. ``Hollywood has been hibernating in its cave for
years,'' he said. ``The Real Networks, the Yahoos have been
sneaking into our cave and stealing our food.''
</P>
<P>
   Record companies were caught flat-footed by the speed at which
the Internet began to be used to distribute music, legally and
illegally. Studios are owned by the same companies as the record
labels and should be preparing. But are they?
</P>
<P>
   Except for Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox, a unit of News
Corp., none of the Hollywood studios would talk about Internet
entertainment _ a sign, some industry executives say, that the
studios have not figured out what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the studios are taking the path of least resistance _ what
can we do that's not competitive with our existing business?'' said
David Wertheimer, chief executive of Wirebreak and former head of
the online activities of Paramount Pictures, which is owned by
Viacom. ``I think they'll be surprised at how big it becomes how
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that caution is justified. There have been several
failures in online entertainment, including early efforts by
Microsoft and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a big sinkhole,'' said Jake Winebaum, who once
ran the Internet operations of Walt Disney. ``I think there's going
to be a lot of money spent before the consumer is ready for it.''
Disney offers some entertainment for children on the Internet but
has pursued a broader Web strategy with a general portal and search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Studios also believe they can wait, because they have access to
the best talent. Few if any of the thousands of garage bands that
distribute their music over the Internet have become stars, posing
little competition for the major labels. And home-grown Web video
shows might become no more of a threat than the amateur programs on
public-access cable television.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As far as tapping a mass audience, it's going to be difficult
because it's pretty grungy stuff right now,'' said James Murdoch,
who is in charge of Internet operations for News Corp. and its Fox
studio. He and some other executives said that if good programs did
arise online, studios could buy them or their production companies
and even turn them into television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ABC uses the Web to provide statistics to go with
``Monday Night Football.'' Fox is looking at creating virtual
communities tied to shows like ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures is allowing users of Web TV, a device that brings
Web pages onto television sets, to play along with ``Jeopardy'' and
``Wheel of Fortune,'' two game shows it produces. It also offers
video games online. But executives at Sony, one of the few major
studios not affiliated with a television network, have indicated
that they are interested in the Internet for program distribution
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In that it is used for chatting, games and idle surfing, the Web
is already a big entertainment venue, though not for traditional
video and movies. Some analysts say the Web is best suited for such
interactive activities, rather than for transmitting shows that are
best seen on television or in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web entertainment sites try to provide some sense of
community by letting viewers comment on the show, chat with other
viewers or even influence the plot, however minimally.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether such active viewing can be as
engrossing as traditional entertainment, in which viewers suspend
their disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been no big hit show on the Internet that
defines the medium, in the way that Milton Berle's show did in
television's infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the made-for-the-Web shows now online are in short
``Webisodes,'' only a few minutes long, and many are cartoons.
Shorter programs are more tolerable with existing technology, and
animation can be transmitted with higher quality than video.
</P>
<P>
   But the brevity also reflects the way Web programs are being
viewed _ as a quick break for people working on their computers.
People describe Web entertainment as a ``lean-forward experience''
rather than the ``lean-back experience'' of watching television or
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to watch a half-hour of `Seinfeld' or an
hour-and-a-half movie on the PC in the office,'' said Johan
Liedgren, chief executive of Honkworm International, a Seattle
company whose Internet shows feature animated fish talking in a
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shows are sophomoric, if not downright demented, in
part because the Web has been a refuge for shows unsuitable for a
general television audience and because such fare is intended to
appeal to teen-age boys and young men. In addition to Shields' frog
cartoon, for example, there is ``The Peeper,'' a cartoon about a
peeping Tom, created by the comedian and actor Adam Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   One big question is whether any Web entertainment can make
money. Some sites are offering or planning to offer pay-per-view
movies or charge subscription fees. Program developers hope they
can syndicate their shows to other Web sites, such as portals and
e-commerce sites that might provide entertainment to lure
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most shows, including ``God &AMP; Devil,'' are being offered free
and their providers depend on advertising, but it is not clear
whether online shows can draw big enough audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Honkworm gets 500,000 viewers each month for all its shows
combined, while a television program can draw millions in a night.
The average film shown on Ifilm.com, a Web site offering free
independent films, draws 5,000 viewers, though some films can get
up to 50,000. SightSound.com, which charges a few dollars to Web
users to download movies, says its most popular title is ``rented''
60 times a month, less than a single video store can do.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Web programming is now made ``for people who live in
SoHo or Silicon Valley,'' the audience will broaden, said Moloshok
of Entertaindom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstreamers are coming online,'' he said. ``I don't want to
create the niche show. I want to create the `Seinfeld.'''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Health Web site alliance agrees on timetable 
By Andrew Park  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The coalition of leaders of top Internet health
sites assembled by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said this
week it had taken its first steps to address the lack of ethical
standards in the new industry and made plans for regular
discussions over the next five months.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of 16 companies, including WebMD Inc., Healtheon
Corp., Medscape Inc., America Online Inc. and Austin's drkoop.com
Inc., met this week and formed working groups that will create
policies for advertising, privacy and content. The small groups
will meet weekly and the entire coalition _ dubbed the Hi-Ethics
Alliance _ will meet once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to discuss the issues, but we didn't come up with
anything,'' said Donald Kemper, chief executive of Healthwise Inc.,
an Idaho nonprofit group that runs a health site. ``It's too early
to say what things will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders expect to release a set of ethical principles by the end
of March, Kemper said.
</P>
<P>
   Health sites around the country have taken heat in medical
circles for creating potential conflicts of interest, providing
inaccurate information and offering diagnoses and prescribing drugs
online.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, chairman of drkoop.com, called the company leaders
together last month, but he won't play an active role in the group
despite having drawn some of the harshest criticism for perceived
ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com, the most popular health site on the Internet, has
been judged as one of the most reliable, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, leaders of the American Medical Association
criticized Koop for not providing enough information about
sponsorship and commerce arrangements on the site, which derives
much of its revenue from advertising. Koop, who developed a
reputation as a tough public health advocate, was criticized last
week for telling Congress in March that medical latex gloves were
safe without disclosing that he had once been a paid consultant to
a major latex glove manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackett, drkoop.com's chief executive, represented the
company on the alliance and was tapped to head the advertising
group, which has already agreed that health sites should not accept
advertising from tobacco, alcoholic beverage or firearms companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals there are to ensure that we have very high standards
and principles regarding the separation between church and state,
between content and advertising,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear what impact the guidelines will have on the
estimated 15,000 health sites on the Internet, Kemper said he
believes they all could stand to raise their standards and solidify
their policies on ethics and credibility. For example, he would
like to see content on Healthwise.com include more detail on the
source of the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a shame that we didn't do this earlier so
people had clear guidelines as to what was appropriate and what was
not,'' Kemper said. ``Everybody's been working kind of blind as to
what standard operating procedure should be.''

Everybody has questions or answers on reformatting 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was on vacation when I engaged in the Herculean
struggles with my hard drive described in the past two reports, so
all the messages pointing out my blunder didn't reach me.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is good to be able to say that on the second
go-round, I did discover that it was unnecessary to install Windows
95 before installing 98.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers, however, had questions rather than advice, and
I'll try to answer some of them here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you reformat the hard drive by upgrading your BIOS with a
more current version known as BIOS flashing? Also, I'm going to buy
an Uninstall program from Norton that helps me find many of those
programs and files that get lost and need to be deleted to increase
hard drive space and performance.
</P>
<P>
   A: Formatting the hard drive has nothing to do with a BIOS
upgrade. Formatting the hard drive is accomplished using the FORMAT
command and simply wipes the drive clean, sort of like taking an
eraser to a blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   The program to which you refer is Norton's CleanSweep. Let me
suggest that you buy SystemWorks, which includes CleanSweep and a
lot more good stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the command used to format the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way I do it is to go to the DOS prompt and enter the
command ``format,'' followed by the drive designation, i.e.:
``format c:''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I also own a Compaq 7212 and made the set of system disks.
Will these 30 disks be all that I need to load Windows 95 on my new
computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I couldn't say without seeing what's on the disks, but I
would suggest staying entirely legal and much more modern by going
to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will formatting the hard drive cause me to lose DOS?
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about CMOS settings, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't worry about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote that you backed up your hard disk ``by a direct
connection via parallel port.'' How did you do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the communications section of the Windows 98 accessories,
there is a provision for setting up a direct cable connection to
another computer. I seem to remember it was available in 95, too,
but I'm not sure. If not, there are plenty of programs, such as
LapLink, that will do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what are ``registry files,'' and how can I find a
program that will copy and store them? Do you have one registry
file for your hard drive, or do you have one for each program on
the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is only one registry file, which contains critical
information about each program on the drive, and it basically
replaces the old WIN.INI file of Windows 3.x. Don't bother looking
for it with Explorer because it's invisible. Don't mess with it,
either. Norton SystemWorks not only contains a program for storing
copies of the Registry but one that will detect and correct simple
problems in it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your opinion, when performing a backup of the hard drive,
is it best to back up the entire drive, including program files, or
just the data files?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can reinstall the program files, but remember that you
want to save things like your browser bookmarks and your e-mail
address book. Otherwise you really need only back up your data
files.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I use the drag and drop technique to move some programs
from C: to D:, will they actually be physically moved so that they
will not be deleted on reformatting C:?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to verify the serial number of the Windows OS
I've loaded so I can ensure to use the proper CD for
reinstallation?
</P>
<P>
   A: What, you've got a collection of them? I can find no way to
figure out which one is installed, and I suspect that's the way
Microsoft wanted it.

Let your own needs, not price, rule your computer selection 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The newspapers are full of ads for computers that seem
to be priced impossibly low. I've seen new computers for $400 or
so, and prices around the $600 mark are common. Even fairly
powerful PCs are advertised right at the $1,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, however, and despite what you probably
think, the price for a computer hasn't really changed much over the
years. Now, before you start calling my boss demanding that I be
given a drug and sanity test, let me explain my theory on buying
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the most sense to me to buy a PC that is nearly at the
top of the pecking order when it comes to power and memory. You
tend to pay too much of a premium for the very fastest,
state-of-the-art computer. And computers at the other end of the
spectrum get outdated too quickly and also are unable to run all
the applications and games that you might choose.
</P>
<P>
   If you price this computer _ the one that is just one step below
the hottest machine out there _ my guess is that you'll pay
somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 if you get it and an excellent
monitor. That's the same price range that you'd have found five
years ago, or even 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the computer itself will be much more powerful than what you
would have gotten for the same amount of money even four months
ago. But that's always been true, too. If microwave ovens improved
in performance as fast as computers, your oven would not only cook
the food but it would tie a bib around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   But while the increase in performance is impressive, there are
other factors at work that tend to pull down the speed with which
you can perform any given task. So, it's also my contention that
the actual speed of computing _ if you measure it by how long it
takes you to perform a given task _ hasn't changed as drastically
as you think.
</P>
<P>
   As computers have grown more powerful, applications _ everything
from word processing programs to games _ have gotten fatter and
more complex. Years ago, back when the operating system for most
PCs was DOS, I used a text-based word processor called Xywrite. It
was so compact that the entire program fit on a floppy disk. And it
was faster than the word processor I use today. Surprisingly,
perhaps, it had all the features of the high-flying word processor
I use at home now _ spell checking, multiple windows, search and
replace, almost any feature you could want. And _ as is still true
today _ the word processor contributed little to the writing
process. (There have been several times when I wished I could blame
my prose or thoughts on a word processor, but that part of the
writing equation is my problem.)
</P>
<P>
   While I can't blame bad prose on a computer, I can tell you how
to weed through all the choices available today when it comes time
to buy a computer.
</P>
<P>
   First, decide what you need to do with the computer and buy one
powerful enough to accomplish that with a little reserve power left
over. If you design graphics or work with desktop publishing in a
serious way, you really may need a state-of-the-art computer. And
if you truly just want a computer to log on to the Internet and
write an occasional letter, an el cheapo computer may be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you are relatively inexperienced and would rate
yourself low on the knowledge scale when it comes to evaluating the
various components that make up a computer _ motherboard, hard
disk, video card, sound card and RAM chips _ stick with brand-name
machines and retailers whom you already know and trust. If, on the
other hand, you are competent to make a judgment on the type of
components used, feel free to investigate the small ``screwdriver''
shops that sell no-name computers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, make sure you buy slightly more computer than you need
today. It's a certainty that your computer will be outdated soon
enough, but there's no sense helping out by buying a marginal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, if it's the Web that intrigues you, keep in mind that
the speed there is dictated by the speed of your connection, much
more than the computer. So save pennies on the computer if you
must, but pop for the fastest connection you can get if your main
use is surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my guess: If you follow my advice and shop wisely, you'll
end up spending between $1,500 and $2,000

Surfing at work? Start here 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having Internet access at work is like having a
television on your desk, only cooler. The studies show that online
prime time for the Net is the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   People are online the most while they are at work. Checking
stock quotes. Reading movie reviews. Scanning NFL injury reports to
set fantasy football lineups. Checking Internet e-mail in-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   All while they should be working.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.ishouldbeworking.com, is nice and brazen about
the people's online slacking. People are on the Web when they
should be working, so if people are going to do it, the site
argues, why not do it here?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the welcome message states, ``This Web site is dedicated
to slackers, goof-offs, procrastinators, loafers, `long-lunchers,'
and Web-addicted employees worldwide. You should probably be doing
something else right now, but as long as you're here, have some
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The site offers discussion groups, games and jokes. It also
includes a panic button on every page in the site. If your boss is
walking by, press it and immediately (or as long as it takes to
download) a business-oriented Web site appears.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes practical tools as well. One page offers links
to several online job-hunting sites. Another provides links to
alcoholic drink databases, and one offers links to travel planning
sites.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING LIGHT SITE HAS HEALTH TIPS, MORE
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all the excuses: You're too busy to eat right and
too overworked to burn off the excess from the food you shouldn't
be eating because you're too busy in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's one less excuse. The folks at Cooking Light magazine
improved their Web site, www.cookinglight.com. The only drawback to
the site is the annoying pop-up box, ``welcoming'' you to the site.
But that can easily be removed with a click.
</P>
<P>
   The new site includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nutritional information that lets you search recipes by fat
content or the percentage of calories, carbohydrates, sodium and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twice as many recipes as the original site. Some 2,000 recipes
are included. Each is linked to dishes included as part of
last-minute menu ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new, faster search engine to help find recipes when all you
know is one word.
</P>
<P>
   _ A feature called My Recipe Box, which lets you keep an online
collection of your favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clueless Gourmet is geared toward someone who doesn't know
much about cooking but wants to make it seem like they do. The
selections come with tips to create ambience and advice on how to
select the fruits and vegetables in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   LOCATE THAT HARD-TO-FIND RENTAL MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   So you want to rent an old Albert Brooks movie. But you live in
the Deep South, not exactly the holy land for movies written by and
starring a somewhat whiny, neurotic Californian. You have a few
options: You can drive to the video stores near your home and see
if they carry ``Lost in America.'' You can call and ask. Or you can
take advantage of a Web site designed to help you find hard-to-find
movies to rent.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.formovies.com, has a search engine that lets you
type in the name of a movie and your ZIP code. After a few seconds,
it lists the phone number and address of video rental stores near
your house that carry the movie you want. A recent search on ``Lost
in America'' using a ZIP code in metro Atlanta turned up 12 video
stores, five of which were a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes more than 9,000 video stores and 160,000 movie
titles in its database. You can search for video cassettes, DVDs
and video games. You can search by movie title, actor, directory or
category.
</P>
<P>
   THE LATEST THINGS IN NET MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Web listening: RCA's Lyra 2201 is an MP3 player that offers the
versatility of handling different formats. The RaveMP 2100 not only
looks cool but also adds a built-in microphone for four hours of
voice recording. The Rio 500, successor to the original MP3 player,
greatly improves on capacity and features.

A look at games for kids 
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's amazing that anything with Barney's mug on
it still exists. There was a time where the purple dinosaur
inspired rage and social backlash. Now, it's the opposite. Barney
is back in favor, in part because of cool toys like Barney's Song
Magic Bongos ($30). The Magic Bongos plays 11 songs in the voices
of five different instruments. All kids have to do is pick their
song (i.e. ``Farmer in the Dell'' among others) and an instrument,
ranging from a steel drum to a hooting organ sound, and start
bonging away. Each hit yields a note and, following that principle,
a bunch of notes/hits play a song. This toy is great for those
creative kids just starting to attain their dexterity, and is also
good for celebrities who insist on dancing around their homes
naked. (800-PLAYSKL)
</P>
<P>
   Bugs Bunny has a problem. On the way to Albuquerque he finds a
time machine. That's not the bad part. The bad part is that he
tries to use it and gets lost in time. In Infogrames' Bugs Bunny:
Lost in Time ($30, for the Playstation), that wascaly wabbit must
travel over five different eras in order to get back to the
present. Along the way, he meets up with favorites such as Elmer
Fudd, Witch Hazel, Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian. If nothing
else, this game teaches the kiddies that you shouldn't play with
time machines.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Albert is a little crazy in the head (we'll just
euphemistically call him ``eccentric''), but boy is it fun to poke
around in his stuff! In Uncle Albert's Magical Album ($30, PC and
Mac), you can look through Albert's scrap book and piece together
an assortment of puzzles by flipping through pages and putting
items in the right places; if you find a key you can unlock the
rocket ship game and go on a space journey. Find the picture of the
champ and you can play in the stadium. The game, a bestseller in
France, is handily adapted to the U.S. and runs on Windows PCs and
Macs. It features many small films, eight individual games and a
host of animal friends to play with. (www.vtechsoft.com/album.html)

<HEADLINE>
COMPUTER ENTREPRENEURS TO HELP POOR KIDS GET ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By MARILYN GEEWAX  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Entrepreneurs who have made fortunes from the
online revolution have an obligation to give away large chunks of
their wealth to ensure that ``in the Internet century, no children
get left behind,'' Steve Case, chairman of America Online Inc.,
said Monday while announcing a public-private partnership to help
poorer children get online.
</P>
<P>
   Putting his own money where his mouth was, Case said his
family's charitable foundation will give $10 million to help
establish the PowerUP partnership, which will coordinate private
donors and businesses with nonprofit organizations and federal
agencies to give underserved children access to computers and
guidance on how to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Foundation is paying for the initial staff
administrative costs. The Waitt Family Foundation, established by
Gateway Inc. chairman Ted Waitt, will supply 50,000 computers to
community centers. America Online then will give away 100,000
accounts for Internet access. More than 400 specially trained,
full-time AmeriCorpsVISTA workers will provide an adult presence at
PowerUP-supported centers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer centers will be closely tied to local YMCAs, Boys &AMP;
Girls Clubs, Save the Children, National Urban League and other
organizations with connections to young people. The AmeriCorpsVISTA
workers will coordinate with local schools to make sure PowerUp
efforts complement educational programs. Students will be able to
access only Web sites that have been screened for appropriate
content.
</P>
<P>
   Case said that, because so many new jobs will be tied to the
Internet in coming years, all children need knowledge of computers.
``Just as the nation made a successful commitment to ensuring that
every child has access to public education starting at the age of
five, we must now commit ourselves to ensuring that in the 21st
century every child in America has access to technology so that no
one falls behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waitt agreed, saying that because the Internet ``has created an
era of almost unprecedented prosperity,'' the affluent must ``share
so that everybody can take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, who serves on the PowerUP board,
said people all over the world are looking at the United States to
see whether its form of capitalism is worthy of support and
imitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism is gone ... and we are in a remarkably powerful
position,'' Powell said. But that position will be eroded if others
see that capitalism distributes wealth only to a handful of people,
while leaving the poor behind, he said. ``We can't be that shining
city on a hill,'' he said, unless the light reaches all children.

Portable MP3 players take over for the computer 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hot trend in music is to download music
purchases directly over the Internet for storage and play through
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is you probably don't want to lug your
personal computer to the beach, on the bus or to most of the other
places you want to go. That's why several companies are now
marketing small, portable players capable of playing music recorded
in the Internet's MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The latest portable MP3 player is the I-Jam, introduced by the
I-Jam Multimedia Corp. of Illinois. The I-Jam ``portable MP3
multimedia system,'' as the player is called, plays MP3 files
downloaded from the Internet. It also has a built-in FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   I-Jam claims its portable MP3 player is the smallest on the
market at three inches high and less than two inches wide, and it
can be worn around the neck or on a belt clip. The I-Jam player is
supposed to deliver CD quality sound through its ear bud speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To use the I-Jam system, you download music through your
computer as you normally do. Once the music is in your computer,
you can load it onto a MultiMediaCard about the size of a postage
stamp. I-Jam says its player is compatible with all the digital
formats currently being used to download music from the Internet.
I-Jam systems were being offered online for $179.95 last week. To
get further details or to order the product, visit
www.ijamworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Jam system and other portable MP3 players also are
available through major electronics stores or through other online
audio equipment sellers.

The cyber-mall is waiting to help you with your holiday shopping 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't all those Internet pundits see how obvious it is
that lots of people will be shopping online this holiday season?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Even people who absolutely hate shopping are
forced to do it at Christmas. Anyone who's ever had to fight his or
her way through Toys ``R'' Us or Victoria's Secret at Christmastime
knows this all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the episode of the TV show ``Friends'' in which one of
the characters, probably Joey, forgot all about Christmas and
bought everyone presents from a gas station? Somebody got
windshield wipers; someone else got an air filter.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that people get desperate during the holidays.
They'll buy almost anything from anyone as time begins to run out.
</P>
<P>
   So the idea that people will be shopping online this year is
really a no-brainer. Do you really want to spend the 12 days of
Christmas trekking through every bookstore in town to find that
fly-fishing book your husband keeps yakking about? Of course you
don't. Why not just sit down at your computer, log on to an online
bookseller, have them find the book, gift-wrap it and drop it on
your doorstep? And it comes in the nifty UPS box, so if your
beloved asks you what came in the mail, you can smile sweetly and
say ``Oh, this? It's a `Cooking with Soy' book. We really don't eat
enough tofu, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's foolproof _ not even the most curious member of your family
is going to try to rip open a UPS package. First of all, anyone
who's tried knows it's not really possible without power tools.
Secondly, unless you work for UPS, you don't have the equipment to
return the packages to their just-delivered state. You will be
found out, and you will be presentless.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if shopping at home is some wacky new idea that only
Web geeks and Microsoft employees can figure out. People have been
sitting comfortably catalogshopping and phoning up those cable
home-shopping channels for years. Now that most companies have at
least one computer hooked up to the Web, the end-of-the-millennium
holiday shopper can probably find his way to an online retailer and
place an order with little or no difficulty. It's hard to find a TV
show, newspaper or magazine that isn't stuffed with ads for
``Dot-com'' retailers urging you to get online.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers say they've learned tons from last year's
surprise Christmas onslaught. More than just posting a list of
goods for sale, they finally understand that the Web offers more
opportunity for personalization and interaction than a catalog or a
retail store.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for the novice e-shopper, retailers you know
and trust in the real world such as Nordstrom, Macy's, Neiman
Marcus, The Gap, Barnes &AMP; Noble, even speciality stores like The
Museum Co. and cosmetic companies such as Clinique and Bobbi Brown,
have all set up shop online. Each offers faithful consumers the
opportunity to bypass the crowds and do their holiday shopping by
the festive glow of their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites offer very detailed and easy-to-read privacy
statements that you should read before you begin any online
shopping adventure. Any reputable site will promise security
measures to keep your credit card numbers safe. They'll also

   Converts to the wonders of online shopping will tell you that
the Web offers consumers much more besides convenience. There are
``wish lists'' users can create to help confused but
well-intentioned gift-givers pick out something you might really
enjoy. Other sites provide online ``personal shoppers.'' Type in
the person, the occasion, some information about their likes and
dislikes and a price range and you'll get several suggestions that
might fit the bill. If you find a retailer you like, you can often
select ``one click ordering option'' that will store your personal
information so you don't have to enter it over and over. It saves
time and provides extra security.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not shopping online yet, don't worry. The mall won't
be closing any time soon. But as the holidays draw closer, going
online is clearly better than last-minute shopping at the gas
station.

EBAY MOVE RAISES INTERNET PROPERTY RIGHTS QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leading Internet auction site eBay has begun blocking
efforts by another Web site to create an index of ongoing eBay
auctions. In the process, eBay has raised a crucial question about
intellectual property on the Web _ who owns the information on a
Web site?
</P>
<P>
   EBay is using special software to block out all visits from the
computers of AuctionWatch.com, a San Bruno, Calif. company that
runs a search engine for Internet auctions. Just as an Internet
user can go to the Lycos or Yahoo search engine to find information
on computers or sports, AuctionWatch seeks to offer a listing of
many different Internet auctions. By typing in an item of
merchandise, such as Pedro Martinez baseball cards, AuctionWatch
lists auctions where such cards are available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Most auction sites want to be listed on AuctionWatch, just as
most Web sites want to be listed in Yahoo or Lycos. But eBay
spokesman Kevin Pursglove says the 3 million auctions listed on the
site are a form of intellectual property. Services such as
AuctionWatch, which aggregate eBay's listings along with those of
other auctions, seek to profit unfairly from eBay's success by
stealing the information the company has acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe what aggregators want to do is essentially get a
free ride on that hard work and investment from another party,''
Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Sales, cofounder of AuctionWatch.com, disagrees. Just as
services like Lycos automatically create indexes of millions of
public Web pages, Sales thinks AuctionWatch has a right to create
listings of auctions on public Web sites, including eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's available for anyone to view, right on the Web site,''
Sales said. ``It's not the property of eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales tried to negotiate a licensing agreement with eBay that
would have allowed him to keep listing its auctions on his site.
But when the talks broke down, eBay demanded the specific IP
addresses of the computers used by AuctionWatch to search the eBay
auctions. To avoid having eBay block all of AuctionWatch's IP
addresses, Sales complied. Now eBay's auction computers block out
efforts by AuctionWatch to search the site.
</P>
<P>
   But Sales says he's not licked yet. He says he plans to
investigate possible ways around the blockage, including a method
that would make it appear that searches were coming from individual
AuctionWatch users, rather than from AuctionWatch itself. Told of
these efforts, eBay's Pursglove replied: ``We'll certainly block
that bridge when we come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute could last quite awhile. Shari Steele, director of
legal services for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet
civil liberties group in San Francisco, said that no court of law
has ever settled the question at issue in this dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting legal question that has not been
resolved,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, eBay vows to keep playing hardball against other
search engines that target auctions. Burlington-based Bidder's Edge
Inc. announced in September that it would comply with eBay's demand
that it stop listing eBay auctions. But last week, Bidder's Edge
reversed itself and said it would once again feature eBay listings
on its site.

</P>
<P>
   Why did the Soviet Union reconcile itself to ``peaceful
revolution'' in the nations of central and eastern Europe? Why did
we not do everything in our power to keep hold on East Germany?
Should we have fought to keep it in our sphere of influence?
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union understood the abnormality of having the German
nation divided in two. In fact, more than once in the past, Soviet
leaders had submitted proposals for consideration by its Western
partners that would provide for the unification of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the West rejected these, considering them to be mere
propaganda, or trickery, on our part. To a certain extent, the
proposals did have a propagandistic, or self-promotional, purpose.
But our Western partners never once tried to take Moscow at its
word.
</P>
<P>
   During my tenure, in the first years of perestroika, the
question of German reunification did not arise as a specific
problem. East Germany was a place where the people lived better in
material terms than the population of other ``socialist'' countries
of central and eastern Europe. In terms of political freedom,
however, the situation was bad.
</P>
<P>
   As we got under way with perestroika _ the movement that was to
bring freedom to our own people _ the Soviet leadership could not
apply different criteria to the other countries in our domain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the process of democratization in the Soviet Union made
the East German citizens' unhappiness with their own repressive
regime increasingly manifest.
</P>
<P>
   I do not mean that there were any kind of hints of pressure from
us. When changes began in eastern Europe, the expression of the
people's will was recognized as legitimate and as the expression of
the freedom of any people to choose their own path of development.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet leadership made its own domestic plans and actions
known during visits to the Warsaw Pact countries. But the Soviet
leadership nonetheless did not wish to export its own aims and
intentions, its own experience.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the truth is that interference in the internal affairs
of our neighbors was ended. No longer was advice given from Moscow,
let alone orders or commands.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, sometimes certain politicians even took offense at
this _ especially those who wanted Moscow to push in a certain
direction. But Moscow remained true to its position.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the leaders in Bonn would make a point of commenting
on the division of their country. Our attitude was that the
division of Germany was a product of history and that history would
take care of it some day. Without categorically denying the
possibility of reunification, the Soviet side suggested that time
be allowed to solve the problem. This same idea was repeated during
my visit to Bonn in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, however, events began to develop at a rapid
pace. There were outbreaks of discontent and mass demonstrations.
Support for the East German regime was rapidly collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The East German citizens fled the country en masse, even at the
risk of death. There was an exodus to West Germany _ at first
through Hungary and later Czechoslovakia. Some people left the
country by any means available, even crossing the Berlin Wall,
which separated West Berlin from East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the East German citizens understood that the Soviet
Union would not use force to prevent the unification of their
country. This was a signal to them that their will to have unity
could be realized.
</P>
<P>
   From our standpoint, any effort to try forcibly to preserve this
system would have only vastly weakened the Soviet position and
discredited us in the eyes of the Germans, our people and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In early November 1989, Moscow still hoped that the East German
leadership would be able to cope with the situation, preserving
East Germany as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But events developed in a much more precipitous way. A process
began in which the government structures of East Germany began to
fall apart. The pressure grew, resulting in the resignation of the
old leadership under Erich Honecker, the opening of the Brandenburg
Gate and, on Nov. 9, the fall of the Berlin Wall _ that symbol not
only of the division of Germany but of all Europe into East and
West.
</P>
<P>
   I can say now that Moscow conducted itself optimally in these
circumstances. It ruled out the use of force, including the use of
Soviet troops deployed on East German territory.
</P>
<P>
   It did everything possible to allow the process to develop along
peaceful lines, without violating the vital interests of the Soviet
Union or those of East or West Germany, and without undermining
peace in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that we lost our allies in eastern Europe,
that we surrendered these countries too easily and without
compensation. This is folly. After all, to whom did we surrender
them? To their own people.
</P>
<P>
   Any use of force to oppose the will of the German people for
unification would have been fraught with the risk of war, perhaps
world war. How was the Soviet Union to ``save'' this regime? By
revving up the tank motors?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was a heavy concentration of armed forces
stationed in Germany. This nation was important to both the East
and West. And its system could be ``saved'' in only one way _ by
once again sending in the tanks, as we did in Czechoslovakia in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of such action _ such unjustified action _
could have included a general European war. And for what? Was it
not so that the nations of eastern Europe, amid a free expression
of the will of the people, chose their own path of development
based on their own national needs?
</P>
<P>
   The system that existed in eastern and central Europe, as well
as in our country, was condemned by history; it had long since
outlived itself. It was a burden on the people.
</P>
<P>
   And so we allowed reunification to proceed calmly, without
complications or disruption of European stability.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty on the final normalization of relations with Germany
was signed in Moscow on Sept. 12, 1990, and on Oct. 3 German
unification became a fact.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union before
its collapse in 1991 and Nobel Peace Prize winner, now heads the
Gorbachev Foundation, a political think tank in Moscow. He
addressed the German Parliament on Nov. 9 in a special ceremony to
honor the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.) &LR;

IN HEAVYWEIGHT REMATCH, HOLYFIELD WON'T TAKE LEWIS LIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ This time there is no prediction, there is only a
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll be better,'' Evander Holyfield said Tuesday, as if
he were stating a fact. ``If I minimize the mistakes I made, I know
I can win handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't learn from their mistakes. Some do. My whole
life has been a revolving door. I've made mistakes but I've always
corrected them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Holyfield made enough mistakes against Lennox
Lewis to lose two fights, the biggest being his decision to make
the first public prediction in his long career. It was a prediction
the 37-year-old champion rued the minute it didn't come true, which
was only nine minutes into his heavyweight unification fight with
the towering World Boxing Council titleholder.
</P>
<P>
   When his fearless prognostication of an early knockout failed to
materialize, Holyfield began to unravel. For three rounds he was
adrift, a champion suddenly more interested in finding a way out
than the way to his opponent. It was then that Holyfield learned
what Roberto Duran felt that night in New Orleans when he forever
changed his career by uttering just two words.
</P>
<P>
   ``No mas!'' Duran said. The words have followed him ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When Duran quit out of sheer frustration in his second fight
with Sugar Ray Leonard despite holding a slim lead at the time, no
one could quite fathom what he had done. But last March, as those
three rounds ground on at Madison Square Garden, Holyfield began to
understand. It is a lesson he has not forgotten as Saturday night's
rematch with his newest tormenter grows closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I openly admitted I made a mistake with that,'' Holyfield
said. ``I shouldn't have allowed what he said in a phone conference
affect me. I said that in anger and suddenly it just got to the
point, `OK, I'll go with three.' That hurt me for the next three
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until then (the seventh round), I hadn't made up my mind
whether to go on or not. I was very surprised the way I felt. I was
almost depressed. I felt embarrassed. I almost wanted to step out
of the ring and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a release you may want at that moment and it feels good
but you have to live with that for the rest of your life. After all
Roberto Duran has done, that's what he's remembered for most. I
didn't want my kids to think of me like that. You know if you do
that, one day when you're an old man you'll pick up a book and it
will say, `In New York, he quit.' So I prayed. I asked God to let
me get through that fight and I'm thankful for it He did.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all he did. He got through it. But when it was
over, and the result was a controversial draw, it led to federal
and state investigations into the judging of Eugenia Williams and
called into question once again the validity of the sport that has
been Holyfield's life since he was a kid growing up in poverty in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, Holyfield agreed with the decision. He didn't
really think he won, but he knew he hadn't lost, either. Two
champions had come together to settle something and neither had,
Holyfield believes, so now they prepare to do it again at a packed
Thomas and Mack Center, and one of them knows this time he is truly
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four months, Holyfield has trained at the Hard Knocks
Gym in Houston. Trained body and soul to be ready this time.
Trained not only under the watchful eye of trainer Don Turner but
also under one of his former trainers, Kenny Weldon, whom Holyfield
brought in because he is a specialist on the subject of footwork,
and it is footwork _ and footsteps _ that Holyfield believes will
be the difference this time.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Holyfield was unable to find a route to Lewis. All
night he was either too close to him to punch with leverage or too
far away to do anything but get drilled by a stinging jab that
dented his face and dulled his spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Holyfield was never hurt, he was never on top of the
situation, all night finding himself a step off, a step slow, a
step away. He has said some of this was the result of stomach and
leg cramps that overtook him on the way into the ring, and
Holyfield is not undefeated in rematches with Riddick Bowe, Michael
Moorer, and Dwight Muhammad Qawi for nothing. He won those return
bouts (avenging defeats with the first two and destroying a man he
had struggled with in the third) because he refused to lie to
himself about what happened on those long nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a plan to rough (Lewis) up the first two rounds real bad
so he'd wish I had taken him out,'' Holyfield said. ``But I didn't
do nothing to lead him to think he was going out (in the third
round). After that round, I lost a little zeal right there and it
messed my mind up. I felt sorry for myself at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did find the proper distance all night. I've got to be
more precise this time and go from different angles. And when I get
inside, I've got to be busy and land some shots to make him
freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Holyfield admits, he had little respect for
the British champion, and his overconfidence led to
miscalculations. Lewis always has been a mystery, a powerful
puncher who has lost only one time (34-1-1) yet seems to battle a
malaise when he gets into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Where Holyfield is fire, Lewis is central heating. Where
Holyfield is ice, Lewis is lukewarm tap water. Where Holyfield is
the warrior, Lewis is the enigma. As the first fight neared,
Holyfield couldn't shake those thoughts and couldn't quite convince
himself this fight was what people thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   He saw one warrior, not two.
</P>
<P>
   This time, even Lewis's allies know the view is different in
Holyfield's corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holyfield was in a spiritual dream world for that first
fight,'' said Emanuel Steward, Lewis's trainer and Holyfield's
ex-trainer. ``He'll be a different fighter this time. Down to
earth. He has more respect for Lennox and I know he'll be more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander knows he's only got one option. He's got to make it a
dogfight. The way he fought that third round is the way he has to
fight this second fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But can a 37-year-old man who has had 40 professional fights
(36-3-1) _ most of them wars _ win one more dogfight? Can he even
make it one? Those questions are in the air, which is why Holyfield
is nearly a 2-1 underdog.
</P>
<P>
   His critics said he was too old before he destroyed Mike Tyson
the first time, and the same people are saying he's too old again.
They are saying he won't find the right distance against Lewis, who
is more than 3 inches taller and will likely outweigh Holyfield by
30 pounds. They are saying he won't be able to get out of the way
of Lewis's jab. They are saying he may get knocked out this time,
something that's never happened to Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they are saying he will leave Las Vegas without the
World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation
portions of the heavyweight title he now holds.
</P>
<P>
   They are saying a lot of things about Evander Holyfield these
days and he is saying little. He is making no predictions. Unless
you listen closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to beat Lennox,'' Holyfield said. ``My opinion of
Lennox went up after the first fight. I won't underestimate him
this time. I'm ready for him to fight better, but watching it on
tape I saw that when I truly wanted to get inside I got inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I go in the ring knowing I want to win so bad I'll
do whatever's necessary. I'd rather die than not win because I
didn't give my all. We are all tested at times but nothing ever
happens that's more than you can handle. After that fight I had to
reevaluate my thinking and I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trained for 15 weeks for this. I expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be a prediction, but it's a promise. A promise from
a little guy who may not beat you the first time but always has the
second.

A TOUGH STRETCH OF INFIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just call it the Wild Wild East, as the Patriots get set to
enter their most interesting five weeks of football in many a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next month is going to be critical for everyone in our
division,'' says Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, looking at a
schedule that has the four contenders all beating on one another at
some point in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the season, the AFC East figured to be the most
competitive of the six NFL divisions, and it has lived up to that
billing, with the exception of the New York Jets. The Jets, picked
by many to reach the Super Bowl, have fallen from grace into the
cellar, and will be no factor in the playoff picture unless they
suddenly find enough offense to upset a good team and play the role
of spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, at 7-1, is the team to catch. The Colts, at 6-2, are the
team to watch. The Patriots, also 6-2, seem to have the best
balance of offense and defense. The Bills, at 6-3, still have all
three teams above them coming into Buffalo, trying to win in cold
weather against a very good defense, and a quarterback (Doug
Flutie) who isn't bothered by the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a closer look at how tight this AFC East race really is,
and how it projects to unfold:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(! used as column separator) &QL; 
Opponents' ! Times ! Projected &QL; 
record ! favored ! record &QL; 
Dolphins (7-1) 35-30 ! 6 ! 13-3 &QL; 
Colts (6-2) 34-33 ! 6 ! 12-4 &QL; 
Patriots (6-2) 36-31 ! 5 ! 11-5 &QL; 
Bills (6-3) 33-22 ! 5 ! 11-5 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Buffalo faces the toughest schedule but has four games
at home, including three against divisional opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has the 2-6 Jets and the sliding Chargers on its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   New England has to try to win in Miami, in Buffalo, and in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, who currently have the best offense in the league,
have the Giants, Eagles, and Jets in the next three weeks, a menu
that might have them on top of the division three weeks from now
after Miami, the Patriots, and Buffalo, have battled each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are hoping to have Dan Marino back to face the
Patriots in Miami a week from Sunday, but that may not be
realistic. Marino was in California Tuesday to see specialists
about his injured neck. He has a bulging disk that has been
aggravated by a bone spur. Reportedly, doctors have told him that
surgery would sideline him for the season. So the problem now is
how to get him back on the field the fastest way possible, through
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Huard has done a nice job as Marino's replacement _ he
hasn't lost a game _ but he cannot make the throws that a healthy
Marino can. As a result, opponents have been stacking the line,
shutting down any chance the Dolphins have of running the ball on a
consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't turn the ball over, and play defense the way we
can play, we won't lose the game,'' says Johnson. Huard, as Patriot
fans remember, threw an interception on his first attempt after
replacing Marino in Foxborough Oct. 16, but he has thrown just one
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's healthy return would take some pressure off the Miami
defense, which now bears the burden of winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis leads the AFC in scoring, averaging 28 points a
game, and has the best offensive troika in the league: Peyton
Manning at quarterback, Edgerrin James at running back, and Marvin
Harrison at wide receiver. Don't forget, this young team had big
leads in the two games it lost, at New England and home against
Miami. The Colts will be tough for anyone to beat the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo went through a tough period, with three games on the
road and some important players injured, but it had a big win
Sunday in Washington as wide receiver Eric Moulds returned to the
lineup. Buffalo can run the ball better than Miami or New England
and play better defense than the Patriots. What looms as a great
game is Buffalo at Indianapolis on the final Sunday of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have no offense. They are averaging 15 points a game,
10 fewer than a year ago when they were riding high with Vinny
Testaverde at quarterback. Rick Mirer has not been getting it done.
Bill Parcells might start Ray Lucas at QB as soon as he is healthy
enough. There is also the temptation to start punter Tom Tupa, who
played well against New England at quarterback in the season
opener. But Tupa has been the Jets' best player this year _ that
tells you what kind of a season they've been having _ so Parcells
is reluctant to make that move.
</P>
<P>
   There is one danger in this four-way shootout. One AFC East team
could end up with a better record than the AFC West champion and
still not get into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With Jacksonville and Tennessee likely to make the playoffs,
there would be room for just three AFC East teams. Somewhere in
there, how they do head to head might be the tie-breaker that sends
one team into the postseason and the other one home.

NEW YORK YACHT CLUB READIES BOAT 2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When OneAustralia broke apart and sank like a stone in 90 feet
of water off San Diego in the America's Cup winter of 1995, the
``Indy car'' analogy was first trotted out.
</P>
<P>
   For those ``on the cutting edge'' or ``pushing the envelope'' of
America's Cup design, every now and then something is bound to blow
up.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in the aftermath of the second such disaster in two
Cups _ when the New York Yacht Club's Young America broke apart,
forcing the crew to jump overboard _ the analogy returned.
</P>
<P>
   It's just like Indy cars. If you're cutting edge on design,
you're going to blow one up now and then.
</P>
<P>
   On board Young America Tuesday, the feeling was not quite so
academic. The moment, though not as disastrous as the sinking of
OneAustralia (which disappeared in a matter of seconds, her sails
and rigging a threat to drag sailors under), was still a horror.
Young America was in its second race in Round Robin 2 of the Louis
Vuitton Cup trials.
</P>
<P>
   In winds touching 20 knots and seas to 4 feet, Young America's
charcoal-gray hull was a few boat lengths ahead of Japan's Nippon
Challenger as they swung toward the upwind mark to turn for the
finishing leg of the 18-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Young America had been experiencing a few problems with the
genoa track, but no warning sounds came before the Rhode
Island-built 75-footer came off two big swells with heavy thuds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to syndicate trustee Charles Leighton, who was
riding in the 17th position (a spectator perch at the extreme aft
end of IACC boats); ``We heard a bang and then we heard the order
to all get off the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, fearing a sudden sinking, all crew members jumped
overboard as crash boats from Japan and Italy rushed to the aid of
Young America's support boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all incredibly helpful,'' Leighton said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, everyone watching the foundering yacht was
waiting for it to sink. Three crew members _ Bob Campbell, Jerry
Kirby, and Dave Tank _ ventured back to lower the sails and
retrieve what gear they could.
</P>
<P>
   With pumps aboard and flotation affixed to the hull, a towline
was rigged, and Young America, her ends sticking up in the shape of
a 75-foot banana, began the four-hour tow back to the dock. It was
not until the boat had been brought into calmer water that there
was hope it could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Once the extremely valuable mast was pulled out by crane, slings
were put around the hull to lift it out. As it settled into its
cradle, the hull straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Eric Goetz, president of Custom Sailboats in Bristol,
R.I., builder of both Young America yachts, rounded up a team and
headed immediately for Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   First job is to get the second new boat (US 58) ready for the
water. A clause in the no-substitution rule provides for boats with
serious damage, so skipper Ed Baird and crew will finish the second
round robin in US 58 after forfeiting a 4-point race.
</P>
<P>
   According to syndicate chief John Marshall, despite a crack all
the way around the deck that caused the collapse, the hull is sound
and the boat can be repaired. It is expected to return to racing
``in a matter of weeks, after Goetz sets up a facility to work on
it in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern now is that we do not get distracted, that we do
what has to be done to move forward and win the America's Cup
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of focus on the technical issues of
carbon fiber, but this competition is won by people and strength of
our team. We will come out of this with a strong sense of
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Young America collapse does raise again questions that
have hung over the Cup since it began last month. Several of the 11
challenger boats have had breakdowns under stress, such as a
shattering of the deck on the Swiss entry sailing in high winds in
Round Robin 1.
</P>
<P>
   With 110-foot rigs and towering sails exerting tremendous loads
on the hulls, and keels with 35-ton ballast bulbs, the lightweight
IACC yachts with their carbon fiber skins are strained to the
limit. The speed equation all designers seek is the highest
strength for the least weight. Thus, most sailors and designers
concede that the IACC boats in breezy New Zealand are often
strained to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Having won 10 of 13 races, Marshall said, he has no doubts that
his team can be among the top six finishers that will enter the
semifinal round in January with clean slates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good boat speed,'' said Marshall. ``We have everything
we need to make the semifinal round _ a good, fast boat, a design
advantage in our mast, and a great team. We'll be there.''

A WRITER'S RICH LIFE, UNDER A HAYSTACK OF DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GORE VIDAL 
A Biography 
By Fred Kaplan 
Doubleday, 864 pp., illustrated. $35. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore Vidal, speaking to his authorized biographer, was sounding
both outrageous and wistful, simultaneously ingenuous and
disingenuous _ an entirely characteristic tone. ``So I don't know
how you are going to do this,'' he said, referring to the plan to
produce a biography, ``because there isn't anything there . . .
there isn't anything except the books, of course, to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vidal's books appear to be just about the least of Fred
Kaplan's concerns in this vast tome. Kaplan, who has also written
biographies of Henry James, Thomas Carlyle, and Charles Dickens,
races past all those pesky novels and essays as fast as he decently
can, although he devotes dozens of pages to media-driven feuds
between Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr., Norman Mailer, and Truman
Capote.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal, of course, is partly to blame for this. Like Capote and
Mailer, he has always been an aggressive self-promoter, and in many
respects a more successful one than either of his onetime literary
rivals. Vidal kept himself in the public eye as a television
personality, a candidate for office, a successful Broadway
playwright, an energetic worker in the mass media, a purposeful and
intelligent controversialist. He may have hoped to draw attention
to his books by these activities, or at least to subsidize
literature by better-paying work, but the result was inevitable in
a nonliterary culture like ours. Vidal, like Mailer and Capote, is
more famous for being famous than for anything he has accomplished,
better known for his sound bites than for his novels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, Vidal was born into a milieu of accomplishment and
privilege through which he has moved confidently ever since. His
grandfather was a senator from Oklahoma; his father was a West
Point athlete and a pioneer in aviation (and a lover of Amelia
Earhart). His mother, on the other hand, was a conspicuous
exception. She reveled in being fascinating, beautiful, and
well-connected; Vidal's relationship with her grew increasingly
troubled as she retreated into resentful and theatrical alcoholism.
After an unforgivable letter to her son in 1958, he replied by
writing to say he would never see her again. He never did, although
she lived another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal never went to college, but accumulated an unconventional
but formidable education that continued throughout his life. The
first novel of the young Army veteran, ``Williwaw,'' made Vidal a
minor celebrity. His third, ``The City and the Pillar,'' one of the
first American novels to deal polemically with homosexuality, made
him a hero and a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal had an adolescent sexual relationship with a friend, Jimmy
Trimble, who was killed on Iwo Jima, and he has idealized that
friendship ever since. Most of Vidal's subsequent sexual contacts
were as fleeting as the ones with Trimble, but without emotional
content _ although he was for a time flamboyantly in love with the
pioneering American dancer Harold Lang, and for a time Anais Nin
was flamboyantly in love with him, and she recorded the details in
the empurpled prose of her diary. In 1950, Vidal met 21-year-old
Howard Austen, with whom he has shared his life ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal's workload has always been heavy and he has always been
proud of his work, which in later years flowed in parallel streams,
a series of novels about American history beginning with ``Burr,''
and a series of outrageous ``inventions,'' beginning with ``Myra
Breckenridge.'' Vidal's editors and publishers preferred the stout
historical bestsellers; Vidal himself, and some of his foreign
literary admirers, like Italo Calvino, much preferred the
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   This, briefly, is the story Kaplan unfolds in painstakingly
dogged and mostly accurate detail (Maria Callas, however, seems an
unlikely member of Leo Lerman's salon in 1945). If you want to know
what Long Island queen didn't wear underwear under his smock when
entertaining Vidal in 1953, or where Eleanor Roosevelt kept her cut
gladioli fresh (the toilet bowl), you will find that information
here. The breathless run-on may have been typical of Vidal's life
at points; it is also typical of Kaplan's style: ``. . .he stayed
for awhile at the Chelsea Hotel, then for a brief time in
Tennessee's apartment while Williams was away, then in a sublease
on East Fifty-second Street, downtown from the ballerina Nora Kaye,
who had been married to one of the literary heroes of his
adolescence, James T. Farrell, everything of whose he had read at
Exeter. One night her bathtub overflowed, flooding his apartment,
leaving them both discomfited but even friendlier. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan doesn't push, doesn't ask discomfiting questions, works
hard, piles up detail, lacks focus, gets nowhere. Vidal's first
authorized biographer, Walter Clemons, never seemed able to get
started; his second, Kaplan, doesn't know when to stop.

FIVE DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   G.K. Chesterton called coincidence a ``spiritual pun,'' and it
was in that vein that I spotted a book on my office floor _ ``Five
Days in London'' _ the day I embarked on a five-day trip to London.
The book is deadly serious, and my trip was vitally fun, so
naturally I am going to tell you about the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five Days in London'' is historian John Lukacs's
reconstruction of the events of May 24-28, 1940 _ five days, he
argues, that rescued European civilization from Hitler's Thousand
Year Reich. Such grand pronouncements are always suspect; history
has many ``hinges,'' real and imagined. Twenty thousand dead
Russian soldiers on the outskirts of Moscow may have done more to
bring down Hitler than a coven of boarding-school aristocrats
(``Halifax . . . had been the Marquess of Londonderry's fag
(servant) at Eton,'' we read). But Lukacs defends his thesis well.
</P>
<P>
   The author of two broader books on the subject of Churchill and
Hitler, Lukacs distills the essence of the Allied crusade into nine
crucial deliberations of Churchill's newly formed War Cabinet. With
meticulous research into the heavily ``culled'' diaries of the
principals _ Churchill mentions the critical meetings in neither
his World War II history, nor in his memoirs _ Lukacs reminds us
that hindsight can be the most distorting perspective of all.
</P>
<P>
   This was the situation on May 23, 1940: Hitler's armies had
steamrollered France and pinned the 250,000-man British
Expeditionary Force up against the English Channel. The ``miracle''
evacuation of Dunkirk had not yet occurred. Franklin Roosevelt,
seeking an unprecedented third term as president, was ducking
British pleas for aid. And Churchill, the newly appointed prime
minister, had only a tenuous grip on the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   After the failure of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy,
we remember, Churchill swept into office and led the fight against
Hitler. But, in fact, it was King George VI's hope that Churchill's
rival Lord Halifax, whose ``addictions were fox hunting, High
Anglicanism, and high government service,'' would lead the nation.
Halifax declined, but both he and Chamberlain loomed large in the
War Cabinet of the pension-aged, ``half-breed American'' as one of
Halifax's aides snidely dismissed Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   So here is Lukac's drama: In the secrecy of the tiny,
five-member War Cabinet, the politically confident Halifax rounds
on the vulnerable Churchill, whose grandiose flights of rodomontade
and dark evenings of whisky solace are famous throughout
Westminster. (And across the Atlantic: Harold Ickes, father of
Hillary Clinton's eminence grise, called Churchill ``too old . . .
and very unreliable under the influence of drink.'') Halifax thinks
England should negotiate with the triumphant Hilter, in partnership
with the defeated French, or through the offices of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill opposes Halifax on principle. ``We would rather go
down fighting than be enslaved to Germany,'' he says more than
once. But reason is against him. If Britain treats with Hitler,
Halifax says, next to nothing will be lost. A Mediterranean naval
base; a pledge of neutrality; small prices to pay, Halifax argues,
to spare Britain the anguish of a bloody world war. But Churchill,
the ``impassioned Manichean,'' as biographer William Manchester
calls him, believes everything will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly polite, Halifax has little patience for Churchill's
``frightful rot.'' ``I despair when (he) works himself up to a
passion of emotion when he ought to make his brain think and
reason,'' Halifax tells his diary. But in the secret duel with
Halifax, Churchill engages an unexpected ally _ his predecessor,
Chamberlain. To sit down at table with Hitler, he belatedly
realizes, is to become the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Addendum: Will there be another volume of William Manchester's
wonderfully readable Churchill biography? ``Everyone asks us
that,'' says a staffer at Manchester's publisher, Little, Brown.
Volume 2, which took Churchill right up to Lukacs' proverbial five
days, appeared in 1988. Manchester, who last read from the new work
in progress six years ago, is 77 and has not been in good health.
Little, Brown says he is still working on the book, with no
publication dates yet set.

ART OF THE E-DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Robert Slutsky has had a keen interest in
photography for several decades, but between the demands of family
and career, he never got around to indulging his passion _ that is,
until he discovered the Internet. In April, he bought an Ansel
Adams photograph from the upscale on-line auction house Artnet.com,
and since then, he has built a modest collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting to do this for about 20 years, but I work a
lot of hours, and I never had the time,'' says Slutsky, an
emergency physician at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital on Long Island.
``Now I have these things littered all over my house, and you don't
know how happy that makes me. My wife thinks I'm a nut job, and
we're running out of walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the great global garage sale spawned by on-line
auction sites like eBay was limited to low-price items with no
guarantee of authenticity. The art world, which is elitist by
definition, resisted the populist realm of cyberspace, turning up
its nose at the consumer-driven media. But suddenly prestigious
galleries and auction houses are racing to get on line faster than
you can say, ``Ready, fire, aim'' _ an industry term that describes
the urgency of Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   The art market is one of the last unexploited areas of
e-commerce _ and that's changing at breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tens of thousands of fine art works out there just
looking for buyers,'' says Hans Neuendorf, Artnet's founder and
CEO. ``We're helping them find each other.'' Since April, Artnet
has sold $1 million worth of art, with a painting by Lucio Fontana
fetching $168,000. But has Artnet turned a profit? ``Of course
not,'' says Neuendorf, matter-of-factly. ``We will be making money
in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Profitable or not, the trend began earlier this year when Artnet
held its first on-line auction and the venerable Sotheby's and
Christie's announced plans to enter the market. In recent weeks,
there has been a mad scramble to get into the competitive business
of ``accessible luxuries.'' The names of the ventures sound like
cyber clones: There are OnView and eArtgroup and Artstar and
Artnet. EBay just launched Great Collections, a partnership with
the San Francisco auction house Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield.
Sotheby's, which teamed up with bookseller Amazon.com, will debut
its site in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The art market hasn't seen this kind of frenzied activity since
the wild speculation in the '80s, when prices soared to record
highs during the free-spending craze of the bubble economy and the
junk bond market. That period was followed by a crash, and it's
unclear how many new ventures will survive the frontier days of
Internet experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite subtle differences and grand attempts to distinguish
themselves, all of these ventures are banking on an unproven
assumption: That there are armies of latent collectors out there _
overworked professionals such as Slutsky or the hypothetical kids
in Silicon Valley with the freshly minted millions.
</P>
<P>
   Neuendorf says he wants to open up the exclusive art world to
ordinary folks by providing a database of prices and extensive
information about artwork. Yet despite all the documentation in the
world, it's unclear whether art will thrive in cyberspace. After
all, buying art is akin to a romance: The suitor spots the work
across the room, has a visceral reaction, gets a closer look, and
then makes a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the idea that you would buy an artwork and not look at
it in person is unheard of,'' admits Deborah Ripley, a former print
specialist at Christie's who sells art sight-unseen as senior
specialist at Artnet. ``But for some people, the Internet is their
world, and they have no resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Works by household-name artists sell well on line, Ripley says,
especially to first-time buyers. ``You might as well call it
Warhol.com,'' she adds. Unfamiliar and esoteric contemporary work,
however, is a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you buy something when you can't go and see it and
touch it?'' asks Boston art collector and philanthropist Kenneth
Freed. ``I can't imagine buying a new work by a young artist
without having a relationship with the artist or the gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   But even cautious collectors are using the Internet as a global
research tool. Freed spotted a West Coast gallery in Artnet's
on-line magazine, and during a recent trip to Los Angeles, he
visited the dealer and ended up buying a piece.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet is opening up the insular art world, dominated
by galleries in a few urban centers, to a global audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to a gallery is a scary venture,'' says Newbury Street
dealer Barbara Krakow, who has signed up with several on-line
services. ``People can give you looks that make you want to scrunch
down and squeeze out the back door. That puts people in the `out'
group, and nobody likes that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, some argue, levels the playing field by offering
newcomers information without intimidation. Such boosters say the
Web makes the art world more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. ``I don't think the Internet has
democratized anything, ever,'' says Nick Capasso, curator at the
DeCordova Museum in Lincoln. ``That is hype, and it's a big lie.
Look who can afford the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet will have a profound effect on the art world,
Capasso admits, just as it has on almost every other aspect of both
culture and commerce. Already, experts accustomed to speaking the
language of lithographs and provenance are tossing around the
jargon of cyberspace. And the talk is hardly genteel; instead, it's
fiercely competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks after eBay announced its partnership with
Butterfield, Amazon joined forces with Sotheby's. ``The race began
to see who went up first, and, I might add, we won,'' says Steve
Westly, general manager of eBay Great Collections. Tuesday, the
site offered sparse pickings by little-known artists and was
illustrated with grainy photographs, but Westly contends that the
offerings will grow over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Westly readily admits that he knows almost nothing about fine
art. He is exactly the kind of high-tech professional the on-line
art ventures are trying to attract as customers. ``The mythical
Silicon Valley kid will come along in time,'' says Morgan Spangle,
vice president of eArtgroup, an on-line dealer network. ``They're
quick to respond to trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Spangle says his company, which will launch its site in a few
weeks, is primarily catering to established collectors. But most of
the new ventures are also trying to attract new clients.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that the rarefied atmosphere of the elite
auction houses and galleries will disappear entirely. The
schmoozing and the wining and dining of blue-chip clients will
continue, as will the drama of traditional auctions. But the art
market, once resistant to change, is racing to catch up with a
changing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go to a dinner party where people aren't talking
about the Internet,'' says David Redden, executive vice president
of Sotheby's. ``It's part of the air we breathe. Our high-end
clients are attuned to it. No one can afford to be a Luddite
anymore.''

VETERANS ARE WARNING OF HEPATITIS C `CRISIS' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July 1998, Terry Baker and several of his buddies attended a
leadership conference for Vietnam veterans in Savannah, Ga. They
noticed a booth hosted by a Washington health consulting firm
offering free hepatitis C tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``My buddies said to me, `We will (be tested) if you will,'''
recalled Baker, who lives in Middletown, Del. ``And I was the one
who ended up testing positive.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that 9 percent of the 122 veterans tested at the
conference were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus,
said Audrey Wright Spolarich, a principal in the consulting firm,
Health Policy Analysts.
</P>
<P>
   It was among the first indications that the infection rate among
veterans is far higher than the estimated 1.8 percent infection
rate in the general U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent studies confirmed that hepatitis C is a particularly
serious problem in the veteran community. In March, a one-day study
of 26,000 patients at Department of Veterans Affairs medical
facilities found that about 8 percent were infected. And a study
presented this week at a medical conference in Dallas found that 19
percent of 791 veterans using the San Francisco Veterans Affairs
hospital were infected.
</P>
<P>
   As Veterans Day on Thursday approaches, veterans' advocates
around the country are struggling to promote awareness of hepatitis
C and to help veterans obtain the medical care and social support
that they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first diagnosed, I was devastated,'' said Baker,
47. ``The doom and gloom comes over you. I've always been a healthy
individual and tried to take care of myself, and boom, I have a
serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized that more and more of us were coming down with
the illness _ enormous numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization prompted Baker to form an organization called
Veterans Aimed Toward Awareness, which is working with public
officials and advocacy groups to educate veterans about the disease
and to encourage those who are at risk to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crisis out there right now,'' said Ed Wendt, a Houston
journalist and Army veteran who learned in 1994 that he had
hepatitis C. Wendt, who later was diagnosed with liver cancer, is
awaiting a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt said he was able to obtain the treatment he needed at the
Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, but he
said many other veterans have had difficulty working through the
agency's bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly,'' he said, ``a lot of veterans are not aware of how to
fight the system like I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it appears that many veterans are unaware that they
are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of 500 veterans by Baker's organization, 74.8
percent said they were ``not very'' or ``not at all'' concerned
about their risk for having contracted the hepatitis C virus. More
than two-thirds (67.5 percent) said they were unfamiliar with the
disease, and 58.3 percent said they were unlikely to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said his group is working with the American Liver
Foundation and other organizations to develop public service
announcements, brochures and other tools to educate veterans about
hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the high infection rates among veterans are
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brownstein, president of the American Liver Foundation,
said little research has been conducted on the question. Some
experts, he said, believe that battlefield blood exposure may be a
factor, particularly among Vietnam-era veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is spread through contact with infected blood. A
major source of infection is blood transfusions before 1992, when a
reliable test was instituted to screen infected blood from the
national blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Research by Veterans Aimed Toward Awareness shows that field
hospitals performed more than 364,900 blood transfusions on U.S.
personnel in Vietnam. In addition, soldiers, medics and nurses were
exposed to blood while caring for the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Department of Veterans Affairs established two
national ``centers of excellence'' for hepatitis C treatment, one
in San Francisco and the other in Miami. The agency also issued
treatment guidelines for the disease, which generally follow the
standard of care developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the guidelines, Baker said, veterans who sought care at
VA facilities often were told that they had ``nothing to worry
about _ go home and we'll keep an eye on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, he said, ``each facility sometimes decides to make its
own rules'' despite the national guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Baker said, pharmacists at some VA facilities have
been unwilling to pay for the two costly drugs that, taken in
combination, are the most effective treatment for hepatitis C. As a
result, he said, veterans served by those facilities don't have
access to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Dr. B.S. Anand, a physician who treats veterans with
hepatitis C at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center,
said he believes the hospital has sufficient staff and budget to
meet the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VA has now provided us with extra help in terms of
personnel, and we have the latest tests to diagnose the viral load,
to get a sense of how much virus is circulating in the blood,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Biedenfeld, president of the Houston chapter of the Vietnam
Veterans of America, said many veterans face social problems that
can compromise their ability to deal with hepatitis C or other
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a veteran suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder might be withdrawn and isolated, making it less
likely that he would seek medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Such personal issues also can complicate a veteran's attempt to
demonstrate that his hepatitis C infection is service-related,
which often is necessary to obtain free health care and disability
benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran who has been homeless or in prison, or who has been an
injection drug user, has other risk factors for infection that the
government can cite as a reason for denying a service connection,
Biedenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's general position is: `If we can find another
reason (for infection), we'll find it,''' Biedenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation introduced in Congress this year would make it
easier for infected veterans to establish a service connection for
hepatitis C. Biedenfeld, however, said the bill is languishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is in no hurry to create a new financial liability
for the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Lackey, a spokesman for Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Maine
Republican who sponsored the bill, said the measure has not been
scheduled for a hearing. He said Snowe is working to build support
among her colleagues on an issue that many know little about.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things take time,'' Lackey said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, meanwhile, said he has overcome his personal hepatitis C
crisis _ treatment with the drug combination cleared the virus from
his system. But he continues to speak about the issue around the
country and to lobby federal officials for better services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are American heroes who are dying, even as we speak,
from this illness, and everyone is hemming and hawing about what
they should be doing,'' he said.

<P>
   WEYMOUTH, Mass. _ A few years ago, when Julie Rotondi of Hingham
started knocking tennis balls around at the Weymouth Club and
attending clinics, the buzz was that she was good . . . but.
</P>
<P>
   But she could be great. But she didn't play up to her potential.
But she didn't play with enough determination.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi heard the buzz, and decided to prove it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   She is now the sixth-ranked junior player in the nation, played
in this year's US Open, and is headed to the University of North
Carolina next year on a full tennis scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   She is no longer known as ``Rotondi who is good but . . .'' She
is just ``Rotondi who is good. Very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi, 17, said she realizes her tennis path is not the one
most follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much been an exception all the way through
juniors,`` she said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she has managed to get near the top of the game
without living and breathing tennis ``24/7,'' or all day, every
day.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't start taking lessons as soon as she could walk, and
she doesn't spend the winter at a tennis camp in Florida, where the
kids study books a little and tennis a lot and ``have permanent tan
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no problem affording it,'' said her mother, Trish
Rotondi. ``But we wanted her to have as normal a life as possible.
And I think the college coaches liked it that she puts down her
racket for three months a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Which comes to another exception in Rotondi's regime: She takes
a break from tennis in the winter to play on her basketball team at
Thayer Academy in Braintree. As one of four seniors on the squad,
the 5-foot-6-inch point guard might be elected one of the captains
when the team starts practice next week.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of her peers on the tennis circuit, Rotondi wasn't
pushed onto the court when she was in kindergarten and didn't start
hitting balls until she was 9 years old, when her parents signed
her up for a junior tennis clinic at the Weymouth Club, where they
played.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no big deal, she said, acknowledging that she was far
from hooked on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little lazy,'' she said, then refined her assessment.
``Well, yeah, I was definitely lazy. Sometimes it was a chore, you
know?''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years, she heard the buzz that was circulating
about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would say it to my face, but people would say, `oh,
look, what a waste of talent.' Or, `she has all the talent, but
she's not using it and she's never going to reach full potential
because she doesn't have the work ethic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her tennis coach at Thayer, Clymer Bardsley, who has seen
Rotondi play since she was in seventh grade, said, ``The knock on
her early was that she was not much of a practicer.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of letting the stage whispers get her down, Rotondi
decided to silence them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I don't know, after a while, it was kind of a motivation,
just to prove them wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 12, Rotondi was in the middle of the USTA/New
England group, and ranked in the top 10 among juniors.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 14, she had taken over the No. 1 spot for
New England juniors and has held onto it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Daly, who has been Rotondi's coach the past five years,
said her tendency when she started was to ``flick the racket
around'' and that her racket work wasn't that impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a way it was good that she wasn't so rigid, and her
athleticism and determination paid off,'' said Daly, now a pro at
the Kingsbury Club in Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   As for her potential that didn't always show up in practice.
Daly said, ``I'd try to point out to her that if she works hard in
practice, the tournament will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said her attributes on the court now include a ``very good
slice, so she can change the pace'' and capitalizing on her
opponent's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always finds out what the opponent doesn't like and uses
that,'' Daly said. ``Like hitting a ball to their backhand, if
they're weak there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rotondi was ranked 94th nationally among juniors,
last year she was 24th, and this year she ended the summer ranked
No. 6, culminating with an invitation to be an alternate doubles
player at the US Open. (She got to play when there wasn't a full
draw, and she and her partner from Ireland made it to the second
round.)
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi said she definitely wants to turn pro, but only after
she finishes four years at UNC, and has no desire to go the way of
other prodigies, who join a tennis academy and turn pro early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never do that, I enjoy my life too much, I guess,''
she said. ``I wouldn't pick up and leave my family and friends . .
. my social life and everything. I wouldn't give it all up, and
just put it all into tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's no reason not to believe that.
</P>
<P>
   She has time for movies (she's seen ``Superstar'' three times),
for TV (she loves ``South Park''), and for hanging out with her
friends (no boyfriend currently).
</P>
<P>
   The other high school experience Rotondi was determined not to
sacrifice for tennis was another sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says I'm insane for doing basketball all these
years,'' she said. ``Every single year a handful of people will
tell me to quit, and I think about it for five minutes and then I
decide, no I'm not quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine with her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really does put tennis on the shelf for a while, which is
really rare for a player of that level,'' said Karen Jodoin, the
girls' basketball coach at Thayer.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not just a token athlete on the court, either.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rotondi was named MVP when her team won the prep
school tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi doesn't pass up playing on the Thayer tennis team,
either, when the seasons overlap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been little bit of frustration for us, but she's
always tried to make it work for both her USTA schedule and her
high school schedule,'' said Bardsley.
</P>
<P>
   He said that even though the team's No. 1 player could
overshadow her teammates, it doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she tries to downplay her national ranking as much as
possible,'' he said. ``She came back to school late this year
because she was at the US Open. But she didn't mention what she'd
done; she'd rather talk about getting to meet Martina Hingis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotondi, whose career has seemed to flourish only when balancing
tennis, basketball, school, and the social life of a teenager, said
her next goals are to go to college, turn pro, and break into the
top 100. It will be about time, said Rotondi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially after four years of college, I'll be ready for
it,'' she said.

ACTIVIST SPIRIT DRUMMED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a protest last month, a group of Harvard University
students threw bags of garbage at the base of John Harvard's bronze
likeness, then draped a T-shirt with the words ``Janitor for a
Living Wage'' above the statue's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The real John Harvard might have cringed at the sight of the
broom that someone in the crowd had set at the statue's legs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the students who demonstrated that day in
Harvard Yard, the message was clear: Strip John Harvard's likeness
of its prestige, add a broom and other tools of the janitorial
trade, and the icon seems no different from the average working
man. Except for one thing, students said: The average service
worker can't make a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after campus activists brought the
anti-apartheid movement to Harvard, a new crop of students are
demanding higher wages and benefits for the people who prepare
their meals, maintain their dorms, and ensure their safety by
patrolling university grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of university students around the country are focusing
on various types of activism right now,'' said Aaron Bartley, a
Harvard Law School student who helped launch the on-campus living
wage campaign. ``But when students at Harvard started meeting 18
months ago, there was a real concern about focusing on issues in
our immediate environment. There was a real concern about
outsourcing, contingent labor, and the way janitors are being
treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both scrappy and profane, this in-your-face, 200-member student
group's protests harken back to the civil rights movement and an
earlier era in the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard students are not alone. At the University of
Michigan, students have been demonstrating against sweatshop labor,
demanding that university officials stop selling T-shirts, hats,
and other clothing made overseas by the working poor. At Yale
University, students have demanded better wages for the graduate
students who teach their courses and grade their papers. Meanwhile,
at the University of Virginia, students protested against the $6.50
hourly wage that campus employees earn.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University, the University of California at Berkeley,
Princeton University, and many others have seen a rise in student
activism following a lull dating back to the 1980s, when many had
set their sights on making _ and spending _ money.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the campus activity, Harvard University spokesman
Joseph Wrinn said: ``There is a certain level of activism that is
expected on college campuses, but it can be ironic since many
people at the university are former activists themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor specialists attribute this turn of events to everything
from former Labor secretary Robert Reich's exposure of sweatshops
to an era of downsizing that forced the children of laid-off
workers to look more closely at the inequities around them, to the
union movement itself, which three years ago launched a nationwide
effort called Union Summer. The program's goal: to recruit young
organizers at college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   When the AFL-CIO launched the massive organizing drive, it was
facing a battle. Many people in their late teens and early 20s,
having grown up in an era of eroding union membership, meager pay
hikes, corporate layoffs, and increased economic insecurity, had
grown increasingly cynical about labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed. ``Unions and the labor movement now have a
very different stature in the eyes of students and their teachers
than they previously had,'' said Robert J. S. Ross, a sociology
professor at Clark University in Worcester who is writing a book
about the anti-sweatshop movement. ``There are now college
internships for students that are being sponsored directly by
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley of Harvard traces his interest in labor to a stint as an
assistant organizer for a unit of the Service Employees
International Union in Denver. Now a second-year law student, he
spends much of his free time working on the on-campus living wage
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Offner, a history student at Harvard, got her first taste of
labor activism while in high school. She worked on an
anti-sweatshop campaign that sparked controversy because some
students' fathers were running companies that relied on sweatshop
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard sophomore Steve Smith, meanwhile, said it was his
father, a civil rights lawyer, who encouraged him to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The three are among 200 students who have pressured Harvard to
boost the wages of its full- and part-time service staff. With
support and encouragement from on-campus unions, they've held
marches, met with university officials, and talked with hundreds of
low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group has done a lot to raise awareness and get people
thinking about the need for good employment standards for anyone
who works at Harvard,'' said Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard
Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Harvard University acknowledged that between 300 and
400 employees had been misclassified as contingent workers, despite
a union contract specifying that after three months workers must be
classified as full time.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the issue of wage equity had been festering for
more than a year at Harvard, where the students' living wage
campaign had pushed the issue into the public eye. While union
officials were gathering information about the workers and
attempting to hammer out an agreement that would properly
compensate them for their lost pay, the students were drumming up
support among their peers and holding weekly demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 13, the university agreed to pay millions of dollars in
back pay and benefits to between 300 and 500 workers who had been
misclassified. Jaeger, who helped draft the agreement, noted at the
time that compensation for the misclassified workers would range
from $250 to $12,000, to be paid out over a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
   The student-run campaign, which had sought to increase the wages
of unprotected employees to at least $10 an hour, was instrumental
in attracting support from other groups on and off campus, said
Adrienne Landau, president of Harvard's clerical and technical
union. ``The student rallies were quite effective in creating
visibility,'' he said. ``No big employer likes to be embarrassed in
public.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, living-wage campaign members are concentrating on
other forms of activism in what many describe as an ongoing push to
increase benefits and wages for janitors and other low-wage and
nonunion staff at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   In a drive to increase its effectiveness, the campaign has been
writing to Harvard alumni, people who might have been involved in
the anti-apartheid movement or the antiwar efforts that rocked the
campus in the 1960s.

   Every morning Claudia Leah rises early, pours herself a cup of
coffee, and immediately heads to her computer in a spare bedroom of
a rented duplex apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She is searching for a house to buy, and, like millions of
others in America, she has turned to the Internet to find it.
</P>
<P>
   On good mornings, an e-mail advises her of a ``hot home,'' a new
house listed overnight that fits requirements she and her husband,
Joseph, a management consultant relocating from Munich, have filed
on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But even when there is no e-mail, the 34-year-old prospective
home buyer is able to ``visit'' dozens of houses every day on
Internet Web sites, many featuring room-by-room, 360-degree video
tours. With a click of a mouse, she can zoom in for a close-up,
scan rooms to the left and right, floor to ceiling, sink to closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves so much time,'' she said after viewing a new $480,000
house in Beverly, Mass. ``I don't know how people looked for homes
before the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by consumer demand and an explosion of Web site
technology, unprecedented change is sweeping the real estate world,
remaking the way many properties are bought and sold in America.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in Internet use by home buyers and sellers is
astounding. At the beginning of 1996, only 2 percent of home sales
were generated through the Internet, according to the National
Association of Realtors. Today, the trade organization says, that
number is approaching 30 percent and rising daily.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry observers say the percentage of
Internet-generated sales is already higher, particularly in high
technology areas such as Boston, with as many as 40 percent of home
buyers using the Internet to help in their house hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Every month, more than 6 million people are accessing the
Internet 171 million times to look at real estate. And that's on
just one site, realtor.com, operated by the National Association of
Realtors. There are thousands of other new real estate sites _
30,000 and counting by some estimates _ ranging from a huge venture
launched by Microsoft Corp. to eye-catching local Web sites being
rushed to existence by realty agents across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this surge in Internet growth is being driven by an
unexpectedly strong demand for information that is turning the real
estate industry on its head.
</P>
<P>
   The industry ``is being radically altered,'' William Wheaton, a
professor of economics and director of the Center for Real Estate
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the
traditional methods for buying and selling homes. The Internet's
influence, he added, ``is growing and it's going to continue to
grow until it takes over the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole pricing structure could change,'' he said,
foreseeing a decline in the role of real estate agents.
</P>
<P>
   Realty agents and other industry officials disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, when it shakes out, most of the traditional purveyors
of real estate information will retain those roles,'' said James
Doherty, president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors.
Conceding the Internet is a ``powerful tool,'' he said it was being
used largely to assist, not replace, the work of agents and more
traditional sales and marketing methods.
</P>
<P>
   The profusion of real estate Web sites is not without problems.
Wide disparities in the way information is presented on them is
confusing to many consumers, industry officials say. And, perhaps
odd for an electronic medium, many Web sites are slow to purge
their listings of properties that have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Classified real estate advertisement in newspapers remains a
principal source of information for people looking for a house,
industry officials agree. Still, the classifieds are increasingly
being augmented by the Internet, as even printed ads today carry
real estate Web site addresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people are actually buying homes based soley on Internet
searches and the new wave of on-line video house tours. Rather,
specialists agree, consumers are using the Internet to rapidly
narrow their house search and to research home prices,
neighborhoods, schools, and mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth McCully is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   McCully, a Labor Department official in Boston, was transferred
from Virginia at the beginning of the year and had little time to
sell her old home or buy a new one. She turned to the Internet, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linked to the `hot homes' feature by an Internet-savvy realty
agent, McCully logged on March 18 to find a newly listed $440,000
restored Victorian on the North Shore with an ocean view. Struck by
its apparent charm and location, she called a realty agent she had
been working with. After a quick lunchtime visit and a conference
with her husband, Thomas, an official with the Environmental
Protection Agency in Washington, she made an offer. The same week
she flew to Viginia to close an Internet-aided sale of her old
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things move fast today. You have to be ready to move fast
too,'' said McCully, regional director of the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Barely three years ago, the real estate Web sites that existed
offered little more than bland and often outdated listings of
homes. Pictures were single grainy snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   That began changing in 1997, however, as real estate Web sites
began to link with databases that could provide consumers with a
wide range of economic and demographic information. The speed and
sophistication of the sites improved dramatically, paced by intense
competition among a variety of Internet companies created to
service the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most noteworthy are Bamboo.com and Interactive
Pictures, Internet imaging companies that merged last month. At a
cost of $99 per home, they offer realty agents the option of
putting high-quality 360-degree video tours of homes the realty
agents list on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations include the so-called hot homes option, which
automatically sends a consumer selected new homes carried by the
local agent or the National Association of Realtors' Multiple
Listing Service.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everybody I'm working with is connected to me through
my (Web) site,'' said Judy Moore, a realty agent in Lexington,
Mass. who specializes in high-end homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in the industry who are afraid (technology)
will remove them. My feeling is . . . if you aren't doing something
new, you're going to be removed anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, when Moore visits a home she has listed, she brings
a small laptop computer equipped with a tiny rotating camera that
can take a video image of any room or item in a home and transfer
it by e-mail to a prospective customer.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, she and other realty agents say, only one spouse is
available to tour a home in person; the other is connected by cell
phone and Internet image. In the short term, Internet usage by
consumers has helped realty agents like Moore more than triple the
number of clients she can handle because they come to her more
knowledgeable and prepared to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Burnham, the realty agent helping Claudia and Joseph Leah in
their Internet home search, has enjoyed a similar surge in
business. He was among the first in Massachusetts to develop a
high-quality local Web site, and is using it to force change in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham favors releasing to consumers the addresses of homes
offered for sale on the Multiple Listing Service, arguing that
buyers should be free to drive by any home listed on the Internet,
without a real estate agent. Traditionally, these addresses have
been off limits to home buyers until a visit was arranged through a
local agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is much better informed because of the Internet.
They're smarter. They demand information immediately, and they
should get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards for realty agents can be quicker sales and increased
business.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Langs, a securities analyst in Boston, says he
bought a house last year through a Duxbury-based firm, Macdonald
and Wood Real Estate Group, because of the quality of its Web site
and because it answered his e-mails immediately when he and his
wife, Christine, were still in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to talk to anyone at (the agency) for at least a
month and a half,'' Langs said. ``I kept sending them e-mails, and
they kept replying with the information I requested. That impressed
me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, like Wheaton at MIT, predict a substantial decline
in the number of realty agents as Internet use and the
sophistication of Web sites increase. He also predicts more limited
roles and reduced fees, which now range from 3 to 6 percent of the
sales price, for realty agents who survive.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry officials concede the numbers of agents is sure to
thin, but foresee no change in an agents' role. The industry is
embracing the Internet, and has formed a range of alliances with
Web providers to secure a dominant on-line role.
</P>
<P>
   The national association's Web site remains the largest, with
1.4 million homes listed. Microsoft has about half that number of
listings. Dozens of other national sites, one exclusively for
private sellers, are also striving to become full-service providers
of real estate services.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Claudia and Joseph Leah learned late last year they would
have to relocate to Greater Boston, she immediately began searching
real estate sites on the Internet. Narrowing her search to Boston's
North Shore in hopes of finding a house on or near the ocean, she
soon came across Burnham's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the way it was set up, it has good pictures and
graphics,'' she said. The Leahs also liked that the Web site
provided quick links to databases, including newspaper Web sites,
that provided information about North Shore communities, schools,
taxes, and recent property transfers. They were further impressed
that Burnham was quick to answer e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   So when it came time for them to move earlier this year, though
they had not yet found a new home, they called Burnham and arranged
to continue their Internet search from their rented duplex
apartment in Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had a good sense of the area,'' Claudia says. ``The
Internet is great because it lets you see so much.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For a bank that barely a decade ago had just two dozen
branches in eastern Pennsylvania, it was a trip to the big leagues
_ and a sign of how much the company has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Sovereign Bancorp set out on the road of high
finance, blitzing through New York, London, Boston, and San
Francisco in an uncommon bid to lure the world's leading investors.
</P>
<P>
   For a savings and loan, even a large one like Sovereign, the
move was unusual: Few community banks leave their provincial turf
to cast about for capital from blue-chip investment banks and
mutual fund firms. Traditionally focused on local mortgages, such
banks are not known for staging international fund-raising ``road
shows'' to finance outsize acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few community banks have tried what 124-year-old
Sovereign is attempting: to use its 24-fold growth this decade to
refashion itself from a thrift into a mainstream commercial bank,
with full-fledged business and consumer lending throughout much of
the Northeast. But two months after taking a quantum leap forward
in its metamorphosis by acquiring a mammoth lot of assets and
branches from Fleet and BankBoston after their merger, Sovereign is
raising as many questions as dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether Sovereign is being too bold this
time around,'' wrote Goldman Sachs in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign, which will be New England's third-largest bank, with
about $35 billion in assets, Tuesday garnered $1.25 billion of the
$1.7 billion it needs to finance its latest and biggest deal. It
expects to haul in the remaining $500 million this week through a
debt offering, and to use the money as a cushion for its new assets
_ something cautious regulators wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Banks rarely undertake debt and equity offerings at the same
time, a move that can ask too much of the market. But Sovereign
managed to raise $300 million in stock, $250 million in hybrid
equity, and $700 million in debt, albeit in costlier noninvestment
grade, or ``junk,'' bonds. Reflecting investor uncertainty,
however, Sovereign took the unusual step of arranging $500 million
in emergency financing from investment banks in case it comes up
short. And some private investors who had initially shown interest
ultimately backed out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bank accomplished most of what it set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are past the second big hurdle,'' said James Ackor, who
covers the company for Tucker Cleary. The first was becoming the
surprise winner of the Fleet-BankBoston assets, the largest bank
divestiture in history.
</P>
<P>
   Sealed in September, that landmark deal handed Sovereign 268
branches across Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island and
boosted the company's assets by 40 percent. It doubled Sovereign's
deposits to $24 billion and increased its loans by 63 percent, to
$20 billion. The acquisition made Sovereign, whose main operations
are in 300 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, the
third-largest bank in Massachusetts, where the bank gains the
entire Fleet network.
</P>
<P>
   But despite scraping together financing and sporting a track
record of making its deals work, Sovereign faces pressing issues
before it begins operating here in April.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the bank's challenge is to retain customers in a
market where it is unknown. That Fleet is prohibited from poaching
Sovereign business clients for three years will help.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street analysts and institutional investors say
Sovereign has no experience in big out-of-market deals, is entering
several new lines of business, and is expanding into an unfamiliar
region with entrenched competitors, including the new FleetBoston
Financial, the region's heavyweight. And the company is under
pressure to grow profits to justify the cost of its acquisition.
Sovereign, prohibited under law from discussing earnings
projections while it finishes raising financing, earned $136.5
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign also has a newly depressed credit rating and a limp
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, the big issue is whether Sovereign, which holds a
thrift charter, can operate successfully as a traditional
commercial bank, lending to both consumers and businesses. While
three years ago Sovereign lent money almost exclusively to
homeowners, it has made big strides in recent years to become more
bank-like through strategic acquisitions. Now Sovereign, which
recently opened a headquarters in Philadelphia but is based in
Wyomissing, Pa., plans to convert to a commercial bank charter
before 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a commercial bank,'' said Sovereign's president and
chief executive, Jay S. Sidhu, in a brief interview. ``Citizens
looks like much more of a thrift than we do,'' he said, referring
to the Providence-based bank that also has a thrift charter.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Sovereign seems more worldly than most smaller
banks: Sidhu, 48, recently jetted to Dubai for an investment
conference, and the company's 1998 annual report looks like an
issue of Business Week. But despite its unusual moves _ ``You don't
see many thrifts doing road shows in London,'' one Boston fund
manager said _ Sovereign is not yet a traditional bank.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of its deposits are in certificates of deposit,
vs. 12 percent for commercial banks. Sovereign has 40 percent more
mortgage exposure than regional banks, although it plans trims.
According to Goldman Sachs, it also owns one-third more wholesale
assets, like mortgage-backed securities _ purchased to redeploy
capital when homeowners prepaid loans.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the thrift's ability to compete with bigger
banks, absorb its purchase, and retain customers prompted Standard
&AMP; Poor's, the credit-ratings agency, and others Tuesday to
downgrade Sovereign Bancorp, the holding company for the bank, to
noninvestment, or ``junk,'' levels. Unusual for a bank _ especially
one that regulators count on to compete against FleetBoston _ the
Sovereign Bank subsidiary is now just one notch above investment
grade. Lower ratings make fund-raising more costly for the bank,
since investors take on more risk.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Bartko, an associate director at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
recently that Sovereign had ``very, very little, if any, room for a
misstep in making this deal work.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many industry observers see a potential pot of gold
at the end of the road for Sovereign, which was founded a decade
after the Civil War. Although many savings and loans are trying to
branch out, Sovereign is the thrift world's most aggressive player,
with 25 acquisitions in 12 years, including 93 branches it
purchased from CoreStates when that bank was bought by First Union.
Eleven of 14 analysts covering Sovereign rate its stock a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They could hit a home run, and their track record suggests
they can pull it off,'' said Ackor, the Tucker Cleary analyst. But
Ackor, who rates Sovereign a ``hold,'' cautioned that the bank's
latest deal ``is not your run-of-the-mill acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome to many analysts is that the Fleet-BankBoston
acquisition will cause Sovereign's total assets to tower perilously
over its equity capital, or common stock. (The latter cushions
against losses; a lower equity-to-assets ratio can leave a company
with less of a buffer against sour loans and volatile earnings in
an economic downturn.) By growing quickly, Sovereign Bancorp has
become one of the most highly leveraged regulated financial
institutions in the country. Though better capitalized than its
parent, Sovereign Bank is still highly leveraged.
</P>
<P>
   Leverage is common among thrifts, which face different
regulatory guidelines on capital than mainstream banks. And
Sovereign's loan book is decent _ the bank did not acquire
nonperforming, delinquent, or large loans from Fleet. But the
overall leverage ``makes some people uncomfortable,'' said David
Winton, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. Sidhu promised to
boost the holding company's capital in the next two or so years.
</P>
<P>
   Growing assets fast is nothing new for the personable Sidhu, a
native of New Delhi who has quadrupled Sovereign's size since 1994
and made the company the biggest thrift outside California. Along
the way, Sidhu has spared no one, operating branches on a
shoestring budget and famously battling Sovereign's last chairman,
multimillionaire turkey farmer Frederick Jaindl, in an ugly
boardroom brawl in 1993 that spilled into the courts. Jaindl, who
later retired, wanted to sell the company; Sidhu, a 26-year banking
veteran intent on expanding his nascent empire, refused.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign shares rose 3/4 Tuesday to close at 8 25/32, after
heavy trading following its new equity offering. But the stock is
down 67 percent from its April high. In recent years, wary
investors have depressed Sovereign's stock relative to other
thrifts. The most recent decline led Sovereign to scrap plans to
raise equal parts equity and debt to finance its acquisition and to
take on more debt to avoid diluting existing shareholder stakes.
The move only exacerbates an already-weak capital structure.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the stock is relatively cheap, analysts see
little danger of Sovereign being acquired in the near term. Arnold
Danielson, a banking consultant in Rockville, Md., said competitors
were unlikely to want a company that does not dominate in most of
its markets and still has to absorb a gargantuan purchase. Dennis
S. Marlo, Sovereign's chief financial officer, said the company
would not make any acquisitions over the next 18 to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing his task, Sidhu has raced to line up a team for his New
England network, to be headed by former Fleet executive Joseph
Campanelli. Lacking people to promote from within, he is recruiting
20 former BankBoston executives. So far he has signed up John D.
McCarthy, former head of banking operations, as chief technology
officer in charge of systems integration, and James Cosman, who
headed consumer lending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sovereign's biggest acquisition ``is a bold move for
them,'' said Michael Hodes, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``It's
causing them to stretch, and it's a formidable undertaking.''

NEW CONSULTANT GENERATION FLUSH WITH NET WORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as there have been computers in our lives, businesses
and consultants have thrived by showing the rest of us how to make
the things work to our best advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition from one high-tech generation to the next can
be as rough and unpredictable on the consulting trade as it is on
the computing industries that drive speedy innovation.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, consulting companies like Cambridge
Technology Partners Inc. that were upstarts during the early 1990s
and highfliers just a few years ago have suffered a popularity
plunge on Wall Street that would make your nose bleed.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of consultants, based on Internet
``e-solutions,'' has risen quickly to grab away much of the old
guard's stock market capital and senior management talent. The new
pitch: to adapt corporate clients to the Web world, sometimes
turning businesses upside down in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no stark black and white to this,'' said Thomas
Willmott, a consultant with the Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``But
there clearly have been a whole new generation of start-ups focused
entirely on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the amounts of money flooding into new
companies with a Web focus are staggering. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --Viant Corp., which went public in June at 16 per share,
finished Tuesday at more than 106. The Boston consulting firm said
Tuesday it would split its stock 2-for-1 and announced plans to
sell another 2.5 million shares that, at Tuesday's price, would
raise more than $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Breakaway Solutions Inc., which went public a month ago at 14
per share, closed Tuesday at 59 1/4. The Boston company, which
reported revenues of $7.2 million in its most recent quarter, is
valued for the moment at $999 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Aztec Technology Partners Inc. of Boston, which has suffered
an 80 percent stock decline in the last two years, said Tuesday it
would spin off its Web consulting business in a separate public
stock offering and work on ditching other parts of its business.

   --Internet-focused consultant NerveWire Inc. opened its doors
just months ago in Wellelsey Hills, Mass. with a $60 million shot
of venture capital from Thoma Cressey Equity Partners.
</P>
<P>
   --Zefer Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., less than two years old, won
last year's Harvard Business School business plan comeptition and
pulled in a local record $100 million in venture capital from a
Chicago firm six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the market performances of some local companies that
were the tech consulting go-go stocks just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. shares have sunk by about 59
percent in the last three years. Renaissance Worldwide Inc. of
Newton, Mass. is down 80 percent during the same period. Keane Inc.
of Boston, long a highflier, has shed more than 55 percent of its
value since a peak hit in July of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The one clear local exception to the trend: Sapient Corp. of
Cambridge, which has more than tripled in the last year and
finished at an all-time high of 71 3/4 Tuesday. The stock has
excelled largely because it made the most successful transition to
the Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   As money has migrated from one generation of tech consulting
firms to the next, so has management talent. The chief executives
of four ``new'' consulting companies _ Robert Gett of Viant, Gordon
Brooks of Breakaway Solutions, William Seibel of Zefer, and Malcolm
Frank of NerveWire _ are all former senior executives of Cambridge
Technology Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting companies that were thriving just a few years ago
sprung up in the age of client-server technology, which made it
possible for personal computers to communicate with main frames and
other big high-tech resources inside a company.
</P>
<P>
   Typically the consultants did slightly different things: write
software from top to bottom, customize generic software for
individual companies, offer broad advice on how to get the most of
high-tech firepower, or provide trained people to perform computer
chores.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient, which focused on customized software, made a remarkable
transition to the Internet world, particularly in electronic
commerce fields. Cambridge Technology Partners generated a sizable
Web-consulting practice but it has been largely masked by problems
in other parts of the company's business. Others consulting
companies have been less inclined to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story of change management,'' said Frank at NerveWire.
``Consultants have a very hard time of changing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the consulting generation before them, the e-solution crowd
splinters into many different specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Viant and Zefer focus on big companies trying to
adapt to a Web world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bet is the need for Fortune 2000 companies to reinvent
themselves on the Internet will be the fastest growing market,''
said Tom Waite of Zefer. ``I think of it as the return of the
dinosaurs, and it's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have gone in different directions. Breakaway Solutions
wants to a be a soup-to-nuts resource for smaller companies, a
field with more clients and less competition. NerveWire is
concentrating on the Internet's business-to-business capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of consultants will tell you they are in a
better business than their predecessors. Their point: The Internet
is driving a type of technology change that reaches further and
deeper into everything that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift to client-server was kind of an evolutionary
shift,'' said Brooks at Breakaway Solutions. ``You've heard the
phrase, `The Internet changes everything'? Well, it's true. This is
a revolutionary shift. It has a much larger business impact and is
far deeper into the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it really worth all that money, or has the stock market
lost its head again in the lastest Web obsession?
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Solutions, part of the old guard, has been left for
dead by the stock market despite pulling in about $800 million in
annual revenues and generating a profit in three straight quarters.
Stock market value: $285 million.
</P>
<P>
   Viant, with revenues of $18.8 million in its most recent
quarter, is valued by Wall Street at $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of consultants seem to have a big future
ahead of them. But isn't that what we said about the old guard just
a couple of years ago?

   BOSTON _ ``Are you going to stay?'' 4-year-old Walker
plaintively asks his father as they go through their pre-bedtime
ritual. Atul Gawande has spent the last few hours giving Walker and
his younger sisters, Hattie and Hunter, a macaroni-and-cheese
dinner and their baths. With 10-month-old Hunter gurgling at his
feet, Gawande sings Walker and Hattie, 3, to sleep by coaxing the
Beatles' ``Blackbird'' from his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   It could have easily gone another way for Gawande, a Brigham and
Women's Hospital surgical resident. Problems with a patient had
threatened to delay his trip home after a 36-hour shift. Gawande's
wife, Kathleen Hobson, had to get to a board meeting for the Newton
Mothers' Forum, a social club for moms. At the last minute, a
fellow resident had agreed to fill in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying tonight,'' Gawande, 34, reassures his son as he
puts the guitar away and then quietly walks down to the first floor
of a house filled with stick-figure drawings and toys. He'll use
the next few hours of quiet to shape his eighth story for The New
Yorker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Gawande drafts these articles at a time when emergency-room
tales written by doctors have become ``as common as dirt,'' says
New Yorker editorial director Henry Finder, who edits Gawande's
work. But since becoming a New Yorker staff writer in 1998 (after a
two-year stint penning columns for the on-line magazine Slate),
Gawande has pushed the medical yarn in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Gawande piece,'' says Finder, ``isn't like any other medical
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Through wrenching human tales, Gawande spotlights the policy
issues he became fascinated with while working on Jim Cooper's
congressional staff, Al Gore's senatorial staff, and Bill Clinton's
presidential campaign. Gawande develops, researches, and writes
these stories as he juggles the equally demanding needs of his
family and medical career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 20 years,'' says Michael J. Zinner,
chairman of Brigham and Women's department of surgery. ``There
isn't another resident that I know of who can write the equivalent
of multiple, sole-authored articles for The New Yorker or anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   One Gawande story delves into doctors' inability to cure nausea.
In another, he uses moving vignettes to show how patients sometimes
make bad health-care choices and suggests that doctors nudge
patients toward the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   An article about mistakes made in the operating room offered
solutions to a matter seldom discussed outside the medical
profession. It won Gawande an American Society of Anesthesiologists
award last month and garnered a positive mention in a February
editorial in the Lancet, a respected British medical journal.

   (ittals)Just a decade ago, surgeons had to make a six-inch
abdominal incision that left patients in the hospital for the
better part of a week just recovering from the wound. Today, we've
learned to take out gallbladders with a minute camera and
instruments that we manipulate through tiny incisions. The
operation, often done as day surgery, is known as laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, or ``lap chole.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``When Doctors Make Mistakes,'' by Atul Gawande, in The New
Yorker, Feb. 1, 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like an ambidextrous puppeteer, Gawande is using both hands, and
a foot as well, to remove a woman's gallbladder using a
laparoscope, a fiber-optic camera, and dissector, an instrument
that lifts and cauterizes body tissue. He's in the OR at Faulkner
Hospital, where he recently completed a rotation. At Gawande's
side, Dr. Jeffrey Thurlow, the surgical intensive-care unit
director at Faulkner Hospital, murmurs encouragements. It takes
about 45 minutes to sever the organ, which looks like raw meat
dipped in thick spaghetti sauce when it's finally placed into a
container.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Gawande, who will complete his medical training in
three years, decided to specialize in surgery is because he admires
the character of surgeons like Thurlow. ``Surgeons have the knack
that good politicians have of being able to deal in a situation
where information is incomplete and action is what's needed,'' says
Gawande.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine and politics have battled for dominance in Gawande's
life since he began stuffing envelopes for Gary Hart's 1984
presidential campaign while studying at Stanford University. He
calls medicine the inevitable career choice for the son of a
urologist father and a pediatrician mother, who live in Athens,
Ohio. Gawande's parents had immigrated from India to New York to
study medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But Gawande resisted that path, partially because he wanted to
be near Hobson, 33, his Washington-based college sweetheart. In
1992, Gawande temporarily ditched medical school to work as the
social policy adviser in the infamous war room of Clinton's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Settling his lanky, 6-foot-3 frame into a chair in Faulkner's
cafeteria, Gawande recalls those days nostalgically. Slightly
oversized, black-rimmed glasses frame his caramel-colored face.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 book ``The System,'' by Pulitzer Prize winners
Haynes Johnson and David S. Broder, Gawande is described as having
``the kind of impressive academic credentials and boundless
self-confidence, unsullied by much workaday experience, that later
came to characterize much of the Clinton White House staff.''
</P>
<P>
   During his time in Little Rock, Ark., Gawande scanned the
television news from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., ready to pounce with
responses to the health care, Social Security, and welfare issues
of the day. He playfully adopts a Southern drawl to mimic James
Carville, Clinton's ``Ragin' Cajun'' campaign consultant who often
called Gawande ``egghead.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gawande, who went on to become a senior adviser at the
Department of Health and Human Services, can't escape the subject
of age as he reminisces. He believes that his inexperience _ and
his failure to work behind the scenes in Washington's byzantine
political hierarchy _ caused him to gradually lose power in his HHS
job.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of age lingers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of surgeons ask themselves when they're reading
(my stories), `What does a resident know about surgery?' '' says
Gawande. ``I think the failure to engage is worse than waiting
until things are perfect.''

<P>
   For Gawande, the invitation to write for Slate came at the
perfect moment. It was 1996. He had been in Brigham and Women's
residency program for a year and a half. Reading health policy
journals helped him keep up with issues, but it didn't give him the
insider feel of his political days.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time Jacob Weisberg, Slate's chief political
correspondent who became friends with Gawande when both were Rhodes
scholars, suggested Gawande write for his publication. Soon the
medical resident had a regular gig producing the on-line magazine's
``Medical Examiner'' column as often as every other week.
</P>
<P>
   The work caught the eye of Malcolm Gladwell, a New Yorker staff
writer who knew Gawande through Weisberg. Struck by what he calls
``smart, beautiful'' writing, Gladwell soon shared his discovery
with editorial director Finder.

   ``I thought, `If this guy writes that well after two months in
the business, what's he going to be like in a year?' '' says
Gladwell. ``The upside was so enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gawande, he struggled hard to become a writer
worthy of Gladwell and Weisberg's praise. He'd never done magazine
writing before The New Yorker called.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at my first pieces, they sucked,'' says Gawande.
``The issues were interesting, but I told them in this abstruse,
academic way. The thing the editors keep beating into me is: `Stop
talking like a pointy head. Give us the footage, the details, the
video picture.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finder praises Gawande as a quick learner. If he failed to
incorporate advice initially, says Finder, ``the second time he was
in like Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   Gawande credits his medical training for this ability.

chance that the lump would grow back? No doctor was the authority
on these matters. Only Iphigenia was. Yet in such situations

influenced by money, professional bias (for example, surgeons tend

   On recent morning rounds Gawande, outfitted with two beepers and
a cellular phone, speeds through Faulkner Hospital. He enters the
room of a talkative 67-year-old cancer patient. He checks the
woman's charts, reassuringly grasps her frail hand, then gently
asks if she has any questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atul's one of our delights,'' raves Thurlow of Faulkner
Hospital, moments after performing the gallbladder surgery with
Gawande. ``He's a motivated guy.''

   Motivated enough to endure a schedule that begins at 6 a.m. on
weekdays and includes overnight stints every three days. Since he's
on call this evening, his shift won't end until about 7:30 p.m. the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, those nights he's not coming home, it's a little
bit of a bummer,'' says Gawande's wife. Hobson, a former editor who
is now a full-time mother, once edited Gawande's Slate and New
Yorker stories before he turned them in. ``Atul's there for
emotional support. We keep in touch a couple of times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's during Gawande's hospital encounters that he captures the
seeds of possible stories. The New Yorker article about medical
choices evolved from an experience during Gawande's first year of
residency.
</P>
<P>
   An already weak cancer patient had died because he elected to
get spinal surgery. Struck by the futility of the surgical effort,
Gawande wrote five pages about the case. This was long before he
started working for Slate and The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A simple case that you see every day can (have) all kinds of
extremely interesting problems and issues that illuminate policy,''
says Gawande. ``That's sort of the whole reason I got started in
writing in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just a matter of finding time to do it. For now, that time
comes after meeting the needs of his residency, his wife, and his
children. He'll log on to a hospital computer or work on his laptop
whenever he can carve out a long stretch between patients.
Sometimes, he'll scrawl paragraphs on paper kept stashed in his
notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just write wherever I am,'' says Gawande as he flips
through the notebook, pulling out a rectangular square filled with
his small, clear writing. ``It works terribly. It's not a good way
to write.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it will have to do.

ENSEMBLE ENERGY SPARKS `LIGHT IT UP'

LIGHT IT UP 
Written and directed by: Craig Bolotin 
Starring: Usher Raymond, Forest Whitaker, Rosario Dawson, Robert
Ri'chard(cq),  Judd Nelson, Fredro Starr, Sara Gilbert, Clifton
Collins, Jr., Glynn Turman 
Running time: 98 minutes 
Rated: R (language and violent content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Light It Up'' isn't a great movie, but it's a cut above most
so-called urban thrillers _ that racist label meaning movies with
violence and African-American characters. One of the things in the
film's favor is that its story about an armed standoff that erupts
in a run-down inner-city high school actually is biracial. Although
it's executed at not much more than the level of a passable TV
movie, its heart is in the right place in that it wants to find
ways to channel the lives of the students positively, starting with
giving them a voice to air some quite reasonable complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the students occupy the protagonist slots at the expense
of adults. Indeed, what sparks the trouble is their protest of the
suspension of a popular white teacher. While they're frustrated by
a don't-make-waves bureaucrat of a black principal and pushed over
the edge by a black cop with a short fuse, the film is not
unsympathetic to the pressures on the principal or even to the
personal issues of the cop, played by Forest Whitaker. After
detonating the siege situation, he's allowed to rejoin the human
race. ``Light It Up'' works hard to try and snatch something
positive from a bad situation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the siege is the thing most of the time, although it's a
siege nobody wanted. It happens when the armed cop is a little too
quick to lean on the kids. Next thing everyone knows, the cop has a
bullet in his leg, six students are barricaded inside the evacuated
school, and a small army of heavily armed cops, complete with
commando units, is surrounding it. Still, the film finds time to
rag on ``The Breakfast Club'' amusingly, even to the extent of
having one of that film's stars, Judd Nelson, play the sympathetic
ousted teacher here. That was suburbia and this is the inner city,
but the orchestration of various types is just as carefully
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can deny the charisma and ensemble energy, starting with
singer Usher Raymond, who makes easy work of the natural leader
role of a basketball star with trouble at home. Another, a
sensitive artist secretly holed up in the school attic because his
home life is even more hellish, is convincingly embodied by
newcomer Robert Ri'chard. Rosario Dawson is another plus as the
most intelligent and goal-oriented member of the group. Fredro
Starr skirts cliche as the gangsta type, and Clifton Collins Jr.
and Sara Gilbert hold up their end of the lower socio-economic
order as a wheeler-dealer and pregnant teen, respectively. Vanessa
Williams adds marquee value as a police negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The rigging frankly gets a bit transparent in ``Light It Up.''
And the concern over infusing it with upbeat values sometimes takes
precedence over dramatic spontaneity. Still, the film,
agitprop-heavy though it may be, is easy to get behind. It never
loses sight of its message that education is important. Ironically,
that's one of the things the kids are holding out for, along with
smaller class size and more _ and newer _ textbooks. The idea of
kids demanding respect and better education at gunpoint marks a
level most teen movies, especially ones flecked with violence,
seldom reach. Unlike most, it's about more than its hugely salable
soundtrack.

MAKING MUCH OF MUCHA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ ``I do not think of myself as a poster
artist,'' Alphonse Mucha told the New York Sun in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   But poster artist he was. He was a whiz at it, one of the
greatest designers of mass-market imagery at the turn of the
century. Mucha was also much more. A full-fledged member of the
international Art Nouveau movement that ranged from Tiffany stained
glass in New York to Charles Rennie Mackintosh houses in Glasgow to
Bakst ballet decor in St. Petersburg, Mucha designed everything
from a chic Parisian jewelry shop to agitprop ads for a Czech
gymnastics group that also promoted nationalism at a time when the
country was still under Hapsburg rule.
</P>
<P>
   His subjects went from the giddy to the somber. He was better at
the former, as attested by the more than 100 works in ``Alphonse
Mucha: The Spirit of Art Nouveau'' at the Worcester Art Museum
through Jan. 2. Decades before Warhol blurred the line between
commercial and fine art, Mucha yearned to stop designing menu
covers and become a great painter in oils. Finances had forced him
to go into commercial work in the first place, and he hit almost
instantly on a bold, linear, aggressively glamorous style. The oil
paintings in Worcester _ portraits, allegories, studies for ``The
Slav Epic,'' the cycle he considered the crown of his career _ are
by comparison pallid and treacly. Without the vivacious outlining
of the graphic work, the paintings' compositions go limp. The
palette is powdery. And in the age of Sargent's bravura brushwork,
Mucha's was tight and tame. Sargent and Mucha make an interesting
comparison. Both wanted out of their forte: Sargent became as weary
of portraiture as Mucha was of poster-making. Both proved less than
spectacularly successful as history painters. Occasionally, both
used a similar format: The style of Sargent's Boston Public Library
murals is kin to some of Mucha's work.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha's name is hardly as well known today as it was at his 1904
arrival in New York, where he was treated as a celebrity. The
underrecognition is partly due to politics. He was blacklisted by
the Nazis; much of his output spent decades behind the Iron
Curtain, in his native Czechoslovakia. The traveling exhibition now
at Worcester, organized by Art Services International, is the first
comprehensive presentation of his work in this country. The only
previous one was a 1921 show of some of his ``Slav Epic'' paintings
that visited Chicago and Brooklyn _ and attracted an astonishing
600,000 visitors. By then, the brief heyday of Art Nouveau was over
and Mucha, who clung to the style until his death in 1939, was
already retardataire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his signature images, recast as ``psychedelic'' in 1960s
dorm rooms, are more widely recognized than his name. One of the
most frequently reproduced is the 1897 poster promoting ``Bieres de
la Meuse.'' The voluptuous woman holding a beer stein, wearing a
crown of poppies, wheat, and hops, her robe slipping off one
shoulder, her hair extending into the looping ropes that came to be
called ``Mucha Macaroni,'' is completely typical of the artist's
cast of characters. He had an eye for women. It was a poster
commission from a woman _ the actress Sarah Bernhardt _ that
initially helped catapult him to fame. The walls of the Worcester
galleries are filled with lovely women looking out at you, many
with a wide-eyed stare reminiscent of the facial expressions in
silent movies. Mucha used female beauty to hawk everything from
bicycles to a potion called ``Jos. Triner's American Elixir of
Bitter Wine,'' just the thing for ladies with mysterious maladies.
</P>
<P>
   He understood subliminal selling. You barely see the cigarette
wrappers that are being pushed in one poster. Far more obvious are
the sinuous tendrils of smoke, as exaggerated as the hairdos on
Mucha's women or the opulently long necklace in a Mucha poster
featuring the actress Leslie Carter, whom he tried to make into an
American Bernhardt. (He couldn't.) A similar necklace is also in
the Worcester show. Made of gold, enamel, freshwater pearls,
mother-of-pearl, and semi-precious stones, it is Mucha's
reinterpretation of a Renaissance ornament, filtered through other
influences ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha's ultimate woman was the Divine Sarah. She was 5 feet
tall; he made her into a statuesque goddess through a vertical
format that became one of his trademarks. A room filled with
Bernhardt _ playing roles male and female, Hamlet to Medea _ opens
the Worcester show. In an image of her as Camille she's in a sea of
whiplash curves, silver stars, the eponymous flower, and its
curling root: The curl is, conveniently, both another Mucha
hallmark and a herald of the courtesan's coming death.

   A master in one of the most completely international styles in
art history, Mucha wanted, ironically, to create a specifically
Czech art. He achieved that only in subject matter, most notably in
the 20 gargantuan canvases, each over 18 by 24 feet, that make up
``The Slav Epic.'' Hidden during the German occupation of
Czechoslovakia, lest they inspire a patriotic uprising, they are
now housed in the castle of Moravsky Krumlov in southern Moravia,
not far from Mucha's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, and without much indication of Mucha's
achievements in architecture _ like the 1901 Fouquet Boutique, a
Parisian jewelry store re-created and now on view in that city's
Musee Carnavalet _ the show in Worcester can't be the last word on
the artist. But it's both beautiful and instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite falling off the charts for much of the 20th century,
Mucha has been extremely popular at various times in various
countries. The lenders to the current show are from as far afield
as Japan. You wonder how Mucha, who was deeply wounded by criticism
that he was somehow insufficiently Czech because he'd left his
homeland for so long, would feel about the identity of the biggest
private collector of his work _ tennis legend and Czech expatriate
Ivan Lendl.

   If ever there was a band custom-made for ``Behind the Music,''
it's the Allman Brothers Band. In three decades, they've endured
the deaths of two founding members, assorted drug and alcohol
problems, the ebb and flow of record sales, financial chicanery,
and in the case of organist Gregg Allman, a remarkably stupid,
mercifully short-lived marriage to Cher. And they've produced such
memorable music as ``Whipping Post,'' ``Jessica,'' ``In Memory of
Elizabeth Reed,'' and their biggest hit, ``Ramblin' Man.'' In its
current issue, Rolling Stone considers the Allman Brothers Band's
rockin' and rocky history, from its members' beginnings in various
Daytona Beach jam bands to their induction into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame. Writes Gavin Edwards, ``If you were looking for a
band from central casting to embody the story of American rock &AMP;
roll, you'd want to call the Allman Brothers Band.'' The band
remains popular, although it hasn't enjoyed a hit record in eons,
and has never been the most harmonious of groups. But the members'
love of the music has always been their common lifeblood, allowing
them to come together in spite of themselves. When Allman is asked
if, knowing what he does now about all the highs and lows, he would
do it all again, he pauses, and says, ``Yeah. Once the music gets
you, you'll go wherever it takes to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same issue, Rage Against the Machine, details its
internal problems, which threatened to derail the band before the
release of its stellar third album, ``The Battle of Los Angeles.''
Guitarist Tom Morello offers this image of the band's discord: ``It
was like (MTV's) `Real World' times ten.'' Somehow, it's hard to
imagine any comparison between the whiny narcissism of the seven
roommates on the MTV show, and the members of Rage who view their
music as a means to save the world. With what writer David Fricke
aptly describes as ``their electric hymns for the underclass,''
they've championed imprisoned activists Leonard Peltier and Mumia
Abu-Jamal, and denounced racism, sexism, and censorship. Says lead
singer Zack de la Rocha, ``That's why I'm in this band _ to give
space and volume to various struggles throughout the country and
the world. To me, the tension that exist in this band, and its
effect on me, is a minimal sacrifice.''

   At times, lesbians and gay men are so concerned about public
perception they allow a conspiracy of silence to envelope issues
that threaten their community's well-being. A worthy and timely
article in The Advocate spotlights one of these problems _ domestic
violence. According to a 1998 report, there were 2,574 reported
cases, including two murders. In New York, 50 percent of violent
crimes against gays and lesbians were cases of domestic abuse. Yet,
writer Mubarak Dahir reveals many victims, fearing they will be
outed, are reluctant to report the crimes. And then there's the
reticence within the gay and lesbian community itself to shed its
own denial about a problem now believed to affect more than 25
percent of couples. ``There's a tangible taboo against examining
any kind of problem in gay and lesbian relationships, out of fear
that someone like Jerry Falwell will grab on to it and distort it
as another reason gay and lesbian relationships aren't healthy,''
says anti-violence advocate Peter Sawires.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there's an airy feature on the ``25 Coolest Women,''
divided into three categories. There's ``Women Gay Men Love,'' with
such surprises as former presidential candidate and Viagra
beneficiary Elizabeth Dole and Secretary of State Madeline
Albright; ``Women Lesbians Love,'' with obvious icons like Martina
Navratilova and k.d. lang (called ``the virtual Frank Sinatra of
lesbians'') and Jodie Foster and Rosie O'Donnell with whom gay
girls just seem to have a special bond; then there's the women the
whole community digs, including Oprah Winfrey, Cher, and Hillary
Clinton. Larry Flick of Billboard says the wannabe US senator's
popularity among gay men is linked to her tomcattin' husband.
``Some boys tend to really identify with women done wrong by men.''

   I've been playing hyperviolent video games like Doom and Quake
for years, and I've managed not to get strapped, build bombs, or do
damage to anything and everyone around me. Then again, I'm not a
member of the ``peculiar subculture of young, white American
males,'' described by Paul Keegan in his examination of violent,
interactive entertainment in Mother Jones. Hanging out at the
recent Electronic Entertainment Exposition _ E3 _ in Los Angeles,
Keegan came up-close-and-personal with the sorts of games vilified
since the horror visited upon Columbine High School last spring by
two young, white American males with a penchant for violent
computer games, and far more insidious pursuits. Although cerebral
games like Myst and Riven are the all-time best sellers, it's the
body count games like Quake and Kingpin that get most of the ink
and airtime. These 3-D point-of-view games are so involving they
are ``closer to acid trips, altering your sense of perception in a
fundamental way,'' Keegan contends. But does that mean the games'
virtual violence is a direct link to real violence? Keegan allows
all sides of the argument _ sociologists, software developers, and
gamers _ to have their say. But he is convinced these games have a
dangerous impact on their players. ``If the media doesn't affect
real-world behavior, there would be no such thing as advertising,''
he writes. ``Arguing that these games have no effect at all is
absurd, given that everybody (at E3) is devoting his life to
developing increasingly powerful ways of fooling your mind and body
into believing the game experience is really happening to you.''

HART, WEIR CONTINUE AFTER-DEAD EXPERIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Grateful Dead are history, but alumni of the Dead keep on
trucking. Two of them _ Mickey Hart and Bob Weir _ are busily
pursuing separate projects that pay homage to their Dead legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hart is touring with publication of his new tome, ``Spirit Into
Sound: The Magic of Music,'' published by Grateful Dead Books. Weir
is touring with his group Ratdog, a funk-roots act with a bunch of
new songs, but also freshly reworked Dead chestnuts such as
``Terrapin Station'' and Jerry Garcia's ``The Wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We rotate three, maybe four new songs on a given night,'' says
Weir. ``The songs are kind of long, but that's what this band does
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's book describes his cosmic view of music as the gateway to
the soul. It also features many quotes from musicians, authors, and
sages that Hart has gathered the past 18 years. Some of the quotes
are from oral sources, such as Garcia, while others are from books
and magazines that Hart and partner Fredric Lieberman researched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy read, and a very sexy read, I think,'' says Hart.
``I tried to cover the waterfront to show that music is a necessary
part of life, not a fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more pithy contributions:
</P>
<P>
   Anais Nin: ``Music sobs for you. It laments, it rejoices, it
explodes with vigor and life.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cage: ``Everything you do is music and everywhere is the
best seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Morrison: ``We hide ourselves in our music to reveal
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marley: ``One good thing about music _ when it hits, you
feel no pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think of music as product, but really it's
vibration. It's the vibratory arts,'' says Hart, who was inspired
to write the book after he sent a bunch of quotes to friend (and
former Van Halen singer) Sammy Hagar, and Hagar memorized them and
recited them back. ``After he reacted so strongly, I knew I was on
the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir has also pursued his own track, keeping Ratdog alive and
finishing a musical on the life of baseball great Satchel Paige,
expected to debut at San Diego's Globe Theatre next year. Weir is
also eager to digitize the song archives of the Grateful Dead _ a
``major undertaking,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Both Weir and Hart also hope to resurrect the post-Grateful Dead
FurthurFestival next summer. It didn't occur this year because Dead
bassist Phil Lesh couldn't commit. The festival may proceed without
Lesh (``Phil is very unpredictable and he's wanted to do his own
thing, which I can understand because Mickey and I have been doing
that for years,'' says Weir).
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Ratdog may headline the festival, anchoring a bill
with Hart's Planet Drum and the Bruce Hornsby Band. Or there could
be a revival of the Other Ones (the band that had the above
principals and Lesh), with or without Lesh this time. ``It's all
still speculation at this point, but you'll see at least a few of
us out there next year,'' says Hart.

STILL ROTUND, AND STILL STANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years ago, at the bar of the aptly named Wayfarer
in Bedford, N.H., hard by the
artificial-waterfall-most-often-broadcast on television, Bob Healy
of The Boston Globe introduced me to a balding rotund gent:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nyhan, say hello to Jack Germond. He's always the last man
standing.'' So he was. So he is. Still bald, still rotund, still
standing, and still calling his shots with the practiced efficiency
of a pool player who makes a living at nine-ball. Jack Germond is
one of of the handful of journalists whose thumbs-up or thumbs-down
counts in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known now as a TV talking-head, Germond is a man of print
first. Like David Broder, the scrupulously nonpartisan
reporter-pundit of The Washington Post, and Bob Novak, the
first-rate-reporter-turned-scrupulously-partisan articulator of the
conservative position du jour, Germond is a print guy first, with
instant access to the mighty, and the minions who service them in
the political equivalent of the royal court.
</P>
<P>
   Germond forsook sportswriting early for political journalism for
the best possible reason: not to save the world by the flickering
light of what Joseph Conrad warned against as any possible ``-ism''
or ``-ology,'' but for the sheer hell of it _ the fun. Now comes
``Fat Man in a Middle Seat; 40 years of covering politics,''
(Random House), a page-turning collection of yarns and common sense
distilled from four decades of tracking the spoor of the
politicians who make the biz such a hell-bent-for-election
adventure, hilarious and heartbreaking in turn.
</P>
<P>
   No punches are pulled in this memoir. He dismisses George Bush
the Elder as ``a totally amoral campaigner . . . he would do
whatver it took to win an election . . . he was such a whiner it
was embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Germond recounts one stomach-turning event when Bush received
the endorsement of a New York man whose policeman son had been
murdered. Primed by henchmen to demonize rival Michael Dukakis,
Bush said: ``If the liberal governor of Massachusetts doesn't
understand it when a Matt Byrne stands up and creates a foundation
for his son, I do and so do the American people.'' Added Germond:
``What struck me later as I repeated this story to my friends was
that the reporters of my generation, the older hacks, were the only
ones appalled by the willingness of a presidential candidate to
stoop so low.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cover-your-fanny right-wing slant of network
television in general, and PBS in particular, the sidelines have
been moved for broadcast political comment. As a result of this
tropism that began with the odious Nixon years, someone like Jack
Germond _ a cheerfully moderate, middle-of-the-road skeptic _
became the left-iest commentator on lowest-common-denominator talk
shows. No hare-brained liberal he. Nor hair-brained either.
</P>
<P>
   But he often finds himself cast against strident defenders of
the right, who are often not right, by my rights, which of course
may not be right either. Watching Germond swat back the likes of
John McLaughlin or Bob Novak became a parlor sport for a generation
of the kind of college-educated up-market voters who resign
themselves to their civic duty and watch the political gabble on
the boob tube. Sit with Germond on a park bench or bar stool
anywhere, and someone walks up and initiates a political
conversation because they've bonded with him, TV-wise.
</P>
<P>
   The polite ones are met with politeness; the nonpolite deserve
what they can get, depending on the weather. Among the latter
category are fringe political candidates with high opinions of
themselves who whine that they deserve better from the mainstream
media. ``Don't waste my time'' is one of Germond's kinder
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   But no man can be a cynic who visits the track on a regular
basis. By definition, the bettor on horses is at heart an optimist.
If Germond were luckier at the ponies than in his political
prognostications, he'd be rich. But few are richer in his range and
breadth of pals. In any state, any city you can name, he knows a
friend, a bar, the best place to eat, and is on a first-name basis
with six people who can tell you what's really going on.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime running mate is Jules Witcover, a saturnine
reporter whose energy level and relentless pride in craft matches
that of The Fat Man in a Middle Seat. One of their dwindling breed,
Tom Ottenad of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, just died at 77, an
insider's insider whose reporting skills and analytical objectivity
made him not only a source but a treasure to his rivals and
friends, often one and the same. They are a hardy crew, these road
warriors who beat the bushes decade in, decade out, ferreting out
the next Bill Clinton, the next John McCain. They know readers are
sullen, editors are impatient, and publishers can be cheap. But
they live the life they love, and at the end of the day, raise a
glass. So here's to Jack Germond: the last man standing, even when
squashed into that middle seat.

A SAD DAY FOR THE FRIENDS (AND READERS) OF GEORGE V. HIGGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Frazier, the late and acerbic Boston Globe columnist,
could spot talent and start a fight simultaneously. What's with
your pal Higgins and his middle initial, he asked one day in the
1970s. No novelist needs that, he rasped. Who ever heard of Norman
Q. Mailer?
</P>
<P>
   It's a Catholic school thing, I told Frazier. A parochial school
or a public school jammed with Joey Kellys, Jimmy O'Briens, and
Billy Murphys needs a large supply of middle initials. Besides,
that's George's name and he's not keen on a marketing plan that
would shun his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier praised ``The Friends of Eddie Coyle,'' inventing middle
names for the author, including ``George Vliet Higgins,'' the
middle name of the then-mayor of New York City, John V. Lindsay.
But Frazier didn't change George V. Higgins. Nor did anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In his life, which ended a week short of his 60th birthday, he
was a brilliant teacher at Boston University; a devoted husband and
father; an assistant attorney general of Massachusetts; a federal
prosecutor; a trial lawyer; the best editor I ever had, who could
exhume a strong active verb from passive-voice mush; and the
creator of characters who spoke a distinctive New England vulgate
that will live for generations.
</P>
<P>
   When editors were updating ``Bartlett's Familiar Quotations,''
one asked me for nominations. Two from ``Eddie Coyle'' stood out. A
cop asks Coyle how he can help. Eddie growls that he could use ``a
good leavin' alone.'' Jackie Brown, a gun-runner, rejects a
customer, explaining, ``This life's hard, but it's harder if you're
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   George did not make the cut. Bartlett's contains five quotes
from an earlier, lesser Boston novelist, Willian Dean Howells, none
more telling than a Higgins line from ``Outlaws:'' ``Morality often
takes credit for middle-age fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics thought his ear for dialogue relied on transcripts from
the US Attorney's office. Higgins actually learned those cadences
as a student, hauling cases of Coca-bleepin'-Cola to thirsty
residents of Greater Brockton. He belonged to the last generation
to afford the tuition to Boston College by doing hard physical
work. The divide between blue-collar life and academe, between
street smarts and erudition, was thinner then. What Jesuit
discipline did not instill in him, the Associated Press did. Those
toiling for the AP quickly conquer writer's block.
</P>
<P>
   On Nantucket one summer, as we frolicked with our kids, the late
John Chancellor delighted George by saying ``Cogan's Trade'' was
his favorite. Of that novel, his third, John Gregory Dunne said
Sunday, ``That book is perfection from intent to achievement.
There's not a mistake in it.'' Elmore Leonard called Higgins ``my
favorite'' and Mordecai Richler noted that literary arbiters
punished him for being so prolific. They can stop that now.
</P>
<P>
   He was loyal to his friends and loyal to his no-compromise code.
On a chilly opening day at Fenway Park, I suggested we adjourn to a
bar for the final innings. Shocked, he asked if the rules had
changed. Yes, I said, they change when we get older. But on
literary standards, his rules were unbending. Yes, Edwin O'Connor's
novels had great dialogue, but George argued that narrative was
cheating. If quote marks did not dominate, the author was running
out of the basepath.
</P>
<P>
   Our last conversation was about the Red Sox, who so often
resembled the hopeful clientele of Jerry Kennedy, the lawyer in a
Higgins trilogy. The protagonists to whom he gave voice were often
like their author, not given to compromise or marketability.
Kennedy, Coyle, Jackie Cogan, Digger Doherty, Ways and Means
Reardon, Panda Feeney and the others did it their way.
</P>
<P>
   His friends and readers feel the way Billy Wilder and William
Wyler felt at the funeral of their fellow director, Ernst Lubitsch,
in 1947. ``No more Lubitsch,'' sighed Wilder. ``Worse yet,'' said
Wyler, ``No more Lubitsch pictures.''

OUT OF COLUMBINE, A LESSON ABOUT RACIAL HATRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Isaiah Shoels was gunned down in the Columbine massacre
last spring, eyewitnesses said that killers Dylan Klebold and Eric
Harris shouted ``nigger.'' As Isaiah Shoels lay dead or dying, a
laughing Klebold or Harris was reported to have said either, ``Hey,
I always wondered what nigger brains looked like,'' or ``Look at
this black kid's brain. Awesome, man!''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Isaiah's parents, Michael and Vonda Shoels,
have asked Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the killing
of their son as a ``hate crime conspiracy.'' Vonda went so far as
to say the death of her son ``was worse than the others. What
happened to Isaiah was worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a statement and other actions have not endeared Shoels's
parents to a Colorado still coping with the tragedy in which 12
students and a teacher were killed and 23 others were wounded. The
Shoelses have asked for more money than the $50,000 they were given
from a United Way fund, saying past vandalism and fear of future
racial incidents forced them from their house and their children
into private schools. When the United Way balked, the Shoelses
teamed up with New York activist Al Sharpton to call for a national
boycott of the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   If that was not enough, the Shoelses hired Geoffrey Fieger, the
attorney for assisted suicide doctor Jack Kevorkian, to sue the
parents of Klebold and Harris. In blaming Klebold's and Harris's
parents for not doing enough to prevent their sons from going on
their rampage, the Shoelses have pushed presumptions to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those parents taught those children hate,'' Michael Shoels
told The New York Times. ``They raised children who hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shoelses, and particularly their request for more money,
resulted in a noticable backlash on talk shows, newspaper letters
pages, and editorials in both the Denver Post and the Rocky
Mountain News. The Post criticized the ``erratic'' actions of the
parents whose suffering ``was no worse than that borne by the
families of the other students.'' The News bluntly said, ``It's
time for (the Shoelses) to stop playing the perpetual victim.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Isaiah Shoels is, of course, no ``worse'' than
the others. The massacre left untold and immeasurable tragedies in
its wake, a point horribly reinforced last month when Carla
Hochhalter, the mother of a Columbine senior who was paralyzed in
the shooting, walked into a pawn shop, asked to see some handguns,
and shot herself to death at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the Shoelses have a propensity for going over
the top does not mean that there is no lesson to be learned.
Isaiah's death should remind us of an erupting truth, one that
should bedevil white people as much as it does people of color.
</P>
<P>
   White racism can help kill white people.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Shoels was the only African-American killed out of the 12
students. He was the only African-American killed by two young men
who saluted Hitler after making strikes at a bowling alley. He was
the only African-American killed by a Klebold and Harris who talked
in a racist manner during video class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric would say, `You know, I wish we could kill all the
niggers,'' classmate Jon Ungerland said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this and the account of the shooting, local authorities,
seeing that a dozen youths and a teacher _ most of them white _
were killed, have downplayed the notion that the killing of Shoels
was racially motivated. Klebold and Harris were said to have also
hated scholars and athletes. Jefferson County District Attorney
Dave Thomas said, ``I don't believe that Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold went to Columbine to kill anybody specific . . . their
hatred seems to have been fairly widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   Widespread yes, but not so widespread as to ignore that race
hatred, however muted compared to the 1950s, remains a far more
enduring and endemic hatred than that of athletes and scholars. In
a nation where people of all colors often work side by side, and
suburban schools have at least a few students like Isaiah Shoels,
everyday white people (as compared to white civil rights workers in
the 1950s and '60s) are arguably more at risk of being victimized
by white racists than perhaps they want to admit.
</P>
<P>
   One need no greater example than the Oklahoma City bombing. The
bombing took 168 lives of all colors. Timothy McVeigh was largely
portrayed in the media as an antigovernment figure. The most
underplayed aspect of his background was his racial hatred. When he
was in the Army, McVeigh handed out copies of ``The Turner
Diaries,'' a novel of a triumphant, murderous rampage by white men
over African-Americans, Jews, and the government.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be a mere coincidence that the nation's worst school
shooting and office bombing were committed by people full of racial
hate. Isaiah Shoels's death was not worse than that of any other
student at Columbine. But we will make it worse if we continue to
deny the power of racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris, like McVeigh before them, had many sources
of hate. Racial hate has a fuse that is, with the possible
exception of homophobia, easier to light than any other. Today,
once that fuse is lit, you no longer can predict who will be killed
by the explosion.

   Miniature robots that can bounce up stairs and explore buildings
have been developed by researchers at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis. The robots could be used in urban warfare or help
police to foil hostage-takers in a siege.
</P>
<P>
   Nikos Papanikolopoulos and his colleagues have tested the
ability of a series of robotic ``scouts'' to gather information.
They envisage a group of scouts being lobbed by a grenade launcher
into a building that is too dangerous for police officers, to
explore and send back information via a radio link.
</P>
<P>
   Each robot is roughly the size and shape of a roll of toilet
paper, with a diameter of 4 centimeters. It moves around by rolling
and hopping and stays in touch with other scouts by radio. ``The
jumping mechanism, along with the software that makes it jump, is
the largest accomplishment,'' Papanikolopoulos says. ``Hopping is
done by a spring-loaded mechanism that winches in a leg. Then,
suddenly, it is released.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the leg hitting the floor causes the robot to
jump, ``like kicking a leg.'' It can also climb stairs and hurdle
small barriers. Two independent wheels at either end of the
cylinder help the robot to roll into position.
</P>
<P>
   Each scout has a tiny sensor. One has a video camera that pops
out of its body, panning and tilting to capture images of the
surrounding area. Other scouts have small vibration sensors and
microphones.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scouts would be deployed at once and controlled from
a mobile ``home base.'' The 50-kilogram base is in turn operated
remotely and acts as a radio repeater, allowing a greater distance
to be maintained between the scouts and the people digesting the
images. The researchers hope that the people will be more than 400
meters away from the front line.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of multiple robots working together is known as
distributed robotics, explains Paul Schenker, supervisor of the
Mechanics and Robotics Technology Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory near Pasadena, Calif. ``A number of groups are working
on distributed robotics,'' he says. The idea is that multiple
robots can provide diverse information about what is going on
inside a building, for example by beaming back video pictures of an
object from different angles.
</P>
<P>
   Papanikolopoulos' research is being financed by the U.S.
military and is scheduled to be finished by 2002. So far his team
has successfully tested the robot's locomotion system and the video
camera's ability to pan and tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The main application for the robots will be urban warfare or
police rescue operations. But they could also be useful for
civilian intelligence-gathering. ``CNN would love something like
this,'' Papanikolopoulos says. &QL;

   Why did the geneticist cross the chicken? To turn it into a
cheap pharmaceuticals factory, it seems. Comical as it may sound,
two companies are planning a pilot test of drugs in eggs laid by
genetically engineered chickens.
</P>
<P>
   GeneWorks of Ann Arbor, Mich., announced this month that it has
a flock of between 50 and 60 genetically engineered birds. Some
carry a gene that enables them to make a human growth factor in
their eggs, while others produce a human antibody.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company will not name the proteins, it says that
both have great potential for treating disease. According to its
chief operating officer Steve Sensoli, GeneWorks has deals to make
14 proteins for six drug companies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AviGenics of Athens, Ga., has produced a human
interferon for treating cancer in its flock of birds. It claims to
have a slight lead on its rival because it has already managed to
pass on the interferon gene to further generations of birds.
</P>
<P>
   With hens producing an average of 200 eggs each per year, and
100 milligrams or more of a drug in each egg, both companies
believe the yields could be large and lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The companies smuggle genes into the birds using harmless forms
of viruses that are engineered so they cannot replicate. The gene
that makes the protein is inserted in the virus.
</P>
<P>
   GeneWorks uses the reticulo endotheliosis virus as a ferry. The
company uses a genetic switch that restricts production of the
protein to the egg white. ``We put it in a one-day-old chicken
embryo by microinjecting it into a cavity called the blastoderm,''
Sensoli says. He and his colleagues hope that some virus reaches
primordial cells in the blastoderm which develop into sperm and
eggs, so the gene for the protein can be passed down to future
generations of chickens, rather than having to repeat the injection
in each generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the company can already harvest the proteins from hens that
have been injected and next year plans to open a production plant
capable of making ``metric tons'' of protein.
</P>
<P>
   AviGenics already has transgenic cockerels producing new
generations of GM birds. ``They're very busy,'' says Carl Marhaver,
the company's president. AviGenics uses the avian leukosis virus as
a gene shuttle. ``We microinject it into the pronucleus in the egg
yolk,'' Marhaver says. The gene is then expressed in all the
chicken's cells. AviGenics plans to contract out production and
protein purification to companies which already produce vaccines in
chicken eggs _ a long-established practice in the pharmaceuticals
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Sang, a chicken biotechnology researcher at the Roslin
Institute in Edinburgh, England, is encouraged by the companies'
work. ``It is good progress, and proof of principle,'' she says.
Sang, who is developing a virus-free method of shuttling genes into
chickens, points out that the technology has been in development
for a decade. But she is disappointed that neither company is keen
to publish openly in the scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   Sensoli says the work it too commercially sensitive to publish,
and all but two of the proteins under development are unknown
outside the companies that discovered them. ``It's a shame we can't
blow our horn a bit more,'' he says. &QL;

<P>
   USTI NAD LABEM, Czech Republic _ Ludmilla Doubkova flung open
her windows to chastise a Gypsy boy who had climbed onto the wall
outside and was scribbling on it with blue chalk.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, 9-year-old Honza Ondo, jumped down, but not before he
cursed her.
</P>
<P>
   Doubkova shook her head, Honza settled onto the sidewalk to play
cards with his friends, and the latest skirmish along Europe's most
disputed wall had ended once again in an acrimonious draw.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the Berlin Wall was torn down, a much smaller,
more aesthetically pleasing barrier has gone up here on Maticni
Street, separating white Czechs from their darker Roma, or Gypsy,
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The white, yellow, and brown wall is 7 feet high and as long as
a football field. And if it had been meant to save those like
Doubkova from having to look at or hear the Gypsies across the
street, it has failed miserably. But the wall, which went up Oct.
13, has already assumed much larger symbolic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   If at one level this is simply a neighborhood tiff, it mirrors a
wider, more fundamental debate about where the 300,000 Gypsies
living in the Czech Republic fit in this country and in the rest of
central and eastern Europe. The region is home to 8 million of the
world's 12 million Roma, a typically nomadic ethnic group who came
originally from India and scattered widely across Europe and Asia
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has demanded that the wall be torn down, and
European Commission president Romano Prodi suggests that the Czech
Republic's membership in the EU could be held up if the wall stays
up. It has even raised the ire of some in the US Congress, where
Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican, is among
those who have called for its dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by the attention, the Czech government has appointed
one of its deputy prime ministers to get the wall torn down but has
been wary of going over the heads of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just the town of Usti nad Labem, but the whole of the
Czech Republic is identified abroad with this symbol of intolerance
and discrimination,'' President Vaclav Havel said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the town's mayor, Ladislav Hruska, is unabashed in his
defense of the wall and scoffed at the international outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As mayor,'' he said, ``I am not ruled by foreign demands, but
consider the priority to be the social demands of the town's
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed at ground level, the controversy in this gray industrial
town of 100,000 on the River Elbe seems small-scale. By the
residents' own count, it was a group of no more than 11 people who
had asked the local government to wall off the Gypsies living in
three apartment buildings across the street.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 Roma families live in the apartment buildings, one of
which is empty.
</P>
<P>
   Doubkova, 46, her husband, and their three children amount to
nearly half of the non-Gypsies living across the street. She said
the Roma let their children run wild, while the adults congregate
at night, making noise and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have manners,'' she said of her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Doubkova said that she and her family have lived here for 19
years, and that things began to deteriorate six years ago, when the
mostly elderly residents of the apartment blocks gradually moved
out and were replaced by Roma. She resents criticism by outsiders,
who suggest she and others who support the wall are racists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to criticize,'' she said. ``We have to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   As it weighs the applications of 10 former Soviet-bloc
countries, the European Union is critical of their treatment of
Gypsies, and it singled out the Czech Republic for particular
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Roma children in the Czech Republic are
assigned to schools for the mentally disabled, barring them from a
chance at a university education. They are stigmatized from the
start, and by the time they get out of school, if they go at all,
there are few jobs waiting for them. Unemployment estimates for
Roma range from 70 to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Roma turn to petty crime. Many Czechs blame them for most
crime, and dismiss them as incurably lazy.
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, one of the most enlightened cities in Europe,
``skinhead'' toughs lurk outside the main railway station, looking
for Roma to attack or intimidate.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the young racists catch and kill a gypsy. Last
year, a 26-year-old Romani woman was chased into a river by
skinheads and drowned. A short time later, four skinheads beat a
Romani man and left him on a road, where he was run over and
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Havel's impassioned calls for tolerance, some Czechs
shrug and say Gypsies have it coming.
</P>
<P>
   Seven bottles of cheap booze constitute the top shelf at Eva
Kompertova's bar on the corner of Maticni Street. There is no
bottom shelf. Kompertova was born 53 years ago in one of the three
hulking apartment blocks across the street she no longer wants to
see. She went to school in the building that is now her bar. She
serves Gypsies who want a drink, but, as she put it, ``I wouldn't
let them in my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kompertova insists she is not a racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are different from the rest of us,'' she said. ``They
don't want to live like you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some leading Roma acknowledge that. Many Gypsies cannot
decide whether to integrate more deeply into the wider Czech
society. But according to Karel Holomek, one of only 600 Czech
Gypsies to survive the Holocaust, they are not being given much of
an incentive from the white people they call ``gadjo.''
</P>
<P>
   Holomek, who edits Bohemian Romano Hangos (Romani Voice), says
the news media exaggerate the shortcomings of Roma, while paying
little attention to their institutional exclusion from Czech
society.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Roma children arrive at school unable to speak
Czech. In an educational system lacking bilingual teachers, that is
an automatic sentence to schools for the mentally retarded and a
life on the margins.
</P>
<P>
   Across Maticni Street, in one of the crumbling apartment
buildings, Lidie Demeterova and her 20-year-old daughter, Veronika,
acknowledge that many of their Roma neighbors do not supervise
their children properly.
</P>
<P>
   But Lidie Demeterova, whose 19-year-old son serves proudly in
the Czech Army, gets animated when she talks about how the gadjo
lump all Roma together, refusing to distinguish between good
families like hers and those who behave irresponsibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a second-class citizen,'' she said. ``Even when I see a
low-life gadjo, I know that in this society I am below him. You can
look good, look clean, you can work, but you're still a Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Czechs think the wall was a waste of money. Libor Masicek,
47, a teacher, says the money spent on the wall could have been
used to refurbish the town's 40-year-old bus shelters, which are
rusting away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed by all this talk about the wall,'' said
Masicek. ``It makes us all look like racists.''
</P>
<P>
   While important people in Prague, Brussels, and Washington wring
their hands about the wall, most people here seem unperturbed, and
many voice approval of it. Two other Czech towns are considering
building similar walls.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, this town's representative in a teenage beauty
contest, Magdalena Babicka, was asked by the judges what she wanted
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public prosecutor,'' she replied cheerfully, ``so that I
might cleanse our town of all the dark-skinned people.''
</P>
<P>
   She received a warm ovation from the audience.

ATTACKS ON ABORTION DOCTORS STIR FEAR THROUGH CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ In Canada, this is the season of dread
for doctors on the front lines of the abortion rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, in rifle attacks from British Columbia
to eastern Ontario, a phantom gunman known as the Remembrance Day
sniper has ambushed doctors who provide abortions, killing one and
wounding four in late October and early November.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the attacks, including the slaying last year of Dr.
Barnett Slepian near Buffalo, actually occurred in upstate New
York, not far from the Canadian border. But all occurred around the
time of Nov. 11, known as Remembrance Day in Canada, a solemn day
of commemoration for the war dead _ and a day that some
antiabortion activists have adopted to mourn unborn fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the sniper has become so pervasive in Canada that many
of the country's abortion doctors, on advice from police, now wear
bulletproof vests, have installed video monitors and motion
detectors around their residences, and keep their window shades
tightly drawn day and night. All of the victims were shot at their
homes through an uncurtained window or door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an open season,'' said Celia Posyniak, director of
the Kensington Clinic in Calgary, Alberta. ``We go into this tunnel
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Police hope that a massive international manhunt underway in 50
states and the 10 Canadian provinces has driven the sniper so deep
into hiding he won't dare attempt another attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime suspect remains at large _ hidden, investigators
are convinced, by a sympathetic underground of radical antiabortion
activists.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the investigation is James Charles Kopp, a
44-year-old abortion foe whose last known address was in northern
Vermont. Kopp earlier this year was placed on the FBI's ``10 Most
Wanted'' list while rewards totaling $375,000 have been posted by
Canadian authorities for a conviction in the woundings of doctors
in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't over. We're not going to stop until we catch
whoever is responsible,'' said Inspector Keith McCaskill of the
Winnipeg, Manitoba, police, who heads the Canadian task force
investigating the shootings. ``Meanwhile, we don't want people to
become less vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian police last month urged all abortion providers to wear
bulletproof vests off the job as well as on, even at home. ``Do not
put on or take off your body armor in public,'' warned the circular
distributed to the 1,500 members of Canada's Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Lalonde, the society's executive vice president, said
there is ``widespread anxiety'' among doctors specializing in
women's health, even those who don't perform abortions. ``When you
have physicians talking about not daring to eat breakfast with the
shades open, that's pretty significant,'' Lalonde said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks started on Nov. 8, 1994, when Garson Romalis, then
57, a British Columbia gynecologist who performed abortions at his
Vancouver clinic, waited for bread to pop out of his toaster. From
out of the early morning gloom, two high-powered 7.62mm rifle slugs
smashed through the window of his suburban home. One ripped into
his thigh, shattering bone and severing an artery. He nearly bled
to death on the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe that four subsequent ambushes were undertaken by
the same lone rifleman, although Kopp has only been charged with
Slepian's murder.
</P>
<P>
   --On Nov. 10, 1995, a sniper's bullet smashed the arm of Dr.
Hugh Short, a gynecologist with an abortion practice, as he watched
television at home in Ancaster, Ontario. He retired from medicine
as the result of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   --On Oct. 28, 1997, a physician with an abortion practice was
wounded by a shot fired through the window of a home in Richmond,
N.Y. Police refuse to release the name of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   --On Nov. 11, 1997, Dr. Jack Fainman, a Winnipeg gynecologist,
was struck by a bullet fired through the window of his home. He
therafter abandoned his abortion practice.
</P>
<P>
   --On Oct. 23, 1998, Slepian, the father of four, was killed by a
sniper's round fired through the window of his home in Amherst,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Observers call it significant that the victims were relatively
obscure medics, not high-profile abortion advocates. ``The intent
of these attacks is obviously to frighten off ordinary doctors who
give this legal medical service,'' said Dr. Henry Morgantaler, who
still provides abortions at his Toronto clinic despite death
threats and a 1993 bomb attack. ``I personally have developed a
philosophy of fatalism.''
</P>
<P>
   About 107,000 abortions are performed every year in Canada, one
for every 3.5 live births. All abortions are paid for with tax
dollars under the country's national health care system.
</P>
<P>
   There is an active antiabortion movement in Canada. But
defenders of the procedure say the most virulent foes come from
south of the border. They point the finger at American activists
for the climate of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much concerned about people coming across the
border and inciting violence,'' said Marilyn Wilson, executive
director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League. ``There are
a lot of antiabortion fanatics coming in with criminal records and
carrying hate-type literature.''

   TOKYO _ Nobody pushes Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura around,
including his own political party.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the most outspoken U.S. state administrator flew
halfway around the world to promote trade with Japan despite his
independent party's protectionist platform.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through his first official overseas trip since taking
office one year ago, Ventura spoke with Asahi Evening News on Nov.
5 about his 10-day trade mission to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Puffing on a Cuban cigar _ a product prohibited in the United
States because of trade restrictions _ Ventura, known to the world
as ``The Body'' and ``The Brain,'' made it clear his Reform Party's
isolationist views do not reflect his personal agenda of free trade
and opening new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the best job I can do for Minnesota is to
isolate us,'' Ventura said. ``In fact, I treat Minnesota like it is
my own nation. That's why...we're here to trade with Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's economy, one of the strongest among all the nation's
states, is also healthier than 75 percent of the world's countries.
Only next-door neighbor Canada does more trade with Minnesota than
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Minnesota's soybean, pork and corn
interests also accompanied Ventura to Japan. Minnesota's
agriculture industry has suffered more than other private sectors
from Asia's economic downturn. Last year, food and farm exports
were down 14 percent from 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is timed to catch Japan as it rebounds from recession.
``I firmly believe they're going to recover from it, and we want to
be on the ground floor when that recovery takes place,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's first deal of the trip, cemented in Tokyo on Nov. 5,
is an agreement by food distributor Nichimen Corp. to buy 110 tons
of pork each month from a Minnesota meat company. But when asked
what other visible developments might result from this visit,
Ventura said most of the benefits will take time to see fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese might better recognize Ventura from his days as a
bad-guy professional wrestler who performed in Japan during the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Still others might know him as a supporting actor in action
movies _ either stalking Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``The Running
Man'' or being stalked in ``Predator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura, also a former mayor, says he receives more respect
in Japan than back home, where he finds it difficult to escape his
celebrity past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me with a great deal of dignity here _ more dignity
than I get in the United States,'' he said. ``(Japanese] address me
as `governor.' Not for my own ego but because it's the office that
I hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who served for six years with the U.S. Navy's elite
SEAL organization, was also asked his thoughts about controversies
surrounding of U.S. military members stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that while U.S. servicemen should be held to high
behavior standards, Ventura acknowledged certain disruptions will
inevitably occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to remember that (these are) young men serving in the
military who have access to alcohol and things of that nature.
They're going to misbehave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that compromise must be carefully evaluated by
Japanese and U.S. officials, Ventura reckoned, ``It's a price that
Japan pays for having our protection.'' &QL;

AFTER THE HORROR, HOPE: RWANDA FOES MOVE CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUHENGERI, Rwanda _ It has been five years since the ethnic
massacres left more than 800,000 people dead, and in that time the
Orphanage of the Benedictine Sisters of Ruhengeri has come to
symbolize the kind of place Rwanda is _ and the country it hopes to
become.
</P>
<P>
   Children are still arriving to seek shelter with the nuns. They
are survivors of periodic violent attacks, carried out, it is
widely suspected, by exiled Hutu extremists who cross into this
northwestern town from neighboring Congo in a drive to finish the
slaughter of minority Tutsi that started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, it has become a two-way street. The nuns
have begun to place some children in successful adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   They have one strict condition: ``We never let the prospective
family know if the child is Hutu or Tutsi,'' said Sister Mary
Chuilene, who runs the orphanage. ``We don't want the people to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Caught between a state of perpetual siege and the hope of
healing its deeply traumatized society, Rwanda has begun to take
the first steps toward a national reconciliation. As the first
step, the complex undertaking requires the establishment of the
rule of law in a country torn by decades of government-sponsored
terror.
</P>
<P>
   Its goal, however, is simple: the creation of a national
identity that is neither Hutu nor Tutsi, but Rwandan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time Hutus and Tutsis have been challenged
to question their ideas about their country and their history,''
said Aloisea Inyumba, head of the newly formed National Unity and
Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi is critical to central
Africa. Rwanda, now under the control of a predominantly Tutsi
government, has launched back-to-back wars against Congo for
harboring thousands of Hutu who are believed to be involved in the
1994 killings. And Burundi once again teeters on the brink of civil
war, as peace talks falter between the two groups in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly larger than Massachusetts, Rwanda is a land of steep
rolling hills planted with banana groves, potato mounds, and deeply
rooted ethnic myths. The conventional view is this: The Hutu, who
make up 80 percent of a population of roughly 7 million, are a
Bantu people originating from south and west of Rwanda; the Tutsi,
14 percent of the population, are a Nilotic people from the north
and east. Furthermore, the myth holds, the Hutu are short with
broad flat noses; the Tutsi are tall and slender.
</P>
<P>
   But as historians point out, Rwandans are not what they, and the
world, have been taught to believe. In fact, Hutu and Tutsi belong
to the same 18 clans. They are tightly intertwined through
marriage, speak the same language, share a common religion, and
recognize the same chiefs. Physically, they are indistinguishable
even to one another, so much so that the Hutu government issued
mandatory identity cards prior to 1995 to give itself a reliable
means of determining ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably more accurate to view the differences between
Hutu and Tutsi as a function of class rather than race. In a
society where wealth is measured in cattle, herdsmen were
aristocrats and nominally Tutsi, while farmers were peasants and
nominally Hutu. A Hutu could become a Tutsi through marriage or the
accumulation of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all this mixing, ethnographers and historians have
lately come to agree that Hutu and Tutsi cannot properly be called
distinct ethnic groups,'' Philip Gourevitch wrote in his
authoritative book on the 1994 slaughter, ``We Wish to Inform You
That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the names Hutu and Tutsi stuck. The source of the
distinction is undisputed: Hutus were cultivators and Tutsis were
herdsmen. This is the original inequality.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Belgian colonial rule, however, the distinctions became
decidedly ethnic. Concepts of racial superiority and inferiority
were introduced to Rwandan children at school. Using wealth and
physical characteristics as ethnic yardsticks, the Belgians
empowered the Tutsi and suppressed the Hutu majority. Social and
economic cleavages opened.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Hutu advocating independence in the late 1950s
embraced the divide, arguing that Tutsi were foreign aggressors and
that democracy meant rule by the majority _ the Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   And since Rwanda gained independence in 1960, the Tutsi have
suffered massacre after massacre. The last round was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, Hutu government radio broadcasts called on Hutu
people across the country to kill Tutsi as well as liberal Hutu.
The slaughter that followed was perhaps more efficient than the
Nazis' extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust. Conditioned by
decades of polarizing ethnic politics, brother turned against
brother, husband against wife. More than 800,000 people were slain
in less than three months, according to UN estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, killing a Tutsi was not a crime, and people
cannot understand it as a crime,'' said Tom Ndahiro, a member of
the recently formed National Human Rights Commission. ``In the
1960s, stealing one's goat was more of a crime than killing a
Tutsi.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how to rebuild a society so deeply
fractured. After ousting the Hutu regime, the Tutsi-led Rwandan
Patriotic Front established a transitional government, brought all
corners of the country under tight military control, and began
repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees scattered
during and after the slaughter. Identity cards were abolished, and
thousands of ex-Hutu soldiers were integrated into the new national
army.
</P>
<P>
   The government also began to round up perpetrators. It enacted a
law in late 1996 to expedite the judicial process and build a more
complete record of what happened by coaxing more people to trade
confessions for lighter sentences. As a result, more than 120,000
Rwandans, just a fraction of all those who committed atrocities,
now sit in crowded, decrepit prisons awaiting trial. The courts,
capable of prosecuting only about 600 cases a year, are clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government, made up of both Hutu and Tutsi, is
broadening its approach to reconciliation. This year, Rwandans
voted for the first time in local elections, the first round of
successive ballots designed to create an ethos of accountability at
all levels of government. Regional elections will follow soon, and
ultimately a national vote. Two new commissions, meanwhile, will
oversee public debates on unity and reconciliation, promote human
rights, and monitor public officials and political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The glut of genocide cases, however, poses a serious obstacle.
To cope, the country is now contemplating a proposal to adapt an
indigenous system of community tribunals to try all but the most
serious offenders. Known as gacacas (ga-CHA-CHA), these are
traditional courts in which a jury of elders judged disputes before
the whole village. Named after a kind of grass, they often convened
in open fields.
</P>
<P>
   Applied to genocide cases, gacacas would bring perpetrators and
their victims together at the village, regional, or provincial
level _ depending on the severity of the crime _ hear the case, and
pass a sentence according to national guidelines. The 12 provincial
courts would then be reserved for the planners of the 1994
slaughter. A bill to create such a system is due before parliament
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But excising four decades of ethnic hatred from the national
memory will not be easy. A kind of normality prevails on the
surface, yet everywhere people who bear the grotesque physical
scars of machete attacks, and carry the burden of terrible loss,
are bumping shoulders with killers concealing terrible secrets.
</P>
<P>
   To lay the groundwork for her commission, Inyumba has been
holding more than 150 public meetings around the country to hear
what reconciliation means to ordinary Rwandans. She carries a
simple message: ethnic hatred in Rwanda is based on false
differences perpetuated under colonialism, and therefore has no
historical basis. It is a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   Mwumvaneza Felicien, a university student of public
administration, has heard Inyumba speak. Her skepticism is probably
all too common.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of hatred is still there for those who killed or
survived,'' she said. ``I don't think such people like to have such
stories preached at them.''

<P>
   The fall of the Berlin Wall, 10 years ago today (Tuesday), was
perhaps the most extraordinary political event that any of us are
likely to witness in our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   An emblem of oppression was swept away. The tumultuous scenes as
crowds chipped away at the object that had come to be a symbol of
political evil encapsulated all the other changes of that dramatic
year in which communism so suddenly collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, it has become fashionable to express
pessimism about all that has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the people,'' chanted the demonstrators in 1989 in
defiance of the people's police. Then, ``We are one people,'' in
the heady run-up to German unification.
</P>
<P>
   But finding optimists in Germany today is a tough business. The
``wall in the heads'' _ the mutual distrust between east and west
Germans _ scarcely seems to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   The resentments mean that the former communists, now cutely
restyled as Democratic Socialists, are successful in a way they
could never have dreamed of when the Wall itself came down.
</P>
<P>
   The single most mocked phrase in Germany in the past 10 years
has been Helmut Kohl's declaration that east Germany would be full
of ``blooming landscapes'' within just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   In failing to deliver the proverbial ``blood, sweat and tears''
speech, Kohl was indeed misguided. When times looked tough, voters
felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, eastern Germany enjoys a standard of living that
would have seemed unthinkable to anyone who looked soberly at the
disastrous state of the east German economy 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's greatest problems are not economic, but social. East
Germans feel bitter that they are patronized by their affluent
western cousins.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans took decades to liberate themselves from the legacy
of a totalitarian regime after 1945. But they were scornful when
east Germans were disoriented by being thrust overnight into an
entirely new political and economic world.
</P>
<P>
   East Germans resent being perceived as less capable than the
west Germans. West Germans are contemptuous of the fact that the
easterners, despite the billions of marks in subsidies that they
have received, still complain of being badly off.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the problems are generational. The distance between a
50-year-old from Dusseldorf in the west and a 50-year-old from
Dresden in east Germany is likely to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dusseldorfer will continue to think of the east Germans as
grasping and ungrateful; the Dresdener will think of west Germans
as arrogant and condescending. But their children are growing up
less conditioned and, gradually, the psychological scars will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, there is cause for optimism. The fall of the
Wall was only the most dramatic of all the changes that took place
in the extraordinary year of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Political collapse in Poland and Hungary paved the way for the
destruction of the Wall; Prague followed hard on Germany's heels.
Within two weeks, the Czechs' own revolution was complete. A month
after that, even the hated Romanian dictatorship of Nicolae
Ceausescu had been swept away.
</P>
<P>
   In these countries, there was no east-west divide, which meant
that the problems of coming to terms with life after
totalitarianism could be addressed in relative privacy. There was
no know-it-all rich sugar daddy offering unwanted advice.
</P>
<P>
   Although economic recovery was less dramatic than in east
Germany, the psychological effect has been more positive: everybody
knows economic progress has been achieved by their own efforts, not
because of a financial drip feed.
</P>
<P>
   Following German unification, less than a year after the Wall
came down, east Germany was absorbed into the European Union. For
countries such as Poland and Hungary, the fact that they are now
leading candidates for EU membership is itself a remarkable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Romania, once seen as a basket case, is clawing its way
towards economic self-confidence and political stability. The
relative progress is just as remarkable as the fact that the
challenges remain enormous. &QL;

<P>
   In the region formerly ruled by Moscow, the most obvious
exception remains the former imperial power itself. Russia has
scarcely come to terms with the loss of its political colonies.
More importantly, it has little understanding of what has gone so
badly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet coup by hard-line communists failed disastrously
in August 1991, there was brief optimism that Russia could break
free of its own repressive history.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Russia _ which has a highly educated population, and
is rich in natural resources _ has stumbled from one disaster to
another, always blaming others for its woes.
</P>
<P>
   Some former Soviet republics, most notably the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ whose economic viability was
questioned by Western economists before the Soviet Union broke up _
have proved well able to adjust to the rigor of the free-market
economy. Potentially rich Russia, by contrast, remains enmired.
</P>
<P>
   The war that Moscow has relaunched against the little republic
of Chechnya in recent weeks, where civilians have been the
principal victims, is only the most glaring example of Russia's
failure to connect.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, despite a partial recovery after last year's
disasters, remains brittle; the criminal mafias sometimes seem to
be the most powerful branch of government in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Russia, however, there are signs of hope. After 70 years
of totalitarianism (and centuries of feudal rule before that), it
is hardly surprising if the first years of attempted democracy have
been chaotic and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is as capable as Poland or Germany of becoming
successful. Like the school bully in the playground, weighed down
by many complexes, Moscow throws its weight around while seeming
unable to believe that things can ever get better.
</P>
<P>
   The message of 1989 _ that change is possible, even in the most
unpropitious circumstances _ remains valid.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Moscow helped unleash miraculous change in the rest
of eastern Europe. If Russians can believe in themselves, they may
look forward to the return of the boomerang of democratic reform
that they helped to launch, and the economic prosperity that it
could bring in its wake. &QL;

successful. Like the school bully in the playground, weighed down
by many complexes, Moscow throws its weight around while seeming
unable to believe that things can ever get better.
</P>
<P>
   The message of 1989 _ that change is possible, even in the most
unpropitious circumstances _ remains valid.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Moscow helped unleash miraculous change in the rest
of eastern Europe. If Russians can believe in themselves, they may
look forward to the return of the boomerang of democratic reform
that they helped to launch, and the economic prosperity that it
could bring in its wake. &QL;

   BERLIN _ An East-West row that threatened to mar Tuesday's
celebrations of the fall of the Berlin Wall a decade ago has been
defused. The organizers _ Germany's two main parties _ graciously
consented to cutting their respective festive speeches by five
minutes each.
</P>
<P>
   The time saved by Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schroder rushing
through their scripts is to be donated to a genuine East German,
someone who had actually contributed to the historic event.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Joachim Gauck, a Lutheran pastor and former
dissident who gets to play the token Ossi, is not without
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992 Gauck has led the government's Stasi-busting agency,
which roots out agents of the former communist secret police from
public life.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Germans complain that their entire nation has been
unfairly tarred with the Stasi brush, and suspect Gauck's agency of
conducting an institutionalized witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But his 10 minutes in the Reichstag on Tuesday goes a long way
to placating the 16 million eastern Germans outraged by the way the
``Wessi''-dominated political establishment airbrushed them out of
the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it not the people of East Germany who prised open the
Berlin Wall?'' asked a group of indignant former dissidents in an
open letter.
</P>
<P>
   The event, like much of what happened in the past 10 years, has
clearly been mishandled. To eastern Germans, it was the most vivid
demonstration yet of Wessi high-handedness. Wessis always seem to
know best, even about a moment of history in which they were
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Just to recap: it was east Germans who had stormed the Wall on
the night of Nov. 9, 1989, though listening to the accounts of west
German politicians, one might think east Germans had only been
extras in a west German show.
</P>
<P>
   But it is useless to dwell on matters that took place such a
long time ago. The two Germanies are undoubtedly growing together.
</P>
<P>
   Much complaint has been made about the way the eastern education
system, in some ways superior to west German schooling, was
pronounced totally worthless. East German teachers were booted out
of the class rooms into the dole queues.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, after 10 years, the culture ministers of
all German ``Lander'' have decided that east German teaching
qualifications will henceforth be recognized nationwide. That
decision was reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the higher echelons of learning, the situation is worse.
According to a recent survey, 80 percent of senior professors at
eastern universities are Wessis, and their proportion is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of lawyers, doctors, artists, civil servants and other
professionals also lost their jobs to Wessis, either because they
were judged _ by Wessis _ to be unqualified, or had had links with
the Stasi, which was almost unavoidable in the old GDR.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the industrial working class, meanwhile, was abolished
when their factories closed down soon after reunification.
</P>
<P>
   To many east Germans, therefore, the past decade has been the
most painful in their lives. They can be excused for not opening
champagne on Tuesday, and for shunning the party at the Brandenburg
Gate.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the anniversary is an ordinary working day,
because ``Unification Day'' falls on Oct. 3, the day the west
German parliament voted to incorporate the east German provinces
into the existing Federal Republic.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, most east Germans will reluctantly concede that the
system they have now is better than what they had in communist
times. Not even the 20 percent who vote for the cuddly communists
of the Party of Democratic Socialism want the Wall back. Most will
settle for of old-fashioned compassion and solidarity, and maybe a
little more respect. &QL;

   BERLIN _ You can see Berlin grow. A resident away from just one
week will be confronted with skyscrapers a story or two taller,
cranes that have migrated from their previous spots, and new
bridges across the Spree.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's biggest construction site is filling up. On the
Potsdamer Platz, bissected by the border 10 years ago, the world's
foremost architects have been allowed to act out their fantasies,
not always to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   About a mile north, the Reichstag is at last complete, its dome
lighting up the night sky. A wonderous sight, even if it true, as
the government alleges, that Sir Norman Foster's creation has a
leaky roof.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk from the Reichstag is Pariser Platz and Brandenburg
Gate. Once an eerie no-man's land dividing east and west Berlin, it
is now a crowded tourist trap. Many of the buildings destroyed here
during the Second World War have been rebuilt, and other new
structures have cropped up around the square.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the overground and underground railway lines have
already been patched together, and in many parts east and west have
become indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall is certainly hard to locate. In some parts a line has
been drawn on the pavement for the sake of tourists, and only a few
segments here and there have survived the efforts of overzealous
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The city has just rebuilt a section at Bernauer Street, so that
visitors have something to gape at.
</P>
<P>
   But east and west still feel different. The west is infinitely
more prosperous, the east more vibrant. One of the biggest losers
of the Fall of the Wall was the west Berlin district of Kreuzberg
on the front line. It could not compete with the seediness of the
east.
</P>
<P>
   The action nowadays is in the Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg, two
formerly derelict working-class districts that have been receiving
a new coat of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Yuppy new arrivals live cheek by jowl with artists, dropouts and
increasingly hostile original residents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main attractions of the pubs and night clubs of the
east is the beer they serve: the original Berliner. It is one of
the few east German products that somehow managed to survive the
influx of western capital and know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Berliner is vastly superior to any of the western brews, but you
will struggle to find it in the pubs of west Berlin. In their
drinking habits, as in so much else, the two Berlins remain
divided. &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seconds after the antitrust judgment against
Microsoft was released on Friday night, the news was powering
through fiber-optic and copper cables around the world to
electronic mail in-baskets and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders were selling the company's shares from dealing
floors, trading rooms and computers perched precariously on the
dining room table, and hundreds of thousands of copies of the
document were being downloaded on to hard disks or printed out.
</P>
<P>
   One person, more than anyone else, made this possible: William
H. Gates, the man who has defined the business of computing and the
New Economy of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 1980s were about quality and the 1990s were about
re-engineering, then the 2000s will be about velocity,'' he says in
``Business At The Speed of Thought,'' his new book. ``About how
quickly business itself will be transacted. About how information
access will alter the lifestyle of consumers and their expectations
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of this man, his vision and the company which he has
built from nothing to dominate totally the computer business is now
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the subject of a huge competition case, and if
Friday's statement from the court is to be believed, it is losing.
Bill Gates himself lost $20 billion, when the judgment affected
Microsoft share prices.
</P>
<P>
   And when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote his damning
conclusions about Microsoft, calling it a monopolist and charging
it with a massive abuse of its power in the market, he was not
speaking just of a company or a hierarchy: he was damning Gates.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility is on trial, as much as his company, as lawyers
and consumers come to terms with how one man sought to use American
capitalism, and to change it in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in many respects, an unlikely figure to follow in the
footsteps of the pirate kings of American industry, the monopolists
who sought to dominate the explosive growth of American heavy
industry 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is worth billions, owns Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex
Leicester and has a house worth more than $20 million, Bill Gates
is not the man in the top hat and the frock coat, the classic
capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Tremulous and thin-voiced when he stood up to defend himself on
Friday night he sounded less plutocrat than plebeian: more like a
junior marketing executive caught out fiddling his expenses than
John D. Rockefeller.

   But don't be fooled. The Economist magazine has called Gates a
``paragon of industry'' and a ``ruthless predator,'' and both are
true: he has succeeded beyond all imagining in creating a behemoth
of American industry, but, as the antitrust trial has made clear,
it has not always been very pretty. It has succeeded primarily
through its ability to bring products to market and to outmaneuver
competitors. &QL;

<P>
   Bill Gates started with a program which linked together the
devices on primitive computers and allowed the user to control them
in a relatively easy way: a Disk Operating System.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1980 when IBM needed an operating
system for its new personal computer. Gates and his colleague Paul
Allen bought a rough working version from a local company for
$5,000 and sold it to Big Blue, which turned the machine into an
industry standard _ and MS-DOS with it.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM didn't own the program: Microsoft did. And within a few
years it was clear that the key to the new age of computing was not
the large boxes with which IBM had made its name, or even the
smaller ones that it was selling by the pallet-load: it was the
code which made them work, and that meant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   From MS-DOS came Windows, the world's most widely used software
program and the foundation for the modern age, in which computing
power is widely dispersed and easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet is shifting that revolution into a higher gear.
And it was the internet which both crystallized Microsoft's
importance and inspired its current problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the user, the keystone of the Internet is the browser, the
program linking each individual to the vast range of network
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was faced with a stiff challenge from Netscape, the
upstart young company which was pushing its Netscape Communicator.
Microsoft, its opponents alleged, used its power to choke off
competition and establish its Internet explorer as the standard. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claims that it is just competing like everybody else:
that by innovating, developing products and then selling them as
hard as it can, it is doing what capitalists do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users said to us, `we want to get on to the Internet...we want
to do that in a simple way where we just buy a Windows PC and it's
there. And we know that it works and Microsoft provides all of its
support services for us,''' Gates told the news service CNET in
1997. ``We delivered to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he stood up to defend himself on Friday, it was the
same argument: that he had delivered innovation. ``The court's
findings do acknowledge that Microsoft's actions accelerated the
development of the internet, reduced the cost to consumers and
improved the quality of web-browsing software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is fundamentally about one question: can a
successful American company continue to improve its products for
the benefit of consumers? That is precisely what Microsoft did by
developing new versions of the Windows operating system with
built-in support for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Judge Jackson has rejected this idea, conclusively.
``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The
ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit
consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide
with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are tempted to weep for Gates _ or are preparing to dance
on his grave _ think again.
</P>
<P>
   When Standard Oil was broken up, John D. Rockefeller's wealth
actually increased. Everything has moved on now, of course, at the
lightning speed described by Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is now owned by America On-Line, the Virginia company
which is the world's best-known provider of Internet services.
There are other challenges to Microsoft, from languages like Java
and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   The game is moving from the PC and the browser, down to handheld
devices like the Palm Pilot, or up and out on to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Vast new combinations are being spun from fiber-optic cable,
software, semiconductors and hard cash, labyrinthine webs of
corporate control aimed at capturing the largest share of the
largest markets for the longest possible time.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is right in there. The game is not over for Gates: in
some ways, it may only just be beginning. &QL;

   Miniature robots that can bounce up stairs and explore buildings
have been developed by researchers at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis. The robots could be used in urban warfare or help
police to foil hostage-takers in a siege.
</P>
<P>
   Nikos Papanikolopoulos and his colleagues have tested the
ability of a series of robotic ``scouts'' to gather information.
They envisage a group of scouts being lobbed by a grenade launcher
into a building that is too dangerous for police officers, to
explore and send back information via a radio link.
</P>
<P>
   Each robot is roughly the size and shape of a roll of toilet
paper, with a diameter of 4 centimeters. It moves around by rolling
and hopping and stays in touch with other scouts by radio. ``The
jumping mechanism, along with the software that makes it jump, is
the largest accomplishment,'' Papanikolopoulos says. ``Hopping is
done by a spring-loaded mechanism that winches in a leg. Then,
suddenly, it is released.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the leg hitting the floor causes the robot to
jump, ``like kicking a leg.'' It can also climb stairs and hurdle
small barriers. Two independent wheels at either end of the
cylinder help the robot to roll into position.
</P>
<P>
   Each scout has a tiny sensor. One has a video camera that pops
out of its body, panning and tilting to capture images of the
surrounding area. Other scouts have small vibration sensors and
microphones.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scouts would be deployed at once and controlled from
a mobile ``home base.'' The 50-kilogram base is in turn operated
remotely and acts as a radio repeater, allowing a greater distance
to be maintained between the scouts and the people digesting the
images. The researchers hope that the people will be more than 400
meters away from the front line.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of multiple robots working together is known as
distributed robotics, explains Paul Schenker, supervisor of the
Mechanics and Robotics Technology Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory near Pasadena, Calif. ``A number of groups are working
on distributed robotics,'' he says. The idea is that multiple
robots can provide diverse information about what is going on
inside a building, for example by beaming back video pictures of an
object from different angles.
</P>
<P>
   Papanikolopoulos' research is being financed by the U.S.
military and is scheduled to be finished by 2002. So far his team
has successfully tested the robot's locomotion system and the video
camera's ability to pan and tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The main application for the robots will be urban warfare or
police rescue operations. But they could also be useful for
civilian intelligence-gathering. ``CNN would love something like
this,'' Papanikolopoulos says. &QL;

   Implants that amplify weak signals traveling along the spinal
cord might one day allow some paralyzed people to stand or even
walk. The researchers developing the implants have so far tested
them only in animals, and are anxious not to raise false hopes. But
they hope to begin clinical trials within two years.
</P>
<P>
   In injuries in which the spinal cord isn't completely severed,
the remaining neural pathways can let some weak signals through. As
a result, about four in five people with spinal injuries still have
some residual control over muscles in their legs. By boosting the
faint signals responsible, Arthur Prochazka and his colleague
Vivian Mushahwar of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada,
believe it may be possible to restore coordinated movements.
</P>
<P>
   Movements such as walking aren't entirely controlled by the
brain. Instead, once the brain has sent a signal to start walking,
for instance, feedback loops between the motor nerves in the lower
spinal cord and the sensory nerves in the muscles largely control
the process.
</P>
<P>
   So, in theory, if the nerves beneath a spinal injury are
undamaged and an implant boosts the signals coming down from the
brain, these reflexes should take over.
</P>
<P>
   To test this idea, Prochazka and Mushahwar have developed
implants that can be attached directly to a vertebra. A series of
microwires, made of an alloy of platinum and iridium, project from
the implant and are fed individually into the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tested the implants on four anesthetized and
four unanesthetized cats, applying a signal of 300 microamps
delivered between 25 and 40 times a second. By stimulating
different parts of the spinal cord with different microwires, the
researchers were able to get both groups of cats to flex their rear
legs, and the unanesthetized cats to raise the rear of their bodies
to support their weight.
</P>
<P>
   The unanesthetized cats seemed so unconcerned by the experiment
that they carried on eating. ``One of the very important things
about this is that the stimulation is apparently painless,''
Prochazka says. He also says that the microwires can be pulled out
without damaging the spinal cord. Other researchers have managed to
trigger similar movements using electrical stimulation. But the
real surprise came when Prochazka and Mushahwar turned down the
amplitude of the signals from the implant to 50 microamps. These
signals were too weak to cause muscle contraction directly.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the researchers monitored the electrical activity
of the cats' muscles as they walked around, they found that the
implants were causing the muscles to contract more strongly than
normal, presumably by amplifying the natural impulses traveling
along the spinal cord. The researchers have submitted a paper
describing their results to the journal Experimental Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   The cats in Prochazka and Mushahwar's experiments had no spinal
injury. But if the implants can also amplify the weaker signals
passing along a damaged spinal cord, it might be possible to
restore movement to some paraplegics.
</P>
<P>
   Prochazka is now planning human trials with the Alberta
Paraplegic Foundation and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for
Medical Research. The initial goal would be to help paralyzed
people stand and exercise their legs. ``Walking with help from a
frame could be possible in a couple more years,'' Prochazka
cautiously predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers warn that people shouldn't build up their
hopes until the results from those trials are available. But they
are impressed with Prochazka's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like jump-starting your car engine,'' says Richard
Apps, a neurophysiologist at University of Bristol. ``You give that
extra oomph to the system.'' &QL;

   Intravenous drug abusers are harboring a virus that is evolving
300 times faster than usual and could turn nasty, scientists warn.
Several drug users infected with the normally harmless virus have
already developed a devastating neurological disorder, although a
firm link between the virus and the disease is yet to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Salemi and Anne-Mieke Vandamme at the Rega Institute for
Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, and William Hall at University
College Dublin in Ireland, say needle sharing has made the virus
epidemic among drug users. And they believe it is this dramatic
increase in transmission rate that has suddenly kick-started the
virus' evolution. ``We have to keep monitoring this,'' Salemi says.
``It could evolve into something more pathogenic, we just don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus is called HTLV-II. It is a retrovirus, which
incorporates viral DNA into the genome of infected cells. Its
relative HTLV-I can cause leukemia and neurological disorders.
</P>
<P>
   HTLV-II, however, is normally relatively benign. It is thought
to have jumped from monkeys to humans 15,000 to 30,000 years ago in
the Americas. For up to 2,000 generations, the virus has been most
common in Pygmy and American Indian tribes, transmitted from mother
to child via breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 30 years, however, the virus has spread into a wider
population through contaminated blood in shared needles. The virus
has been picked up in drug users in the United States, Asia and
Europe, where between 5 and 10 percent of users are infected.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more, Salemi's team took blood samples from drug
users in Italy and Ireland, and compared similar samples in
databases from the United States, Spain, Sweden and Vietnam. They
looked at how much the virus had evolved within drug users compared
to people in American Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the genetic sequence of HTLV-II changes at a
rate of 1 percent every 100,000 years or so in the American tribes,
the slowest for any known virus. In drug users, however, this rate
is 300 times faster.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably because HTVL-II normally lies dormant. It only
replicates and mutates during a brief infectious period when trying
to integrate itself into a new host's cells. Because the virus is
usually passed from mother to child, this happens infrequently.
However, a single drug user can pass the virus on to hundreds of
others within a few months. And each new infection gives the virus
a new chance to mutate and evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Severe neurological disease has already cropped up in several
drug users infected by HTLV-II, although it is still unclear
whether this is linked instead to their known infection with HIV.
Hall now hopes to test whether HTLV-II is becoming more pathogenic
by studying drug abusers serving long prison sentences in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Martine Peeters at the Institute for Research and Development's
Retrovirus Laboratory in Montpellier, France, agrees that the study
throws up important questions. ``We need more clinical follow-up,''
she says. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Seconds after the antitrust judgment against
Microsoft was released on Friday night, the news was powering
through fiber-optic and copper cables around the world to
electronic mail in-baskets and pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders were selling the company's shares from dealing
floors, trading rooms and computers perched precariously on the
dining room table, and hundreds of thousands of copies of the
document were being downloaded on to hard disks or printed out.
</P>
<P>
   One person, more than anyone else, made this possible: William
H. Gates, the man who has defined the business of computing and the
New Economy of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 1980s were about quality and the 1990s were about
re-engineering, then the 2000s will be about velocity,'' he says in
``Business At The Speed of Thought,'' his new book. ``About how
quickly business itself will be transacted. About how information
access will alter the lifestyle of consumers and their expectations
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of this man, his vision and the company which he has
built from nothing to dominate totally the computer business is now
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the subject of a huge competition case, and if
Friday's statement from the court is to be believed, it is losing.
Bill Gates himself lost $20 billion, when the judgment affected
Microsoft share prices.
</P>
<P>
   And when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote his damning
conclusions about Microsoft, calling it a monopolist and charging
it with a massive abuse of its power in the market, he was not
speaking just of a company or a hierarchy: he was damning Gates.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility is on trial, as much as his company, as lawyers
and consumers come to terms with how one man sought to use American
capitalism, and to change it in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in many respects, an unlikely figure to follow in the
footsteps of the pirate kings of American industry, the monopolists
who sought to dominate the explosive growth of American heavy
industry 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is worth billions, owns Leonardo Da Vinci's Codex
Leicester and has a house worth more than $20 million, Bill Gates
is not the man in the top hat and the frock coat, the classic
capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Tremulous and thin-voiced when he stood up to defend himself on
Friday night he sounded less plutocrat than plebeian: more like a
junior marketing executive caught out fiddling his expenses than
John D. Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled. The Economist magazine has called Gates a
``paragon of industry'' and a ``ruthless predator,'' and both are
true: he has succeeded beyond all imagining in creating a behemoth
of American industry, but, as the antitrust trial has made clear,
it has not always been very pretty. It has succeeded primarily
through its ability to bring products to market and to outmaneuver
competitors. &QL;

<P>
   Bill Gates started with a program which linked together the
devices on primitive computers and allowed the user to control them
in a relatively easy way: a Disk Operating System.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came in 1980 when IBM needed an operating
system for its new personal computer. Gates and his colleague Paul
Allen bought a rough working version from a local company for
$5,000 and sold it to Big Blue, which turned the machine into an
industry standard _ and MS-DOS with it.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM didn't own the program: Microsoft did. And within a few
years it was clear that the key to the new age of computing was not
the large boxes with which IBM had made its name, or even the
smaller ones that it was selling by the pallet-load: it was the
code which made them work, and that meant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   From MS-DOS came Windows, the world's most widely used software
program and the foundation for the modern age, in which computing
power is widely dispersed and easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet is shifting that revolution into a higher gear.
And it was the internet which both crystallized Microsoft's
importance and inspired its current problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the user, the keystone of the Internet is the browser, the
program linking each individual to the vast range of network
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was faced with a stiff challenge from Netscape, the
upstart young company which was pushing its Netscape Communicator.
Microsoft, its opponents alleged, used its power to choke off
competition and establish its Internet explorer as the standard. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claims that it is just competing like everybody else:
that by innovating, developing products and then selling them as
hard as it can, it is doing what capitalists do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users said to us, `we want to get on to the Internet...we want
to do that in a simple way where we just buy a Windows PC and it's
there. And we know that it works and Microsoft provides all of its
support services for us,''' Gates told the news service CNET in
1997. ``We delivered to that.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he stood up to defend himself on Friday, it was the
same argument: that he had delivered innovation. ``The court's
findings do acknowledge that Microsoft's actions accelerated the
development of the internet, reduced the cost to consumers and
improved the quality of web-browsing software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is fundamentally about one question: can a
successful American company continue to improve its products for
the benefit of consumers? That is precisely what Microsoft did by
developing new versions of the Windows operating system with
built-in support for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Judge Jackson has rejected this idea, conclusively.
``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and
stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and
businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The
ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit
consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide
with Microsoft's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are tempted to weep for Gates _ or are preparing to dance
on his grave _ think again.
</P>
<P>
   When Standard Oil was broken up, John D. Rockefeller's wealth
actually increased. Everything has moved on now, of course, at the
lightning speed described by Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is now owned by America On-Line, the Virginia company
which is the world's best-known provider of Internet services.
There are other challenges to Microsoft, from languages like Java
and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   The game is moving from the PC and the browser, down to handheld
devices like the Palm Pilot, or up and out on to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Vast new combinations are being spun from fiber-optic cable,
software, semiconductors and hard cash, labyrinthine webs of
corporate control aimed at capturing the largest share of the
largest markets for the longest possible time.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is right in there. The game is not over for Gates: in
some ways, it may only just be beginning. &QL;

   LONDON _ Nancy Reagan was famous for consulting hers, and the
Princess of Wales reportedly never made a move without taking
advice from one. But now the world of business is using astrology
before making crucial boardroom decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses are renowned for making choices based on facts and
figures, and in an area where the bottom line rules it seems
unlikely that companies would turn to the stars before appointing
new members of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But a new website launched Tuesday claims it can warn businesses
of trouble in the boardroom by matching executives according to
their astrological compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   YAS Corporation says it could have predicted the fallout between
Alan Sugar, the former chairman of England's Tottenham Hotspur
Football Club, and Terry Venables, then his chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at people's birth dates the company produces detailed
character analysis and at Spurs it would have predicted ``constant
friction, if suppressed'' between the two men. The clue is to be
found in the alignment between Jupiter on Sugar's chart and Mars on
that of Venables.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, the partnership between British leaders Tony
Blair and Gordon Brown, whose working relationship has often been
the subject of speculation, ``will share common ideas about ethics,
politics, and many social values. They will make an excellent
business team, especially in any endeavors that require reaching
out to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mackenis, chief executive of the California-based company,
said a number of businesses, including a mobile-phone operation and
a City of London bank, had approached him about the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford never launches a new car without checking the date first,
and it is interesting to note that Ford has the Orion, Aries,
Taurus and Mercury,'' Mackenis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a bit of fun when someone showed me the program,
and then I ran a few friends and colleagues through it and realized
it was exactly right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have an instant rapport with some people and think
they would be good to go into business with, but then you find out
that you do nothing but sit about talking about your ideas without
actually achieving anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology helps you to decide whether you should
actually go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are often sniffy about astrology in public when they
think someone might hear, but when they can check things out in
private they go for it. This tool can just give you an extra
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackenis said the program's software, known as Seer, is more
accurate than star signs because it is based on a person's birth
date, which allows it to be more precise than simply using one of
the 12 signs of the zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a way of predicting how a person's business day
will be and whether they should sign that contract or not, and we
will be developing group software that will allow a whole
department to decide if someone should join their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be used by venture capitalists and
consultants. In the same way that graphology is used increasingly
this will be just another tool,'' Mackenis said.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be free for the first few months while any
glitches are ironed out, and after that people will be allowed two
free consultations and then be charged $ 6.00 for the next.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan you can look up your own boss _ on
www.yourastrologysite.com _ and find out if he's going to have a
good day or whether you should pick up that phone and call in sick
right now. &QL;

Taurus and Mercury,'' Mackenis said.

   ``It started as a bit of fun when someone showed me the program,
and then I ran a few friends and colleagues through it and realized
it was exactly right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have an instant rapport with some people and think
they would be good to go into business with, but then you find out
that you do nothing but sit about talking about your ideas without
actually achieving anything.

   ``This technology helps you to decide whether you should
actually go ahead.

   ``People are often sniffy about astrology in public when they
think someone might hear, but when they can check things out in
private they go for it. This tool can just give you an extra
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackenis said the program's software, known as Seer, is more
accurate than star signs because it is based on a person's birth
date, which allows it to be more precise than simply using one of
the 12 signs of the zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a way of predicting how a person's business day
will be and whether they should sign that contract or not, and we
will be developing group software that will allow a whole
department to decide if someone should join their team.

   ``I think it will be used by venture capitalists and
consultants. In the same way that graphology is used increasingly
this will be just another tool,'' Mackenis said.

   The site will be free for the first few months while any
glitches are ironed out, and after that people will be allowed two
free consultations and then be charged $ 6.00 for the next.

   HAVANA _ To further their revolutionary street-cred over their
summer vacations, radical youths used to defy the American embargo
and help harvest Cuban sugar cane during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In middle-age, some of these aging rebels are back, but now they
undermine the blockade to buy PPG-5, a home-grown Viagra derived
from those same sugar stalks.
</P>
<P>
   They lay forty dollars cash on the counter _ the pills are
available at the airport _ and can immediately road test the
virility drug in Havana, to the beat of bongo drums.
</P>
<P>
   As an added attraction for the baby boomers, at the same time as
PPG-5 raises erections, it also conveniently lowers cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing lawmakers in the United States have targeted the
public health system in Cuba for almost four decades, but they
failed to foresee that there could be two-way leaks in their
embargo and sorely underestimated the wiles of patients looking for
a health bargain in the Caribbean sun.
</P>
<P>
   Doctoring the masses, particularly as practiced on the
battlefield by the late Dr. Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, or later in
neighborhood clinics by his outspoken physician daughter, Aleida,
has long been seen as a revolutionary act in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Americans scuttled humanitarian exemptions to their
economic embargo in 1992 and banned the supply of new imported
medical equipment and drugs to the island, Dr. Aleida Guevara
recalls, ``We all became inventors; there was no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet bloc crumbled, the Cuban medical profession
turned increasingly to its island resources. Herbal remedies
concocted by local healers began to replace unobtainable
pharmaceuticals, and radical new drugs were developed.
</P>
<P>
   From the ubiquitous Cuban sugar cane, for example, scientists
extracted PPG-5 to dramatically cut cholesterol. Heart patients,
particularly overweight middle-aged males, were quick to notice an
unexpected side-effect due to improved blood flow. PPG-5 (and its
stronger version, PPG-10) was a precursor to Viagra and enhanced
erections.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-carrying health tourists flocked to the island in droves.
Stocks of locally manufactured Interferon flew off the shelves in
exchange for hard currency almost as fast as Havana cigars.
Experimental anti-AIDS drugs were on sale cheaply, too.
</P>
<P>
   Primary and preventative health care for all is the pride of
Fidel Castro's Cuba, where infant mortality rate is half of
Washington D.C.'s.
</P>
<P>
   Recuperating in the Caribbean was a bonus for health tourists,
who could come home cured and tanned after excellent care. Eye
surgery to correct vision was in particular demand. But ever since
the severe economic decline following the breakup of the Soviet
Union, free treatment for visitors has ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Health tourism, however, is promoted everywhere. International
clinics in Havana, Varadero and Santiago de Cuba accept American
dollar bills or, by preference, charge euros when you pay with
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide choice of rejuvenation therapy, cosmetic and
reconstructive surgery specialists, anti-aging treatments,
diagnostic and risk prevention clinics and physiotherapy units.
</P>
<P>
   Paying patients arrive from Latin America, Europe, Canada, and
increasingly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfaction with stingy Health Maintenance Organizations
(HMOs) or medical insurance priced beyond their budget sends many
ailing Americans south of the border to Mexico, from where they
pick up a cheap flight to Havana and its health professionals, who
advertise in flight magazines and tourist pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   This is in some ways a heartening trend, especially since so
many ill-paid Cuban doctors and nurses were beginning to moonlight
as guides or drivers to earn a little hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   In the duty-free shop of the Jose Marti airport, boxes of shark
cartilage capsules are stacked high for these customers, who gobble
the supplement for arthritis pains or to shrink tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, alongside China and Australia, leads the research field on
the properties of shark cartilage, which is growing in popularity
and gaining credence in the west as an alternative cancer
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A retired California schoolteacher we'll call Sylvia Brubaker
crams several shark products into a bag with her duty-free rum and
maracas. She came to Havana last week for an eyelid lift, hoping to
return looking ``well-rested,'' but lost her nerve when nurses told
her to supply her own sutures.
</P>
<P>
   The shortages are biting ever more deeply. Half of all new
pharmaceuticals, the ones licensed by the United States, are
unobtainable in Cuba because of the blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may admire the chrome muscle cars cruising the streets,
but the 1950s ambience is less charming when replacement parts for
30-year-old x-ray machines and components for respirators and
pacemakers are not to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sophisticated and comprehensive public health system is
being systematically stripped of its resources,'' notes the
American Association for World Health.
</P>
<P>
   Care for women and children remains a priority in Cuba, but with
diminishing supplies, more adult males and some of the elderly are
put at risk, especially since the incidence of tuberculosis is
climbing and water hygiene has declined.
</P>
<P>
   In August, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South
Dakota toured Cuba and concluded that lifting the barriers to vital
food and drug sales would ease people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-communist hardliners in Congress did not agree, but even
before the senator's 3-day visit, a breakthrough in the medical
blockade was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Bio-technicians from Havana's Finlay Institute struck a deal
with an American subsidiary of the drug giant SmithKline Beecham,
hoping to develop a meningitis vaccine for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   The Finlay vaccine was developed during an epidemic in Cuba
during the 1980s and works against a particularly deadly strain of
Meningitis B. It has been an important medical export for Cuba for
a decade, but only available in a dozen countries. Now the
Americans hope to adapt this vaccine to other types of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only thing they don't have,'' Dr. Aleida Guevara
sniffed, gesturing at the basic equipment in her allergy lab in
Havana's William Soler hospital. ``Just observe the capitalist
ideology when they want something from us.'' &QL;

   Trousers that transform into a protective shell, a curtain which
plays the sound of passing traffic, a light to alleviate Seasonal
Affective Disorder and giant wall-mounted paper clips may form part
of the office of the future.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of an exhibition of work by young industrial
designers from the British Royal College of Art, and go on display
for the first time next month.
</P>
<P>
   The show, part of a major exhibition at Olympia, London,
includes products ranging from simple plastic pulls for plugs to
the innovative and eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Plant's clothes, being developed for production in a project
supported by Levi's, include a polymer that hardens on impact,
protecting workers from accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Another product is a transparent curtain, designed by Andreas
Raptopoulis, which plays the sounds of the street through tiny
loudspeakers in a plastic sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Arash Kayawa's witty offering is a giant plastic paper clip
which hangs on the wall, while Rainer Spehl has produced seats in
the shape of outsized polystyrene cups.
</P>
<P>
   All the work on show at the Workplace 99 exhibition is by
graduates of the college's famous postgraduate design course, which
has produced a series of internationally known designers. Several
of the young designers in the show have gone on to work on research
and development at the college.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Myerson, director of the Helen Hamlyn Research Center at
the RCA, said: ``Britain has the longest working days in Europe and
the highest number of days lost to stress-related illness. We are
very concerned to carry on practice-based research. It's about
improving the quality of life at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will put up with an incredible amount of discomfort at
work and with a lot of physical wear and tear on their bodies which
they would never put up with at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of office products are based on the technology which is
available. Our ethos is to look at creative problem-solving and do
things from the point of view of the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think people are going to want witty and innovative
products for work. Offices are going to become much more
comfortable. What this sort of exhibition does is give us a glimpse
into the future.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ At first it was just a lonely telephone booth,
stranded miles away from anywhere in the middle of the Mojave
Desert. But then it became something else, something a bit special.
It became an object of cult veneration.
</P>
<P>
   The Mojave Telephone Booth, as it is now known to its fans,
started out as the sole conduit of communication for a remote
cinder mine off the main road from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the past two years, thanks to an impassioned computer
programmer from Arizona and the lightning communicative power of
the Internet, it has become a phenomenon unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of intrepid explorers have trekked the 15 miles of unmade
road from the nearest highway to pay homage to this gloomy outpost
of telecommunications, often getting stuck in the sand on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people, meanwhile, have dialled the number from as
far away as Norway, New Zealand and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   At first there was no answer, but recently the line has been
humming so loud it has almost always been engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination is hard to explain. ``Why did I go out to the
middle of the desert to hang up a phone?'' asks Steve Amala, who
describes his experiences on one of the many Mojave telephone
websites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't say, really. I've tried to forge an alloy out of some
ideas, struggled to come up with a phrase that will support the
weight of reason and still shine with adventure, but I can't. Brain
cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems the craze began when a music fan from southern
California spotted the word ``telephone'' on a map of the Mojave
desert and decided to take a look for himself.
</P>
<P>
   He found the glass shot out and the phone book missing but, in a
letter to the music magazine Wig Out!, reported the phone to be in
perfect working order.
</P>
<P>
   His account was read by Godfrey Daniels of Phoenix, Ariz., who
was immediately transfixed. Mechanically, Daniels began dialling
the number every day to see if anyone would answer.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, someone did _ a cinder miner's daughter
called Lorene. Further phone calls finally inspired him to visit
himself, and he chronicled the whole thing on his website.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just as I had imagined it _ a lonely communications
outpost at the end of a long, long chain of telephone poles,''
Daniels wrote. ``All its glass had been shot out, but I thought it
was beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment I felt I might never leave it. In fact, we
almost didn't _ we spent hours making phone calls to anyone we
could think of.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the cult was born. As the trickle of visitors turned into
a flood, the media became interested. And once newspaper articles
and photographs began appearing in the Californian press, the flood
turned into a veritable stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains earlier this year made the road almost impassable,
and the California Highway Patrol became so sick of towing people
out that they announced they simply wouldn't do it any more.
</P>
<P>
   But still the fans kept coming. In August, the cinder mine was
threatened with closure, and the issue was publicized loudly on
Daniels' website.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Daniels became so famous that computer hackers
started messing with his e-mail address. Then, two weeks ago, the
whole adventure came to an ignominious end.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor called Steve arrived at the booth only to discover
that the phone had been ripped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to happen, I suppose,'' Daniels surmised
philosophically. ``There has been way too much attention, way too
many people going out there, and there are way too many jerks in
the world.'' &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film ``Happy, Texas'' looks as if it might be quite good,
but I don't think I'll go and see it. I've been there already, I've
got the baseball cap and I would have a T-shirt if there was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' is a comedy that was the star of the Sundance
Film Festival, and is opening to rave reviews across America. But
the real Happy is a small _ very small _ town in the Texas
Panhandle, between Amarillo and Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   I went there a year ago for the ``Independent on Sunday'' on
what proved to be a quixotic mission in search of the American
spirit of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   I have strong memories of that hot Texas day, the sun beating
down on the dusty streets _ street, really _ of a beaten-up
settlement that seemed to have been outflanked by time, geography
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There was, as it turned out, a cowboy, wandering over to the
Imperial Cafe with his spurs tingling and his stetson at a jaunty
angle, but he worked for one of the feedyards up the road, and his
life was far from the cliched existence of the classic Western.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his job was probably done on an all-terrain vehicle, not
a horse. The days of ranchers and the range have gone, and
agriculture is now divided between small farmers struggling to
survive and large semi-industrial compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Happy is dominated by crops, not cattle, with
sepulchral grain elevators that loom over the town and the railway
line which cuts across the flat plain on its way to Canyon and
Amarillo to the north.
</P>
<P>
   If I learned one thing from visiting Happy, it is that America
is not how you see it on the television or films. It is more
complex, of course; but also there is far more of a sense of
locality and place than you would ever imagine from the media.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to how it sometimes seems, the entire nation has not
been reduced to a set of strip malls and fast-food parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Regional identities are strong: indeed, sometimes it seems that
all the flag-waving, oaths of allegiance and bumper sticker
patriotism is intended principally to disguise the fact that this
is a very fragmented country.
</P>
<P>
   Local allegiances count for far more than anything which happens
in Washington, a place which most Americans regard as Sodom and
Gomorrah, populated by the moneylenders from the Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, no story ever resolves neatly in Hollywood-style
simplicities, and Americans are smart enough (despite the way the
country is often reported abroad) to realize that.
</P>
<P>
   Even America _ perhaps especially America _ is a victim of media
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Happy is a little sensitive about the film, partly because it
feels a little victimized in that way. The plot centers on two
escaped convicts who stage a beauty pageant in Happy, and in part
turns on a local gay bar.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a gay bar in Happy, Texas. There isn't any sort of
bar in Happy, in fact. But more than that, some locals have
evidently felt that the mickey was being taken: they were being
parodied as stereotypical small-town Texans, dodging the dead
armadillos on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Happy's claim to fame is almost entirely dependent on its name.
It describes itself as ``The Town Without a Frown,'' and even
before the film it had been used in advertisements for ice-cream.
</P>
<P>
   The odd moniker came when settlers found water in what is an
arid area, and decided this was the place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   America is rich in places with odd names, and they aren't shy of
making a few dollars out of it. My favorite is Truth or
Consequences in New Mexico, which changed its name from the more
prosaic Hot Springs in 1950 to adopt the title of a leading radio
game show.
</P>
<P>
   But Happy's 500 or so inhabitants were distinctly dubious about
the film, which wasn't even made in Texas; it was filmed in
California, using cars with Texas license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The town is starting to change its mind now, says Patricia Sims,
the city secretary. ``We were a little bit apprehensive,'' she
says. ``But when we get to see it it'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a comedy, after all, she notes, and Happy likes a good
laugh, though there is no cinema and everyone will have to drive up
the road to Amarillo. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Happy was a gloomy place when I visited, because the water which
first brought the settlers had gone. The crops were dying in the
fields, and dust rose from the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Small towns like Happy have suffered as people have upped sticks
and moved to larger towns, and shops have closed down as
competition from the malls puts them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   They are a phlegmatic sort, the people of the Texas Panhandle,
and they've had to be, given the harshness of the climate. This is
a different Texas from the popular myth, but then Texas itself is a
state with half a dozen separate regional identities.
</P>
<P>
   Sims says that this has been a better year for Happy. There was
rain in the spring, and the crops were much better. ``Most
everybody has their wheat in,'' she says, and the maize is ready to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Reed Macdonald, who had just had serious heart surgery
when I met him last year, is in fine fettle, doing a little
dispatching work for a trucking company in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   The diner is gone now: hardly surprising, given the size of the
town. ``Imperial Cafe'' was going it some anyway _ it was actually
a small diner, and not very Imperial, though its departure leaves a
gap.
</P>
<P>
   But there is now a trailer selling smoked meat and snacks, which
is something. A small shop selling country furnishings, set up by a
couple who moved in from outside, is doing nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The film will make a few people turn off the interstate highway
to see the gay bar, and they'll wander about and spend some money
before they realize it doesn't actually exist. But by that time
they should have worked out that this is a good place.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps things will work out for Happy, and that would be nice. &QL;

<P>
   The film ``Happy, Texas'' looks as if it might be quite good,
but I don't think I'll go and see it. I've been there already, I've
got the baseball cap and I would have a T-shirt if there was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' is a comedy that was the star of the Sundance
Film Festival, and is opening to rave reviews across America. But
the real Happy is a small _ very small _ town in the Texas
Panhandle, between Amarillo and Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   I went there a year ago for the ``Independent on Sunday'' on
what proved to be a quixotic mission in search of the American
spirit of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   I have strong memories of that hot Texas day, the sun beating
down on the dusty streets _ street, really _ of a beaten-up
settlement that seemed to have been outflanked by time, geography
and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   There was, as it turned out, a cowboy, wandering over to the
Imperial Cafe with his spurs tingling and his stetson at a jaunty
angle, but he worked for one of the feedyards up the road, and his
life was far from the cliched existence of the classic Western.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his job was probably done on an all-terrain vehicle, not
a horse. The days of ranchers and the range have gone, and
agriculture is now divided between small farmers struggling to
survive and large semi-industrial compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Happy is dominated by crops, not cattle, with
sepulchral grain elevators that loom over the town and the railway
line which cuts across the flat plain on its way to Canyon and
Amarillo to the north.
</P>
<P>
   If I learned one thing from visiting Happy, it is that America
is not how you see it on the television or films. It is more
complex, of course; but also there is far more of a sense of
locality and place than you would ever imagine from the media.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to how it sometimes seems, the entire nation has not
been reduced to a set of strip malls and fast-food parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Regional identities are strong: indeed, sometimes it seems that
all the flag-waving, oaths of allegiance and bumper sticker
patriotism is intended principally to disguise the fact that this
is a very fragmented country.
</P>
<P>
   Local allegiances count for far more than anything which happens
in Washington, a place which most Americans regard as Sodom and
Gomorrah, populated by the moneylenders from the Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, no story ever resolves neatly in Hollywood-style
simplicities, and Americans are smart enough (despite the way the
country is often reported abroad) to realize that.
</P>
<P>
   Even America _ perhaps especially America _ is a victim of media
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Happy is a little sensitive about the film, partly because it
feels a little victimized in that way. The plot centers on two
escaped convicts who stage a beauty pageant in Happy, and in part
turns on a local gay bar.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a gay bar in Happy, Texas. There isn't any sort of
bar in Happy, in fact. But more than that, some locals have
evidently felt that the mickey was being taken: they were being
parodied as stereotypical small-town Texans, dodging the dead
armadillos on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Happy's claim to fame is almost entirely dependent on its name.
It describes itself as ``The Town Without a Frown,'' and even
before the film it had been used in advertisements for ice-cream.
</P>
<P>
   The odd moniker came when settlers found water in what is an
arid area, and decided this was the place to stay.
</P>
<P>
   America is rich in places with odd names, and they aren't shy of
making a few dollars out of it. My favorite is Truth or
Consequences in New Mexico, which changed its name from the more
prosaic Hot Springs in 1950 to adopt the title of a leading radio
game show.
</P>
<P>
   But Happy's 500 or so inhabitants were distinctly dubious about
the film, which wasn't even made in Texas; it was filmed in
California, using cars with Texas license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The town is starting to change its mind now, says Patricia Sims,
the city secretary. ``We were a little bit apprehensive,'' she
says. ``But when we get to see it it'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a comedy, after all, she notes, and Happy likes a good
laugh, though there is no cinema and everyone will have to drive up
the road to Amarillo. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 750. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Happy was a gloomy place when I visited, because the water which
first brought the settlers had gone. The crops were dying in the
fields, and dust rose from the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Small towns like Happy have suffered as people have upped sticks
and moved to larger towns, and shops have closed down as
competition from the malls puts them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   They are a phlegmatic sort, the people of the Texas Panhandle,
and they've had to be, given the harshness of the climate. This is
a different Texas from the popular myth, but then Texas itself is a
state with half a dozen separate regional identities.
</P>
<P>
   Sims says that this has been a better year for Happy. There was
rain in the spring, and the crops were much better. ``Most
everybody has their wheat in,'' she says, and the maize is ready to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Reed Macdonald, who had just had serious heart surgery
when I met him last year, is in fine fettle, doing a little
dispatching work for a trucking company in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   The diner is gone now: hardly surprising, given the size of the
town. ``Imperial Cafe'' was going it some anyway _ it was actually
a small diner, and not very Imperial, though its departure leaves a
gap.
</P>
<P>
   But there is now a trailer selling smoked meat and snacks, which
is something. A small shop selling country furnishings, set up by a
couple who moved in from outside, is doing nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The film will make a few people turn off the interstate highway
to see the gay bar, and they'll wander about and spend some money
before they realize it doesn't actually exist. But by that time
they should have worked out that this is a good place.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps things will work out for Happy, and that would be nice. &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ Plans to detonate a huge bomb in the Dead Sea
Thursday in an attempt to simulate an earthquake are causing alarm
among environmentalists and divisions between Israeli government
departments.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m. local time, 5,000 kilograms of dynamite is scheduled
to blow up in the middle of the sea, whose shores are highly
popular with tourists and are overlooked by nature reserves and
Biblical ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The detonation, which will take place between 70-100 meters
(230-330 feet) beneath the water's surface and at least three miles
offshore, is part of an effort by the Israel Geophysical Institute
to improve its seismic monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   The institute _ which has already conducted at least one smaller
explosion of 500kg this week and was Tuesday due to conduct another
of 2,000kg _ says its analyses show the simulated quake will pose
no risk to people, property or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, however, tourists who were swimming in the sea
were ordered out of the water before the first explosion on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But this has failed to convince Israel's environmentalists,
including Bilha Givon, head of an organization for the protection
of the Negev Desert, who fears that the blasts could trigger a
natural earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The last catastrophic quake, which flattened most of Nablus on
the West Bank, occurred in 1927 but the region is regularly rattled
by smaller tremors.
</P>
<P>
   After thousands died in the Turkish earthquake in August, there
were warnings in Israel that many of its buildings would collapse
in a major quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned,'' said Mrs. Givon Tuesday. ``If you want
to simulate an aircraft accident, you don't blow up the plane. This
is a very seismically sensitive area.'' Similar concerns have been
expressed by Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism has also come from Israel's Environmental Ministry,
which has expressed fears that the explosion could release radon
gas from the sea, damage the shorelines, and harm wildlife in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said that the ministry would seek to delay
Thursday's detonation if the earlier explosions were found to be
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sea is lifeless _ its lack of fish is the reason
why it was chosen _ the surrounding canyons are rich in natural
life, caves and ancient ruins.
</P>
<P>
   They include at least two nature reserves. (Aptly, perhaps, the
area is also traditionally believed to include the site of Sodom
and Gomorrah, the cities destroyed by God, according to the Old
Testament, using fire and brimstone.)
</P>
<P>
   However, the Geophysical Institute, which has been asked by
Israel's National Infrastructure Ministry to find ways of reducing
earthquake risk, is adamant that the contrived earthquake will not
trigger a natural one.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion will be ``completely safe,'' Avi Shapira, head of
the institute's seismology department, told the Jerusalem Post.
``This is the only way to calibrate seismological instruments
accurately. It will greatly improve our ability to find the
locations of earthquakes in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the risk of a public scare, the institute has sought
to keep the experiment out of the headlines. Several hoteliers
along the Dead Sea's shores Tuesday seemed unaware of what is in
store. &QL;

<P>
   Sometimes it seems like God's just got it in for Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, man, I'm always getting wrapped up in
(controversy) that I just don't court,'' says the stocky, easygoing
New Jersey filmmaker. ``I'm one of the most boring people you've
ever met in real life. I sit around and watch TV, I'm not
political, and I don't stir things up. I just like to make movies
that I would like to go see.
</P>
<P>
   ``But God, we've been involved with the NC-17 free-speech battle
with `Clerks' and took a little heat for `Chasing Amy' from part of
the lesbian community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm taking some major heat on this picture. It's like it
finds me for some reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Call him disingenuous, but Smith, 29, insists he never thought
his latest movie, ``Dogma,'' would upset anybody.
</P>
<P>
   A satire of Catholicism _ Smith grew up in the Catholic Church
and still attends regularly _ the movie takes more than a few
liberties with, well, dogma. The contemporary story line involves
two fallen angels, played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who figure
out their exile to Wisconsin can be reversed if they pass through
the portals of a certain Jersey church. If they do that, however,
they will prove God fallible and thereby eliminate all existence.
</P>
<P>
   As they cut an increasingly bloody pilgrim's path across the
Northeast, an ad hoc assemblage of foulmouthed prophets (including
Smith and his buddy Jason Mewes, in the Silent Bob and Jay personas
they've assumed in all the director's films), an even more profane
13th apostle (Chris Rock), heavenly muse-turned-stripper Salma
Hayek and an abortion-clinic worker (Linda Fiorentino) who's a
distant descendent of Christ race to stop the avenging ex-angels.

<P>
   Oh, and God? Alanis Morissette plays Her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people would see the movie and come out going, `What
happened to the ``Clerks'' guy? When did he stop being funny and
start being all about Jesus?' The movie's two hours of preachy
church nonsense,'' Smith pleads. ``I thought that's as bad as it
would get, I'd risk alienating our audience by making what I felt
was a devout movie that just happened to be funny, too. But these
people, boy, they went nuts _ without even seeing the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people'' are the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights, a New York-based watchdog group that has had it in for
``Dogma's'' original producing studio, Miramax Films, since the
semi-autonomous Disney subsidiary released the British movie
``Priest.'' Miramax heads Harvey and Bob Weinstein personally
bought the movie back from Disney for $12 million when Mouse brass,
often the targets of fundamentalist Protestant boycotts, balked at
the prospect of another contretemps with a religious community (the
League is not an organization of, nor does it officially speak for,
the Catholic Church).
</P>
<P>
   The Weinsteins hoped to sell the film to another major
distributor, but wound up going with the Canada-based Lions Gate
Films, a small indie outfit best known for last year's surprise
Oscar contenders ``Gods and Monsters'' and ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that that's mollified the Catholic League much. They're now
calling for Disney to divest itself of Miramax (happy with all the
money and awards Miramax films such as ``Shakespeare in Love,'' the
Smith-produced ``Good Will Hunting'' and ``The English Patient''
have earned it, the conglomerate has politely rejected that
suggestion). And they're still calling Smith on the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that Kevin Smith doesn't have the right to
make his movies; he certainly does,'' says Patrick Scully, the
league's director of communications. ``But we have an obligation to
our membership to speak out about this stuff and shine the light of
truth on the content of the movie. There is dialogue, content and
characters in this film that ridicule the Catholic faith, and we're
calling him on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Smith doesn't get a free pass to bash the Catholic faith
because he claims to be a Catholic,'' Scully continues. ``The
source of anti-Catholic content in movies is irrelevant. I don't
care if the person is Jewish, Muslim or Catholic; there are
self-hating Catholics in this world just like any other religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who says the Catholic League's complaints are based on
early script drafts, feels ``Dogma'' does not denigrate faith but
questions tenets of religion that he feels have become overly
politicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie's kind of about the idea of `Church good, God
better,''' Smith explains. ``Being that the church has a man-made
foundation, it's quite fallible because we made it up. There's
stuff that you can point out and go, `That's a little dodgy' or
`That's a little weak.' I don't think the movie ever flat-out mocks
it; it's just kind of like, `Look at this, it's kind of shaky,
isn't it?'''
</P>
<P>
   A product of eight years of parochial school and much self-study
in comparative religion, Smith claims the inspiration for ``Dogma''
came in the most obvious setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in church one day, looking around and noticing
that people weren't there because they wanted to celebrate their
faith,'' he says. ``They were just there because they were
terrified of going to hell. That's a big leap of difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then and there, I decided I wanted to do something that
celebrated my faith because I like going to church. But I also
wanted it to amuse at the same time; you don't want to make `The
Song of Bernadette' again, it's not going to reach an audience any
more. So I wanted to make an entertaining flick about my faith that
also dissected it a little bit. I just wanted to make a psalm _ and
then put a lot of dirty jokes in it, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Most early reviews have found Smith's approach everything from
hilarious to incomprehensible, but not really offensive. Others
agree that the film's grubby, comic-book look (when he's not making
movies, Smith runs a comics store) and playfully sophomoric tone
makes it tough to take ``Dogma's'' metaphysical and theological
discourse seriously enough to get upset about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, people heard that Kevin Smith was making a scabrous
comedy that dealt with issues A through Z,'' reckons Mark Urman,
co-president of Lions Gate Films. ``It was the idea of that that
seemed to upset a few people. People see the film a few years later
and realize that it's not what they were told. I mean, I personally
read so much disinformation about what took place in the film
before anyone had even seen it, some of which sounded _ even to me,
and I'm reasonably unflappable _ a little scandalous. But it's just
not in the movie and never was.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Catholic League's objections to ``Dogma'' include
gags about picking up chicks at abortion clinics, a plan to replace
the crucified Christ symbol with a more marketable ``thumbs up''
Buddy Jesus, and Rock's suggestion that Mary and Joseph were
sexually intimate, all of which are in the finished film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in how something plays,'' Urman points out. ``The
film is very light and buoyant _ and entertaining. It has ideas in
its head, and it touches upon matters that, if handled with great
gravity, would be very grave. But it's all done in a very upbeat,
questioning and youthful spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   And while little Lions Gate doesn't expect anywhere near the
trouble a big-target conglomerate such as Disney or Universal
(distributor of Martin Scorsese's widely protested ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' which Smith not surprisingly considers a
great religious movie) might get for releasing ``Dogma,'' the
company probably wouldn't mind some hubbub. Indeed, it was reported
that the talk of the party after ``Dogma's'' U.S. premiere at the
New York Film Festival last month concerned how disappointingly
small the protest turnout was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't shy away from controversy,'' Tom Ortenberg,
Lions Gate's other president, says, ``but we don't go looking for
it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, of course, stands behind his incendiary, if fundamentally
loopy, approach, though he'll cop to one mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could definitely say that the dude trades in low humor and
profanity and whatnot,'' he confesses. ``But I'm not speaking to
the choir. This movie is for the people who haven't gone to church
in ages or never went, or haven't thought about God or got too lost
in the world and forgot about their faith. Those people tend to be
younger and you want to speak to the young in their own language.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith is getting tired of being martyred for his art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about maybe making `Mighty Ducks 4' next; those
guys don't seem to get in trouble at all,'' Smith jokes. ``Even
though that's really offensive. The fact that there was one, let
alone three, `Mighty Ducks' movies is something that I find
completely offensive.''

Celine Dion/``All the Way ... A Decade of Song'' (550 Music)
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Near, far, wherever you are ...'' Thought you were finally
safe from the ``Titanic'' love theme, didn't you? No such luck,
folks. Dion's back with a greatest-hits collection (in stores
Tuesday) that contains all her formulaic tear-stained
million-sellers _ ``The Power of Love,'' ``Because You Loved Me,''
``I'm Your Angel,'' ``My Heart Will Go On'' _ plus seven new songs
recorded during the summer. Of interest to fans are those new
numbers, which include the midtempo ``That's the Way It Is,'' a
soporific remake of ``The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,'' the
awful Diane Warren ballad ``I Want You to Need Me'' and the
Dion/Sinatra duet ``All the Way.'' There's just something so
artificial about this stuff _ too much of it can leave you with
that disoriented feeling you get after wandering into a Ralphs
market at 3 a.m. But if you're a Dion fan, you well know that
supermarket of the heart where Dion sings 24 hours a day. 2 stars

Master P/``Only God Can Judge Me'' (No Limit/Priority)
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans rap mogul Master P was recently cut from the
Raptors, extinguishing his NBA dreams, but his sixth solo release
landed at No. 2 on the charts last week. His success proves, among
other things, there's no accounting for taste, because Percy Miller
(for it is he) hasn't made a good album in years. Following in the
No Limit tradition, ``Only God Can Judge Me'' is filled with cameos
from the likes of Nas and Jermaine Dupri along with No Limit
soldiers Mystikal and the charmingly named C-Murder dropping by to
add the usual threats and boasts. Master P's now defunct production
team Beats By the Pound offers 23 generic tracks while the
monotonous P drones on and on. 1 star
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
``The Straight Story'' (Windham Hill) soundtrack
</P>
<P>
   Composer Angelo Badalamenti has written several scores for
director David Lynch over the years; he won a Grammy for his work
on that ode to black coffee and cherry pie, ``Twin Peaks.'' But he
has never been better than this. The soundtrack for ``The Straight
Story,'' Lynch's quiet masterpiece about an old man who takes a
trip on his lawnmower to see his dying brother, has familiar
Badalamenti touches _ the lush, haunting orchestrations will remind
many of his work on ``Blue Velvet.'' But he also adds some folk
touches here with violins and guitar that perfectly capture the
film's Midwestern setting. Nostalgic without wallowing in
sentiment, this is the ideal accompaniment to one of the year's
best films. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Andrea Bocelli/``Sacred Arias'' (Philips/Universal Classics)
</P>
<P>
   Like Celine Dion, heart-on-the-sleeve Italian tenor Bocelli's
success has mostly been based on formulaic pop ballads. But unlike
Dion, there's apparently little emotional connection to the
material. There's even less emotional investment evident on his
fifth disc and third classical collection, which intersperses new
compositions and old favorites. Along with several interpretations
of ``Ave Maria,'' Christmas chestnuts ``Silent Night'' and ``Adeste
Fideles,'' the crooner offers a new take on Franck's ``Paris
Angelicus'' and Handel's ``Ombra Mai Fu.'' The disc's final track,
``Gloria A Te Cristo Gesu'' _ penned by French priest Father Lecot
_ has been named the Vatican's official millennium hymn, proving
the Pope should avoid programming jukeboxes. 2 stars

   Cootie Williams/``Cootie Williams in Hi-Fi'' (RCA Victor)
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hodges and Wild Bill Davis/``Live in Atlantic City'' (RCA
Victor)
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington's band always featured some of the greatest jazz
musicians in the world, and the leader gave his sidemen plenty of
freedom to lead their own recording dates. These four midpriced
reissues from RCA showcase some solid sessions from these
standouts. The C-Jam All-Stars disc (3 1/2 stars), featuring
trumpeter Clark Terry and Gonsalves on tenor sax, has never been
released in any form in the United States. It's a sublime session
full of masterful playing.The Gonsalves album (3 stars) is also a
showcase for alto great Hodges in a program of music by Ellington
and the two star saxophonists.
</P>
<P>
   Williams isn't quite as known as the other leaders on these
dates, but he put his stamp on the Ellington band in the 1930s and
'40s with his signature growling trumpet. ``Hi-Fi'' (3 stars)
compiles a number of r&AMP;b-flavored sides that show him in fine,
swinging form. The summit between Hodges and funky organ master
Davis (4 stars) is the most essential album of the bunch, a
high-spirited live date with soulful versions of several Ellington
standards.

   BOOKS-MORRIS _ Say this for Edmund Morris. For the scholarly
author of an 800-page biography of a former president who
supposedly had little (if any) depth _ and who's done virtually
nothing in the decade since leaving office _ he's certainly gotten
people talking about his book. Morris set the publishing and
political worlds on their respective ears weeks ago with the
release of ``Dutch,'' in which Morris himself became a partially
invented character. From historians to still ardent-Reaganites,
people raged against Morris' technique, his portrait of an
out-of-touch and aloof Reagan, even his choice of events to focus
on. Meanwhile, ``Dutch'' practically walked itself onto the
bestseller lists. In part that's because of the controversy, but
it's also because Morris, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of
Theodore Roosevelt, is a heck of a good thinker and writer. Morris
is in town Wednesday for a talk at the Atlanta History Center, and
we talk to him about the reaction to ``Dutch,'' the years he spent

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS Y2K WON'T CAUSE 'MAJOR NATIONAL BREAKDOWNS'
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday that possible
computer failures on Jan. 1 will cause ''no major national
breakdowns'' in key sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people can have full faith that everything from
air traffic control systems to Social Security payment systems will
continue to work exactly as they should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with only seven weeks left to prepare for New Year's Eve,
a White House report on the so-called Y2K computer flaw revealed
that only half of America's 911 call centers could confirm last
month that they were ready for the date rollover to 2000. More than
one-third of all elementary and secondary schools told the
Education Department they weren't prepared.
</P>
<P>
   To help Americans brace themselves for whatever problems the Y2K
bug may cause, Clinton, speaking to reporters on the White House
South Lawn, provided a toll-free telephone number _ 888-USA-4Y2K _
for readiness information.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we work together and use this time well, we can ensure that
this Y2K computer problem will be remembered as the last headache
of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Clinton's comments, John Koskinen, head of the
President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, released his final
quarterly report before the date conversion.
</P>
<P>
   The council said the best-prepared sectors for Y2K are the
federal government, power and water utilities, telecommunications
companies, airlines and nuclear weapons sites. ''Y2K problems will
not cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,'' the report
promised. ''Nuclear weapons launch requires human intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report cited surveys showing more than one-fourth of
small businesses are doing nothing to prepare for the New Year's
rollover, and half of America's 911 call centers are making their
fixes in the final weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said 911 problems won't stop police and fire fighters
from taking emergency calls, but could force workers to use manual
dispatch systems, which would slow response time.
</P>
<P>
   The report also warned that software failures in schools could
affect heating, lighting, fire alarms, elevators, student records
and teacher payroll. Some health-care providers ''exhibit troubling
levels of readiness,'' which could cause mix-ups with billing and
patient records.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen is urging Americans to have enough food, water,
medicines, blankets and other supplies on hand to get through at
least three days of disruptions in daily life. Experts say those
disruptions could involve traffic tie-ups and store closings as
computer glitches strike in the first days of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The Koskinen report also said widespread computer failures
overseas remain possible, but that the largest U.S. trading
partners, Canada and Mexico, are in good shape for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Y2K problem exists because many older software
programs and chips recognize only the last two digits of the year.
That means they could misinterpret ''00'' as 1900, and cause
computer and equipment malfunctions.

Celine Dion/``All the Way ... A Decade of Song'' (550 Music)
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Near, far, wherever you are ...'' Thought you were finally
safe from the ``Titanic'' love theme, didn't you? No such luck,
folks. Dion's back with a greatest-hits collection (in stores
Tuesday) that contains all her formulaic tear-stained
million-sellers _ ``The Power of Love,'' ``Because You Loved Me,''
``I'm Your Angel,'' ``My Heart Will Go On'' _ plus seven new songs
recorded during the summer. Of interest to fans are those new
numbers, which include the midtempo ``That's the Way It Is,'' a
soporific remake of ``The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,'' the
awful Diane Warren ballad ``I Want You to Need Me'' and the
Dion/Sinatra duet ``All the Way.'' There's just something so
artificial about this stuff _ too much of it can leave you with
that disoriented feeling you get after wandering into a Ralphs
market at 3 a.m. But if you're a Dion fan, you well know that
supermarket of the heart where Dion sings 24 hours a day. 2 stars

Master P/``Only God Can Judge Me'' (No Limit/Priority)
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans rap mogul Master P was recently cut from the
Raptors, extinguishing his NBA dreams, but his sixth solo release
landed at No. 2 on the charts last week. His success proves, among
other things, there's no accounting for taste, because Percy Miller
(for it is he) hasn't made a good album in years. Following in the
No Limit tradition, ``Only God Can Judge Me'' is filled with cameos
from the likes of Nas and Jermaine Dupri along with No Limit
soldiers Mystikal and the charmingly named C-Murder dropping by to
add the usual threats and boasts. Master P's now defunct production
team Beats By the Pound offers 23 generic tracks while the
monotonous P drones on and on. 1 star
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
``The Straight Story'' (Windham Hill) soundtrack
</P>
<P>
   Composer Angelo Badalamenti has written several scores for
director David Lynch over the years; he won a Grammy for his work
on that ode to black coffee and cherry pie, ``Twin Peaks.'' But he
has never been better than this. The soundtrack for ``The Straight
Story,'' Lynch's quiet masterpiece about an old man who takes a
trip on his lawnmower to see his dying brother, has familiar
Badalamenti touches _ the lush, haunting orchestrations will remind
many of his work on ``Blue Velvet.'' But he also adds some folk
touches here with violins and guitar that perfectly capture the
film's Midwestern setting. Nostalgic without wallowing in
sentiment, this is the ideal accompaniment to one of the year's
best films. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Andrea Bocelli/``Sacred Arias'' (Philips/Universal Classics)
</P>
<P>
   Like Celine Dion, heart-on-the-sleeve Italian tenor Bocelli's
success has mostly been based on formulaic pop ballads. But unlike
Dion, there's apparently little emotional connection to the
material. There's even less emotional investment evident on his
fifth disc and third classical collection, which intersperses new
compositions and old favorites. Along with several interpretations
of ``Ave Maria,'' Christmas chestnuts ``Silent Night'' and ``Adeste
Fideles,'' the crooner offers a new take on Franck's ``Paris
Angelicus'' and Handel's ``Ombra Mai Fu.'' The disc's final track,
``Gloria A Te Cristo Gesu'' _ penned by French priest Father Lecot
_ has been named the Vatican's official millennium hymn, proving
the Pope should avoid programming jukeboxes. 2 stars

</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hodges and Wild Bill Davis/``Live in Atlantic City'' (RCA
Victor)
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington's band always featured some of the greatest jazz
musicians in the world, and the leader gave his sidemen plenty of
freedom to lead their own recording dates. These four midpriced
reissues from RCA showcase some solid sessions from these
standouts. The C-Jam All-Stars disc (3 1/2 stars), featuring
trumpeter Clark Terry and Gonsalves on tenor sax, has never been
released in any form in the United States. It's a sublime session
full of masterful playing.The Gonsalves album (3 stars) is also a
showcase for alto great Hodges in a program of music by Ellington
and the two star saxophonists.
</P>
<P>
   Williams isn't quite as known as the other leaders on these
dates, but he put his stamp on the Ellington band in the 1930s and
'40s with his signature growling trumpet. ``Hi-Fi'' (3 stars)
compiles a number of r&AMP;b-flavored sides that show him in fine,
swinging form. The summit between Hodges and funky organ master
Davis (4 stars) is the most essential album of the bunch, a
high-spirited live date with soulful versions of several Ellington
standards.

GORE'S LONE WOLF ON WOMEN'S ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARGOT MAGOWAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Why all this furor about Naomi Wolf working for
Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   With women making up 53 percent of the electorate, a prominent
adviser on women's issues ought to be an essential element in every
campaign, Republican or Democrat. Yet it seems that Wolf is the
only adviser bringing the concerns of women straight to a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Is it her salary (until it was reduced, she earned $15,000 per
month) that everyone is up in arms about? Male consultants get paid
this kind of money and much more all the time, and there is no
public outrage or even much interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't we heard what the consultants for the other
candidates are making? Any presidential candidate would be wise to
invest in the kind of expertise brought to the table by Wolf, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Women cast 10 million to 12 million more votes than men do, and
they have been determining the outcome of national elections since
1960. Bill Clinton and Gore won in 1992 with the votes of 5 percent
more women than men and in '96 with 17 percent more votes from
women.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Morris, a former consultant to the president, writes that
for Clinton's campaign Wolf advocated family-friendly policies such
as longer hospital stays for new mothers, easier adoptions,
flexible working time and expanded family and medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   These are far from fringe ideas; they are the concerns of every
mother who wakes up in the morning and wonders about the well-being
of herself and her children.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post called Wolf a ``wacky'' adviser _ which
shows just how far the Beltway mentality has strayed from the real
concerns of the national electorate.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush would have fared far better in 1992 if he
had paid attention to ideas as wacky as Wolf's.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Beltway pundits are calling Wolf's qualifications
into question, another illustration of the growing distance between
the real world and network television. Wolf has written three
best-selling books to address the issues that concern young women.
And in doing so, she managed to inspire many in the notoriously
apolitical Generation X to social activism.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unbeknownst to Washington insiders, young American
women credit Wolf with invigorating the Third Wave of feminism.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Beauty Myth,'' Wolf writes about how images of beauty
trap women. Her second and most political book, ``Fire with Fire,''
examines the Clinton presidency and its policies, laying out the
opportunities women have to take advantage of their position as the
majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Promiscuities,'' Wolf advocates a centrist position
between ultra-conservative abstinence education and handing out
free condoms.
</P>
<P>
   She urges a return to 1950s traditionalism, a return to petting,
thus putting an ethical framework and moral limits around teens
growing up in a chaotic, high-pressured sexual culture in which one
teen-age girl in four becomes pregnant before she is 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the isolated world of politicians, it is crucial to have as
an adviser to a presidential candidate someone who is in touch with
the grass-roots concerns of young women. These women are so
alienated from politics today that only one in five vote _ down
from 1972, when half the women 18 to 24 years old were voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such apathy, Gore chose well.

`POKMON' IS CUTE, BUT CUDDLE AT YOUR OWN RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all its inevitability, ``Pokmon _ the First Movie'' has
arrived in time for the start of the holiday shopping season,
making a lovely merchandising piece de resistance for kids and
cynics alike.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn in the thick black outlines of a comic book, but
containing the dark overtones of a graphic novel, the film is
obviously a long-form episode of a show better digested in
22-minute segments.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a feat of East meeting West on several levels. The
most flagrant of which is its Zen approach to capitalism: You can't
spend unless you first know who you are. To its considerable
credit, ``Pokmon _ the First Movie,'' which has been translated
into English from Takeshi Shudo's Japanese script, couches its
commercialism in life's big questions.
</P>
<P>
   In a fit of trendy biological madness and a prescient fit of
potential marketing savvy, a scientist has cloned Mew, a carefree
kitty/kangaroo-like creature who floats and flies, into Mewtwo, a
more jacked, more dangerous Pokmon for our ``Matrix'' times. He
hovers with fury, has psychic powers and wants _ what else? _ to
rule the world. But unlike the fey maniac-villains of yore, Mewtwo
is stymied by a grating lack of self-knowledge. He's given to
wandering the countryside and wondering aloud: ``Why am I here?'';
``What is my purpose?''; ``Who am I?'' as though David Carradine
will join him for a ``Kung Fu'' moment that will cure his
introspection.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the Pokmon onslaught is spun off from the
cryptic Nintendo video game worlds in Satoshi Tajiri's ``Mario
Bros.'' series. Deadly turtles, lifesaving stars, incinerating
dragons, etc.: Cute, but cuddle at your own risk. There are more
than 150 species in the Pokmon nomenclature with names like the
Pikachus, who are represented by a little yellow canine critter who
coos and yelps his name. (``Pika! Chuuuuu?'')
</P>
<P>
   In the scary-kiddie creature hierarchy, the Pokmons lie a rung
below the satanic Teletubbies and a step above the trippy Smurfs,
and they talk enough pidgin to make Jar Jar Binks sound like John
Houseman.
</P>
<P>
   (There's a fluffy preamble/short called ``Pikachu's Vacation''
that explains some of this, National Geographic-style.)
</P>
<P>
   Humans play the game of Pokmon by collecting the creatures,
teaching them to do battle, putting them in little balls that
trainers like Ash, who's Pikachu's handler, will throw when
challenged. The challenger will throw his or her ball and their
Pokmons spring to magic life and spar until one evaporates. It's
more like cock-fighting than I think the folks at Kids WB realize.
</P>
<P>
   The film climaxes with one such fight between Mew and his
demagogic clone, designed to teach its audience that, indeed,
imperialism does not rule. Not only does ``Pokmon _ the First
Movie'' threaten to strike again with the sequel-readiness of its
title, but the overlong 89-minute opus aims to thrill tykes by
being slightly less than adorable _ meaning you shouldn't trust
these creatures any farther than you can throw them.

CREATING A SAFETY NET FOR THE SAFETY NET 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Early next year, California will become a
mammoth basketball court as Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey race up and down the state trying to
score points with Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 primary in California may decide who goes one on one
next November with the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic hopefuls have been polite to each other so far,
but it can't last. Too much is at stake. There will be heaps of
trash talk and plenty of sharp elbows thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Count on health care to loom large with the voters, pundits and
news media. Which man can convince us he is the answer to the
nation's medical dilemma _ a problem most of the world isn't
fortunate enough to face?
</P>
<P>
   We have the means to improve and often save lives, but
frequently choose not to employ them. We let people waste away and
die because the cost/benefit equation dictates it. We let them go
without as fundamental a protection as health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's solution, hugely ambitious and idealistic, is to spend
$65 billion on health insurance for the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes a cheaper, incremental approach more in line with
fiscal realities.
</P>
<P>
   Both should pencil in stops at the Over 60 Health Center in
Berkeley. They should meet with the low-income folks there. Both
claim to know a lot already about the nation's health-care
situation, but they might learn more.
</P>
<P>
   The Over 60 Health Center is part of the nonprofit LifeLong
Medical Care system in Berkeley and Oakland, which specializes in
family practice and geriatrics. LifeLong records about 54,000
visits a year by patients. More than half are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   But LifeLong recently decided to stop seeing the new uninsured,
who had been coming through its doors at the rate of more than 150
a month. The reason, it said, was the loss of $125,000 in funding
from nearby Alta Bates Medical Center, itself pinched for cash.
</P>
<P>
   This means, no doubt, that there are people in Berkeley, Oakland
and Emeryville who will be forced to go from having next to nothing
in the way of health care to absolute zero. People who live only a
few miles away, as the crow flies, from the megabucks moguls in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety net,'' said Andra Lichtenstein, LifeLong's director
of planning and development, ``needs a safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, LifeLongs executive director Marty Lynch met with
Berkeley City Manager James Keene to see about getting the safety
net repaired. Lynch, who said Berkeley has a little more than 5
percent of Alameda County's nearly 200,000 uninsured residents,
urged Keene to consider two things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pump money into a public-relations program designed to get
uninsured people to make better use of public health-care programs
such as Medicare and Healthy Families.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pump money into Lifelong to make up for the recently lost
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went well, Lynch said. He expects answers this
month.
</P>
<P>
   There are two other meetings Lynch would like to have _ with
Gore and Bradley. In fact, he has given both candidates open
invitations to show up at the Over 60 Health Center or the nearby
Berkeley Primary Care Access Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd learn plenty,'' Lynch promised. ``If they visited Over
60, they'd learn about the tremendous complexity of care for older
people with disabilities. They'd learn how inadequate Medicare is.
At Berkeley Primary Care, they'd see the number of folks of all
ages, colors and genders who have this problem of not having any
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the people who depend on Lifelong are ``a little
cynical'' about politicians' promises, but not so far gone that
they would give Gore and Bradley the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd even take Governor Bush if he wanted to come by,'' Lynch
said, referring to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican
presidential hopeful. ``The issue is what's important.''

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR TAKES A RIGHT TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Imagine if national politics were like politics
on Planet San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore would have gone to the Republican Party
for an endorsement, while former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
would have gone back to boring lectures about values.
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of what's happening here in the race for mayor, only
with two characters a lot more interesting than Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown, a Democrat who is the Great Satan for
California Republicans, went before members of the San Francisco
Republican Central Committee, asked for their endorsement in the
Dec. 14 run-off election, and got it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his opponent, Board of Supervisors President Tom
Ammiano, introduced a resolution asking President Clinton to free
Leonard Peltier, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of
two FBI agents during a 1975 shootout on a reservation far from San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Ammiano pressing his attack on City Hall by coming
down four-square against the Pennsylvania execution of Mumia
Abu-Jamal, while Brown gets George W. Bush's endorsement?
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible Ammiano will play the Mumia card to solidify
his standing with the bumper sticker and bike messenger vote. But
Brown doesn't need Bush, and for that reason alone you can be sure
he wouldn't ask for his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's old Republican buddy, state Sen. Jim Brulte, made calls
to San Francisco Republicans on Brown's behalf. Brulte is a
co-chairman of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush probably doesn't even know who Brown is, given his
recent troubles naming leaders of foreign countries. Never mind
foreign planets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Virginia, Mississippi and Montana, there are Republicans on
Planet San Francisco. Like Republicans everywhere they don't agree
on everything. They used to agree on hating Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   No more, not with left-liberal Ammiano in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Faulkner, a former chairman of the Republican Central
Committee, is on the outs with the committee, and probably even
more so because he's one of the minority voting against endorsing
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Willie's world, it's all about buying and selling,''
Faulkner said when I asked him if maybe Brown was really a
Republican cleverly disguised in expensive clothes and hidden among
rich developer friends in ritzy Republican restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to get the W.E.B. Dubois Club endorsement in the old
days,'' Faulkner said. ``He'd get what he could from anyone. It
didn't matter to him. In those days, he was the darling of the
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we have another darling of the left, Ammiano, and maybe it's
understandable that he's shoring up his support with backers of
Peltier.
</P>
<P>
   In this town, you always have to worry about someone popping up
to the left of you, even if you're Ammiano, who regularly takes on
big business, the rich and the pope. Progressive elected officials
become members of the establishment faster than wet witches melt
down to their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That we know. But who would have predicted the sudden importance
of Republicans in San Francisco? About 15 percent of voters are
Republican, but Arthur Bruzzone, another former chairman of the
local Republican Party who voted to endorse Brown, thinks 30
percent of San Francisco voters are ``virtual Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruzzone says he saw a side of Brown that hasn't been seen much
in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Willie Brown I saw (Monday night) was the Willie Brown we
saw in state government, one more confident negotiating and dealing
with Republicans,'' Bruzzone said. ``He's probably going to be a
better mayor for his second term.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruzzone was awed by what took place when Brown came to
negotiate with the neglected Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it,'' Bruzzone said. ``I see
now why he became the most powerful person in California. Now I
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understand, too. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both have
rushed for the center, so why not Willie Brown? Pay no attention to
the weird gravity that seems to pull to the left, or the
hot-breath-rich atmosphere. This may not be Planet San Francisco,
after all.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I don't pretend to know the ramifications of Tom
Ammiano's surprisingly successful write-in campaign for mayor. What
I do know is, it went a long way toward making me feel better about
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I had begun to fear we had gotten like every other town in this
country: Fat, selfish and rendered inert by prosperity. I had begun
to think that the path of least resistance was the only one most
San Franciscans could be bothered to take.
</P>
<P>
   Hey. Home prices and rents are immorally high and the live/work
zoning rules have been completely corrupted. But what can you do?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. The proliferation of high-rise buildings is blotting out
what's left of the light and air downtown and along the
Embarcadero. But who can stop it? Of course. We should commit
ourselves to public transit first so we can keep this city from
becoming one big parking lot of single occupant automobiles. But
how can you force that on people?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. There's something truly obscene about folks eating
out of garbage cans in America's No. 1 favorite tourist city. But
who doesn't have a homeless problem?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 25.4 percent of voters took the time to write ``Mayor
_ Tom Ammiano'' on their ballots and force a Dec. 14 run-off
election with incumbent Willie Brown, I have heard lots of people
say Ammiano _ who is head of the governing Board of Supervisors _
would be ``a disaster'' as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because times have changed so much that, even in liberal
San Francisco _ where there hasn't been a Republican mayor since
1964 when George Christopher's reign ended _ Ammiano is so liberal
he's scary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just last year, Republican activist Adam Sparks called
Ammiano ``a radical in the most extreme sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Ammiano advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S.
government (or any sort of overthrow, for that matter)? Does he
refuse to pay the percentage of his income tax that correlates with
defense spending? Does he burn the Stars and Stripes or get
arrested for blocking the gates at the School of the Americas or
atomic testing sites? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   But ours is an era in which a consumer-driven boom economy and
the Democratic occupant of the White House have moved the political
center so far to the right, true right-wingers have been forced to
distinguish themselves with acts like hanging the Ten Commandments
on the walls of public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   From what he's demonstrated so far, Ammiano is a textbook social
and fiscal liberal.
</P>
<P>
   This means he almost always takes labor's side against
management and believes that big, profitable business owes the
community big time. He sees clean air and water as fragile public
resources to be protected, not as necessary sacrifices to
convenience and an ever-fattening bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   When he says, ``Transit first,'' he means more than endorsing
one ``Spare the Air'' day a year.
</P>
<P>
   He wants his city not to go with the greedy, selfish
short-sighted national flow, but to lead the way to a fairer, more
humane and dignified existence for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   And _ Lord, have mercy _ he thinks we all should pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ammiano's critics are right. If he manages to beat the
odds and defeat Brown in the run-off election, it might be a
disaster for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can't run a modern U.S. city unless you kowtow to the
maximize-profits folks and stay below the federally required
minimum for every kind of civic expenditure but cops. Maybe you
can't put any real teeth in zoning and building laws or offer any
real incentives to develop affordable housing. Maybe it's
impossible to make it tougher to drive in your town while providing
a great public transit system as a viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe you can.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will never know unless we're willing to counter
the prevailing culture and kiss the status quo goodby.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush's record just substantial enough to be target
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I realize that when you raise $56 million you have
some intention of spending it. But someone should have advised
George W. Bush to sit on his money for a few more months.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, he's gone ahead and made some TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   With the greatest political minds available, Bush surely knows
that nothing draws attention like a TV spot. No, not from voters.
They hit the mute. The attention is from rivals and pundits. They
will biopsy a new TV spot as if were a suspicious mole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has prospered thus far in being a name and a number. Did I
say $56 million? The more attention he draws to anything else, the
more questions. Who needs those?
</P>
<P>
   Someone tell the governor he also errs by bringing attention to
his record as governor in the TV spots, instead of simply saying
something like. ``Bush: How swell can a guy be?''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, one of the new spots touts Bush as having held the
line on spending in Texas. To this, rival Steve Forbes has asserted
that Bush ``makes big-spending Bill Clinton look like a fiscal
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton, said Forbes, federal spending is up 21 percent.
Under Bush, Texas spending is up 36 percent. Forbes is comparing
apples to papayas, but that is how things work when a candidate
brings up his record in TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   We won't be seeing that from Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a magazine publisher, Forbes increased the use of white
space in copy and changed body-type fonts to a new and more
readable style. He will do the same as your president.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, at least Bush has a record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's problem, of course, is that he wants to show that he's
accomplished a lot, but he hasn't, partially because Texas
historically is a low-tax, do-nothing state when it comes to some
of the things fiscal conservatives don't want government doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Try as one might, it's hard to make less of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true if you're in a weak governor system and
your legislature meets only every other year, meaning Bush has had
just three legislative sessions to do something, or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious thing Bush tried as governor failed: His bid
to abolish the state school property tax and replace it with a
laundry list of business taxes. Forbes disingenuously accuses Bush
of pushing tax hikes. It's true, but was attempted only in hopes of
wiping out property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush is going to tout having given Texans
twice-running their largest tax cut ever. We should be rolling in
the dough. But the fact is that in each case the tax cuts will have
disappeared as school districts raised levies to meet crucial
needs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the spending Forbes assails, Bush says that major
portions came in pursuit of federal matching dollars, such as in
the Children's Health Insurance Program, seeded by Congress.
Generous or stingy? The truth is that while Bush's budget would
have made 270,000 children eligible, it would have bypassed a
golden opportunity to insure over 200,000 additional eligible
children between 150 percent to 200 percent of the poverty level.
Ultimately the bill included them. Bush signed it, but a stingier
bill was his choice, even though Texas gets $3 from Washington for
every dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outlay will be used against him by Forbes in a bid for
conservative votes. Later, assuming Bush gets the nomination,
Texas' governor will try to use it to show moderates he's a
compassionate guy. In either case, Bush will take too much blame or
credit. He was a bystander during the whole debate.
</P>
<P>
   Except maybe for building on education reforms that predated the
Bush administration by nearly a decade, and maybe a no-nonsense
reform of the juvenile justice system _ possibly Bush's signature
work _ Texas did nothing in the last six years worthy of boosting
anyone into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That's the dilemma for Bush, of course. Has he done a lot? No.
Then again, not much is exactly what some folks want government
doing.

SAN FRANCISCO CANCELS SOME EVENTS FOR NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A fund-raising campaign that fell short of its
goal has forced the city of San Francisco to cancel a fireworks
display from the Golden Gate Bridge and a splashy bash at the Civic
Center Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Police administrators concerned about staffing celebrations on
New Year's Eve, when as many as 1.5 million people are expect to be
in the city, have welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does for us is give us more of an ability to staff the
other events at a greater level,'' said Sgt. Dan Linehan, head of
the department's response planning for New Year's Eve. ``It reduced
the venues that we're concerned about by 20 percent, so that's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco officials announced Tuesday that the fireworks
celebration planned for the Golden Gate Bridge and the Civic Center
Plaza event were being canceled due to lack of money and because
federal officials objected to having large crowds at Crissy Field,
which is being converted to a natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The city still plans to sponsor events at two other locations.
</P>
<P>
   When city officials began planning the four separate
celebrations, they counted on a budget of $3 million in private
contributions, but donations are falling short of that goal, said
Marsha Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mayor Willie Brown. Cohen
attributed the shortfall on a late start for fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was being done in terms of private fund-raising was not
being done in as timely a manner as need be,'' Cohen said. ``We had
to reevaluate the parties we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was unable to provide figures for the amount of money that
has been raised for the New Year's Eve events and what the city
would save by canceling the two events. But, she said, any
additional savings from the cancellations will be pumped into a
party at the Ferry Building, where a fireworks and laser show are
planned.

visit to Greece following a wave of anti-American demonstrations.
The government said Clinton would come to Greece from Nov. 19-20,
shortening his stop to less than 24 hours in an embarrassing blow
to Greece. He was originally to kick off a European trip Saturday
with a three-day visit to Greece. The new schedule will wedge
Clinton's trip between visits to Turkey and Italy. (Deans, Cox News

   INDIA _ ERSAMA, India _ Bob Laprade was a relief worker at the

had never seen anything quite like this. This area on the Bay of
Bengal took one of the worst blows from the Oct. 29 cyclone. At
least 1,500 human bodies and tens of thousands of cattle are still
decomposing on the ground. (Basu, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

activities; they provide a way to be activists. Some veterans say
they are fighting new battles. Battles for flag protection and

the government promised when they enlisted and has not fulfilled.

   TROY, Ohio _ This time of year, before sunlight and before
homeroom, when only an occasional car fills one of Troy's diagonal
parking spots, the city has its routines and rhythms. It's
certainly not bustling between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. But neither is
it asleep, as cars darting around Downtown Square prove.
Early-morning Troy is the domain of people immersed in a variety of
activities _ some already feeling the stress of the day or wrapping
up graveyard shifts at factories, others basking in leisure or
gathering themselves with a walk. The scene at Dudley's Pastry
Kitchen illustrates both. (Reines, Dayton Daily News)

   Signs you're watching a second-rate Joan of Arc movie:
</P>
<P>
   1. The French sound like they wandered in from Oxford Street.
</P>
<P>
   2. You pay more attention to Joan's hairstyle than her
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   3. You're relieved when Joan is burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on, but you get the point. ``The Messenger: The
Story of Joan of Arc'' is a misguided attempt by French director
Luc Besson to make the 15th-century heroine into a kind of
modern-day ``riot grrl,'' a teen-age action figure able to remove
an arrow from her shoulder without smudging her makeup. In
attempting to humanize Joan, Besson has turned her into a bug-eyed
kook. It's bad history and bad filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first movie about Joan, of course, and it
probably won't be the last. Her story is compelling enough to have
inspired countless writers, painters, filmmakers, historians and
feminists over the past 500 years. She was a peasant girl who heard
voices (from God?), led her country to battle and victory as a
17-year-old and, two years later, died a horrible death, a victim
of political maneuverings.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Theodore Dreyer's silent classic, ``The Passion of Joan of
Arc,'' vividly captured Joan's spirituality, and Renee Falconetti's
performance ranks as one of the finest in film history. Ingrid
Bergman also made a pretty good Joan, both on stage and screen.
Jean Seberg, although in over her head, had some interesting
moments in Otto Preminger's ``Saint Joan.''
</P>
<P>
   We mention past films because there's an important lesson to be
learned from watching them. If you're going to make a movie about
Joan of Arc, you better have a good actress on board. And although
model-actress (and estranged wife) Milla Jovovich livened up
Besson's last movie, ``The Fifth Element,'' she is (at this point
in her career, at least) wholly incapable of investing the sort of
soul-searching intelligence that the role requires.
</P>
<P>
   Besson, however, is only partly interested in what makes Joan
tick. Much of this laborious movie is devoted to showing the
graphic brutality of the battles Joan and her French army fought
against the English. Frequently using a hand-held camera, Besson
manages to capture the intensity of war but fails to approach the
sweeping grandeur that Mel Gibson achieved with ``Braveheart.'' In
fact, with its artless decapitations and limb severings, ``The
Messenger'' plays more like an earnest version of ``Starship
Troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besson fills the movie with bizarre images and mystical
mumbo-jumbo, enlisting Dustin Hoffman in an unintentionally comical
third-act appearance as Joan's conscience. Cloaked and radiating
mystery, Hoffman does his best Obi-Wan Kenobi, but he's handicapped
by Jovovich's limited range. It's hard to play the conscience of a
cipher, much as it is difficult to watch a movie about one. &QL;

   NEDERLANDER-LOFT (New York) _ On the day that Jerry Seinfeld was
announcing his engagement to Jessica Sklar, a Tommy Hilfiger
publicist, her former husband, Eric Nederlander, was closing on his
new loft on Lafayette Street, contemplating his future _ with a
decorator. For Nederlander, whose friends are eager to fix him up
with a woman to help him forget that Ms. Sklar left him for
Seinfeld three weeks after their honeymoon in 1998, it's design

   MEN-FURNITURE (New York) _ If you accept the rule of thumb that
anything three inches above the floor constitutes furniture, then
Charlie Himmelberg, who is single and lives in a four-room
apartment on the Upper West Side, owns six pieces: a futon, a
bookshelf, a television stand with a television, a coffee table, a
folding canvas patio chair and a pressed-wood kitchen table that a
girlfriend gave him. But there are indications that men,
notoriously resistant to the idea of buying furniture for
themselves, are losing their fear of furnishing, and discovering
the necessity, if not the joy, of having furnished homes. By
William L. Hamilton.

   GADGETS (Chicago) _ Tim Samuelson lives the role of the eminent

his kitchen. In fact, he has eight Veg-O-Matics, one of which he
actually uses. But wait! There's more! He has four Chop-O-Matics,
three Mince-O-Matics, two Dial-O-Matics (``Slice a tomato so thin,
it only has one side'') and a Whip-O-Matic (with planetary action),
plus a Tidie Drier (for bras, hose, panties and hair), a Miracle
Broom and two Pocket Fishermen. All were made by the Popeils of

the slob sports writer of the '70s, could barely find his sofa

``Friends'' (David Schwimmer) moving into bachelor digs with
Craftsman-style furniture and warm red walls that signal ``he's

SUCCESSFUL WRITE-IN CANDIDATE SHUNS SLICK CAMPAIGN OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>

 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the early 1990s, when Tom Ammiano was on the
Board of Education, his friends printed T-shirts as a joke reading
``Ammiano for Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Ammiano became president of the San Francisco's
governing Board of Supervisors, one of those shirts was auctioned
off at his election party. The winning bid was $110.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably worth a lot more than that today,'' chuckled
Criss Romero, president of the Harvey Milk Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Democratic Club, and one of Ammiano's early supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Ammiano loyalists who made the T-shirts are from the same
crowd of gay activists and self-described economic justice
proponents who, in less than three weeks, energized enough voters
to propel the long-shot write-in candidate for mayor into the Dec.
14 run-off election against the incumbent, Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ammiano's activist army faces more difficult challenges as
it tries to maintain a grass-roots campaign against a powerful
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, 58, vows he won't hire high-priced consultants in his
bid to unseat Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass-roots effort is there for us,'' Ammiano said. ``We
have a very good organizational strategy. Right now, we're focusing
on voter registration because we want to bring in those people who
have not felt included in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, a sometime stand-up comedian, secured second place in
the Nov. 2 election after the unprecedented three-week write-in
campaign. Brown, 65, the city's first black mayor, has spent a
lifetime in politics, earning him fund-raising power, influence
with state and federal officials and a night in the Lincoln bedroom
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Ammiano were the top vote-getters in a crowded race
for mayor. Since neither man earned more than 50 percent of the
vote, they must compete in the run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign has been a slow, steady march of more than two
years, lining up early endorsements from labor groups and political
clubs and spending six months on expensive phone banks targeting
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ammiano's effort more closely resembled a guerrilla
attack. His supporters mounted a last-minute, low-budget,
all-volunteer campaign that tapped into voter disgust with
traditional politicians, including Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But the people behind Ammiano have long pushed for his run and
began plotting moves months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to draft Ammiano into the race began, in earnest, in
April when tenant activist Robert Haaland got a friend to put
together a Web site. The site was crude, with just a message that
zipped across the screen in yellow and black type: ``Run, Tom,
Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Haaland had worked with Ammiano on several tenant protection
measures and wanted a progressive candidate for mayor. He began
circulating an Ammiano for mayor petition, gathering thousands of
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The petition drive got a boost when the city's alternative
weekly newspaper, the Bay Guardian, ran a cover story on Ammiano,
urging him to run.
</P>
<P>
   Haaland, 38, began planning the campaign strategy: target
tenant-rich neighborhoods in a city with chronic housing shortages
and spiraling real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know how to reach tenants,'' Haaland said.
``They don't know what kind of message to give them. The electorate
is two-thirds renters, so understanding the renter vote is
understanding two-thirds of your electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Haaland was sold on the strategy, Ammiano wasn't.
Worried about the amount of money he'd have to raise, the
supervisor announced in August he wouldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Wilson, Ammiano's friend and fellow gay activist, wasn't
dissuaded. He set up a folding table at two gay community events
and asked voters whether they would support an Ammiano bid for
mayor. Many said they would.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 52, had known Ammiano since the mid-1970s when both were
public school teachers. They co-founded the Gay Teachers Coalition,
which fought the Board of Education to include a non-discrimination
clause for sexual orientation in the school district's bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-October, Wilson's arm-twisting, along with thousands of
supportive e-mail messages, helped persuade Ammiano to enter the
race as a write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign this week sent out its first fund-raising letter to
3,500 past contributors to Ammiano and has plunked down $6,000 a
month in rent for a campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has said he expects to raise as much as $250,000, mostly
in small donations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ammiano volunteers are likely to face the charge that
their operation is bush league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no substitute for phone banks, and the more
elaborate voter identification, voter targeting, get-out-the-vote
stuff that the mayor has at his command,'' said Jim Rivaldo, a
political consultant who is working for the Brown campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Ammiano loyalists are hoping to show that a campaign that
relies on motivated volunteers, not paid staff, can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're breaking the model of the corporate, consultant-driven
campaign,'' said Giuliana Milanese, a community organizer for the
California Nurses Association and an Ammiano ally.

   NEDERLANDER-LOFT (New York) _ On the day that Jerry Seinfeld was
announcing his engagement to Jessica Sklar, a Tommy Hilfiger
publicist, her former husband, Eric Nederlander, was closing on his
new loft on Lafayette Street, contemplating his future _ with a
decorator. For Nederlander, whose friends are eager to fix him up
with a woman to help him forget that Ms. Sklar left him for
Seinfeld three weeks after their honeymoon in 1998, it's design
first, dating later. By Monique P. Yazigi.

   MEN-FURNITURE (New York) _ If you accept the rule of thumb that
anything three inches above the floor constitutes furniture, then
Charlie Himmelberg, who is single and lives in a four-room
apartment on the Upper West Side, owns six pieces: a futon, a
bookshelf, a television stand with a television, a coffee table, a
folding canvas patio chair and a pressed-wood kitchen table that a
girlfriend gave him. But there are indications that men,
notoriously resistant to the idea of buying furniture for
themselves, are losing their fear of furnishing, and discovering
the necessity, if not the joy, of having furnished homes. By

Frank Lloyd Wright. But wait! There's more! He has a Veg-O-Matic in
his kitchen. In fact, he has eight Veg-O-Matics, one of which he
actually uses. But wait! There's more! He has four Chop-O-Matics,
three Mince-O-Matics, two Dial-O-Matics (``Slice a tomato so thin,
it only has one side'') and a Whip-O-Matic (with planetary action),
plus a Tidie Drier (for bras, hose, panties and hair), a Miracle
Broom and two Pocket Fishermen. All were made by the Popeils of

``Friends'' (David Schwimmer) moving into bachelor digs with
Craftsman-style furniture and warm red walls that signal ``he's
ready to nest,'' said John Shaffner, the show's production
designer, whose set is intended to signal ``an educated man who is
not afraid of having an aesthetic.'' By Kimberly Stevens.

PREPARING A PORTFOLIO FOR THE LONG HAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects maturity date of 6.5   percent IRAs in second question to
2002 sted 1902.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I, aged 60 and 64 respectively, are retired. We
get $40,000 yearly in teachers' retirement and Social Security, and
need to draw about $30,000 from other sources to meet our needs. As
part of that, I now work part time and earn about $10,000 yearly. I
would like to quit this in two years. I also have deferred
compensation of $10,000 a year, which will continue for the next
six years. The rest of the income must come from our investments.
We have $45,000 in CDs, investment property valued at about
$100,000 that produces $2,500 yearly, $90,000 in IRA equity fund
accounts, and $460,000 in a mutual fund portfolio that consists of
52 percent equity funds and 48 percent fixed-income funds. Are our
funds appropriate to our age and goals? Will this portfolio provide
for us for the next 25 to 30 years? How should we withdraw from
this portfolio as we need money?
</P>
<P>
   R.C., Valley Center, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I guessed that your yield from your fixed-income holdings
averaged 6 percent, and that you were getting a 2 percent yield
from your various equity funds and 5 percent from your CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding in the real estate income, this would bring you $24,582 a
year in yields, without calculating any additional portfolio
growth. That amount is more than enough to meet your needs until
age 70, when the deferred compensation income stream runs out.
</P>
<P>
   I then made a sequence of calculations based on the assumption
that you achieved average annual portfolio returns of 7 percent,
and that you withdrew at a rate of $833 a month for the next two
years and then at a rate of $1,666 a month for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation came out with a total portfolio of $923,391 at
age 70 _ the point at which you would need to begin withdrawals of
$2,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though at some point inflation will probably dictate that
you increase your levels of withdrawal, chances are you will have a
sufficient buffer so that your portfolio will continue growing
despite the higher withdrawals. You'd need total returns of less
than 3.5 percent to support those $2,500 monthly withdrawals at age
70 with no portfolio erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card here is that real estate. Clearly, since the
investment is bringing you a yield of only 2.5 percent, you
anticipate capital gains, but the uncertainty there might make that
7 percent assumption of total portfolio growth either low or high.
But it's probably a safe, and perhaps conservative, assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most people would consider the portfolio makeup, which
includes only 38.3 percent on the fixed-income side, to be a bit
too aggressive for a fellow your age.
</P>
<P>
   But given your particular circumstances, with the earned and
deferred income meaning you will make little call on your portfolio
for the next six years, I think it's just fine.
</P>
<P>
   My only suggestion along these lines is that during those six
years when much of your yield will be available for reinvestment,
that those reinvestments go on the fixed income side.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow that practice, chances are good that you will
never have to liquidate fund positions, but can simply draw from
the yield of your holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 70-year-old retired widow with a yearly income of
$45,000, with a small yearly increase tied to the Consumer Price
Index. From that I save $600 a month in a money market account,
which currently stands at $15,000 and earns 4 percent interest. My
home is mortgage-free with a current value of $350,000. I maintain
$2,500 in my checking account. I have the following investments,
none of which is needed for additional income: a $100,000 401(k)
balance, $87,000 in bank IRAs at 6.5 percent maturing in 2002,
$140,000 in bank CDs at 5.2 percent maturing this year, and a
$39,000 variable annuity in growth stocks. I need to move my 401(k)
money into some type of IRA account this year, and I must begin
taking minimum distributions on this and my IRAs. I want to invest
the distributions each year. My concerns are inflation and taxes. I
have been considering various stock and bond funds in the Vanguard
and American fund families. I can assume a small amount of risk,
but am uncertain how to allocate my investments to minimize taxes
and keep ahead of inflation. Can you suggest some stock or bond
funds for my 401(k) and the yearly distributions?
</P>
<P>
   E.S., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although you say you are willing to assume a small amount of
risk, when I consider that your current lineup consists of just
over 10 percent stocks, I'm going to consider that the operative
word there is small.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what I suggest.
</P>
<P>
   With the 401(k) money I suggest a rollover into a Vanguard bond
fund portfolio, with 25 percent each in Vanguard's Prime Money
Market and Short-Term Corporate Bond funds, and with the balance in
Vanguard GNMA fund.
</P>
<P>
   The latter two of these funds do represent some risk, but are
excellent long-term holdings, providing solid yields and excellent
long-term records.
</P>
<P>
   To dip your toe into the stock market a bit, I suggest you put
the required distributions from the 401(k) and IRA accounts into a
balanced fund _ one that divides its investments between the stock
and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   I would consider three funds _ Vanguard Star, Vanguard Balanced
Index, and American Balanced funds. Vanguard Balanced index is the
standout among the three, especially given your concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Mutual Funds notes that low portfolio turnover has
made the fund tax-efficient. The fund is the only one of the three
with an above-average rating from Morningstar, and its record in
recent years has clearly outstripped those of its rivals. It
provides a yield of 3.30 percent, and has averaged 16.83 percent
annual returns over the past three years, and 17.52 percent over
the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Those periods have been exceptional years for the stock market,
but I think that over the long haul, returns in the 8 percent to 10
percent range are a reasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be just a bit more aggressive _ without invading
your conservatively established portfolio _ you might transfer some
of the money that you have accumulated from your monthly savings
into the fund as well.

FOCUS IS NOW ON PRIVATE LIVES OF CLINTON'S WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 14)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of Bill Clinton's scandalous conduct in
the White House, questions abound about the private lives of the
men who seek to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has conceded that he once was a heavy
drinker but has avoided answering specific questions about his
alleged abuse of drugs. Arizona Sen. John McCain has confessed to
having been a hell-raiser when he was at the Naval Academy and
during his early years as a naval officer. One-time Ronald Reagan
aide Gary Bauer has denied charges that he had an extramarital
affair with a young woman on his campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no rumors that Vice President Al Gore or
former Sen. Bill Bradley had affairs or took illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   During their joint appearance before a New Hampshire town
meeting on Oct. 27, Gore volunteered that he, like other Americans,
felt ``disappointment and anger'' when he learned of Clinton's
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I also feel that the American people want to move on
and turn the page and focus on the future and not the past.''
Bradley said nothing about Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments were far less caustic than some of the
Republican candidates who gathered for a town meeting the following
night.
</P>
<P>
   For example, former State Department official Alan Keyes
contended that America now is in the worst ``moral crisis'' in its
history. Bauer remarked that ``America's a great nation militarily.
But it also has a terrible virtue deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not alone in having indulged in bad behavior. The
reputations of several prominent Republicans _ including former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, Louisiana's former Rep. Bob Livingston, who almost
became speaker, and Indiana's Dan Burton, who investigated
Clinton's conduct _ have been tarnished by revelations of
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has come up with a sure way to reverse the
downward trend in morality.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the problem, according to Democrats, is to elect
more Democrats. According to Republicans, it is to elect more
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The basic question that needs to be answered it this: Do
individuals' private lives influence or interfere with their public
performance? Are presidents less effective because of extramarital
affairs? Is America's influence abroad diminished by the cynicism
that scandal engenders at home?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the months that Clinton's relations with Lewinsky and
other women were revealed in intimate and often embarrassing
detail, he continued to enjoy the support of more than half of the
Americans who were queried by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a majority of people felt that his performance as
president was not diminished by his shady deportment. Many even
overlooked the fact that he lied about his sexual escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations about the extramarital adventures of John F. Kennedy
may, to some degree, account for the public's acquiescence in
Clinton's misconduct. Polls indicate that millions of Americans
think of John F. Kennedy as a great president, despite reports of
his sordid private life, his escapades with numerous women and the
fact that he had few outstanding accomplishments during his less
than three years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans under 40 know about Kennedy is that he was
charming, intelligent, good looking and martyred by Lee Harvey
Oswald's bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Reporter's Life,'' Walter Cronkite
wrote that most journalists who covered Kennedy's presidency ``will
tell you today that they knew about the rumors (of his sexual
escapades) but were never able to come up with enough evidence to
go with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite added, ``This alibi represents a denial of
responsibility for a gross dereliction of the Fourth Estate's
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cronkite also pointed out that reporters in the 1960s
``operated on a rule of thumb regarding the morals of public men.
The rule had it that, as long as his outside activities, alcoholic
or sexual, did not interfere with or seriously endanger the
discharge of public duties, a man was entitled to his privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it was 35 years ago. Those of us who covered the
White House on a full-time basis would ruminate over Kennedy's
private life. But no one seemed able to identify the women with
whom he had liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after his death that the public and the news
media learned of his trysts with Marilyn Monroe and other
actresses. But even if we White House correspondents had known
specifics about Kennedy's private life, we probably would not have
reported them.
</P>
<P>
   The one possible exception was his liaison with Judith Campbell
Exner, who also was the mistress of Mafia boss Sam Giancana. Had
she chosen to do so, she probably could have provided unscrupulous
mobsters with information harmful to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But we lived and practiced our profession in a time in which the
presidents, despite their varied pecadilloes, were not stripped
naked in public. What they did in secret was largely a matter for
debate and resolution between husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   By current standards of news coverage, we erred. By our own
standards in a very different era, we did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have their own way of dealing with scandal.
If they approve of a president's domestic and foreign policies, as
in the case of Clinton, they will excuse his bad behavior. If they
do not approve of those policies, as in the case of Jimmy Carter,
they will vote him out of office.

freeze salaries and reverse gains in employee rights. Businesses
have staged protests, too. Indeed, many experts say that this bold
experiment is not going to be the promised cure-all for the nearly
3 million unemployed. But it could accomplish something the

TRAVEL AGENTS MUST FOCUS ON CONSUMER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no disputing that the professional livelihood of travel
agents _ men and women who have scheduled and booked our trips for
generations _ is threatened as never before.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is this: What steps must they take to survive?
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Repeated commission cuts and caps on airline-ticket sales have
depleted most agencies' biggest revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet booking services, while not yet the dominant force
most industry analysts anticipate, are growing in scope and
variety.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much to travel agents' dismay, online-only promotions and
schemes are undercutting traditional fare structures.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report published in The New York Times, 1,800
retail travel agencies ceased business in the first seven months of
this year, escalating a trend. Longtime, dedicated agents are
asking, ``When will the bleeding stop?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IT'S TIME TO MAKE CHANGES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some observers, I'm not ready to sound the death knell.
But I see a profession that must adjust to the changing needs and
habits of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A profession that, for practical purposes, may need to reinvent
itself _ at least in regard to the leisure traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Heretofore, much of the formal response to one wound after
another has been reactive. The American Society of Travel Agents,
the world's largest travel trade organization, has urged the
Department of Transportation to declare online-only fare discounts
illegal. ASTA also has filed litigation, lobbied Congress and
appealed to the DOT in an effort to nullify the latest commission
cuts (to 5 percent) on standard domestic airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It's not my position to question these strategies _ when under
attack, I'd likely explore every angle of defense, too _ but ther ASTA actions are troubling, especially the membership
expulsion of United Airlines after it led the latest round of
commission cuts.
</P>
<P>
   One Florida-based agency even encouraged a trade boycott of
United, a position that runs contrary to travel agents' most
persuasive argument for maintaining our loyalty: that, in an era of
change, only they can provide unbiased advice and service. (ASTA,
to its credit, did not endorse the boycott.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAIN HOPE FOR THE FUTURE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents traditionally have flourished because, in theory,
they represent the traveler, not one airline or cruise line or tour
company over another. If Continental Airlines offers the sweetest
deal for our vacation, we expect a travel agent to recommend
Continental. Same with United. If Radisson Seven Seas has the best
bargain on a Tahiti cruise, we want to know about it. Same with
Renaissance, a rival line that favors online bookings (and which
ASTA also expelled).
</P>
<P>
   Individual travel agents can't afford to focus so heavily on
extracting revenge that they ignore their main purpose for being _
and their main hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's us.
</P>
<P>
   ASTA insists that all its actions are taken on behalf of the
consumer. Online-only discounts are unfair, ASTA asserts, because
not every consumer has access to a computer. These fares and
airline-initiated commission cuts, the organization maintains, are
part of a systematic effort to control the distribution of tickets
and limit public access to unbiased information about fares and
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a new ``Fight Back'' campaign, a letter sent by ASTA
to Congress last month read in part: ``Even though the first impact
is felt at my agency, the real target is the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents, however, must also consider these realities:
</P>
<P>
   _ Today's traveler relishes comparison shopping on the Internet
and perceives that online auctions, bid sites, special fares
offered via e-mail and discounts promoted on airline Web pages are
bringing down the cost of vacations _ even if these vacations are
eventually booked through travel agents. In other words, thanks but
no thanks for lobbying on our behalf.
</P>
<P>
   _ The traveler has more potential sources for information and
advice _ about fares and destinations _ than at any other time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite repeated commission cuts, airlines are filling seats
in record numbers. The traveler could not care less what commission
percentage a travel agent earns _ even if, as many analysts
predict, it eventually is zero.
</P>
<P>
   That said, most travelers have demonstrated their support for
travel agents as a profession by accepting fee structures imposed
for specific services (as a means of partially offsetting lost
revenue).
</P>
<P>
   But if they are to earn our business into the 21st century,
travel agents must convince us _ not Congress or the courts or the
DOT _ that the services they provide are worth our investment in
time and money. It's a shopper's market, and the marketplace is
jammed with new and exciting alternatives. We're all looking for
the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Travel agents _ especially those whose main
clientele is the leisure traveler _ must find ways to stand out
among the increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   Two thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   _ A signature asset of a good travel agent is the knack for
shaping vacation dreams, for analyzing our travel objectives and
budgets, and customizing a trip that fulfills our desires.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't be surprised, as the next century unfolds, to see
travel agents evolve into travel counselors. Studies show that many
travelers now do much of their research online, then visit a travel
agent to book trip elements. But an informed agent _ or counselor _
also can prove invaluable in helping us evaluate that research.
(And many of us would be willing to pay for this advice.)
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the second point:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some progressive travel agents are turning the online
revolution into an ally, not an adversary. They've become active
participants, even creating Web sites of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With younger consumers so comfortable in the interactive world,
online travel commerce no doubt will continue to develop. Travel
agents can either sit idly by and complain or actively seek their
slice of the online pie.

AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM IS CAUSE OF DELAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For air travelers, 1999 was the summer of our
discontent.
</P>
<P>
   It had the most airline delays in history. Delays were up 51
percent in April from the year before, 35 percent in May, 12
percent in June, 76 percent in July and 22 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the nation's air traffic control system is
approaching gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people were delayed every day because the
federal system simply can't cope with air traffic. And, it's going
to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Industry forecasts say the number of passengers will rise 43
percent through the year 2008. An additional 2,500 aircraft will be
needed to transport those passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the industry group that
represents airlines, predicts that if the air traffic control
system isn't fixed, this additional traffic will mean a 250 percent
increase in delays.
</P>
<P>
   Delays are not just aggravating. They cost us all billions of
dollars annually in higher air fares and lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Air Transport Association says, delays cost the
airlines $2.9 billion. It figures that passengers' lost time
totaled $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The consolation here is, despite its problems, the air traffic
control system is safe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SETUP IS ANTIQUATED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers must
work with an antiquated system never meant to handle this kind of
traffic, which causes the delays.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has tried repeatedly to update its system, dating back
to the 1980s. It's announced a series of sweeping changes to the
system, only to have each update either fail completely or
partially.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA was never organized to accommodate growth,'' says
Darryl Jenkins, head of the Aviation Institute at George Washington
University in the nation's capital. ``Nor can it deal with rapid
organizational change.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins says the FAA isn't alone in its problems. No regulatory
organization has been successful managing technology. It's a people
problem, he says. Government regulators simply don't have the
mindset necessary to handle that kind of rapid change.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins praises Jane Garvey, the head of the FAA, for trying to
make incremental changes to help the current system work better.
However, he adds, the FAA will never be able to manage today's
growth, much less tomorrow's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRIVATIZING SYSTEM CAN WORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, says Gordon Bethune, head of Continental
Airlines, is the air traffic control system is operating with '50s
technology, installed in the '60s and out of date by the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the answer?
</P>
<P>
   _ First, we need to spend the billions of dollars that travelers
already have paid in taxes on air tickets for the system. Political
leaders don't want to spend that money because holding on to it
makes the federal deficit look as if it is really a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   _ However, that money isn't enough. Bethune says the system
needs to borrow billions to buy new equipment. That won't happen as
long as the system is part of the federal government. The president
and Congress are under heavy pressure to reduce borrowing, not
increase it. Nor should we rely on raising taxes to pay for an
upgrade. As we've seen, that money will not get spent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fortunately, 16 other countries have shown us the way. They
have privatized their air traffic control systems _ either turning
the job over to a private company or setting up a not-for-profit
company to handle the job. Instead of tax dollars, these systems
rely on user fees. Passengers still pay for the system through
increased fares. However, the money will be spent _ and spent
wisely. It's to the airlines' economic advantage to see that it is.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half years after it was privatized, the Canadian
system not only has vastly improved, it's managed to cut its fees
by 27 percent. And we've seen similar results in Germany, New
Zealand, Latvia, the Czech Republic and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   They can do that because they can hire quickly, pay
competitively and immediately respond to changing technology. And
reward success.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect privatization to happen soon. The Air
Transportation Association takes no position on privatization
because one of its members, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines, fears
that under its short-haul structure, it would wind up paying much
more than it does now.
</P>
<P>
   However, the main obstacle, says Jenkins of George Washington,
is Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of (congressional) committees wanting to keep
their power vs. the needs of the flying public,'' Jenkins said.

TIME TO CHECK WEATHERSTRIPPING

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weatherstripping is designed to close the gaps around the
perimeter of doors and windows so the warm interior air cannot
escape to the outside. Weatherstripping around doors, particularly
around the entry door, has a short life span because the doors are
used every day. Opening and closing a door wears the
weatherstripping until it no longer forms an effective seal.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect the weatherstripping around all exterior doors before
the cold weather sets in. Worn and damaged weatherstripping should
be replaced as soon as possible. Before installing any
weatherstripping, check the gap between the edge of the door and
the jamb. If the gap is too wide, the weatherstripping will not
bridge it and warm air will slip past.
</P>
<P>
   You can use wooden wedges to squeeze the door frame and close
the gaps. Pry off the interior case molding (being careful not to
damage it) on the hinge side. Drive wedges between the jamb and the
framing stud, then test-fit the adjustment by closing the door.
Make additional adjustments if necessary, then replace the molding.
</P>
<P>
   Before replacing the molding, insert wooden spacer blocks in the
cavities above and below the wedges. Spacer blocks provide extra
insulation by filling dead wall space. They will also reinforce the
door frame. This will add an extra measure of security and make it
impossible for an intruder force his way into your house.
</P>
<P>
   If the gap between the jamb and door edge is acceptable, you can
install the weatherstripping. Whenever possible use metal V-channel
and metal-reinforced felt strips to seal the door jambs. These
products are more expensive than flexible foam stripping, but they
are far more durable and will last longer.
</P>
<P>
   To install weatherstripping around the jambs, cut two lengths of
V-channel to fit the height of the door opening. Cut another piece
to fit the width across the top. Use wire brads to fasten the
strips to the jamb surfaces on the interior side of the stop
molding. Start nailing at the top and work toward the bottom to
avoid buckling. Shut the door to check the tolerances. The metal
leaves of the V-channel should make firm contact against the edge
of the door. If not, you can spread them apart with a wide putty
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Next attach metal-reinforced felt strips to the exterior side of
the stop molding. Position them so they fit snugly against the
surface of the closed door, then use wire nails to fasten them in
place. Be careful not to drive the nails below the surface of the
felt strip; this could cause them to buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Next examine the threshold at the bottom of the door. If it is
worn or damaged, replace it. Remove the old threshold by cutting it
in three pieces with a back saw (assuming that it is a wooden
threshold. Use a hacksaw for a metal threshold.). Pry up the middle
piece then pull the two side pieces free. Sweep the area to remove
all dust and debris.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you can replace the old threshold with a new one
made of wood, but for added weather protection it is best to
install a metal threshold with a rubber gasket. The rubber gasket
will fit against the door bottom to form an airtight seal.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the new threshold will have to be cut to the
right length so it fits across the doorsill. You can measure the
width of the doorsill or you can reassemble the pieces of the old
threshold as a guide. You may also have to cut notches at both ends
of the threshold so it can fit around the stop molding. Again, you
can use the old threshold as a guide or you can use a contour guide
to copy the profile of the stop molding and jambs.

<P>
   Many professional builders use portable table saws fitted with
carbide-tipped blades to cut through an aluminum threshold. You can
also use an ordinary hacksaw to make the cut. Be sure to wear
goggles to protect your eyes. Before cutting, remove the rubber
gasket by sliding it out of metal channel in the threshold; you can
cut the gasket later with a utility knife. You can get a square,
straight cut if you put the piece in a miter box and cut across the
surface, rather than attempting to cut down the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Before installing the threshold on the floor, lay down a
generous bead of silicon caulk. The caulk will prevent any water
that makes its way under the threshold from seeping inside. Press
the threshold down into the caulk and wiggle it into position in
the doorway. Squeeze some caulk into the screw holes then insert
the screws and drive them home.

PREPARING CAN HELP RAISE CREDIT SCORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ 620.
</P>
<P>
   That three-digit number is the difference between good credit
and bad credit.
</P>
<P>
   It's the cutoff credit score for getting a home loan from many
traditional mortgage lenders. They consider applicants with scores
below 620 _ on a scale of 300 to 900 _ to be too risky to finance.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you want to be in a position to ask your lender for a
better interest rate without paying a fee to get it, then you
better have a score of 660 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question today for many people is not whether or not you
will qualify for a home, but at what price?,'' said Dwight
Robinson, a vice president with Freddie Mac, which indirectly funds
one of every six mortgages in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Credit scoring evaluates a borrower's potential to default on a
loan by examining the person's credit history. Lenders use that
statistical representation of your creditworthiness to decide in
minutes whether you have what it takes to repay the money you want
to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions are lasting impressions. So, it is imperative
that consumers monitor and improve their credit reports.
</P>
<P>
   Credit scores do not appear on the reports issued by the three
major credit bureaus, but many lenders will tell you what yours is.
Some, such as Countrywide Credit Industries, have agreements with
the rating companies not to disclose scores to customers, while
others will only tell borrowers in person. Ask your mortgage broker
or banker whether score information will be shared before choosing
a lender.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly used rating system was created by Fair, Isaac
&AMP; Co. of San Rafael, Calif., which gave the scores their FICO
nickname.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOOK AT YOUR REPORT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac &AMP; Co. considers its patented method for determining
the score to be a trade secret. However, the company does provide
lenders with four reasons each score was not higher. They can range
from having too many credit accounts opened recently to a
bankruptcy in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, how can you prep your credit report to get a better score
and, ultimately, a better mortgage?
</P>
<P>
   First, get a copy of your credit report. The major credit
bureaus can be reached by telephone: Equifax, 800-685-1111;
Experian, 888-397-3742; and TransUnion, 800-888-4213. You should
review your credit report annually, but when shopping for a home,
it's wise to get one at least three months prior to applying for a
loan to give yourself time to correct blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of good credit are simple: Pay your bills on time and
keep your credit balances low.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until the week a bill is due to cut the check. Mail
your payments as soon as you get your statements. The consequences
of being even a day late are too severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen incidents of people being reported 30 days late,
when they were just a few days past their due date,'' said Lenora
Land, a loan processor with the Northwest Houston office of Allied
Mortgage Capital Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Loan underwriters prefer borrowers with no late payments in the
12 months before applying for the loan. If you have bills that were
reported late in the past year or other flaws on your credit
report, you can write a letter to the lender explaining why the
problem occurred.
</P>
<P>
   However, that slows down the process and requires the
underwriter, the person who decides if the lender will finance the
loan, to make a subjective decision about your ability to pay on
time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SEVEN-YEAR LIMIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A loan default in the past seven years or a bankruptcy will
disqualify you with most mainstream lenders and force you to borrow
from finance companies that charge significantly higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders also tend to reject applications from potential home
buyers who have more than 41 percent of their income tied up in
credit card balances, car loans and other debt.
</P>
<P>
   Debt is not the only thing that can blemish your credit record.
Having too much credit also can be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you have high credit limits on several cards, you have the
potential to charge beyond your means, and that makes you more of a
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The FICO systems seem to like ``seasoned'' credit that you've
had for 24 months or longer. Hang on to a couple of older cards,
especially those that have raised your limit over the years.
However, close those that you never use, like the one from a local
furniture store in the town where you went to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to get a mortgage, you need four accounts with good
payment history and that have been open at least a year,'' Land
said. ``Anything over that is not necessary. In fact, at some
point, and I don't know what that is, having a lot of accounts
starts to drive down your score.''
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have a zero balance on those accounts before you
close them. Some creditors will stick you with the highest interest
rate they charge if they know they will no longer be getting your
business.
</P>
<P>
   It's better to pay off those small debts rather than transfer
them to other cards. Consolidating isn't the quick fix it used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The FICO systems seems to prefer low balances on several cards
over a high balance on one. The latter implies that you are
overextended, while the former shows control over your debt and
responsible use of your credit limit.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you only have one credit card, don't run out and get
more. Avoid applying for and opening new credit and check cards.
Every time you apply for credit, whether it's for a card or a loan,
the inquiry is noted on your credit report. Too many inquiries can
lower your credit score.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have enough credit to establish a strong score,
some lenders will use alternative resources, such as rental
payments and utility bills, to determine your creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, start on all of this as early as possible. If you
haven't cleaned up your credit by the time you find your dream
house, getting a mortgage will be a nightmare.
</P>

 &HT;    B. Smith on a budget
 &HT;    (Resending to fix garble.)
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vivian Reid arrived early at Barnes &AMP; Noble
Booksellers on Tuesday to learn about ``B.'' She didn't want to
miss a word of whatever Barbara Smith _ restaurateur, magazine
columnist and syndicated television show host _ had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know how she has time to do it all with her
restaurants and her family,'' Reid said anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of her informal discussion to promote her new
book, ``B. Smith, Rituals &AMP; Celebrations'' (Random House, $35),
Smith provided an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had at least three jobs,'' she joked, describing
her early beginnings as a part-time model for Ebony Fashion Fair, a
companion to a little girl and a caterer's assistant to the girl's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Holmes came to ask for some advice about a dinner party
she's planning for 10 this Christmas. Holmes said she wanted to
know ``how to become more personable with the guests and not stay
in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she could ask her question, Holmes got the answer.
Preparation is everything, Smith said as she recalled how she would
help her mother set the table for Thanksgiving dinner days in
advance, then cover it with a bedsheet until the big day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this,'' Patricia Jones whispered out loud.
``My mother did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the audience is part of Smith's charm. Before she
says a word to plug her book, she talks to the crowd of more than
two dozen _ most of whom are African-American women _ about her
life in a small town in western Pennsylvania where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Her years as a model show. Her makeup is flawless, and the navy
blue pinstriped pantsuit is unruffled after a morning of cooking
pumpkin apple soup and biscuits for a television morning show and
later taping a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   People have compared her to Martha Stewart, but Smith, 50, whose
trademark logo is B. Smith, says her mother was actually the
original Martha.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew how to make a beautiful home, and anything she cooked
tasted great,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Although her book is packed with suggestions on party themes,
holiday entertaining and recipes, Smith said that unlike Stewart,
who ``is the expert on everything,'' she likes to share ideas on
how to entertain elegantly. She also encourages people not to take
her suggestions literally.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for Chinese New Year, Smith set a table with
goldfish in a bowl as a centerpiece. That same centerpiece could be
used at a child's birthday party, she says, and the goldfish can be
given to each guest as a party favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about just sticking to what I've done,'' Smith said,
``it's about using it as a guide.''

FOCUS IS NOW ON PRIVATE LIVES OF CLINTON'S WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 14)   (EDs: ADDS copyright line after the byline)  
 (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of Bill Clinton's scandalous conduct in
the White House, questions abound about the private lives of the
men who seek to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has conceded that he once was a heavy
drinker but has avoided answering specific questions about his
alleged abuse of drugs. Arizona Sen. John McCain has confessed to
having been a hell-raiser when he was at the Naval Academy and
during his early years as a naval officer. One-time Ronald Reagan
aide Gary Bauer has denied charges that he had an extramarital
affair with a young woman on his campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no rumors that Vice President Al Gore or
former Sen. Bill Bradley had affairs or took illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   During their joint appearance before a New Hampshire town
meeting on Oct. 27, Gore volunteered that he, like other Americans,
felt ``disappointment and anger'' when he learned of Clinton's
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I also feel that the American people want to move on
and turn the page and focus on the future and not the past.''
Bradley said nothing about Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments were far less caustic than some of the
Republican candidates who gathered for a town meeting the following
night.
</P>
<P>
   For example, former State Department official Alan Keyes
contended that America now is in the worst ``moral crisis'' in its
history. Bauer remarked that ``America's a great nation militarily.
But it also has a terrible virtue deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not alone in having indulged in bad behavior. The
reputations of several prominent Republicans _ including former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, Louisiana's former Rep. Bob Livingston, who almost
became speaker, and Indiana's Dan Burton, who investigated
Clinton's conduct _ have been tarnished by revelations of
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has come up with a sure way to reverse the
downward trend in morality.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the problem, according to Democrats, is to elect
more Democrats. According to Republicans, it is to elect more
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The basic question that needs to be answered it this: Do
individuals' private lives influence or interfere with their public
performance? Are presidents less effective because of extramarital
affairs? Is America's influence abroad diminished by the cynicism
that scandal engenders at home?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the months that Clinton's relations with Lewinsky and
other women were revealed in intimate and often embarrassing
detail, he continued to enjoy the support of more than half of the
Americans who were queried by pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a majority of people felt that his performance as
president was not diminished by his shady deportment. Many even
overlooked the fact that he lied about his sexual escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations about the extramarital adventures of John F. Kennedy
may, to some degree, account for the public's acquiescence in
Clinton's misconduct. Polls indicate that millions of Americans
think of John F. Kennedy as a great president, despite reports of
his sordid private life, his escapades with numerous women and the
fact that he had few outstanding accomplishments during his less
than three years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans under 40 know about Kennedy is that he was
charming, intelligent, good looking and martyred by Lee Harvey
Oswald's bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Reporter's Life,'' Walter Cronkite
wrote that most journalists who covered Kennedy's presidency ``will
tell you today that they knew about the rumors (of his sexual
escapades) but were never able to come up with enough evidence to
go with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite added, ``This alibi represents a denial of
responsibility for a gross dereliction of the Fourth Estate's
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cronkite also pointed out that reporters in the 1960s
``operated on a rule of thumb regarding the morals of public men.
The rule had it that, as long as his outside activities, alcoholic
or sexual, did not interfere with or seriously endanger the
discharge of public duties, a man was entitled to his privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it was 35 years ago. Those of us who covered the
White House on a full-time basis would ruminate over Kennedy's
private life. But no one seemed able to identify the women with
whom he had liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until after his death that the public and the news
media learned of his trysts with Marilyn Monroe and other
actresses. But even if we White House correspondents had known
specifics about Kennedy's private life, we probably would not have
reported them.
</P>
<P>
   The one possible exception was his liaison with Judith Campbell
Exner, who also was the mistress of Mafia boss Sam Giancana. Had
she chosen to do so, she probably could have provided unscrupulous
mobsters with information harmful to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But we lived and practiced our profession in a time in which the
presidents, despite their varied pecadilloes, were not stripped
naked in public. What they did in secret was largely a matter for
debate and resolution between husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   By current standards of news coverage, we erred. By our own
standards in a very different era, we did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have their own way of dealing with scandal.
If they approve of a president's domestic and foreign policies, as
in the case of Clinton, they will excuse his bad behavior. If they
do not approve of those policies, as in the case of Jimmy Carter,
they will vote him out of office.

GAY EPISCOPAL PRIEST NAMED DEAN OF CALIFORNIA CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco clergyman is about to become the
first openly gay, unattached priest to be elevated into the
Episcopal Church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Armand John Kreft, the popular pastor who has generated
a thriving congregation in his eight years at Holy Innocent
Episcopal Church, will take over Jan. 1 as the
second-highest-ranking leader in the Diocese of El Camino, which
stretches from Palo Alto to San Luis Obispo in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   As dean and rector of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in San Jose,
Kreft becomes the second openly gay priest appointed to such a
post, and the first who isn't in a committed relationship. There
are fewer than 100 cathedral deans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be very high profile. As far as the Episcopal Church
is concerned, this is big news,'' said the Rev. Robert Cromey of
Trinity Episcopal Church in San Francisco. ``It's saying a
relatively conservative diocese is saying we are picking a
homosexual who is looking for a husband to be our leader. That
doesn't happen much in the Episcopal Church or any other church.''
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church, unlike many mainstream religious
denominations, has no proscription against homosexual or lesbian
clergy, and no requirement that they refrain from sex. Each diocese
makes its own decisions about gay clergy, as well as about the
blessing of same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   While Kreft said the El Camino Diocese has long been supportive
of homosexual rights, he found its decision to hire him courageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I am from San Francisco, and people have a
stereotype of single gay men in San Francisco,'' Kreft said
Tuesday. ``I did tell them that I am not celibate and I do date.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the appointment should tell other gays and lesbians that
they can be full members of the church.
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Innocent, Kreft has built a congregation from a mere 20
members when he arrived to more than 200 now.
</P>
<P>
   ``His congregation loves him,'' Cromey said. ``He is godfather
to five children in his congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other mainstream denominations, the Episcopalians have
struggled for two decades with the issue of homosexual clergy and
the blessing of same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   While Kreft said he is one of 33 gay and lesbian priests among
the 420 in the diocese that encompasses San Francisco, some
dioceses have none.
</P>
<P>
   Kreft moves into his new post Jan. 1, will preach his first

THE WEB WITHOUT MICROSOFT

   (Circuits)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Occasionally a new product can be annoying and delightful at the
same time. Rarely, however, does a delightful product become
annoying without any help whatsoever from the Microsoft Corp., the
notorious monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the i-Opener Internet Personal Access Device, or IPAD,
one of the first of a new class of Internet appliances from a new
company called NetPliance.com. Despite the depiction of Microsoft's
practices outlined by the Justice Department and Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson last week, NetPliance has managed somehow to
create a very interesting home computer that handles e-mail, Web
browsing and other simple tasks and yet does not use Windows,
Internet Explorer or any other Microsoft code. It uses a version of
the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Opener IPAD is scheduled to go on sale nationwide next
week for $199, plus $21.95 a month for Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft probably has many things to worry about at this moment
other than a small start-up company in Texas with a relatively
cheap, underpowered computer that has limited software, a clumsy
mouse and a mediocre visual display. But the i-Opener IPAD embodies
so many clever ideas, and has so much promise, that eventually it
could become precisely the sort of non-Windows information
appliance that keeps Microsoft's executives sleepless in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Opener IPAD, or more likely a future version of the IPAD
or one of its competitors _ maybe Microsoft's forthcoming Web
Companion, maybe something from Apple, maybe something completely
unexpected _ could eventually become as integral to my household as
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Opener IPAD is not a desktop computer. Rather, it is a
countertop computer, a simple, stripped-down, slimmed-down Internet
device that is designed to be used in the kitchen or any other room
where a fully powered desktop computer is unwanted or unneeded. It
consists of a 10-inch flat-panel display screen on a pair of skinny
legs, with a full-size keyboard attached. Although the user might
not care to know such details, the display contains a
microprocessor, 32 megabytes of system memory, a printer port and a
56K modem. It weighs 7 pounds and takes up about as much space as a
toaster.
</P>
<P>
   Like a toaster, it is easy to use. The set-up instructions are
simple: plug it into the power outlet and connect it to a phone
line. As soon as it is plugged in, the i-Opener comes to life and
in less than five minutes the owner is ready to send and receive
mail and visit popular Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the i-Opener IPAD can be bought only from NetPliance,
either by telephone (888) 467-3637 or, for those who already have
access to the Internet, from NetPliance's Web site
(www.netpliance.com). The beauty of this direct-ordering process is
that each IPAD can be customized at the factory for its owner. It
is preprogrammed, in other words, with the owner's e-mail account
and the telephone number of the local Internet host.
</P>
<P>
   Because each IPAD is programmed for its specific owner, it
already knows what number to dial to connect to the Internet, and
it does so several times a day, when no one is using the phone, to
gather e-mail, the local weather forecast, the latest news and
sports, the numbers from Wall Street and other information of
general interest. The information is stored, or cached, in the
computer's memory. (It is also cached in the local NetPliance host
computers, to minimize online connection time.)
</P>
<P>
   There are several advantages to this approach. For one thing, it
means that the computerphobes for whom this device was designed are
spared from having to mess with connections to the Internet. Also,
the IPAD can update its own system software automatically. But the
real beauty is that the IPAD is useful as an information device
even when it is not connected to the Internet. It squirrels away
the latest information gathered during its periodic forays onto the
Net, and offers it, never more than a few hours old, whenever the
user is ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want up-to-the-minute information, stock quotes
and e-mail, the IPAD makes it exceptionally easy to go online. The
system is programmed with the World Wide Web addresses of dozens of
popular Internet sites, in a variety of subject areas. A single
click on any of the addresses causes the IPAD to dial into the
local access number, and in less than a minute the IPAD is
connected. The user can then browse through the preprogrammed
sites, or use the keyboard to enter an address for any other Web
site. With another click, a frequently visited site can be added to
a ``favorites'' list for one-click access later.
</P>
<P>
   Some people hate even the idea of pointing and clicking, so the
keyboard has a number of one-touch buttons for common tasks, like
e-mail and shopping. It is like having a TV set with channel
buttons preset for comedy, drama, news, cartoons and so on.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One can even request an IPAD specifically tailored for a child,
or a teenager. Not only are the preprogrammed menus tailored to
reflect the different interests of children, with security
protections, but the color of the IPAD itself can be customized
into something more jazzy than the gray or beige of the Mom and Dad
or Grandparent models.
</P>
<P>
   If someone calls the house while the IPAD is using the phone, it
immediately disconnects so that there is no busy signal. If someone
wants to make a call, the online session can be ended instantly by
pressing the ``hang up'' button on the keyboard. A light at the top
of the display indicates whether the IPAD is using the phone or
not. Another light signals if the user has unread e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When it has been idle for a few minutes, the screen becomes an
electronic bulletin board. It displays the number of unread e-mail
messages, the current time and date and the latest news headlines.
If a headline is of interest, a single click brings up the article
without going online.
</P>
<P>
   It is that easy, and so cute I wanted to hug it. But it also had
some annoying features that made me want to mug it.
</P>
<P>
   The IPAD is limited to one e-mail address per device. For an
information appliance intended to be used in family settings,
allowing only one member of the family to have a private e-mail
account is dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there is no easy way to use the IPAD as a family
message center, unless one uses a Web-based calendar system. There
should have been a button to bring up a shared calendar, where
events like piano lessons and doctor's appointments could be
entered and seen by everyone. In version 2.0, I would also like to
see a simple way to use the IPAD's built-in microphone and speakers
to dictate and play back short voice memos, like, ``Mom, I went to
the library to study'' or ``Junior, take out the trash tonight if
you want to get your allowance.''
</P>
<P>
   The mouse, or more accurately the rubber-coated cursor-steering
nubbin, is embedded in the upper right corner of the keyboard,
while the buttons that activate the cursor are at the upper left
corner. With practice one can get the hang of holding the keyboard
in both hands while navigating on screen, but it is awkward.
</P>
<P>
   The on-screen navigation is made more frustrating by the
tendency of the cursor to ``submarine,'' or disappear briefly when
moving swiftly across the screen, the result of feeble graphics
performance. It is made even worse by the IPAD's use of a passive
matrix liquid crystal display screen, instead of a sharper,
brighter active-matrix screen that is more readable _ but also more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Although NetPliance says the device can be used in any room of
the house, I'm not sure it would be welcome in the bedroom, unless
one is seeking an exceptionally bright and precocious night light.
</P>
<P>
   Most annoying, NetPliance has been test-marketing the i-Opener
in my town, Austin, Texas, ahead of its official national debut
next week, with a marketing pitch that touts it as the first
Internet computer designed for women _ in effect: ``This computer
is so simple even a woman can use it.'' It is a pitch so misguided
that even a man should have thought better of it.
</P>
<P>
   NetPliance says it is developing other IPAD models, including a
wireless tablet, a screen phone, a handheld unit and a version of
the current IPAD that replaces the dial-up modem with an always-on,
high-speed connection to the Internet. When those arrive, probably
early next year, the era of the information appliance will truly be
upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft tried to persuade Jackson that its overwhelming
dominance of the desktop computer marketplace, which the judge
termed a monopoly, could evaporate as a result of just such a shift
to information appliances. The i-Opener IPAD could have been its
Exhibit A.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many featherweight chart-toppers of summers past, Ricky
Martin's ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' may soon be blown into the
remainder bin. But the song is assured of at least a small place in
technological history. On May 15, ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' became
Billboard's first No. 1 single to have been recorded and mixed
entirely using a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building up the music track by track on a tape-based
analog or digital multitrack recorder, one of the album's
producers, Desmond Child, used a powerful computer system called
Pro Tools to record all the song's vocals and backing instruments
directly onto a series of massive hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a writer edits an article in a word processor, Child and
his engineers used a computer mouse to chop up several different
vocal and instrumental takes and assemble each track into one
seamless part. Sound effects like reverb and digital delay were
added with a few more clicks.
</P>
<P>
   When all the parts were recorded, Child and his engineers were
able to automate numerous complicated mixes of the song and then
select the best one.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time Martin and his producers were creating
``Livin' la Vida Loca'' in a swank Miami studio, Glenn Olander, 42,
a software engineer, was hunkered down in a spare bedroom in his
house in Carlsbad, Calif., using a software program to record on
his 200-megahertz Macintosh. Olander, a guitarist and keyboardist
who describes himself as ``a hobbyist without professional
aspirations,'' records all his parts directly onto a three-gigabyte
hard drive attached to his Mac. Like Child, he edits with his mouse
and uses software plug-ins to add effects to his music.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Tools system used to record ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' is
significantly more powerful than the recording system used by
Olander. But the most obvious difference between the two systems is
price: the Pro Tools system used by Child, which requires extensive
and expensive hardware, costs tens of thousands of dollars. Olander
used software called Cubase VST, which costs less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way the MP3 format is leveling the
music-distribution playing field, affordable hard-disk recording is
leveling the recording-studio playing field. Olander is playing in
both fields: he uploads MP3 versions of his songs to his personal
page on MP3.com, the Web site devoted to the music of thousands of
bands hoping to make it big, and he uses a CD-R drive to make CDs
for his friends.
</P>
<P>
   For aspiring musicians, the combination of more powerful home
computers and a drop in the price of software now offers the
opportunity to record without the expense of a studio or the
inferior sound quality of previous forms of home recording.
</P>
<P>
   Just two or three years ago, a budget recordist like Glenn
Olander would have used a four- or eight-track cassette machine.
Today, all his music can be stored on a computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've seen over the last 30 years is a true
democratization of the recording process,'' said Craig Anderton,
the author of ``Home Recording for Musicians'' (Music Sales Corp.,
1996) and a longtime technology writer for EQ, Guitar Player and
other music magazines. ``Back in the '60s, the idea of having a
home studio was ludicrous, especially for an average person. Maybe
if you were Jimmy Page or something and you made a zillion bucks,
you could get an eight-track installed in your castle, but that was
about it.'' Slowly but surely, he said, ``things have come along
that have either lowered the price, raised the quality or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional recording tools can now be cheaply recreated with
software: pedals, amplifiers, cables, mixers and even synthesizers
and samplers are disappearing inside computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that used to require a massive amount of gear now
fits in a laptop,'' said David Battino, former editor of Music and
Computers magazine, now defunct. Many of these programs also
contain feature-rich MIDI sequencers, which use computer data to
control drum machines, synthesizers and samplers.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous companies, including Steinberg (the maker of Cubase),
Emagic, Sonic Foundry and Mark of the Unicorn, have developed
extremely versatile and intuitive Pro Tools-style software programs
that harness the built-in processing power of a reasonably fast Mac
or PC, turning a desktop computer into a recording studio that is
mightier _ and far more cost-effective _ than many top real-world
studios were just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though many musicians and producers insist that high-quality
analog tape produces better sound than any digital format,
hard-disk recording systems have a number of undeniable advantages.
Digital recordings are free of tape hiss and can be copied and
manipulated again and again without any loss of sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   Small sections of music can easily be looped over and over again
_ an indispensable tool for a composer trying to come up with a
great bass line or keyboard part. The number of tracks possible in
a hard-disk system is often limited only by a computer's RAM and
processor speed; never before have low-budget recordists been able
to utilize 16 or 24 discrete tracks in the same song.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a band with drums and amps, you still need to
have an environment in which to record those,'' said Adrian Lee, a
former keyboard player for the British pop band Mike and the
Mechanics, who, like Olander, records with Cubase VST on a
Macintosh. ``And someone's bedroom is not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the next Beck or Jimi Hendrix may be sitting in a bedroom
with a computer and a guitar at this very moment, creating sounds
that will be sprung on the world in the next year or two. ``What's
going to happen,'' Anderton said, ``is that in three or four years
we'll wake up one day and say, `Hey, wait a minute, I just realized
that everything in the Top 10 was done inside a computer.'''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I want to change the single-control faucet in my stall shower
to a different type that requires a larger opening or hole in the
tile wall.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have, and cannot find, a ceramic hole saw the size of
the opening needed, so I want to be able to do the job with
standard hand and power tools, and without having to replace any of
the old tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Any idea how I can do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Draw a circle on the tile the size of the opening you want,
then use a small masonry bit (about 3/16 inch) to drill a series of
holes spaced less than 1/2 inch apart around the circle as shown
here.
</P>
<P>
   Now use a pair of tile nippers, or even a small cold chisel and
hammer, to break off the small sections of tile between the holes
to form the actual size opening needed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The flue for our fireplace and the flue for our gas furnace
are built into the same wide chimney, although they are a few
inches apart at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The furnace flue is a couple of inches higher than the fireplace
flue and we plan to have the chimney repaired at the top because
some of the bricks are loose and mortar is falling out.
</P>
<P>
   Should we have the flues made the same height? And is it
advisable to have chimney covers installed on top of the flues to
keep out rain and contain sparks?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would advise making both flues the same height and would
definitely recommend installing chimney caps over both flues.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you should install a solid vertical divider between the
two flues to prevent smoke from one flue getting blown down into
the adjacent flue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My house has cedar shingles on the outside that are stained
brown. I would like to paint them white. Can this be done?
</P>
<P>
   A: The shingles can be painted by applying two or three coats of
a latex house paint, but painting shingles is never a good idea
because paint is much more likely to peel.
</P>
<P>
   Shingles are best maintained with stain, rather than paint.
However, there are some white, heavy bodied, semi-opaque stains
that look almost like paint.
</P>
<P>
   When using these over a dark stain there is a chance that some
of the dark stain will ``bleed'' through the white later on,
especially if the original stain contains creosote.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to be sure this won't happen is to test the white
on a small area and then wait several months to see if ``bleeding''
does occur.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have been told that drafts or air leaks around windows and
doors will greatly increase energy waste during both the heating
and air conditioning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a simple way to test for such air leaks without
requiring special equipment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wait for a very windy day or night, then light a candle and
move it slowly around the inside edges of each fully closed window
or door.
</P>
<P>
   If the window or door doesn't fit properly and is allowing
drafts to blow in around the edges then you will see the candle
flame flicker where the draft is entering.
</P>
<P>
   Usually all that is required to correct this is to add or
replace the weather-stripping around that opening.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``TILE NIPPERS'' goes with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: After drilling a series of small holes around the
perimeter of the enlarged opening, the excess tile can be chipped
away with tile nippers.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no glitter at www.witness.org. There is death and
anguish. Bodies are being stacked like cordwood. Women shriek at
the loss of a relative to prison, or to a killing squad. The heavy
metal comes in the form of bars and razor wire, and the soundtrack
is rock-hard, not hard rock. Come equipped with Real Player, Quick
Time and a strong stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder if benefit rock concerts and the pet causes of
celebrities produce results beyond a new album? Well, this site
does, and, its revolution is televised.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1992 by the singer Peter Gabriel in partnership with
the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and the Reebok Foundation,
Witness has provided 125 human rights groups in 47 countries with
two formidable weapons: video equipment and training in how to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   These groups monitor trouble spots like refugee camps in Rwanda,
marches in Northern Ireland and mental hospitals and garment
factories in the United States. Armed with light and sound in
places where there may be no electric power or paved roads, the
organizations, many of them impoverished and officially shunned,
are documenting atrocities that would otherwise become dry reports
to be dismissed by the authorities, and are turning them into
riveting evidence of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Using hidden cameras and training from Witness, the Global
Survival Network, a nonprofit human rights and environmental group,
has documented the trafficking in women from the former Soviet
Union, who are lured to the United States and elsewhere with false
promises of jobs and then forced to work as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Witness has helped provide the International War Crimes Tribunal
in Yugoslavia with eight hours of videotaped interviews with
survivors of village massacres, produced by four Kosovar Albanians
trained and equipped by Witness staff members.
</P>
<P>
   A Witness camera recorded the exhumation of genocide victims in
Rwanda in 1996. This summer in Israel, a partnership of Witness and
the Arab Association for Human Rights interviewed residents of
mixed Jewish-Arab villages for a documentary on discrimination by
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child soldiers,'' a Witness project, tells of 250,000 children
worldwide engaged in military conflict, as porters, spies, sex
slaves and soldiers, in places like Sudan and northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan massacres, military abduction in India, Burma's civil
war: all are captured on tape, all can be explained away, but none
can be denied.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Caldwell, director of Witness, said that in the early
1990s Gabriel was taking part in a worldwide musical tour for
Amnesty International and wanted work for human rights in a more
direct way than just raising money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the inspiration for Witness arrived in the form of
Rodney King. ``Peter was really galvanized'' when the amateur tape
of King's being beaten by Los Angeles police officers hit the
screen,'' Ms. Caldwell said. ``He had a fairly simple concept: Give
cameras to the world, and enable people to right the wrongs they
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Web viewers can watch and hear short segments of tape about
Witness from CNN, a public service announcement produced with
Gabriel's help and collections from the Witness archives. The
descriptions in its film interviews and archives are vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Current online videos involve brutality in three African nations
_ Congo, South Africa and Nigeria. From the home page, click on the
photograph of one of the speakers. When the document window
appears, click on the word ``stories'' at lower left.
</P>
<P>
   In one video, a South African filmmaker Mark Kaplan documents a
family's encounter with Gideon Nieuwoudt, the security police
officer from the apartheid era who is accused of torturing,
abducting and killing their son, Siphiwo Mtimkulu, a student
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In an accusation made in 1981 after his release from five months
in detention (he was fed rat poison) and just before he
disappeared, Mtimkulu tells of being interrogated in the same
prison cell where Steve Biko, the anti-apartheid campaigner, died
in 1977. Nieuwoudt has admitted taking part in Biko's death.
</P>
<P>
   The video is not unbiased. Kaplan, in a printed interview, does
not hide his disgust for Nieuwoudt, who cooperated with the
filmmaker, apparently as part of a bid for official amnesty. (The
national Truth and Reconciliation Commission turned him down in
January.)
</P>
<P>
   In one segment, Nieuwoudt, neatly dressed, visits the Mtimkulu
home, asking Mtimkulu's parents for forgiveness and saying he never
brutalized their son. The polite meeting is interrupted when
Mtimkulu's son, smashes a vase over Nieuwoudt's head.

   Passionflowers: What Now?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have three passionflower plants, growing in pots, that
became 15-foot vines while they were outside over the summer. Now
that they are in for the winter, what should I do next? Do I cut
the vines back? Should I fertilize them?
</P>
<P>
   A. As long as you got them untangled from their outdoor supports
without damaging the main stems, there's no need to cut them back.
Just provide an indoor trellis (preferably a portable one _ the
plants will be huge by spring), and let them keep on going.
</P>
<P>
   A passionflower's need for food depends on two things: its
natural blooming habits and the brightness of its indoor home.
</P>
<P>
   Some varieties, including the large-flowered purple and white
Passiflora caerulea, the little yellow P. citrina and the big,
bright red P. coccinea, are ever-bloomers that will be glad for
monthly feedings throughout the winter. Others, including
old-fashioned purple Maypop (P. incarnata) and the little pink P.
sanguinolenta, are spring and summer bloomers that should be going
into a rest period before long. Feed these, too, but half as often
and at half strength.
</P>
<P>
   Before you get out the fertilizer, bear in mind that all
passionflowers need bright light. If yours are in a dim location,
it won't matter what type they are. They will just hold on over the
winter, growing slowly and greenly, and should be fed only
sparingly _ quarter rations _ until stimulated by the brighter
light of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Planting Under a Beech
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have volunteered to replant an area in my co-op's garden
that is directly under a 75-year-old beech tree, but all the books
I've read warn against planting under beech because of the dense
shade and the shallow roots. This is a very formal garden so I am
hoping for a low hedge similar to boxwood, with taller holly plants
at each end that I can shape into pyramidal columns. In front of
these I want borders of perennials and annuals. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A. While you're at it, why not ask to win the lottery, bring
about world peace and live forever? Unfortunately, the books were
right, but beauty is well within reach if you work with what you've
got.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than planting in the soil, consider containers that can
be switched back and forth. The holly columns (have fun pruning)
will grow well in deep, formal boxes, preferably boxes on legs so
they don't smother the roots underneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Plant four hollies instead of two, and put two of them under the
beech and the other two in a spot where they get bright light but
not all-day sun. Switch their positions roughly every month.
</P>
<P>
   Sun-loving annuals can be treated the same way if you don't mind
moving them every 10 days or so. But perennials are likely to be
more trouble than they're worth. As long as you're careful of the
beech roots, you can plant lots of early spring-flowering bulbs
like crocus, snowdrop and scilla. (Bulbs that flower later in the
season will not get enough sun on the foliage to bloom in
subsequent years.) Use a narrow bulb planter, and watch where you
punch it.
</P>
<P>
   Since you want a low hedge, it sounds as if the view beyond the
tree is pretty _ or at least not ugly. Could it become an asset if
it were framed with ornamental fencing? Does the tree shelter a
spot where a good-looking bench might be welcome? And what's up
with the venerable beech itself?
</P>
<P>
   These handsome trees don't usually need setting off; they're
beautiful all by themselves.
</P>

 &HT;    FIRST LADY FINDS WARM AUDIENCE, ECHOES OF SENATE RACE, IN ISRAEL
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By LARRY KAPLOW(at) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Her statements on the Middle East might make
her a controversial Senate candidate with some American Israel
supporters, but Hillary Rodham Clinton Wednesday received a warm
welcome visiting Israel as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and daughter Chelsea were on the first day of a four-day
trip to Israel and Jordan that was promised early this year. They
visited a youth counseling program and spoke at a university
seminar on Israel's care for its children _ both issues central to
Clinton's seven years as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trip was planned, Clinton has become the likely
Democratic contender for a New York seat in the U.S. Senate. Even
as admiring Israeli college students waited to catch a glimpse of
Clinton at Tel Aviv University, four American students brought the
Senate race to her.
</P>
<P>
   They carried signs supporting Clinton's prospective Senate
opponent, Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani has been a good friend to Israel,'' said Bill
Weissman(CQ), a 19-year-old student from New Jersey who said he
plans to vote in New York next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has riled some Israel supporters by stating that she
thinks the Middle East peace process would be enhanced by bestowing
statehood to the Palestinians. However, that view is fairly common
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israel supporters also groused that originally the trip did
not appear to include a visit to the Western Wall, a Jewish holy
site. That is now on the schedule for Thursday. Some officials
avoid trips to the Wall because it is located in the portion of
Jerusalem that the United States considers occupied territory,
captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   But, while some American Jews may be wary, Israelis on the first
lady's stops Wednesday did not appear to worry about her support of
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Nava Barak, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, showered
her with praise. An 18-year-old boy with nose and chin piercings
said he was glad to meet her. Even protesters, calling on a boycott
of her hotel because of a controversy over kosher food regulations
at the Jerusalem Hilton, said they admired the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Clinton stressed that the United States and Israel
share the same concerns about their children.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Kfar Sava, Clinton visited Elem and
Hafuch al Hafuch, programs offering van-side and coffee shop
counseling by peers to youth dealing with child abuse, drug abuse,
and other crises. She evoked her belief that the whole village has
to pitch in to raise the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that it takes a village and for many of us around
the world, Israel has always represented that village,'' she said
to about 70 adolescents and their counselors. ``This village, as we
now move from the 20th century to the 21st century, has such
tremendous promise and potential.''
</P>
<P>
   At the youth center, Clinton met with Ohad Bikowsky, 18, who
said he used to drink a bottle of vodka a day before beginning
counseling with Elem. Now, he has stopped drinking and is an
apprentice at a body-piercing shop _ himself pierced in the nose
and chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me, 'Come as you are,''' said Bikowsky of the
invitation he received from Elem to meet with Clinton. ``I hope
that something good will come out of this visit because these guys
really need it. I don't care if the reason she does it is to get
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Israelis here, facing urban problems as well as pending draft in
the Israeli army, did not join those Americans objecting to
Clinton's endorsement of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans aren't living here and don't know what is happening
here,'' said Liat Shiber, a 16-year-old youth counselor. ``They
don't have friends dying.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish voters are seen as key in the New York Senate race,
which early polls show close or with an edge to Giuliani, Clinton
aides stressed she was not here for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's here as first lady. This is the kind of trip she had
done many times around the world on behalf of the state department
and the White House,'' said spokeswoman Marsha Berry.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was paid for by the U.S. government and, according to
aides, was promised in March when Clinton visited North Africa. The
Israel-Jordan journey was delayed then because of the sensitivity
of the Israeli elections and the death of Jordanian King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in addition to the trip to the Western Wall, Clinton
will be hosted by Suha Arafat, the wife of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, at a program for early childhood healthcare in the
West Bank Palestinian city of Ramallah.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am looking over some notes I jotted down the other day while
visiting a new Web site called Troublewear.com. ``It's really
pimp,'' I wrote. ``This is tite, I'm ready for a killer whack.
Click and buy, dude. Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took me roughly an hour to come to my senses after my initial
foray into Troublewear, a high-energy world of online youth culture
that celebrates surfer lingo, blaring music and the sort of jerky
green graphics that remind me of Wired magazine circa 1995.
</P>
<P>
   How did I get there in the first place? To translate my notes: I
wanted to buy my brother a really cool (``pimp'') birthday present
to divert attention from the fact that it would arrive several days
after his actual birthday.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard about the extreme-sports theme of Troublewear
(www.troublewear.com), the site's selection of logo-laden men's
shirts ($10 to $17) sounded like just the thing for my
brand-conscious brother, a devoted adherent of such extreme sports
as mountain biking, in-line skating and baby-sitting for his
nieces.
</P>
<P>
   Troublewear.com also calls itself the first extreme-sport brand
to be marketed solely on the Internet. The company joins a growing
number of new brands _ www.ingredients.com started an Internet-only
line of scented bath products last week, for instance _ that are
taking advantage of the lower overhead online, where proprietors
don't have to rent physical space to display their wares or hire
sales clerks to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the site was pretty pimp. There's a Lingo Lounge
to explain the site's jargon, a chat and bulletin board area and a
rich collection of Quicktime video ``killer klips,'' featuring such
extreme sports footage as a motorcycle rider nicknamed Shed Guy
jumping over prefabricated tool sheds.
</P>
<P>
   But when I actually tried to buy something at Troublewear, the
site suddenly didn't seem quite so clean and pure (``tite''). For
instance, the images of the clothes for sale weren't actual photos
that showed models wearing the shirts. They were simple line
drawings of the shirts. You could zoom in on the logo _ and yes,
zooming was a killer whack feature _ but in the end it was still
impossible to tell what the clothes looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be a tight or loose fit? How high was the neckline? The
color choices looked more like the blocks of paint in a set of
children's watercolors than like fabric hues.
</P>
<P>
   My brother is somewhat picky. Fanatically loyal to such
tried-and-true brands as the Gap (he likes the fit) and J. Crew (he
owns one of the largest documented collections of the cotton
chambray checked shirts), he has demanding standards when it comes
to color and texture. Shopping for him is as adventurous as trying
an extreme sport for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think it might be less nerve-wracking to jump a
motorcycle over a row of prefab sheds than to choose just the right
cotton blend with contrasting ribbed trim.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Troublewear.com, I started sketching and gave up.
I phoned Troublewear's founders to complain that the site seemed to
put far more emphasis on creating an online haven for
extreme-sports enthusiasts than on its retail operation. That, I
was told, was the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this kind of brand, you have to create a community
first,'' said Rob Shively, the company's vice president of
marketing. He explained that Troublewear is aimed at shoppers aged
12 to 21. ``The generation that we're trying to appeal to is very
fickle and they're very elusive,'' he said. ``They know when
they're being sold something and they're very cynical about
advertising. If they think that a brand is selling out, that it's
just about making money, they won't buy it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If you buy the questionable premise that kids are cynical about
advertising (that's why they wear it on their chests), you can see
the reasoning behind Troublewear.com's strategy. It's far easier to
control the image of the brand by limiting the marketing and
distribution process to the Internet. That way, there's no chance
that the company's clothes will end up on the 50 percent-off rack
in an un-pimp mall store.
</P>
<P>
   That also explains that the problem with the site wasn't the
crude line drawings of shirts. It was me. Maybe I'm a little too
old for Troublewear.com. The company's president, Don Kerkes, was
too polite to come right out and say it, but he did point out
gently that ``we felt blending extreme sports with the Internet
really targeted the younger customer.''
</P>
<P>
   So I decided to turn my back on all extreme sports except
bargain hunting. That's how I ended up buying my brother a nice
lamb's wool V-neck sweater from the J. Crew Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog, the sweater cost $49.50; online, the price was
$39.60. When I called J. Crew's toll-free number to make sure there
was no mistake, a customer service representative (who sounded,
reassuringly, slightly older than me) said that J. Crew, also eager
to take advantage of the savings of doing business online, was
offering discounts on selected items to encourage shoppers to use
the site.
</P>
<P>
   And I know the fit will be killer.

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; APPELLATION &LR;  - A growing emphasis on appellation
represents a fundamental shift in California winemaking philosophy
_ a shift that gives less credit to the winemaker and the grape and
more credit to the soil and the site.
<P>
   As wineries succeed in building prestige for geographic areas,
consumers can expect to see prices for wines from those regions
soar. Predictably, as appellations rise in value, disputes are
emerging over who's in and who's out.

NEW TOOLS TO PROTECT ONLINE PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Chaum is at it again. Chaum, a master cryptographer who
made his name creating techniques for preserving a person's
anonymity on the Net, is now developing a new generation of tools
for protecting the privacy of online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Chaum has devoted much of his professional career to exploring
how secret codes can be reconfigured to offer people the ability to
buy and sell goods electronically without revealing their names.
His goal is to replicate the anonymity of paper cash without any of
the bulk, inconvenience or insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Diffie, an inventor of public-key cryptography, said
Chaum had the flash of insight to realize that it was possible to
create digital cash that was both secure and anonymous. ``He's been
the driving force in the area,'' Diffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ledig, a partner in the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris,
Shriver &AMP; Jacobson who writes frequently about new technology and
banking, said Chaum had found unique ways to ``promote the benefits
available from electronic commerce while offering individuals the
opportunity to protect information about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This respect, however, has yet to be translated into business
success.
</P>
<P>
   The road has not been easy. Chaum set up his first company,
Digicash, in 1990 to create a mechanism for shuttling money across
the Internet in a way that would be both very secure and very
private. The system was notable because a bank could not use the
information in its database to watch how a customer spent money _
the kind of information that credit card companies have about their
customers' habits.
</P>
<P>
   While Digicash signed several high-profile deals with big
customers like DeutscheBank, it never succeeded in grabbing much of
a market. Potential users needed to set up separate accounts with
each bank and install special software. In 1998, Digicash declared
bankruptcy and auctioned off its assets, including some of Chaum's
patents, to a new company, eCash.
</P>
<P>
   The failure does not deter Chaum, who believes that many people
need privacy when they purchase things over the Internet. ``When
you buy something online, you leak information,'' he said. People
are running into that problem more often now, he said, because they
are buying more personal items through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that even seemingly mundane transactions could
reveal important bits of data. Amazon.com drew widespread
complaints when it started creating ``specialized best-seller
lists'' that report the most popular books purchased by people at
particular companies, schools and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see his point. The Amazon list for Bell
Communications Research, for instance, lists a book describing some
of the technical challenges involved in shipping voice signals over
the Internet. That is probably an active area of research for
everyone in telecommunications, so it is not so surprising, but
other, less obvious information might be gleaned in the same way.
Is it a coincidence that the list for Fort Meade, Md., the home of
the ultrasecret National Security Agency, includes ``Black Hawk
Down,'' about the 1993 U.S. military operation in Somalia?
</P>
<P>
   Chaum's new system is designed to work seamlessly with credit
cards, which most people use to pay for Internet purchases. His
plan is to issue special credit card numbers that will be good for
only one use. People will be able to purchase the numbers over the
Net like traveler's checks, then use them for a purchase at a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone tried to trace the spending, the trail would end at
Chaum's company. The customer's credit card would show a purchase
from Chaum's company, but not the number identifying the card
purchased. The merchant's account would show a charge to Chaum's
company. Any snoop with access to just the records of the bank, the
person or the merchant would not be able to put together the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   That approach would offer only limited anonymity. It would
release some information to a snoop because the full purchase price
would still appear on a customer's statement, albeit as a charge to
Chaum's company.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who read the monthly statement from the customer's credit
card company would see only the amount, not its final destination.
But someone with access to the records at Chaum's company could
pierce the veil.
</P>
<P>
   One banking industry insider questioned whether Chaum's system
would really add much security. ``Do you trust David Chaum more
than Visa?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Chaum argues that partial security would still be better than
the current system, which shares a person's name and credit card
number with an army of clerks, waiters and database engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Chaum said the system would also help reduce credit card fraud,
a major problem for the industry. ``That 16-digit number is only
going to work once,'' he said, ``and it's only going to work for
that account. It will only pay that one merchant.''
</P>
<P>
   Thieves often steal credit card numbers from payment slips and
discarded receipts. Some even use access to corporate databases to
find out a customer's credit card numbers and expiration dates. Any
eavesdropper or malicious clerk who tried to reuse one of Chaum's
numbers would fail because the processing system would allow it to
work only once. Chaum suggested that this scheme would be quite
useful if someone did not completely trust a merchant met online.
The customer could be safe in knowing that a clerk would not be
able to misuse a number for one of the special credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Chaum has yet to settle on a firm business model or company name
and suggested that his company might run the system itself or
license it to other businesses. His company is toying with the idea
of offering a more sophisticated version, in which a customer would
set up an account that would be automatically refilled monthly from
a credit card account. That would also hide the amount of the
charges because the credit card bill would display only the total
amount sent to Chaum's company.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that this new approach will allow his new company to
carve a marketplace niche without displacing the major companies.
``People are very conservative when it comes to financial stuff and
payments,'' he said. ``It was just astonishing how long it took
consumers to adopt automatic teller machines.''

   &UR; A SCANNER'S COLOR DEPTH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I want to buy a scanner but don't understand all of that
24-bit and 36-bit color business that's always mentioned in scanner
advertisements. What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Those numbers in the advertisements refer to a scanner's bit
depth, which is the number of bits (pieces of information, in ones
and zeroes) used to represent each pixel (a single point in an
image) in the scanned image. The number is also referred to
sometimes as the scanner's color depth. Generally speaking, the
higher the bit-depth number, the more individual colors and
gray-scale levels will be represented in your scanned images. But
hardware and software factors may affect the final overall quality.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, a 24-bit scanner can show 16.78 million
individual colors, a 30-bit model can display 1.07 billion colors,
and a 36-bit device can do 68.72 billion colors. Those numbers are
just the mathematical possibilities, but higher bit depths will
usually give you better color accuracy in your scans.
</P>
<P>
   As far as factoring bit depth into your purchase decision, you
should take into account how you will be using the scanner. If you
want to scan in family photos or do some small-business
applications, a scanner with a lower bit depth should be adequate.
If you are a graphics arts professional and the accuracy of every
color counts, you may want to look at high-end models for more
precise results.

WINEMAKERS TO WATCH

 CHRON   Beth Milliken, Spottswoode Vineyard &AMP; Winery 
 &HT;       
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; ST. HELENA, Calif. _ &LR;  Beth Novak Milliken was destined to be a
vintner. Raised in San Diego County, where her father had a medical
practice, Milliken moved to St. Helena in 1972 when she was 11
years old. Her father was looking for a career change and a new
life in a more rural location to raise his family.
<P>
   When he bought the Spottswoode estate from Albert Spotts, it was
Milliken's first contact with wine and one she wouldn't forget.
Although her family's plans to start a winery were delayed when
Milliken's father died in 1977, her mother, Mary, wound up running
Spottswoode Vineyard &AMP; Winery. Milliken eventually joined her and
is now president.
</P>
<P>
   Spottswoode's first winemaker was noted winemaking consultant,
Tony Soter. Today, with the help of winemaker Rosemary Cakebread
and wine consultant Mia Klein, Spottswoode has established a
reputation for consistent high quality Cabernet Sauvignon and
Sauvignon Blanc. The Cabernet comes from Spottswoode's 40-acre
estate organically farmed vineyard and the Sauvignon Blanc is a
blend of estate grapes and grapes purchased from vineyards in
Calistoga and Carneros.
</P>
<P>
   Balance, refinement, complexity and consistency distinguish
Spottswoode wines, especially the Cabernet Sauvignon. Milliken
points to the 1996 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($60) and the
1998 Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc, $18 as examples of the
Spottswoode style.
</P>
<P>
   Production is small at Spottswoode, but the quality and style
place the wines among the leaders of the future.
</P>

 &UR; Ted Lemon, Littorai Wines &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Lesli Neilson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; ST. HELENA, Calif. _ &LR;  Ted Lemon, who is known for his Pinot Noir
and Chardonnay, was inspired to make wine after spending a year in
France as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   During his stay, he visited a large estate in Muscadet; the
chateau was shrouded in fog and mist. The owners told the visitors
how winemaking is a magic potion of chemistry, agriculture,
tradition and human experience. Lemon was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a bachelor's degree in French literature from
Brown University and an enology degree from the University of
Dijon, he worked in Burgundy for four years, learning to make Pinot
Noir and Chardonnay. Once back in the U.S., he spent another seven
years at a winery in New York state working exclusively with
Chardonnay before moving to California.
</P>
<P>
   He is a firm believer in vineyard-designated wines and
concentrates on the cultivation of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. ``The
Chardonnay I make is subtle and refined _ it shouldn't hit you over
the head with a baseball bat,'' he says. As for Pinot Noir, Lemon
says it should be elegant and light; it's his favorite wine to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Littorai wines are only available in restaurants. Lemon doesn't
want to build Littorai on what he terms ``media mojo'' but hopes to
create a fine wine estate based on selling the way classic European
estates were sold years ago, establishing themselves in the finest
restaurants. Restaurant sommeliers, he says ``are the real
ambassadors of my wine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Littorai wines are available at such
restaurants as Rubicon, Jardini &LR; e &LR; re, Postrio, Farallon, EOS and
Chez Panisse.

 &UR; David Miner, Miner Family Vineyards &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Kim Severson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA, Calif. _ &LR;  David Miner is one of a small group of talented
winemakers without extensive plantings who buys grapes and produces
some exciting Chardonnays and, in particular, some new, elegant
Pinot Noirs.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has long been an enthusiastic consumer of wine,
Miner came to winemaking through the back door. He has a degree in
English literature and was selling software when he was tapped in
1994 to take over Oakville Ranch Vineyards for his uncle, Oracle
Corp. co-founder Bob Miner. His uncle died from lung cancer that
year, and suddenly he found himself running a winery.
</P>
<P>
   The company philosophy centers on producing small lots from a
single vineyard or an appellation that showcase each area's
micro-climate. His acclaimed 1997 Pinot Noir reflects the foggy,
coastal influence of the Monterey hillside vineyards where the
grapes were grown.
</P>
<P>
   The Miner family owns about 80 acres of vines, growing
Chardonnay, Cabernet and Merlot. They purchase fruit for other
wines including Pinot Noir, Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Sauvignon
Blanc. This year, they made about 8,000 cases under the Miner
family label and 4,000 under the Oakville Ranch label. New
vineyards and contracts with other vineyards should get the
bottlings to a collective 25,000 in four or five years.

 &UR; Joel Aiken, Beaulieu Vineyard &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Gerald Boyd &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA, Calif. _ &LR;  Joel Aiken, director of winemaking at Beaulieu
Vineyards, has made great strides with BV's Pinot Noir, Carneros
Chardonnay and Napa Zinfandel, all the while maintaining the
winery's reputation for Cabernet Sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken grew up near Fresno and earned his undergraduate degree in
biology from the University of California at Davis. In the Central
Valley, grape growing and winemaking are common, so it was no
surprise when Aiken entered the university's graduate program in
enology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Aiken was hired as assistant winemaker at Beaulieu
Vineyard, joining the ranks of legendary BV winemakers such as
Andre Tchelistcheff and Richard Peterson. Three years later, at the
age of 28, he became the youngest winemaker in Beaulieu's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, I was always very creative and enjoyed working on
projects with my mother who was an art professor,'' Aiken says. ``I
guess I decided to pursue winemaking because it seemed to combine
science, which helps to produce sound wines without defects, with
art, which is what allows a winemaker to have a personal touch on
the final product.''
</P>
<P>
   At BV, Aiken says, he aims to create world-class wines that
consumers can enjoy today and that they do not have to learn to
like.''
</P>
<P>
   By reshaping BV with cutting edge technology, Aiken says the
winery's wines are ``very bold and intense in flavor, yet also
round and smooth.''
</P>

 &UR; Andrew Murray, Andrew Murray Vineyards &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Karola Saekel &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SANTA YNEZ VALLEY, Calif. _ &LR;  Andrew Murray, renowned for
Rhone-style wines, is the son of a family that ran Mexican
restaurants in Southern California. Just after he graduated from
high school, the family planted grapes on 15 acres near Santa
Barbara. The land became Murray's passion and his home, except for
a stint in Australia studying the making of Shiraz, Australia's
version of Syrah, and getting a bachelor's degree in viticulture
from University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who lives at the winery with his wife and son, has often
been singled out as probably the youngest important California
winemaker. He'd rather not trade on his age, but be known for his
beloved Rhone wines _ three Syrahs (the Hillside Reserve, Coteaux
and Roasted Slope Vineyard); a Viognier, a Rousanne and a white and
a red blend.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; CAZADERO, Calif. _ &LR;  Gregory  &LR;   &LR; La Follette, who is known for his
elegant Chardonnays, grew up an Air Force brat, schooled in many
countries; it was ``a very international experience _ we never
lived on base.'' He also attended several colleges and universities
in Southern California. With degrees in biology and chemistry, he
worked as an AIDS researcher at University of California, San
Francisco for several years.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since he was a 19-year-old seminarian, winemaking had
been his ultimate goal. Returning to the University of California
at Davis, he earned a master's degree in '91 that led to a special
projects job at Kendall Jackson Winery and, three years ago, to his
position at Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   He calls this the culmination of his wildest dreams _ living in
the middle of a vineyard, raising ``three beautiful children'' and
shepherding fine wine from the vine to the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Michel Salgues, Roederer Estate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Janet Fletcher &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; MENDOCINO, Calif. _ &LR;  Michel Salgues, arguably the best sparkling
wine maker in California, is known for wines of exceptional
elegance, including a Brut and Brut Rose and the single-vintage,
t &LR; e &LR; te de cuvee L'Ermitage. In the tradition of Champagne, Salgues
blends wine from different vintages to achieve complexity in his
Brut and Brut Rose. He now has 55 casks, ranging from two to 10
years old, to work with each year.
</P>
<P>
   Salgues was born and raised in Champagne, although his family
was not in the wine business. He studied agronomy and enology at
the prestigious University of Montpellier, then went to Canada for
military service and more university work. ``I was not serious
then,'' he says, citing blueberry wine as one of his early research
projects. He returned to Montpellier as an assistant professor of
winemaking and stayed there 14 years, interrupted by a sabbatical
year with Dr. Vernon Singleton at U.C. Davis. Anxious to return to
the U.S., he applied for the winemaker job with Roederer's new
American facility in 1985. He has been there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Salgues' inspiration is the house style at Roederer in France,
with its more than 200 years of tradition. ``It's not exactly a
recipe,'' he says. ``I'm translating the spirit of a recipe to
California. I'm trying to make a California product with the
company style.''

   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Janet Fletcher &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SONOMA, Calif _  &LR; Gary Farrell has made his reputation producing
Pinot Noirs from the Russian River Valley in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grapes from this region are not overwhelmingly powerful,''
Farrell says, ``but there's a silky suppleness to them.'' The wines
tend to have a strawberry or raspberry character and a richness
that stops short of intense extraction. Farrell calls them subtle
and elegant. The 10,000-case winery also makes Zinfandel and a
smaller amount of Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell caught the wine bug while a student at Sonoma State
University. He and a friend started a wine tasting group that met
once a week, then twice a week. They began making wine together for
fun and eventually got cellar jobs to help pay for their schooling.
``Basically it was a hobby turned profession,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While working for other wineries before he started his own,
Farrell fell in love with Pinot Noir grapes from the Russian River
Valley, especially those from the Rochioli vineyard. Convinced of
the Rochioli quality, he approached proprietor Joe Rochioli about
producing a vineyard-designated wine under a Gary Farrell label,
and launched the winery in 1982 with 100 cases of Pinot Noir from
the Rochioli vineyard. His relationship with that now-prestigious
vineyard continues today.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Robert Biale, Robert Biale Vineyards &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Janet Fletcher &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA, Calif. _ &LR;  Robert Biale is known for producing
vineyard-designated Zinfandels, which has taken Zinfandel to new
levels. In 1998, the winery made six different vineyard-designated
Zinfandels as well as small quantities of Petite Syrah, Sangiovese
and Barbera. Total production is about 3,300 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Biale's best-known Zinfandel is ``Aldo's Vineyard,'' named for
and farmed by his father. Biale compares the Aldo's Vineyard
bottling to a Burgundy because of its silky, sensuous qualities. It
is aged in Burgundian barrels and is, in his words, ``luscious,
soft and very extracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Biale grew up in Napa, the son and grandson of grape growers.
``Like a lot of kids, I wanted to do something else,'' he recalls.
He studied engineering, then spent three years as a lay missionary
in Papua, New Guinea. He returned to school and completed a degree
in religious studies, but couldn't deny his wine heritage. A
temporary harvest job at Beringer turned into a 10-year post in the
cellar, which he didn't leave until early this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Biale and partners Al Perry and Dave Pramuk launched
the Robert Biale Vineyards brand with his father's grapes; they now
buy grapes from other sources, too. Biale runs the vineyard
operations, Perry makes the wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really motivates me is tradition and history,'' says
Biale, who takes pleasure in knowing he's perpetuating his
grandfather's vineyard. ``I'm just doing what I'm supposed to be
doing with my life.''

 &UR; Mia Klein, Selene Wines &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Miriam Morgan &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; NAPA, Calif. _ &LR;  Mia Klein, regarded by many in the industry as one
of the most innovative wine consultants in the state, guides the
winemaking at several Napa Valley wineries, is the winemaker at
another and still manages to make wine for her own label, Selene.
</P>
<P>
   Variety is the spice of her life. ``I love the stimulation of
working with different people and grapes from different areas,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   At Spotteswoode, Araujo Estate and Viader Vineyards, all in the
Napa Valley, Klein works with the winemakers, helping to decide
such things as when to pick the grapes and how long to ferment the
wines. At Dalla Valle, she acts as winemaker herself.
</P>
<P>
   All the wineries primarily make Cabernet Sauvignon from grapes
that grow on their own estates. ``I like to make a statement about
where the wines come from and have that come through in the wines.
I don't want to make a `style,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For her Selene label, Klein buys Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc
grapes and uses other winery facilities to crush them. Having her
own business is a good complement to her other work, she says.
``It's easier to understand all the details that go into the wine
when your name is on the label.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein began her wine career in 1983 as an assistant winemaker
for Chappellet after graduation from University of California,
Davis. But her first love was food, having worked as a chef in a
small seafood restaurant in Hermosa Beach when she was in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of similarities between winemaking and
cooking,'' she says. ``I like all the flavors and how they're
combined but also when it all comes together and you sit down with
a group of people you want to spend time with.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite compliment,'' she says, ``is when people say
they've had a great meal with the wine.''

 Famine  
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Come Saturday, life for crabber Kurt Hochberg will
become a 12-week crapshoot.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until late February or early March, he'll rise early every day
and check the waters along California's North Coast. If the ocean
isn't boiling with a storm, he and two deck hands will guide the
50-foot New Salmon Queen as far as 20 miles off the San Francisco
shore.
</P>
<P>
   They'll stuff squid and sardines into 100-pound cages with trap
doors, slide them into the ocean and spend a nervous night hoping
Dungeness crab will crawl inside.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, when they pull up the 300 pots, Hochberg will
know if he's a winner. If the pots are full, the crew will throw
back the females and anything smaller than 61/4 inches across. Then
they'll head back to San Francisco's Pier 45, where they'll sell
several thousand pounds of live crab to Morgan Fish. The crabs will
become the centerpiece of the most San Franciscan of meals _
steamed Dungeness, good California white wine and fresh sourdough
bread.
</P>
<P>
   If luck hasn't filled their pots, they'll stay out on the ocean,
threading their way through shipping lanes and drag boats in search
of a section of ocean floor thick with hungry crabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crab fishing is just like anything else. You want your pots to
be wherever the crabs are. But the problem is, no one can tell
where the crabs are until you've got your pots in the water,''
Hochberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Some years, the crabs simply aren't anywhere. For reasons even
the best marine biologist can't figure, crabs will sometimes
migrate to parts of the ocean 1,000 feet deep. Crabbers like
Hochberg can only drop their pots down 500 feet. The crabs might
migrate back to shallower water for a few days or weeks, then
disappear again.
</P>
<P>
   Weather can affect the Bay Area's crab supply more than the
mysterious biological whims of the crabs themselves. A winter of
wet, stormy weather can make crabbing, the world's most dangerous
sort of commercial fishing, a losing proposition. The idea is to
get as many pots in the water as often as possible. But the heavy
pots can make boats unstable in rough weather. A captain must
balance the allure of a lucrative catch against the risk of
capsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with hydraulics and heavy traps,'' say
Hochberg, a 42-year-old Benicia resident who has fished since 1972
and is heading into his fourth crabbing season. ``You have to be
careful with what you're doing and you have to know the limitations
of your crew. I pick and choose the days I go out.''
</P>
<P>
   His is one of some 700 crab boats that will ply California's
waters when the season opens Saturday. If the season _ which closes
June 30 _ is good, crabbers will pull more than 4 million pounds of
crab from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Dungeness crabs were first caught commercially off San Francisco
just before the Gold Rush. The hauls were particularly big in the
1950s, but crashed by 1981-82, when crabbers got just 207,000
pounds. In the ensuing years, the annual catch numbers have
fluctuated widely in a bust-and-boom cycle but have never returned
to the large catches of the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Because the biggest harvests are in the early part of the
season, just after crabs have molted and their shells have
hardened, Hochberg fishes until February or March then shuts his
boat down for a month of overhaul. In the late spring, he runs the
New Salmon Queen as a party boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank doesn't care how I make my money,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   How hard he'll have to work over the summer is determined by the
size of the crab haul and the price crabbers negotiate with
on-shore processors. Those negotiations happen this week, just days
before the opener. A bad round of negotiations can lead to strikes
and keep fresh crab off the market even after the season has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Because fresh crab is one of the traditional joys of the Bay
Area Thanksgiving season, pressure to settle on a fair price is
strong. Retail prices will likely start around $3.50 or $4 a pound
for live crab and build until Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Hochberg looks forward to fresh crab as much as anyone born and
raised in the Bay Area. He likes crab cakes, crab leg cocktail and
a good crab Louie. But with his elbows deep in Dungeness every day,
his passion for crab drops off quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a week or two I start tapering back my consumption,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS ON SELECTING AND COOKING CRAB
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; How to Choose
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Crab fisherman Kurt Hochberg suggests selecting live crabs that
feel heavy for their size. Make sure the fishmonger lets the crab
drain before it is weighed _ crab can retain a fair amount of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The best crabs are dark in color. Light-colored legs mean the
crab has recently molted and won't be as meaty.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch a leg if you can to make sure it feels full of meat and
not flimsy, another sign of a crab that has recently molted.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; How to Steam
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Choose a pan large enough to hold the crabs side by side. Add 1
cup wine, 2 cups water, a bay leaf, black peppercorns and 1 lemon,
which has been cut into wedges. Bring to a boil and add the crabs,
cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, boil live crabs by dropping them into a large pot
of boiling water. Boil 15 minutes for a 11/2-pound crab, 20 minutes
for a 2-pound crab.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Cleaning and Cracking Cooked Crab
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Twist the legs at the joint that connects them to the body. Pull
them off and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the crab on its back. Using the heels of your hand, press
on either side of the shell until it cracks down the back. Pull off
the shell halves.
</P>
<P>
   Pry up the tail flap, pull it back and twist it off. Turn the
crab over and clean out the guts, including the gray spongy
fingerlike lungs (``dead man's fingers''). Pinch the mouth and
mandibles and pull them off. Rinse the body well.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, break the body in half and crack each segment of leg
and claw at the joint using a mallet, the side of a heavy knife or
a nutcracker.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Caviar tastes on a tuna-fish budget? There was
good news at last week's San Francisco Seafood Show at Moscone
Center which introduced many new items to the trade. With any luck,
the best of these will appear at a grocer's or specialty store
soon.
<P>
   Trans-Spain Foods of Florida has several kinds of Mediterranean
caviars, including lobsviar _ a pretty orange lobster roe. Alaska
Seafood offers wild or smoked salmon caviar with great texture and
taste and priced way below Russian caviar (Alaska's start at $15
for 4 ounces).
</P>
<P>
   Oyster aficionados will be intrigued with frozen oysters on the
half shell (about $9 for a doz en) from Hillman of Texas: Defrost,
loosen the muscle and eat raw or bake. Equally fresh-tasting: Goose
Point oyster shooters (one large or two small oysters in a shot
glass with cocktail sauce or salsa, about $5 a four-pack). They
keep 18 days in the refrigerator, six months in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   The convention center was awash with chowders, prepared sauces
(check out the zesty remoulade from Louisiana brand, already
available here), crab cakes, smoked fish (amazing blue marlin from
Garden &AMP; Valley Isle Seafood of Hawaii) and seafood burgers and
sausages. Aquacuisine's salmon franks _ about $3.50 for six _ might
just get a finicky kid to eat fish.
</P>
<P>
   On the more unusual side there were many Japanese seaweed
products, including ready-to-eat salads; kelp in a variety of
products from Newfoundland; juicy pickled salmon by both Vita and
Portlock (the latter including one in a basil/tequila marinade);
canned white bean seafood chile from Gordon's, and Singaporean
cuttlefish balls, recommended by manufacturer Thong Siek for
turning a dish of instant noodles into a meal.

EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old.  BAY AREA CLASSICS: Sutter Home Withstands Over a Century of 
 Change 
 &HT;       
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; ST. HELENA, Calif. _ &LR;  These days, if you can pick up a bottle of
decent California wine for $10, you've got a bargain. But in 1906,
an entire winery _ Sutter Home _ was offered at a Napa sheriff's
sale for just that price.
<P>
   It wasn't called Sutter Home back then. Founded in 1874 by John
Thomann as the John Thomann Winery and Distillery. It was renamed
after San Francisco businessman John Sutter, father of one of the
city's foremost dressmakers, Caroline Leuenberger. She and her
husband, Emil, came up with the princely sum of $10 in gold and
acquired the St. Helena winery.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Thomann was a pioneer in more than one sense. Not only
was he among the first vintners in the Napa Valley _ joining such
well-known men as Jacob Schram, Charles Krug and Jacob Beringer _
but he made his wines only from mountain-grown grapes, a rarity in
those days when the coarser Mission grape was the norm in
California winemaking.
</P>
<P>
   By 1884, Thomann was able to build a Victorian mansion for his
family. But he died unexpectedly in 1900, and his wife and
daughters let the business wither on the vine, literally, and
eventually abandoned the mansion as well.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Leuenbergers, already owners of 80 acres of vineyards
and a winery on Howell Mountain on the other side of the valley,
which they had named Sutter Home. They also operated a thriving
wine business in San Francisco, which the 1906 earthquake and fire
wiped out. In the wake of that disaster, they purchased the Thomann
property and transferred their winemaking operation, name and all,
to that location. Eventually, they made their home there as well,
renaming the mansion Chalet Berensis after their home canton of
Bern, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The winery went on a roller-coaster ride of success and decline
in the early part of this century. Prohibitiondealt it the death
blow, and once again, it fell into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Leuenbergers
were in their 70s and weren't up to reviving the winery. But in
1947, John Trinchero, an Italian immigrant working as a winemaker
in New Jersey, purchased the dilapidated winery. He persuaded his
brother Mario to give up his New York job as a waiter to join him
in the wine business.
</P>
<P>
   When Mario's wife Mary and their children came to their new
dream home in the Golden State shortly after, she cried _ and not
for joy. The abandoned barnlike structure had dirt floors and no
electricity, and sleepy little St. Helena was hardly a metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The first few years were rough, but the Trincheros persisted,
with John making wine, Mary and the children staffing the bottling
line and Mario offering wine for sale, in bulk or bottle, and for
tasting _ a first in the valley _ in the front of the building.
Some of the established winemakers looked down on these ``Italian
peasant'' practices.
</P>
<P>
   They also snickered when Sutter Home started making Zinfandel
from Amador County grapes and in the early '80s, when the winery,
now headed by Mario's son Bob introduced White Zinfandel. The
ridicule gave way to grudging admiration when Sutter Home's sales
skyrocketed, especially the fruity, pink White Zin, which proved to
have tremendous appeal for Americans attuned to soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Trinchero clan _ Bob, his wife Evalyn, brother Roger
and sister, Vera Trinchero Torres _ is a pillar of the American
wine establishment and Napa Valley community.
</P>
<P>
   And in an amusing twist, the family whose fortunes were built on
inexpensive wine, has turned to making premium wines under the M.
Trinchero label.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from patriarch Mario's early days when,
according to a cherished family joke, Sutter Home dispensed 52
kinds of wine _ and it all came from two barrels, one for red, one
for white.

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  BEST WAY: Does Wine Quality Matter in Cooking?  
   
 By Rebecca Markowitz  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When a recipe calls for dry white or red wine,
what do you reach for? Do you grab an open bottle of moderately
expensive wine from the night before or do you crack open a jug of
California Burgundy to flavor your dish? Does it make a difference?
<TEXT>
<P>
   To find out how different wines flavor dishes, we took seven
different wines _ Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay,
California Burgundy, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon _
reduced them to concentrate the flavor and then used them in
traditional beurre blanc and beurre rouge preparations. We then
took our favorites and used them in today's Working Cook Coq au Vin
recipe (which is found elsewhere in this section.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reducing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When the 750-ml bottles of white wines were reduced to 3/4 cup,
each wine's major taste characteristic was magnified. Chenin Blanc
had a strong acidic green apple flavor. Sauvignon Blanc was not
quite as acidic and was also slightly grassy. And oak notes
dominated the Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   When the red wines were reduced, tannins in the Pinot Noir and
Cabernet made the reduction bitter. The Zinfandel retained much of
its original peppery flavors without bitter overtones. The
California Burgundy was the most pleasant, reminding most tasters
of grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beurre Blanc, Rouge &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Next, we used the reductions to make beurre blanc and beurre
rouge, using cream to stabilize the mixtures. Among the whites, the
Sauvignon Blanc was the overwhelming favorite. Neither the Chenin
Blanc nor the Chardonnay reductions made appealing sauces. The
clear winner from the reds was the Pinot Noir. The butter that
finished the sauce erased the bitterness that was so apparent in
the pure reduction while amplifying the fruit to a pleasant level.
The Zinfandel was slightly pungent, but not unpleasant. The
California Burgundy continued to taste like grape juice _ which
wouldn't work well in a finished dish _ but the Cabernet was by far
the worst of the group, still bitter and unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Since we found Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel and Pinot Noir made
our favorite sauces, we tried other brands of the same varietals to
see if there were differences. In all cases, we found that the
higher quality wine (and, yes, the more expensive) made the better
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coq au Vin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Our final step was to prepare today's Working Cook Coq au Vin
recipe in four batches _ with our two favorite Pinot Noirs,
Zinfandel and Sauvignon Blanc from the earlier tests. In this case,
the Zinfandel was the wine to use. The hearty, peppery flavor of
the wine penetrated the chicken better than the two Pinots or the
Sauvignon Blanc and the sauce had a richer, redder color. The fruit
of the Pinots was overwhelmed by the other flavors in the dish, but
of the two, the higher priced wine resulted in a better dish. The
Sauvignon Blanc coq au vin was a lighter dish that would be
wonderful in the summer or for those people who are averse to red
wine.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you make of all of this? Think about the wine and
its use before you add it to your dish. Are you creating a sauce
where the wine is standing alone? If so, use one that is mellow and
rounded such as a good Pinot Noir or Sauvignon Blanc. If you want
strong, robust flavors, use Zinfandel. But no matter what, the
overall quality of the wine does matter.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Wines used in the coq au vin recipe included 1998 Markham &LR; 
 &LR; Vineyards Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($10.99); 1996 Meridian &LR; 
 &LR; Vineyards Santa Barbara County Pinot Noir ($12.99); 1997 Morgan &LR; 
 &LR; Monterey County Pinot Noir ($17.99); and 1998 Seghesio Sonoma &LR; 
 &LR; Zinfandel ($13.95). &LR;

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute
Recipe takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast and
Fresh.  WORKING COOK: A Bit of Wine Adds Dash to Dishes 
 &HT;       
 By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Most of us have emptied the dregs of a bottle of
wine into a long-simmering stew without a second thought _ and
usually with good results.
<P>
   Using wine can be a bit more tricky, however, in quicker-cooking
dishes. But once you master a few techniques, it can be one of the
easiest ways to impart flavor to a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, Minute Steak with Zinfandel-Black
Pepper Sauce, is an example of such a dish. You can use the
technique over and over again _ be it with steaks, chicken breasts,
salmon fillets, pork medallions or shrimp _ just be sure to select
the right wine for your protein.
</P>
<P>
   The main roadblock to a good pan sauce is not allowing the meat
to stick to the pan. This is easy to avoid with minute steaks,
which are true to their name _ they cook in just minutes. The trick
is to heat the pan first, add the oil and heat until barely
smoking, and only then add the steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Once you cook the meat, the pan is primed for wine. In this
case, Zinfandel, with its characteristic peppery notes, makes a
perfect match with crushed black peppercorns, which coat the
steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Like most wines, Zinfandel becomes very acidic when reduced and
needs to be rounded out and mellowed with cream and/or butter. In
this recipe, we've used both. When you reach the right balance, the
wine provides just enough acidity to cut through the richness of
the meat.
</P>
<P>
   The other two recipes use wine in equally prominent but simpler
ways. The 30-Minute Main Dish, Mussels Steamed in Vouvray with
Fennel and Leeks, stars a fruity but crisp white wine from the
Loire Valley. The wine's flavor is imparted to the mussels as they
steam, forming a good partnership with the pleasantly astringent
fennel.
</P>
<P>
   The Now &AMP; Later recipe, Coq au Vin, is a classic example of
using wine as a stewing liquid. Since the dish was originally
created as a means of making use of an old stringy rooster who had
seen better days, strong wine and a long stewing time were
essential.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, you can opt for using young fryer chicken legs
and thighs (breast meat will dry out) or the larger stewing
chickens, which have more flavor but need more time to cook. For a
change of pace, the recipe calls for a white Burgundy instead of
classic red wine. You can substitute a California Chardonnay, but
try to get one with the least amount of oakiness possible.

   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper + pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   10 pounds fryer chicken legs and thighs, or two 5- to 6-pound
stewing chickens, each cut into 10 pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   15 slices bacon, diced
</P>
<P>
   6 cups white Burgundy, or a crisp, not overly oaky California
Chardonnay
</P>
<P>
   3 large onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Dredge
the chicken pieces in the flour mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large deep skillet until almost smoking. Add
the chicken and fry until browned on all sides, turning from time
to time. Transfer to 2 large casseroles or Dutch ovens.
</P>
<P>
   Fry the bacon in a separate skillet until it renders most of its
fat. Remove it from the skillet with a slotted spoon and scatter
over the chicken pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Discard the oil in the chicken-frying skillet, and add about 1/4
cup of the wine to the skillet. Deglaze over medium-high heat. Add
the onions and saute until golden, about 15 minutes. Add to the
chicken. In the same skillet, saute the mushrooms and thyme until
tender, then add to the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Add the bay leaves, the remaining wine and the stock to the pan
and bring to a boil. Pour evenly over the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the casseroles and bake until the chicken is very tender.
For the smaller fryer chickens, cook for at least 1 hour. If using
larger stewing chickens, cook for 1 hour and 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the chicken and vegetables from the liquid, reserving
both. Discard bay leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the liquid to a boil in a large saucepan; stir in the
sugar. Simmer until the liquid reduces and has thickened, about 10
minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour the reduced
sauce over the chicken and vegetables and stir gently to combine.
Reheat gently if necessary.

 &HT;

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Few desserts are as easy and refreshing as
 &LR; granitas &LR; , or Italian ices. The Prosecco Granita from pastry chef
Remi Hayashi of Splendido is particularly easy and delicious.
<P>
   Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine, has just a hint of
sweetness. The dessert is great with thin lemon or buttery
shortbread cookies.
</P>
<P>
   For this ice you don't even need to make a simple syrup as you
do with many granita recipes. Just whisk together the wine, lemon
juice, water, salt and sugar, and pour the mixture into a shallow
pan or dish. That's it. The only other effort required is to whisk
every hour or so until it's set.
</P>
<P>
   Most cooks would recommend that you serve it the same day, but
I've found it can hold several days in the freezer.

 &LR; PROSECCO GRANITA
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups dry Prosecco (Italian sparkling wine)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   2 kiwi fruit, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together the Prosecco, water, sugar, lemon juice and salt
until the sugar dissolves. Pour the mixture into a shallow
container (such as a 1-quart Pyrex baking dish) and place in the
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the mixture every hour to break up the ice crystals and
form a slush. (In a home freezer this can take up to 6 hours,
depending on the depth of liquid in the container.) Repeat this
process until the mixture is frozen and flaky. Whisk again just
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the granita in wine glasses or bowls. Garnish with kiwi.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Call the clothing and outdoor gear company L.L. Bean, don't
identify yourself in any way, place your order, and see what
happens. If you have shopped there before and you're calling from
your home telephone number, the folks there know it _ even if
you've blocked Caller ID. They know where you live. And they have
your credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the transaction, the cheerful sales clerk on
the other end of the line will happily recite that information to
you, letting you dispense with the tedium of digging through your
wallet for a credit card or spelling your street name.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new development. L.L. Bean has had such
caller-identification technology in place for years. But the
company began using it openly with customers only recently, in the
belief that they would no longer be spooked, said L.L. Bean
spokesman Rich Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that L.L. Bean executives think people are
ready to give up their privacy. To the contrary, L.L. Bean believes
that, as always, people are willing to share private information
with those they trust, and it believes that it has its customers'
trust. The company may be right. It reports that customers love the
convenience. In fact, one recent caller was so charmed by the
personal treatment that she thought the saleswoman recognized her
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a trusting relationship with that business,'' said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington. Rotenberg said L.L.
Bean's customers had faith that the company would not abuse the
information by reselling it.
</P>
<P>
   So much for blind faith. Even L.L. Bean recently began
exchanging customers' names and addresses (but not other kinds of
personal information) with other companies, which captures
perfectly the complications and contradictions of a giant policy
issue: What are the acceptable limits to privacy?
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention it gets, privacy is an elusive concept. It
means something different to everyone, and when it comes to
behavior, both as consumers and as citizens, people draw the line
at different points on the privacy spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme are the privacy fundamentalists, who denounce the
potential abuse on the part of direct marketers and their
increasingly sophisticated personal-profiling techniques. Privacy
absolutists abhor supermarket discount cards and are vigilant about
keeping their names off lists of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   One person who vigorously guards his privacy is Jason Catlett,
president of Junkbusters, a Web site that helps people protect
their privacy online. He shops on the Web but from a small number
of sites. He also loves the convenience of buying from catalogs,
but he minimizes the number of companies he purchases from so he
can keep a low profile in marketing databases.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping online and offline, Catlett often renders his
address a little differently so he can track who has sold his name
to others against his instructions. He owns credit cards _ four, to
be exact _ but pays for many things with cash. He steers clear of
supermarket discount cards, which require surrendering not only his
address and telephone number but also, every time the card is used,
details about his shopping patterns. And he never fills out
warranty cards. ``A warranty card is the fast track to junk mail
central,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are people who simply don't
care who knows what about them. They figure that privacy is a thing
of the past anyway, so why fight?
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, however, seem to fall somewhere in between. They
are willing to part with personal information as long as they get
something in return, and as long as they know what is to be done
with the information. They are happy to carry supermarket discount
cards. They are annoyed when they get new computers and must
re-enter all the information needed for one-click ordering at
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   These same people, however, are highly protective of their
medical records and are generally appalled when they learn of
clandestine data collection practices.
</P>
<P>
   The recent news, for instance, that Real Networks had been
tracking the musical tastes of people who use the RealJukebox
software to play CDs on their computers generated indignant
messages all over cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Zuckerman, a freelance producer of corporate events in San
Francisco, is one of those who pick and choose their privacy
issues. Ms. Zuckerman has discount cards from her neighborhood
Safeway and Lucky supermarkets. Both are imprinted with her real
name. Yet when she sends contributions to charities, she includes a
note requesting that her name and address not be distributed. She
occasionally shops over the Internet. And when she called to order
flowers recently from Flowers U.S.A., which she uses frequently,
she was surprised that she was asked for her credit card number.
She assumed the store already had it.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers Ms. Zuckerman that her Social Security number is her
identification for her health insurance, and she has asked her bank
to use a different means of identification. She doesn't mind the
cameras that record license plates at parking garages. Yet she owns
a shredder, and she shreds anything with her name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't imagine people are dumpster-diving in Noe Valley,''
she said, referring to her neighborhood in San Francisco. ``But I'm
originally from New York. Maybe I just brought my paranoia with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of privacy as something entitled to legal protection
was most famously expressed in 1890, when Samuel D. Warren and
Louis D. Brandeis, writing in the Harvard Law Review, defined
privacy as ``the right to be let alone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Warren and Brandeis were more passive, appropriate for
their era, the information age called for a new formulation. In
1967, Alan F. Westin, a privacy expert who is a professor emeritus
of public law and government at Columbia University, gave the
concept a more assertive thrust when he defined privacy in
``Privacy and Freedom'' (Atheneum, 1967) as the right of
individuals to determine for themselves when, how and to what
extent information about them is communicated to others.
</P>
<P>
   Since Westin came up with that description, the gathering of
information about individuals has become far more widespread and
automatic. Such information is continually being recorded, while
computers are busy merging, purging, sorting and selecting
information to produce personal profiles and pieces of direct mail
that are tailored to consumers' habits.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be easily protected private information is now
there for the taking, thanks not to changing attitudes but to
changes in technology. Thousands of computers linked to the Web
track individual patterns of online buying and behavior, which are
translated in turn into highly sophisticated marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Wide Web is direct marketing on steroids,'' Catlett
said. ``With the Web, the process of gathering information on
consumers and messaging them with new offers is vastly accelerated
in speed and reduced to a very low cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates say it's fine to be practical like Ms.
Zuckerman, as long as you really know what is being done with the
information you give away.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The missing piece here is that consumers aren't always being
told the consequences of all the data collection,'' said Robert
Gellman, a privacy consultant in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But people differ in their attitudes toward data collection.
Westin said that for the 25 years or so that he has been conducting
public opinion surveys (occasionally financed by corporations), the
general breakdown of how people draw the line when it comes to
their privacy has remained the same: roughly one-fourth of the
population is vigilant about its privacy, and roughly the same
number of people are indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of those he surveys are what Westin called
privacy pragmatists, people who want to know what benefits are in
it for them if they allow information about themselves to be
collected. These pragmatists also want to know what risks they are
running and what safeguards are in place. If they trust the
organization asking for the information, Westin said, they are more
likely to surrender information.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg, of the privacy information center, is skeptical about
those findings, arguing that people's desire for privacy may change
at different times in their lives, or even in the course of a day.
For that reason, he favors legislation that would give individuals
control over the use of their personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Gellman said supermarket discount cards were a good example of
the kinds of privacy trade-offs many people were willing to make.
Roughly 27,000 food stores in the nation provide cards that offer
discounts or other promotions to customers who sign up; those
customers' personal information can then be linked to records of
what they buy. More than half the customers of those stores have
signed up for the cards, and more are signing up every day,
according to the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supermarket loyalty card is the least intrusive of any
kind of loyalty promotion,'' said Todd Hultquist, an institute
spokesman. ``Stores want a better grasp of what's selling and when,
and when to do certain promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellman isn't so sure. He said that while preferences in canned
tuna may be fairly innocuous, other purchases may be more private.
``If a woman goes to a supermarket on Saturday and buys a pregnancy
test kit, then buys prenatal vitamins the next week, it's a
reasonable inference that she's pregnant,'' he said. ``And what if
she hasn't told anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kang, an acting professor of law at the University of
California at Los Angeles, agreed. ``There is widespread ignorance
or misinformation about how personal data is used in the database
marketing industry and in the information collection process in
cyberspace,'' he said. ``Privacy doesn't mean information
quarantine. It just means individual choice. People need to know up
front what will happen to their personal data before they engage in
these market transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett of Junkbusters said that was called fair information
practice. ``There is no reason for information to be handled in an
unfair and unsafe manner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a group of Internet advertising and
data-profiling companies announced that they would give customers
notice that information was being collected as well as the option
to refuse to have that information used for profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett, Rotenberg and other privacy advocates say that similar
self-regulatory efforts have failed in the past and that the the
Federal Trade Commission should recommend legislation that would
establish a code of fair information practices, which they say
would include an individual's right to get access to personal
information held by others and would require a person's consent
before such information could be disclosed to others. They also
said online profiling should be halted until legislation is
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to see information about you shouldn't be something
given to you out of the goodness of the company's heart,'' Catlett
said. ``You should have a legally guaranteed right to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are people like Larry Engel _ so blase on the subject
that they are lost causes to privacy advocates like Catlett.
</P>
<P>
   Engel, a documentary filmmaker and professor of film at Columbia
University, belongs to the minority of people who are indifferent
about the amount of information known about them. ``I love the idea
of marketers knowing my shopping habits,'' he said. ``And look, if
I'm going to be be spammed on my e-mail, I'd rather be spammed by
people who at least have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Engel loves the convenience of one-click ordering at Amazon.com
and the identification feature at L.L. Bean. He loves it when he
calls the front desk from a hotel room and hears, ``Yes, Mr. Engel,
how can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   And the many ways he can be located? ``I don't care if it's the
government or a marketer or my wife, my brother or my accountant _
I'm happy to be located,'' he said. ``Because, the way I look at
it, I don't care if people know where I am. It's my choice as to
whether I respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance cameras, Engel said, like those at intersections,
are a bit trickier, but he said that over time, people would
probably not care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will a camera on every street corner lead to Big Brother?
No,'' he said, ``it will probably lead to more gossip.''

 Top 10 Wines; Wonder What to Pair With Top 10 Wines?  &HT;       
 By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Just the thought of pairing wine and food can be
intimidating. Most people know the basics _ white wine with white
meat and fish, red wine with red meat _ but beyond that it can be a
mystery.
<P>
   In reality, it's just a matter of deciding whether to complement
or contrast the flavors and textures of the food and wine. Sit down
with the wine, taste it and see what it brings to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the wine's balance of acidity to fruitiness and whether
it's full-bodied or light. Think about cooking techniques that
might enhance those qualities _ light acidic wines do especially
well with raw foods like oysters on the half shell.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the accompanying recipes to match our Top 10 wines,
I chose two different approaches. Some recipes represent what might
be called traditional pairings, while others are more unique.
</P>
<P>
   The Paraiso Springs Syrah, for example, is full-bodied with
notes of licorice and vanilla. I paired it with pot roast with an
equally full-bodied sauce with caramelized onions and tomatoes to
complement the fruity elements of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonterra Syrah has more spicy characteristics, so I took a
less traditional tactic, pairing it with a hearty vegetarian black
bean and sweet potato stew with just enough heat to match the
spiciness of the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Franciscan's Cuvee Sauvage Chardonnay tastes of ripe apples, so
matching it with the mellow flavors of roasted garlic and creamy
white beans seemed natural.
</P>
<P>
   Geyser Peak's Chardonnay is lighter, with ripe lemon notes in
the nose. In this case, I played on the wine's balance by matching
it with poached sea bass with a parsley-lemon-garlic topping.
</P>

SPICED DUCK WITH CURRANT-POMEGRANATE COUSCOUS
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting crispy skin on the duck is keeping the pan
temperature hot enough to melt the fat, but not burn the skin. &QL; 
 &LR; Wine: 1997 Shenandoah Vineyards Amador County Sangiovese. If &LR; 
 &LR; that's not available look for the 1997 Swanson Napa Sangiovese &LR; 
 &LR; ($24) or 1996 Beaulieu Vineyard Sangiovese Signet Collection &LR;

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Duck
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup creme de cassis
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless duck half-breasts
</P>
<P>
   The Couscous
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup currants
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups low-salt chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups couscous
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup pomegranate seeds
</P>
<P>
   Chopped parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; For the duck:  &LR; Combine the cassis, onion, garlic, pepper,
salt, cumin, cinnamon, coriander and nutmeg in a shallow dish large
enough to hold the duck breasts in a single layer. Add the duck;
turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 8 hours, turning
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the couscous:  &LR; Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over
medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5
minutes. Stir in the currants and salt. Add the chicken broth and
bring to a boil. Stir in the couscous. Cover the pan and remove
from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Heat a large ovenproof saute
pan over medium heat. Remove the duck from the marinade. Score
through the skin and fat on each duck breast, being careful not to
cut into the meat. Put the duck skin-side down in the pan. Cook
until the skin is crispy and golden brown, and the fat underneath
has melted, pouring off the fat as necessary, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Turn the duck over. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until
the meat is medium-rare, about 8 minutes. Transfer the duck to a
cutting board.
</P>
<P>
   Fluff the couscous with a fork. Stir in the pomegranate seeds.

<P>
   Place a spoonful of couscous in the center of each serving
plate. Cut the duck crosswise into slices. Fan the slices around
the couscous. Sprinkle with parsley.

 &LR; PAN-ROASTED PORK CHOPS WITH PORCINI SAUCE

 &LR; Zinfandel. &LR;   &LR; Other wines to consider include 1997 Deloach &LR;   &LR; Estate

 CHRON  
 Internet E-Commerce Includes Fine Wine Online, but not
for  Everyone  By Lesli Neilson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  The number of online wine sites is staggering _
and the list keeps growing. The problem is deciphering the pros
from the amateurs, getting a fair price and determining whether
they ship to your neck of the woods.
<P>
   The most user-friendly sites include www.wine.com (formerly
www.virtualvineyard.com), www.webvan.com, www.klwines.com,
www.internetwines.com, and www.deananddeluca.com. These sites have
a wide variety of domestic and international wines; Dean &AMP; Deluca
carries California wines exclusively. Many of the sites also sell
gifts and food.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-minute online price comparison revealed several instances
of the same pricing pattern. Here's one example. A 750-ml bottle of
1996 Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon sold for $27.95 on Wine.com;
$23.86 on Webvan; $26.95 on Dean &AMP; DeLuca, $19.99 at the
brick-and-mortar K &AMP; L Wine Merchants and $19.99 at The Jug Shop,
both in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping wine is a major roadblock for online providers. It is
illegal to ship wine to several states, including Utah, Florida,
Kentucky and New Hampshire to name a few. Some sites handle the
situation with disclaimers and caution buyers to select a shipping
destination before browsing. Others leave the responsibility to the
shopper with statements like, ``The buyer is solely responsible for
determining whether he/she is in violation of their own state's
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedros Margossian, a financial consultant in Berkeley, and a
wine drinker for about 20 years and regular computer user, says
he's apprehensive about buying wine online for many reasons.
Generally, they're overpriced, he feels, and he enjoys going to a
wine store. ``It's more personable and you receive tailored
information; the employee eventually learns what you like and makes
suggestions.'' He thinks online wine sites would be ideal for
someone living outside the Bay Area or California, noting most of
the wine selections are pretty mainstream. ``After reading 20 or so
of the wine descriptions the blurbs start sounding the same.''

 CHRON  
 WINEMAKERS OF THE YEAR: Aussies Make Geyser Peak a Winner   By Gerald Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Daryl Groom and Michael (Mick) Schroeter of Geyser
Peak Winery are The Chronicle's Vintners of the Year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a team, Groom, 41, executive vice president of operations and
winemaking, and Schroeter, 40, vice president and winemaker, have
made Geyser Peak into a gold medal producer. Between January and
June, Geyser Peak wines won more than 30 gold medals in local,
state, national and international competitions, including one
Sweepstakes and eight Best of Class. The 1998 Geyser Peak Sonoma
County Sauvignon Blanc alone won gold medals in seven competitions.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this achievement all the more remarkable is that
Geyser Peak is a large winery that produces wines in several price
categories _ from the value-priced Canyon Road label to Italian and
Rhone-style Venezia wines to super-premium vineyard-designated
varietals. Together and with other members of the winemaking
operation, Groom and Schroeter select top-quality grapes and make
superior wines across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geyser Peak's recognition is more for quality across the range
at a great price, whether it's red or white,'' Groom says, noting
that his two favorite wines are relatively inexpensive _ Geyser
Peak 1998 Sonoma County Sauvignon Blanc ($9) and Geyser Peak 1996
Sonoma County Shiraz ($14).
</P>
<P>
   Geyser Peak wines are ``complex and approachable and taste like
the grapes they are made from,'' Schroeter says. ``This is
especially true for the red wines with their soft, round tannin
structure.'' He picks the 1998 Sonoma County Sauvignon Blanc ($9)
and the 1996 Alexandre Reserve Alexander Valley Meritage Red ($42)
as his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that most wines are drunk within 24 hours of
purchase so we are conscious of producing balanced wines that are
drinkable and enjoyable at an affordable price,'' Groom adds.
</P>
<P>
   Groom and Schroeter, both Australians, first worked together at
the renowned Australian winery Penfolds, where they concentrated on
making Penfolds Grange, Australia's premier red wine. In 1989,
Groom moved to the U.S. and joined Geyser Peak; Schroeter followed
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Adelaide, Groom is a first-generation winemaker who
competed with his high-achieving brothers _ an attorney, an
archaeologist and a movie producer _ by becoming an oenologist.
``It sounded ideal; I just couldn't pronounce it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Schroeter, born and bred in the Barossa
Valley, South Australia's version of Napa, comes from a long line
of vintners _ his father and his uncle were Penfolds winemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Groom sees his strengths as a winemaker ``in realizing that I am
a small piece in the process of making a great wine. The most
important factor is the quality of the grapes you receive, which is
80 percent of the quality of a wine. A large team of people,
including the winemaker, makes up the other 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeter also sees people as the major component of Geyser
Peak's success. ``We have a great team involved in every facet of
the winery. My strength is in organization and attention to detail
in the making of the many different styles and varietals.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeter points to the winery's recent successes with
Chardonnay as overcoming ``our last obstacle.'' But within a few
months, Geyser Peak will release the first of the $100
ultra-premium ``bin'' wines _ 1996 Bin 1 Alexander Valley Cabernet
Sauvignon and 1996 Bin 2 Alexander Valley Shiraz. If the recent
past is any indication, these very special wines should achieve one
of Schroeter's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope,'' he says, ``to elevate the winery to new heights.''

TEXAS COMPANY RUN BY PAIR OF 22-YEAR-OLDS SPINNING A WEB OF GROWTH
ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL W. HORNADAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Texas _ Four years ago, the biggest venue that Chris
Faulkner and Erin Bullock attended together was their senior prom
at Grapevine High School.
</P>
<P>
   They are about to have another coming-out party _ this time in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   While many 22-year-olds sweat job interviews at their college
placement offices, Faulkner and Bullock hold the reins of CI Host,
an Internet services company with 65 workers and a client base that
has almost doubled since July. Of 16,000 Web hosts worldwide, CI
Host is routinely ranked among the top five by three ratings firms.
Its major clients include the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas and United
Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Bedford company recently scored a marketing coup by getting
its name on the back of Evander Holyfield's boxing trunks. Its logo
_ CIHOST.com _ may be seen by hundreds of millions of viewers
Friday during Holyfield's internationally televised world
heavyweight title bout against Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later in the same city, CI Host will be a key sponsor
of Comdex Fall '99, the Super Bowl of high-tech trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a journey for a couple who met in an advanced physics
class at Grapevine High.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was strictly Web page design, something to help
pay bills,'' Faulkner said. ``We had no idea it would become
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after high school they founded what has become CI Host.
The partnership _ both personal and professional _ has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   CI Host, which provides computer space for customers' Web sites
and manages the sites for them, has 38,000 clients in 126
countries. It gained about 5,500 clients last month, or one every
eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up, Faulkner and Bullock have added 25 employees since
July. They have been in their office at Airport Freeway and Central
Drive for six months. Starting with 4,000 square feet in May, they
increased their space to 6,800 square feet in July, and they expect
to occupy about 11,000 square feet by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   They also hired an operations manager with more than 30 years'
experience with a Fortune 500 company. He also is Bullock's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth is one of the big things that can bring a company
down,'' said Lonny Bullock, 56, a former national sales manager
with Federal Mogul. ``Unless you measure it, it can sneak up on you
in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner and Erin Bullock said they learned that lesson the hard
way as they tried to get a college education.
</P>
<P>
   They began to design Web pages in their first year of college at
Southern Methodist University and formed Creative Innovations.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, after transferring to Baylor University, they
used $30,000 in earnings to answer customers' demand to manage
their entire Web presence. They bought an Internet server system
and entered an emerging industry: Web hosting.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began CI Host and several 20-hour workdays as Faulkner and
Bullock performed technical support and billing while learning the
UNIX computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got so busy that Chris would shout instructions from
another side of the room while working on a problem and I would
repeat them over the phone,'' Bullock said. ``After awhile, I had
done it so much that I ended up memorizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hectic pace continued after their transfer to the University
of North Texas in Denton in fall 1997. They set a goal to have
1,000 clients by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up with 3,000,'' Bullock said. ``At that point, it
was too much for two people to handle, so we left school in the
spring of '98.''
</P>
<P>
   As the business grew, they occupied one small office after
another, at times sharing space with a Bedford dentist and with
Faulkner's mother, a Bedford lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   By then, CI Host had gained a reputation, said Jonathan Caputo,
director of Web building for c/net, a San Francisco-based Internet
news service.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years, CI Host has been ranked among the top five
Web hosting companies by c/net, HostIndex and Web Host Directory,
which rate such companies for potential users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Web hosts pour money into hardware but fail miserably at
customer service. But that's something that CI Host excels in,''
Caputo said.
</P>
<P>
   User feedback and reviews of the company's performance give it
high marks in crucial service areas, Caputo said. That counts a lot
with companies that increasingly rely on an Internet presence and
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pour a lot of money down the drain if you choose the
wrong Web host,'' Caputo said. ``You really want quality right out
of the gate because, unless it's a Web site for your dog, you could
be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, word about CI Host had spread mostly through
Internet banner advertisements or by word of mouth among its user
network.
</P>
<P>
   That will change Friday with Holyfield vs. Lewis. CI Host paid
at least $100,000 through an auction on Adauction.com for space on
the rear waistband of Holyfield's trunks.
</P>
<P>
   CI Host also paid a ``six-figure'' sum to be a Gold Sponsor for
Comdex's Internet Services Pavilion, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   Two events days apart in the same city is a one-two punch of
cross-marketing, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an aggressive up-and-comer in the Internet world and
we're in the ring every day,'' he said of the image he hopes to
convey.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with IMG, the marketing company that represents
Holyfield, said they sought a ``dot-com'' sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing has an international language,'' said Alan Zucker,
whose Cleveland-based firm represents athletes such as golfer Tiger
Woods, tennis player Andre Agassi and hockey player Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places as diverse as Argentina, Canada and Africa,
everybody knows what dot-com means. When they see `CIHOST.com' on
that patch, people all over the world will type it in to find out
who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the move is not without risk, said Eric Wright of Joyce
Julius &AMP; Associates, a Michigan-based firm that tracks the value of
television and media exposure for sponsors of NASCAR auto races and
other sports events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trunks sponsorships are not really seen a lot in boxing,'' he
said. ``Just throwing around figures, some of us are guessing that
(CI Host's) exposure is probably worth between $100,000 and
$500,000, depending on how well you can read the logo.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner and Bullock said they were counting on that as they
prepared to leave for Las Vegas. Along with four guests, they will
be ringside Friday rooting for Holyfield, whose nickname is ``The
Real Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare to take their company to a new level, they said
they plan to do the same on a personal note. They hope to be
engaged soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In more ways than one, I guess we can say we are the real
deal,'' Faulkner said.

 The Grape Divide _ Location: Wineries emphasize
appellation,  appellation, appellation.   By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Consumers who thought they had the wine thing down
_ Chardonnay before dinner, Merlot with the lamb _ are about to
find they have more to learn. To be in the know, they may have to
study state maps to find the precise location of Howell Mountain,
the North Coast and the Russian River Valley.
<P>
   These place names and others, known as appellations, are the new
clues to quality, some winemakers say. Concerned about a flood of
inexpensive competitors from the Central Valley and abroad,
vintners are increasingly dwelling on place to remind consumers
that great wines don't come from just anywhere. As wineries succeed
in building prestige for areas such as Carneros and Rutherford,
consumers can expect to see prices for wines from those regions
soar. And, predictably, as appellations rise in value, disputes are
emerging over who's in and who's out.
</P>
<P>
   The approval earlier this year of a San Francisco Bay
appellation, which some vintners derided as a political favor to a
single winery, and recent proposals designed to protect the Napa
Valley name have brought appellation issues to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   This growing emphasis on appellation represents a fundamental
shift in California winemaking philosophy _ a shift that gives less
credit to the winemaker and the grape and more credit to the soil
and the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask us (years ago) in Napa Valley why our wines
were so good, people would say, `I did this. I did that.' It was
all winemaking,'' says Tim Mondavi, who directs the winemaking at
Robert Mondavi Winery. ``The magic was in the cellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Mondavi and other winemakers talk relentlessly about
 &LR; terroir &LR;  _ a French term referring to a vineyard's environment,
from slope and soil to sun, wind and rain. And if their vineyards
aren't already in a prominent appellation, vintners are eager to
define and promote their own to assure consumers that their grapes
are grown in a worthy place.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the number of American Viticultural Areas (the
official term for an appellation) in California has risen from 48
to more than 80, with six pending.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders say the push to promote AVAs reflects the
pressure of the globalization of the wine trade. Today's shoppers
face retail shelves stocked with Merlots from Chile, Argentina and
Italy, often priced below their California counterparts. Adding to
the flood of imported varietal wines, growers in California's
Central Valley have recently pulled out undistinguished grapes and
are planting premium varietals.
</P>
<P>
   Although these high-class grapes rarely perform well in the hot
interior valley, consumers buy wines made from them on the strength
of their varietal name.
</P>
<P>
   Without appellations to establish pecking order, ``it's one
cabbage competing with another,'' says Gerald Asher, a San
Francisco wine writer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences, say Asher and others. Some wine
regions in California confer a distinctive character that
sophisticated tasters can identify and articulate. ``You only have
to taste one of those fat, juicy Chardonnays from Alexander Valley
and one from Carneros, all lean and steely, to see it,'' Asher
says.
</P>
<P>
   The growing recognition of these differences may help explain
why AVAs are assuming more rominence. Like a photo gradually
emerging in a developing tray, the true portrait of California's
vineyards _ which grapes belong where _ has become sharper with
each vintage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when Warren Winiarski's Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
Cabernet Sauvignon beat all the French wines in a Paris tasting,
there was no such thing as a Stags Leap District, now one of Napa
Valley's most prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew there was such a place?'' asks Matt Kramer, an Oregon
wine writer who writes frequently about the preeminence of site.
``We knew there was a winemaker who was really good and a wine we
really liked, but no one could know whether it was particular to
Warren and his site or part of some larger force of nature. Now
there are enough wineries (in the Stags Leap District) and enough
vintages have passed that if you set them up and taste them blind,
as I have, you can say there's a `Stags Leapness' there. And if you
introduce a Rutherford or Oakville Cabernet, the wine will stand
out. You'll say, `Whose kid is this?'''
</P>
<P>
   For appellation advocates, this identifiable character _ Kramer
calls it ``somewhereness'' _ is worth promoting. If consumers come
to know what Carneros Chardonnay or Rutherford Cabernet tastes
like, then those appellations become not just a quality seal, but a
useful shorthand for what's in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Others say consumer education isn't motivating the appellation
movement as much as profits are. As consumers seek out Russian
River Valley Pinot Noirs, wines with that appellation rise in
value. Whether the wine is better or not, wineries know they can
charge more for it than for a bottling with the broader Sonoma
Valley or California designation.
</P>
<P>
   How much more?
</P>
<P>
   Silverado Vineyards, for example, sells its Napa Valley
Chardonnay for $20. A new Carneros-appellation Chardonnay will be
priced near $30, says general manager Jack Stuart. And the story is
similar elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there's at least a 20 to 25 percent (appellation)
premium,'' says Jim Regusci, a Napa Valley grape grower. Cabernet
Sauvignon grapes from the prestigious Rutherford or Stags Leap
District areas can fetch $3,500 a ton, he points out, whereas
grapes with the broader Napa Valley appellation may be worth only
$2,800.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that premium represents hype or real quality, it's
transferring quickly to the marketplace. Regusci says that new
growers in these regions are getting high-priced offers even before
they produce a crop. Nevertheless, vineyards in a great appellation
aren't uniformly great, he warns; poor farming practices, even in a
top area, will compromise the wine.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given their value, appellations frequently
become mired in ego, politics and greed. When a group decides to
make the case for a new appellation, the winery just outside the
proposed boundary always wants in.
</P>
<P>
   Appellation disputes already have generated some bitter fights _
such as in the Stags Leap District, where owners of properties not
included in the original application filed their own application
with boundaries that included them _ and more battles are on the
horizon. The Napa Valley Vintners' Association is asking the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to prohibit geographic brand names
such as Napa Ridge (owned by Beringer Vineyards) and Rutherford
Vintners (owned by Bronco) unless the fruit in the bottle comes
fromregions. In both these cases, it doesn't. Vintners'
Association president Tom Shelton says his group is concerned about
wineries ``trading unfairly on the reputation that we've built over
the last 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most observers say appellations are a positive sign of
the industry's maturation, the system is not without critics. For
one thing, an appellation is, in reality, only a guarantee of
origin, not of quality. According to Richard Mendelson, a Napa
Valley lawyer who has helped many groups prepare AVA applications,
the BATF makes no quality demands of applicants, such as
restricting wineries to maximum yields or specific grapes, as is
done in France. All the agency asks is that the proposed area have
some distinguishing geographical characteristics, that it have a
recognized name such as Anderson Valley, and that the proposed
boundaries correspond to the name.
</P>
<P>
   Given this approach, California appellations may have limited
usefulness to consumers. For an appellation to be meaningful, says
Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards, a pioneer in promoting site over
grape, ``it has to reflect the region.''
</P>
<P>
   When the wineries within the appellation make wine of
identifiable and shared character _ as in Carneros, for example _
the appellation can be a useful shopping guide. But when an
appellation's wines don't exhibit much of Kramer's
``somewhereness'' _ and, observers say, many don't _ consumers are
justified in viewing that AVA as little more than a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do names like South Coast, Central Coast or North Coast really
serve a purpose, let alone something like Coastal?'' asks Draper,
who views these appellations as marketing tools for large wineries
that can't afford fruit in the better districts. The Coastal
appellation, for example, is being sought by Kendall-Jackson and
others to distinguish their wines from those made with
lower-quality Central Valley fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay appellation, in Draper's view, was a
political favor accorded to Wente Vineyards, which sells a lot of
wine overseas. ``Abroad, the words `San Francisco' can instantly
sell a bottle of wine, whereas Livermore Valley (where Wente is
located) could not,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want (AVAs) to have extraordinary value,'' Shelton
concedes. ``We want them to become the basis of differentiation.
How much the consumer will rely on AVAs really depends on how good
a job we do in defining them so they mean something.''

 &HT;    'BUNKER' WILL PROVIDE JOURNALISTS WITH Y2K UPDATES
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At 11:59 p.m. Dec. 31, millions of Americans will
be on the edge of their seats, waiting to see whether the midnight
rollover to the year 2000 will trigger massive computer failures in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   And at that same moment, scores of journalists will be trying _
literally _ to hang onto their seats in what promises to be the
world's most crowded newsroom: the federal Y2K-bug ``information
coordination center,'' two blocks from the White House. Last week,
a small group of reporters was given a quick tour of the largely
vacant office space that soon will be transformed into a high-tech
center for tracking glitches that may occur as computer software
rolls over from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This week, broadcast, print and online journalists will begin
working in earnest with federal officials to prepare the space with
miles of wires and mountains of phones, lights, cameras and the
other equipment. The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion,
using a core staff of about 30 people, plans to create a $40
million, temporary News Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   The center, housed on the upper floors of an old Secret Service
office at 1800 G Street NW, will kick off its 24-hour operations on
Dec. 28. Throughout the first days of the new year, federal
officials and industry leaders will continue to hold nearly
continuous press conferences about global and national events
related to computer failures. In mid-January, operations will scale
back, but the center is expected to remain open to monitor problems
through March 15.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Y2K bug exists because many older software
programs and chips recognize only the last two digits of the year.
That means they could misinterpret 00 as 1900 and cause equipment
malfunctions. The threat of worldwide computer problems has
journalists battling for space in the center, jokingly referred to
as ``the bunker.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the bunker sounds like a great idea for reporters.
Instead of trying to reach federal officials scattered throughout a
traffic-clogged city celebrating the millennium, reporters will be
able to do their one-stop news shopping in the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   The podium will be packed as representatives of the Departments
of Transportation, State, Defense and other agencies provide
updates. The President's Council also has arranged to get reports
from representatives of industries, including electric power,
natural gas, telecommunications, banking, finance, oil,
pharmaceuticals and more.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the room designated for press conferences seems
large enough only to host, perhaps, a game of canasta among four
close friends. Officials insist they will be able to squeeze 60
chairs into it. Trying to also fit 60 journalists into those chairs
would not seem possible unless they are planning to use Vaseline to
wedge us in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reporters on the bunker tour asked all the tough
questions: Will there be champagne? No. Will there be food? Bring
your own. Will there be enough restrooms? Maybe. WIll there be
coffee? Yes, lots.
</P>
<P>
   Hhmm. Tight deadlines, fierce competition, long restroom lines,
no air to breath and institutional coffee on an empty stomach.
Could there be a more romantic way to spend New Year's Eve 1999?

 CHRON  
 A Year of Wine: A celebration of California's leading
winemakers  and top wines _ and the food to go with them.   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If there's one thing we love as much as food in
the Bay Area, it's wine. National surveys show that we drink more
than three times the amount of people do in the rest of the
country. The wine industry is exploding in California, and the
majority of the wine is consumed right here at home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So today the Food section celebrates our California wine
heritage by devoting our entire section to the subject. We start by
picking the top 100 wines of the year, compiled from our regular
tastings and from panelists who help us taste thousands of wines a
year. We also spotlight 10 California vintners to watch, and our
Winemakers of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Since food and wine are so closely linked, you'll find a lot to
cook in this issue, too. In our Best Way column The Chronicle Food
department tests of more than a dozen wine reductions to find out
how a varietal's distinctive character holds up in the cooking
process. And then we prepared the same coq au vin four times, using
a different wine each time. The differences were surprising.
</P>
<P>
   For those who love to entertain, we've also created some stellar
dishes to enhance the top 10 wines. Even the ``Working Cook'' can
learn how to incorporate wine effortlessly into his or her daily
meals.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know where to buy California wine online, in
stores and in restaurants, you'll find it here, too.

 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day that Jerry Seinfeld was announcing his
engagement to Jessica Sklar, a Tommy Hilfiger publicist, her former
husband, Eric Nederlander, was closing on his new Lafayette Street
loft and contemplating his future _ with a decorator.
</P>
<P>
   For Nederlander, whose friends are eager to fix him up with a
woman to help him forget that Ms. Sklar left him for Seinfeld only
three weeks after their honeymoon in 1998, it's design first,
dating later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to feel comfortable in my surroundings,'' said
Nederlander, 34, a Broadway producer whose 3,000-square-foot home
boasts a giant wrap terrace and David Bowie as a neighbor. He wants
a serious television system with surround sound. He wants artwork
that's ``nice,'' but beyond that? So he's talking to William
Sofield, the designer of the SoHo Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hire someone I trust,'' he said wistfully, ``And let
them do whatever they want.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why someone like Todd Romano, a decorator, said:
``I'm seeing younger and younger men decorating. They are not
waiting to get married to do this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Romano has been decorating for more than seven years, homes from
New York to Texas. In that time, as the economy soared and the
pleasures of home design began to be touted in upstart magazines
like Wallpaper, the tastes of the young men requesting his services
became more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Men want to have the best-looking girlfriends, the
best-tailored duds, the shiniest cars,'' he said. ``They may not
say, `I want a Louis XV period room,' but they know they want to
live well.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means out with the futons and college sports trophies, and
in with what Romano called the ``James Bond meets the Rat Pack
lounge look.'' The ultimate arm-candy is not a supermodel; it's a
bachelor pad that is masculine but says, `I have style and taste.'
</P>
<P>
   So what do single men want?
</P>
<P>
   Gadgets like flat screen televisions, big pulsating shower
heads, terraces full of greenery so their dogs will be comfortable.
What they don't want is a girlfriend involved in the designing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let girls buy sheets and towels or pick out furniture,
that's letting them get their tentacles into you,'' said Andrew
Feldman, 43, a sports doctor with a freshly decorated apartment.
</P>
<P>
   So altar-shy men go for the vow-free alternative: a decorator.
All the comforts of home (tasteful, too) without your girlfriend
telling you what to do (or moving in). ``Look, you never know if
the girl will last through the 14-week delivery date on the
couch,'' one bachelor said. ``So why bring her?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Feldman's apartment at the Eldorado was ill equipped and
furnished ``with some of my grandmother's furniture and one
towel,'' he shied from girlfriends' offers to upgrade his
surroundings. That seemed too much involvement. Instead, he
committed to a decorator, though he worried about things like
``boopy'' curtains. He ended with exactly what he wanted _ sofas
long enough to lounge on, a steam shower and a spot for a six-foot
statue he dug up in Tanzania. It's in the entrance hall, warding
off evil spirits. Decorators and designers in New York are reaping
the benefits of the male fear of commitment in an age of haute
decor.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Sicher, a New York psychiatrist, blames the rise in
divorce figures for a growing fear of commitment among her male
patients. ``The majority of today's 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds
are coming out of families where at least one divorce took place,
and there is not as much confidence in home and hearth,'' she said,
adding that while some of her patients marry young or ``prematurely
nest,'' others ``avoid dependence of any kind by seeking to acquire
homes by paying for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other men say they are waiting as long as possible before making
a commitment, to assure themselves that something better won't come
along, said Dr. Robert Welber, a couples therapist in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   A single man will gladly hire a woman as a decorator, however,
as long as her taste is nothing like his mother's. Brad Miller, 36,
the chief operating officer of an entertainment and technology
company, wanted his new 1,700-square-foot loft on Thompson Street
to be comfortable. Friends suggested that he consider Nancy
Pearson, a decorator he met last summer in a Hamptons share house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be the type of guy to hire a decorator,''
Miller said. ``I'm someone who likes to roll around in the mud
playing rugby. Hiring a decorator sounds slightly pretentious and
even a little feminine.'' (He equated it with men who watch polo.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearson asked him, ``What's your taste?'' He looked around
the share house, filled with English country furniture, and said,
``This, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a dream client, she said. At least at first, because he
didn't care. Then, warming to the design possibilities, he insisted
on the emblem of swinging Manhattan bachelorhood, a black leather
sofa, but ``She had the clout to steer me in a different direction
and let me see the light,'' he said. ``It's not like I had a
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she persuaded him to embrace a white chenille sofa.
Still, he did want functional furniture, so she got an old laundry
table for a dining room table, wooden chairs and a bench. It is all
very English country in effect, though Miller usually keeps the
bench stuffed with Rollerblades, instead of cricket bats.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened, Miller went to an antiques fair, bought two French
Art Deco chairs ``and put them in my English country living room,''
Ms. Pearson fumed. ``I was sick over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intrusion, the apartment, which cost Miller more
than $75,000 to finish, is surviving. ``I've done a lot of single
guys' apartments,'' Ms. Pearson said, plainly wary of leaving guys
to their own devices.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after finishing the job, Ms. Pearson stopped by to discover
that Miller had installed an exercise area, complete with a Bowflex
machine with power rods, next to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, nice,'' she said. ``It reminds me of a torture chamber.''

NEW YORK: torture chamber.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Meehan, an Upper East Side decorator, will not even take a
job from a single man. She is certain that behind every seemingly
independent guy is a girlfriend, serious or not. ``See, if there is
a woman involved, she should be involved, because you're going to
be working against her without even knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider one of her recent clients, a 40-something, divorced
doctor who hired Ms. Meehan to decorate a 4,000-square-foot house
in Westchester County. Ms. Meehan, whose average job costs about
$500,000, shopped for comfortable furniture and picked bright
colors for the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Six months into the job, she asked the painter why the colors
she had chosen were not being put on the walls. The painter said
the doctor's girlfriend (that was the first Ms. Meehan heard about
a girlfriend) wanted different colors. A week later, the decorator
was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls, you can't question their taste,'' said Jeff Burroughs,
33, the vice president of BadBoy Entertainment, a company founded
by Sean (Puffy) Combs. ``They take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   So Burroughs hired Shawna Chow to make his 2,000-square-foot
loft on Nassau Street into ``a sexy space.'' A spiritual one, too,
with candles everywhere. (``She took my love for candles to another
level,'' he said.) And a social place, where he could ``have cool
little dinner parties,'' befitting someone who made Manhattan File
magazine's ``100 Most-Wanted Bachelors'' list. Burroughs said he
had very strong feelings about one room in particular. ``The bed
was very important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will change when you get married,'' a woman who was his
house guest last weekend said of the four-poster. ``Look, no woman
wants to sleep where other women have been,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs changed the subject to toys, specifically one he still
didn't have in his arsenal of special effects: the remote control
that Combs has, which will turn down the lights and fire up the CD
player simultaneously. ``I can't have everything that Puffy has,''
he said. ``But I have to get that.''
</P>
<P>
   One young man who has hired a male decorator but asked not to be
identified, spoke of the relationship nuances that can occur in
bringing a date on decorating excursions. Not so much nuances, mind
you, as potential threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want a date you're taking out to see you buy a
$20,000 rug,'' he said. ``They'll think if you spend $20,000 on a
rug you walk all over and will last you five years max, then you'll
easily spend $100,000 on a ring she'll wear the rest of the life.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old-media journalists measure their mettle in scoops and
Pulitzers. New-media reporters and editors have another gauge of
success or failure: hits.
</P>
<P>
   By counting the hits or, more accurately, page views, on their
Web sites, online magazines like Salon, Slate and The Industry
Standard can track not only how many people are reading them but
also for how (italics)long(end italics) people are reading any
given article. In a business that has never quite been able to nail
down the habits of that elusive consumer _ the reader _ no
old-fashioned focus group can match the hard binary data of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And for ink-stained wretches _ now repetitive-stress-injured
wretches _ who are already prone to a certain amount of
professional neurosis, a little knowledge may be a dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was utterly shocking coming from a newspaper with a 700,000
circulation,'' said Joshua Quittner, who had been a technology
columnist at Newsday before starting a Web site called The Netly
News for Time-Warner in 1995. ``Because I had the feeling that when
I wrote a story in the newspaper, 700,000 people read it. Which
was, of course, untrue. On a Web site, not only do (italics)you(end
italics) know how many people are really reading your stuff every
week, so do your editors.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more ``horrific,'' added Quittner, who is now managing
editor of Time Digital, a print supplement to Time magazine, is the
fact that ``it's not uncommon for people to spend something on the
order of 20 seconds on a page.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite the mind-meld of reader and writer that journalists
fantasize about when tapping out their deathless prose. But that
only makes hit statistics more addictive. Like authors who check
their books' Amazon.com rankings on an hourly basis, editors and
writers at Salon receive a daily count _ the equivalent of
overnight ratings in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We devour them avidly,'' said Gary Kamiya, Salon's executive
editor. ``It's become an addiction, actually. One of the things I
look forward to is calling them up and seeing how we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Offman, a correspondent in Salon's New York office, said
of the routine, ``Basically, you get a morning tally and you check
it immediately.'' And as in the world of television, this ratings
tally has equal power to elate and deflate.
</P>
<P>
   Being near the top of the list _ say, 20,000 hits for a Salon
cover article, is a validating high. Appearing at or near the
bottom of the list _ 2,000 to 3,000 hits _ can have the opposite
effect. ``It's like in high school and you've auditioned for the
school play,'' Offman said. ``You look at the cast list and your
eyes just slowly move down.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, what scores big numbers is not lengthy exegeses on
foreign policy. It's sex, incendiary opinion columns and almost
anything about the Internet. Articles concerning Linux software
benefit from what is known as the Slashdot effect.
</P>
<P>
   Slashdot is a Web site favored by Linux enthusiasts that
provides links to Linux mentions all over Web. So if Salon or The
Industry Standard runs an article on Linux, the links automatically
increase hits. Obsessive ``Blair Witch Project'' linkers have the
same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gimein, who covers technology for Salon, knows the pain of
ratings anxiety. ``Sometimes you see a story of yours did really
poorly and then you think, `What went wrong?''' he said. ``You
think, `Gee, why are people reading the slapdash commentary I
pulled together in an hour over this great story that I took 23
weeks to report?'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Salon ran an article studying the behavior of
teen-age girls online. It was an analytical, not particularly sexy
article, but the headline included a reference to oral sex and
readership was correspondingly high. Also this summer, Salon
announced that it was giving a prostitute her own column.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics to increase circulation are hardly new to the newspaper
trade. And magazines routinely base editorial decisions on expected
newsstand sales. But some keepers of journalistic ethics worry that
the instantaneous reader surveys will bend online magazines to the
mercenary will of their business sides and encourage pandering to
sex-obsessed technogeeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a publisher's dream and a journalist's nightmare,''
observed James Poniewozik, formerly Salon's media critic and now
television critic at Time. James Ledbetter, a media critic for The
Village Voice before he became New York bureau chief of The
Industry Standard, said that ``when the investment bankers and
shareholders are breathing down your neck to maximize traffic,''
online magazines inevitably became obsessed with hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put sex in the headline, you're guaranteed twice the
number of hits,'' Ledbetter continued. ``If you put oral sex in the
headline, you're guaranteed the highest possible returns. So what
you have measured is that people will click on the term `oral sex,'
and that's not journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamiya acknowledged that Salon happily gratifies its readers'
taste for lurid headlines and ``libido-tweaking'' material,
``within reason and where appropriate.'' But he said the magazine
did not shy away from far less sexy book reviews, foreign news or
dry political articles. Advertisers are looking for ``lots of
eyeballs,'' he said, but ``advertising doesn't dictate any of our
editorial policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if pressure is put on Salon writers by their editors to
deliver those eyeballs, Kamiya said, ``We've joked about having
page views connected to cubicle sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kinsley, editor of Salon's higher-brow competitor,
Slate, called the ability to count page views ``insidious.'' He
looks at the numbers out of ``malicious curiosity,'' he said, but
does not share them with his staff, because, he added, ``writers
are delicate flowers.'' Nor does he believe that the numbers have
any real value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic that goes to one particular article may or may not
reveal how important that article is to you or your readers,'' he
said. ``The click rate doesn't measure the intensity of somebody's
interest.'' He drew an analogy to his days as editor of Harper's
Magazine: ``We had a crossword puzzle. Only 5 percent of the
readers went to the puzzle, but for that 5 percent it was the
reason they got the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of tricks are used to measure traffic on the Web.
Salon lays out its articles with plenty of ``blank space,'' so the
reader has to click through three or four pages to get to the end.
Each click is measured as a page view.
</P>
<P>
   Slate articles, on the other hand, are designed in a continuous
scroll _ a single page view. The Time Digital Web site also adds up
``unique users,'' Quittner said. A person who goes to the site and
reads 27 articles still counts as only one user.
</P>
<P>
   Quittner recalled fondly the ``golden days'' of Web-based
journalism when he and his young staff at The Netly News, which
became the Time Digital site last year, would lure readers by any
means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One enterprising Netly employee set up a fake Web site
purporting to be the world's biggest collection of links to
pornography sites. Users would click on a link to Tokyo Topless and
get a Netly article on the news of the day instead. ``For a couple
of months the page views went through the roof,'' Quittner
recalled. ``And a lot of those people ended up being some of our
most loyal readers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At what point did the lives of disgruntled teen-agers become so
danged interesting? Whether it's news magazines' endless dissection
of the Columbine massacre, dozens of angst-ridden TV series from
``Dawson's Creek'' to ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' or the
continuous stream of teen fare at the local megaplex, it seems like
cranky high schoolers and their gut-wrenching dilemmas are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   At least the young players in ``Light It Up'' have some
legitimate gripes. They already have several strikes against them _
as students in an under-funded, inner-city school, they have to
contend with issues ranging from police-state security measures and
overcrowding to a lack of heat in the dead of winter. They also
have to fight the societal stigma placed on such kids: that their
futures are preordained as violent and hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   The story is standard, by-the-numbers stuff _ think ``The
Breakfast Club'' with firearms. A group of stereotypes bands
together to fight the system and learn something about themselves
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Things get screwy when a popular teacher (Judd Nelson, speaking
of ``Breakfast Club'') is suspended for taking his class off-campus
in order to find a warmer learning environment. When the students
protest the suspension, their hard-nosed principal calls in the
overzealous new security guard (Forest Whitaker, terrific as
always). A scuffle ensues, and the officer is accidentally shot and
wounded. Tempers flare, threats are made and a hostage situation
develops with the wounded cop held at gunpoint by six desperate
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Breakfast Club,'' the movie crystallizes its characters
for you: there's Clifton Collins Jr. as the wiseacre player, Robert
Ri'chard as the talented graffiti artist from an abusive home,
Rosario Dawson as the studious pretty girl, Fredro Starr (founder
of the hip-hop act Onyx) as the hotheaded gang-banger, Sara Gilbert
as the pregnant loner and Usher Raymond as the leader of the band,
who has his own reasons for distrusting law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   All the young players are fine. Despite the script's melodrama
and predictability, you believe in their struggles and root for
their redemption. The only real casting flaw is Vanessa L. Williams
as the compassionate hostage negotiator. (I suspect executive
producer Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds had a hand in that decision.)
No one in the movie buys her as an authority figure _ and neither
will anyone in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some well-made points, ``Light It Up'' strays way into
schmaltz territory, laying on the preachy elements so thick you'll
feel like you're wading through them toward the film's inevitably
tragic conclusion. But for anyone seeking a little testimony that
things aren't as bad as they seem, ``Light It Up'' could be an
unlikely, uplifting paean of hope.

A MOST UNUSUAL VETERANS'S GROUP _ THEY BROKE THE LAW TO ENLIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like many young men of his generation, Eugene Tabaka
willingly joined the military to fight in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from Germany and Poland who had moved to
McMinnville, Ore., Tabaka quit high school in 1943 and joined the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he broke the law.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, a small but substantial number of
men and women too young to legally enlist in the armed services
have lied about their age to get in. Their military service came
with an additional stress above and beyond the dangers of overseas
deployment and combat: the threat of punishment should they be
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Tabaka was 16 when he obtained a draft card falsely showing him
old enough to sign up (the minimum age was 17 with parental
consent). Shortly after arriving in boot camp, authorities learned
his true age and ordered him to inactive duty until his 17th
birthday. He later served on a seagoing tug, the USS Pinola, that
escorted battle-damaged warships back to port in Hawaii and later
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these aging veterans are quietly celebrating their former
status as illegal volunteers. One of the nation's newest military
alumni groups is the Veterans of Underage Military Service,
organized in 1991 and sporting a roster of 900 members.
</P>
<P>
   Their ranks include former U.S. Sen. and Ambassador to Japan
Mike Mansfield, two current members of Congress (Rep. Bob Stump,
R-Ariz., and Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.), two recipients of the
Medal of Honor, and four veterans who enlisted at the age of 12.
Their highest ranking member was the late Adm. Mike Boorda, who
enlisted in the 1950s at the age of 16 and rose to become the chief
of naval operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tabaka said one of the prime purposes of the veterans group is
to assure underage servicemen that the federal government
``forgave'' their illegal enlistments long ago. Many veterans are
still afraid they could lose veterans benefits or even face legal
punishment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tabaka, a 72-year-old resident of Burien, Wash., said he was
drawn to military service like many members of his generation out
of patriotism and a desire for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Although underage enlistments were clearly illegal and
servicemen who lied on their paperwork were subject to criminal
punishment, the system during World War II and the Korean conflict
frequently failed to catch enlistees, particularly when their
parents abetted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have two (members) from Vietnam and none from
Operation Desert Storm,'' Tabaka said. ``You can't lie anymore _
the Social Security system takes care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, also of Burien, was able to enlist in the military
because he talked his father into lying about his age for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very patriotic,'' Thomas said. ``My brother, Earl, joined
up after Pearl Harbor in 1942 and I wanted to join too.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Thomas was only 15 when he took his
military entrance physical exam. ``My dad stood up for me and said
my birth certificate had burned up in a courthouse fire,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Jess Todd of Federal Way, Wash., readily admits that his
motive for underage enlistment in the post-World War II Army
stemmed as much from economic dire straits as from patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   A gangling 16-year-old from West Virginia who was raised by his
grandparents after his father left and his mother died, Todd
falsely told his draft board in 1947 that he was 18 and wanted to
register. The official ``didn't ask for anything'' and Todd was
able to use the draft card to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thomas, Todd found himself serving in Japan where he was
assigned to a military intelligence unit. Unlike many of his
friends in the Veterans of Underage Military Service, Todd was
caught almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admitted it was a fraudulent enlistment, told them the
correct date of birth and where the records were filed,'' Todd
said.
</P>
<P>
   To his amazement, Todd was allowed to continue to serve. His
superiors took no action and allowed him to finish his three-year
enlistment without punishment or disfavor. He went on to serve a
20-year career, retiring as a warrant officer in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so lucky, said Tabaka, who is the new Washington
state commander of the Veterans of Underage Military Service.
Individual unit commanders had sole discretion as to whether to
punish underage enlistees, and some went after them with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Way resident Joe Champagne enlisted in the Army in 1946
when he was 16. One of six children, he wanted ``to see the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the U.S. occupation force in Japan, Champagne was
standing in troop formation one morning when his commanding officer
said, ``I know a bunch of you guys are underaged. I want all who
are to step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Several did and were arrested, Champagne said. ``Some of them
got put in the brig,'' he said. ``So you kept your mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Joseph, 64, of Auburn, snuck into the Army at the age of 15
after a brief stint as a Monterey, Calif., fish cannery employee.
To get work he and a friend obtained fake draft cards at the age of
14, and were able to fool the Army recruiters when they enlisted.
</P>
<P>
   His military service came to a screeching halt 18 months later
as a result of a records foulup involving his older brother serving
in the Korean War, who was erroneously listed as missing in action.
Joseph said his mother wrote a letter directly to his company
commander in the 82nd Airborne Division demanding that her son be
discharged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get into trouble, but three days later I was out of
the Army,'' Joseph said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   The underage veterans group plans a quiet Veterans Day
celebration, Tabaka said. Members of the state group will help host
a Veterans Day dinner at the Burien Elks Lodge for patients at the
Seattle Veterans Administration Hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Tim Samuelson lives the role of the eminent
architectural historian he is, in a Mies van der Rohe lake-front
apartment embellished with original ornaments by Louis Sullivan and
Frank Lloyd Wright.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! There's more!
</P>
<P>
   He has a Veg-O-Matic in his kitchen. In fact, he has eight
Veg-O-Matics, one of which he actually uses. ``No one likes dicing
onions,'' Samuelson explained, channeling the 1960s commercial as
he chopped. ``With Veg-O-Matic, make mounds of them fast. The only
tears you shed will be tears of joy.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait! There's more!
</P>
<P>
   He has four Chop-O-Matics, three Mince-O-Matics, two
Dial-O-Matics (``Slice a tomato so thin, it only has one side'')
and a Whip-O-Matic (with planetary action), plus a Tidie Drier (for
bras, hose, panties and hair), a Miracle Broom and two Pocket
Fishermen. All were made by the Popeils of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that amazing!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real Chicago story,'' said Samuelson, who will begin a
series of lectures in December on ``The Appeal of Popeil'' at the
Chicago Historical Society, where he is the curator of
architecture. Eventually, there may be an exhibition in all this.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Popeils' household gadgets _ and the commercials that
sold millions of them _ are becoming the stuff of civic lore.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing ironic about Samuelson's appreciation of the
Popeil oeuvre. ``It's everything good design should be,'' he said.
``It does the job. It's attractive. And the form relates to the
manufacturing process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a marketing triumph, since Popeil inventions
typically answered questions no one ever asked, like: How can I fit
a fishing pole in my pocket? Or: How can I make 1,150 shoestring
potatoes in a minute?
</P>
<P>
   The Popeils' empire was born a half century ago along Maxwell
Street, a gritty pushcart market southwest of the Loop, with a
pungent overlay of sideshow, cook-out, carny and revival meeting.
Tabletop gadget demonstrations there were the forerunner of the
infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch is the same,'' Samuelson said. ``The superlatives
are the same. The `turn' is the same.'' The turn is that point when
the price is disclosed _ always late in the spiel and always in a
figure like $3.98 or $9.99 or four easy payments of $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel J. Popeil (pronounced poh-PEEL) moved to Chicago from New
York and went into business with his brother, Raymond, in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Popeil Brothers Inc. sold ordinary kitchen devices
like graters and scrapers. Then, Samuel's imagination fired up. He
produced the Citrex juice extractor, the Toastette sandwich-pie
maker and the Slice-a-Way cutting board, a kind of simplified
mandoline in Lustrex plastic that had no safety device to protect
the user's fingers from being trimmed along with the cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   The apotheosis of early Popeiliana was the Donut Maker, patented
in 1952, a tapering vessel of marbleized plastic with a plunger
that formed dough into uniform rings. With accents of vivid red,
yellow or green, the Donut Maker is undeniably attractive and
surprisingly contemporary, even if it does not merit ``Ode on a
Grecian Urn,'' as Samuelson rhapsodically suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The O-Matic revolution began in 1956 with a chopper employing a
rotating, spring-loaded steel blade. At first, the Popeils sold the
Chop-O-Matic through live demonstrations at five-and-dimes and
department stores. But in 1958, Samuel's son, Ronald M. Popeil,
began selling the gadget on television.
</P>
<P>
   He made a five-minute commercial, reprising for the camera his
singsong tabletop pitch at Woolworth's, chopping so forcefully that
his words were sometimes drowned out as he approached the turn:
``If you order right now, the price is not $5.98, but $3.98. That's
right, $3.98. As a special bonus, you will receive with your
Chop-O-Matic at no additional charge a valuable recipe book: `50
Secret Recipes by World Famous Chefs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands were sold, and television history was made; never mind
Popeil's later confession that ``in all candor, I really don't
remember where all those world-famous chefs came from.''
</P>
<P>
   His own company, Ronco Teleproducts Inc., specialized in
battery-powered devices; a phrase, by the way, that never appeared
in advertising, since it would hurt sales. The term was ``cordless
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   The O-Matic family grew to number the Dial-O-Matic slicer, the
Whip-O-Matic frothy drink mixer and the Mince-O-Matic grinder.
</P>
<P>
   But the Koh-I-Noor of the lot was the Veg-O-Matic of 1963, a
sort of guillotine for vegetables, which are forced through a
circular platform of adjustable steel blades by a cleated,
wing-shaped manual plunger. An inexpert push merely lodges a potato
in the blades or bursts a tomato like a water balloon. When
Samuelson bends his 6-foot-1-inch frame to the task, however, the
Veg-O-Matic purrs like a jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11 million were sold. The gadget earned fresh
notoriety in 1976 when Dan Aykroyd lampooned it on ``Saturday Night
Live'' as the Bass-O-Matic, a blender for pulverizing whole fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Veg-O-Matic's closest rival in celebrity was the Pocket
Fisherman of 1972, a spin-casting outfit designed by Samuel Popeil
and Walter Herbst, his collaborator on several items, that folded
down to pouch size.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the glory faded. Samuel's estranged wife, Eloise, was
convicted in 1974 of attempting to hire two men to murder her
husband. (She served 19 months of her sentence. The couple later
remarried.) Popeil Brothers was sold in 1979 to a Milwaukee
businessman, who liquidated it.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel died in 1984 at age 69. That same year, Ronco
Teleproducts was forced into bankruptcy, although Popeil was able
to buy back the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is the chief executive of Ronco Inventions and Popeil
Inventions of Chatsworth, Calif., and a very familiar face on
infomercials. He is also frankly ambivalent about the recognition
being accorded his family's past by the Chicago Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little embarrassed,'' he said. ``Those gadgets from the
old days, they were somewhat hokey. They did serve a purpose. They
were inexpensive. But they weren't Rolls-Royces that were built to
last. My focus is to get away from the little doohickeys and focus
on more substantial things that are needed in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean his Showtime Rotisserie and BBQ (``the
best-selling kitchen appliance in the United States,'' Popeil
said), the Popeil Pasta and Sausage Maker, the Ronco Electric Food
Dehydrator and GLH Formula No. 9 (``hair in a can''), as well as
his own autobiography, ``The Salesman of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson sees a Chicago sinew running through it all, one worth
documenting and celebrating. His idea of the true civic motto is,
``Success comes to those who hustle wisely'' _ an inscription he
found on an ornamental medallion from the old stockyards.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson was born in Chicago in 1951, attended Roosevelt
University and was a protege of Richard Nickel, a preservationist
who perished 27 years ago as he was salvaging architectural
artifacts at the demolition of Sullivan's Chicago Stock Exchange.
Samuelson worked for the Commission on Chicago Landmarks from 1983
to 1997, was a fellow at the Harvard University Graduate School of
Design and joined the Historical Society two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He began collecting Popeil products from flea markets and
Salvation Army stores six or seven years ago, after being struck by
the intrinsic beauty of the Donut Maker. Despite his evident
affection for the gadgets, he is not beyond alarm at some of the
Popeils' more outrageous notions.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Glass Froster. ``It used to shoot chlorofluorocarbons
into the atmosphere,'' Samuelson said. The package warns that
improper use can be fatal _ a high price to pay for a chilled mug.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Egg Scrambler, a cup with a tiny beater in the
bottom that pierces and scrambles an egg while it is still inside
the shell. ``Great for camping,'' the package suggests. Samuelson
imagined a family vacation: ``We're going to the North Woods. Did
you remember the Egg Scrambler?''
</P>
<P>
   Dubiousness changed to delight as he dug out his copy of the
Ronco Music Library album of Handel's Messiah. ``Can't you just
hear it?'' Samuelson asked. `` `Hallelujah! But wait! There's
more!'''
</P>
<P>
   He even volunteered to cook an entire dinner using Popeil
gadgets, but thought better of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are,'' he allowed, ``only so many things you can slice,
dice and julienne.''

<P>
   The Scout Report, one of the oldest and most highly regarded of
the many groups that monitor the Internet for new and useful
research resources, is facing a loss of financing when its
three-year grant from the National Science Foundation runs out next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the foundation is displeased with the report; it is
``quite pleased,'' says Dr. George Strawn, acting executive officer
of the foundation's directorate of computer and information
sciences and engineering. ``We typically fund a project for two to
three years and, when it concludes, it is not extended,'' Strawn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Operating as a part of the computer science department at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison, The Scout Report, which comes
out weekly on Friday afternoons, highlights about 20 Web sites of
interest to the research and education communities. In addition,
the report also publishes editions twice a month for Science and
Engineering, Social Sciences, Business and Economics, and sites for
schoolchildren in kindergarten through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike search engines, The Scout Report is highly selective in
its choice of Internet resources, checking each for currentness,
reliability and ease of access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are currently 30,000 direct subscribers to the list,''
Susan Calcari, the report's creator and director, wrote in an
e-mail. ``But we know it is forwarded on many times and that some
of the subscriptions are actually `exploder' lists which include
many individuals in various departments or organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject-specific reports have a total of about 45,000
subscribers. And the Web site (http://scout.cs.wisc.edu), which
archives all the reports and features an easy-to-use database of
all the covered Web sites (http://www.signpost.org/ signpost),
records more than 45,000 hits daily.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the science foundation money will result in an
annual shortfall of about $400,000. To make up for the loss, The
Scout Report editors and staff will pursue grants from
non-government sources. They are also considering working with
commercial organizations who may want to be sponsors in return for
recognition in the reports and on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, the report sent a survey to subscribers, asking for
suggestions on new sources of financing. Ms. Calcari said that
there were 3,000 responses ``filled with examples of how the
filtered content of the Scout reports allow users of all ages and
all walks of life to enjoy the best of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Mattie, a library development specialist in the New
York State Department of Education, forwards the report to 45
directors of school library systems. ``We don't have the staff to
spend the hours it takes to analyze Web sites and make
recommendations'' he said. ``This material comes from a
higher-education environment, so it's reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scout Report has also proved helpful for a user with a more
narrowly defined objective. Rita Jo Jordan edits and publishes
Analytical Consumer, a monthly newsletter that evaluates
instruments used by analytical chemistry laboratories. ``I find the
items on the environment, waterways and wetlands extremely
useful,'' Dr. Jordan said. ``With a search engine I have something
specific in mind. The Scout Report tells me about things I wouldn't
have thought to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calcari is concerned that the Report continue to be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of our project,'' she said, ``has always been to
improve resource discovery on the Internet, and to reach as many
educators, students, librarians, and life-long learners as
possible. Attempting to charge for the publications would be
counter to these goals.''

SURPRISINGLY STRONG `AFTERSHOCK' SHAKES OFF MINISERIES FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, rattle my molars! ``Aftershock: Earthquake in New York''
is a winner, a TV miniseries that truly looks as if it were made
for reasons other than to fill four hours of dead air or give
paychecks to actors on hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by incredible visual and special effects but never
overwhelmed by them, ``Aftershock'' tells a story we've seen dozens
of times in disaster flicks big, small and dreadful. But ``Hard
Rain'' director Mikael Salomon, an Academy Award nominee for visual
effects on ``Backdraft'' and cinematography on ``The Abyss,'' knows
how to do this type of movie, and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Aftershock'' realistically depicts the crumbling of
buildings, the derailing of subway trains, the swallowing of large
vehicles and the toppling of the Statue of Liberty, Salomon has not
lost sight of the knot-in-the-stomach, edge-of-the-seat human
dramas inevitably wrought by the earth's hiccuping right underneath
a major _ the major _ metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: The mayor's adult daughter is in a subway tunnel,
his elderly mother trapped in a church basement; the fire chief's
teenage daughter is buried alive at her high school; a family that
moved from Los Angeles to get past the trauma of a tragic car
accident is tormented anew; a young dancer, once happy to be away
from her parents, is now desperate to find them.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea so hackneyed that the immediate question is: Why
bother? After watching it, the easy answer, besides that it's a
ratings-sweep period, is: Because every now and then someone gets
it right.
</P>
<P>
   Not completely right. There are a few lighter-than-cheeseball
performances by supporting players that Salomon should have paid
more attention to. But in tackling a project that's already an
industry cliche, he has managed to set the bar higher and avoid a
parody of the genre. The next disaster miniseries on TV will have
to aim even higher, and it doesn't take Martha Stewart to know that
that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Airing Sunday and Tuesday on CBS, the four-hour film centers on
Mayor Bruce Lincoln and Fire Chief Thomas Ahearn, polar opposites
who don't really know each other but who dislike each other
intensely because of political dictates. Just before the quake
hits, Ahearn (Tom Skerritt) has resigned in protest of funding
decisions made by Lincoln (Charles S. Dutton). After the quake,
they must put aside their differences to help NYC rise from the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The performances might not prompt one to unbridled sending of
fan mail, but Dutton and Skerritt set a credible tone that's
matched across the broad sweep of ``Aftershock,'' notably by Cicely
Tyson as the mayor's mother, Emily; Jennifer Garner as poor little
rich girl Diane Agostini; Frederick Weller as Russian immigrant
Nicholai Karvovsky, Ray J Norwood as a gang member seeking
identity, and Sharon Lawrence as transplanted Californian Dori
Thorell.
</P>
<P>
   For those reluctant to commit to both nights, part two is better
than part one. But as sweeps-month miniseries go, ``Aftershock'' is
a magnitude 6.0 _ and they don't happen that often.
</P>
<P>
   Aftershock: Earthquake in New York. Four-hour miniseries about a
major earthquake that leaves New York City in ruins. Starring Tom
Skerritt, Charles S. Dutton, Sharon Lawrence, Cicely Tyson, Lisa
Nicole Carson, Ray J Norwood and Jennifer Garner. Sunday and
Tuesday on CBS. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

CHOREOGRAPHER BRINGS AN EVEN CURIOUSER `ALISS' TO BASS STAGE IN
FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTh, Texas _ Trey McIntyre took his first step toward his
future career by cutting class.
</P>
<P>
   He sneaked out of dance class and took to the parking lot,
showing off some moves he had invented. The teacher looked out the
window and spotted him. But instead of getting in trouble for
missing class, young McIntyre was encouraged by the teacher to
pursue choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the day McIntyre turns 30, Fort Worth Dallas Ballet will
present the premiere of his newest ballet, ``Aliss in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not a misprint. Inspired by Lewis Carroll's 1865
fantasy, ``Alice in Wonderland,'' the ballet ``Aliss'' uses the
well-known principal characters from Carroll's work _ Alice/Aliss,
the White Rabbit, the Duchess, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter and
the Caterpillar _ as a departure point for a tale about a girl who
falls into the alternate reality of television and celebrity
culture. And it's far enough removed from the source of inspiration
that it warranted a slight change of title, from ``Alice'' to
``Aliss.''
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with McIntyre recently at the Fort Worth Dallas
Ballet studios. At 6 feet 6 inches and 230 pounds _ 45 pounds
heavier than when he was an active dancer, but still reasonably
trim _ McIntyre pushes past even the extremely casual standards of
attire at a working dance studio; he appears for the interview in
white T-shirt, shorts and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   And his approach to the classic tale is as unconventional as his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice in Wonderland,'' McIntyre explained, occurred to him as
a source of inspiration several years ago, when he created dance
sequences for a dramatized version for a friend who was directing a
children's theater in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something different from a traditional
version,'' McIntyre says. ``It's been done so many times, and done
well. But they didn't take my advice.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Alice/Aliss'' kept simmering in the back of his mind for
years. When Nashville Ballet proposed that he create a work, the
idea had already grown too big for Nashville Ballet to produce on
its own but not too big for a consortium of ballet companies,
including Nashville Ballet, Fort Worth Dallas Ballet and Oregon
Ballet Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Dallas Ballet artistic director Benjamin Houk met
McIntyre almost 10 years ago, when McIntyre and Houk choreographed
works for the Pacific Northwest Ballet, where Houk was a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always makes a strong impression in his choreography,''
Houk says of McIntyre. ``And he has a great sense of imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of McIntyre's inspiration, the stage at Bass
Performance Hall will be dominated this weekend by a 10-foot-tall
TV screen and characters dressed as zanied-up versions of Carroll's
already zany characters. Neil DuPont, conductor of the Oregon
Ballet, has assembled a mix of live music _ much of it from Bizet's
``Carmen'' _ quilted together to meet the demands of McIntyre's
inspiration. Although McIntyre agrees with the principle that
ballet should have live music, in this case, he says, he felt the
need for recorded segments for the sake of flow and to match some
of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas include drastically different dance styles, ranging
from classical ballet to Broadway to modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not difficult staminawise,'' McIntyre says. ``But it's
difficult in short sections. The dancers have to be brave.''
</P>
<P>
   And, McIntyre says, he has been impressed by the dancers in the
Fort Worth Dallas Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been more than brave,'' he says. ``I didn't know the
Fort Worth Dallas Ballet before, but I've been thrilled by the
dancers here.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, who says he was an awkward, chubby kid, began dance
class at his mother's urging because of his interest in musical
theater. He entered the North Carolina School of the Arts at 15 as
a ballet major and sought out opportunities to choreograph; he
entered a choreographer's workshop at Houston Ballet in 1987 and
ended up staying with the company for nine years after artistic
director Ben Stevenson created the position of ``choreographic
apprentice'' for him. Although he was officially a dancer with the
company for six years, McIntyre's goal _ and Stevenson's goal for
him _ was to become a choreographer. He admits he wasn't good
enough to be a principal and was too tall to fit in the corps. He
did, however, dance a few character roles, including Don Quixote
and the Queen of Hearts in Stevenson's version of ``Alice in
Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston Ballet was my `college,' '' McIntyre says, recalling
the opportunity to work with Stevenson, and with Kenneth MacMillan
and Margot Fonteyn. Blessed by The New York Times dance critic Anna
Kisselgoff as ``a new face to watch,'' McIntyre emerged from his
decade at Houston as a nationally renowned choreographer while
still in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 1 1/2 years as resident choreographer for Oregon
Ballet Theatre in Portland _ conveniently close to a shoe store
that carries size 15, he says, half joking _ McIntyre is involved
in ongoing projects with major companies such as the Bolshoi Ballet
and Stuttgart Ballet. A full-length ``Peter Pan'' is in progress;
having already set composers ranging from John Adams to Elvis
Presley, he's working on settings of Britten's Piano Concerto and
Walton's Cello Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   And, even before the premiere, he is looking ahead to an
expanded version of ``Aliss,'' drawing on Carroll's sequel,
``Through the Looking Glass,'' to turn the one-act ``Aliss'' into
an evening-length ballet. Certainly the response of Fort Worth
audiences this weekend will have a major effect on later versions
of the piece.

MEN GETTING IN TOUCH WITH FURNITURE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you accept the rule of thumb that anything three
inches above the floor constitutes furniture, then Charlie
Himmelberg, who is single and lives in a four-room apartment on the
Upper West Side, owns six pieces: a futon, a bookshelf, a
television stand with a television, a coffee table, a folding
canvas patio chair and a pressed-wood kitchen table that a
girlfriend gave him.
</P>

   ``Does my electric keyboard count?'' asked Himmelberg, 36, a
professor of finance and economics at Columbia University. The
keyboard has the dining room to itself. His mother sent him the
patio chair after she visited the apartment, where he has lived for
five years, because there was no place to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Himmelberg is letting nature run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still single,'' he said. ``I could spend a ton of money,
then get married to someone who doesn't like the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Kevin Smith got married, had a baby and bought a
six-bedroom house in New Jersey, the 29-year-old filmmaker, whose
1994 ``Clerks'' chronicled the adulthood dilemmas of two single
young men and whose new film, ``Dogma,'' opens Friday, lived a
similar life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television was the most important piece of furniture in
the house,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications that men, notoriously resistant to the
idea of buying furniture for themselves, are losing their fear of
furnishing. And no, they're not buying it with beer-cap coupons.
</P>
<P>
   New furniture shopping formats like the Internet,
both-gender-friendly retail stores like Pottery Barn and
Restoration Hardware and a changing social attitude are helping men
get in touch with their furnishing side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The received wisdom has always been that women are the major
purchasers,'' said Lee Brown, an analyst with Rosenthal &AMP; George, a
market research company in Atlanta. Industry sources frequently put
the figure as high as 95 percent. ``We have discovered that this
may be a thought that's 10 years old,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a September report, the company found that men have become an
almost equal buying force. Single men accounted for 19 percent of
the purchases, single women 28 percent and couples making joint
purchases, 53 percent. ``Though 81 percent of the furniture
purchases involved women,'' Ms. Brown said, ``72 percent involved
men. It's now almost neck and neck.'' She explained that the men
making the greatest impact were 25 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have opinions about style, they're marrying later and
they're often at a higher discretionary income level at a younger
age,'' Ms. Brown said. ``So they have to feather the nest
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, with a population of 97 million and a projected
$92 million in furniture and housewares sales this year, may be the
big icebreaker between men and furnishing. Edmund Wise, a design
consultant available by an ``800'' number for Furniture.com, the
Internet's most heavily visited furniture site, said of men who
call, ``They talk about how embarrassed they are about the way they
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of Furniture.com's 722,000 visitors in September
were men; half of Wise's callers were also men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Single men used to be the rarest category in furniture
retail,'' he said, speaking of seven years' experience as a
furniture-store salesman. ``On the Internet, they're typical.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the convenience of shopping online, ``men are saying,
`Help me,''' Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked in a high-traffic store,'' he continued. ``Two
thousand people came through in a month. I never had one guy talk
to me about color in seven years. Now, on the phone, they all want
to talk about color.'' Wise said he thought it was refreshing.
``It's like people who start painting in their 50s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hansen, design service manager for Living.com, another large
furniture site, said that half of its sales were to men. ``They're
going for the higher tickets, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a September report published by
NetSmartAmerica.com, which analyzes the e-commerce market, men
represent 49 percent of the visitors to furniture sites. Eleven
percent are single.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are playing to the figure, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``George, tell us about your first time,'' says the voice-over
in a Furniture.com television advertisement. George, a single male,
is also a cat. ``I'll never forget it,'' he replies. ``So
inexpensive. So easy.'' Sounds like ``a good date,'' the voice
says, with male appreciation. No, George answers, he was shopping
for furniture.
</P>
<P>
   In Restoration Hardware's holiday catalog, the Morgan leather
sofa sits with a glass of beer balanced on an open book, a Dagwood
sandwich on the ottoman and a wall of sports trophies behind.
Deconstructing the sales pitch wouldn't require Roland Barthes.
Furniture now accounts for 30 percent of the baby-boomer hardware
store's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Journal is introducing a monthly furnishings page to help
men find their ``inner guy'' at home. The September issue, which
was devoted to design, was its best-selling newstand issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design is a tool for them, like suits,'' said Terry McDonnell,
the editor. ``They now think where they live has to measure up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Tarrant, 32, an editor at Fortune Small Business magazine,
bought his first apartment last year on West 57th Street in
Manhattan. In a month, Tarrant purchased a club chair and sofa at
ABC Carpet and Home, a torchere floor lamp at Caldor and simple
cotton drapes at Urban Outfitters. ``Big warning for single men:
window treatments,'' he said. ``What the hell is a window
treatment?''
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant said he enjoyed the process: ``For 10 years, I took
whatever people gave me. I'm not going to put anything in this
apartment I don't want.'' That includes a framed picture of dogs
playing poker. ``Can't get rid of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday at Crate and Barrel in New York, the furniture floor
was crowded with young couples with babies strapped to their
chests. The people shopping by themselves were an equal mix of men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 40 percent of my customers are single men,'' said Robert
Hedstrom, a salesman, who has noted an increase during five years
at the store. ``You get a lot who are a clean slate. They've got
the style in mind. They start with the sofa and buy up around it,
from the store display: end tables, chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they kick the tires?
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction question doesn't come up,'' Hedstrom said.

NEW YORK: Hedstrom said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Pottery Barn, single men are a benchmark for product
introductions, said Celia Tejada, vice president of product design
and development. ``If it works with this guy, it will work with
couples and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Hedstrom and Ms. Tejada said that price was not a priority
for single men buying furniture. But sticker shock is very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blown away at couches that cost $2,000, $3,000,'' said
Tarrant, who picked a sofa he liked at ABC Carpet and Home in the
sale-item room. He also bought his club chair without its $700
ottoman; he found one at an antique store upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Are men furnishing to impress women? In part, yes. But the
motivations may be changing, from seduction to security.
</P>
<P>
   ``My men friends are pretty impressed,'' Tarrant said. ``They
see the stuff I've bought, and that it's nice, and it's like,
`Wow.' It's a grown-up apartment. Women are more impressed. They
find out I did it myself, and they like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kimmel, a professor of sociology at the State University
of New York at Stony Brook and the author of ``The Gendered
Society'' (Oxford University Press) to be published in March, said
that changing mores were changing how men live at home. Learning to
have a life of their own, at home, which could include comforts
like furniture, is, if not a rite of manhood at least a passage
into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decorating your home, and nicely, is a positive image, that
you're capable of taking care of a home,'' Kimmel said. ``A woman
walks in, and sees: `Oh, I don't have to feed him. I'm going to
have room for myself as well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, what's taking so long? Why is the furnishing reflex frozen
in many single men, like an attack of stage fright?
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be the guy they knew and loved in college,'' said
Stephen Gordon, the chief executive of Restoration Hardware. ``They
slowly become guys they don't know, and don't recognize. Furnishing
reinforces it _ `Who am I in the furniture realm?'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the filmmaker, has survived the transition from
condominium male to suburban husband. His Batman cel art collection
is intact. The television is 40 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   Much else is as new as tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition is piece by piece, room by room,'' Smith said.
``Wallpaper takes over. It starts in a small bathroom downstairs.
Then it creeps into every bathroom in the house. Certain rooms get
surrendered _ the bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he suffered no resentment toward his wife, Jennifer
Schwalbach-Smith. ``I find it quite comforting that she thinks
about stuff like that,'' he said. When single, Smith based his
aethestic choices on where he had a department store credit card.
``No style whatsoever,'' he explained. ``That's the thing you learn
quickly when you get a wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no style whatsoever.''

AT 105, WWI VET PROUD OF MEDAL FROM FRENCH GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISSAQUAH, Wash. _ In pulp fiction, soldiers in the trenches
socked away a bottle of cognac that would go to the last man left
alive long after World War I ended.
</P>
<P>
   Pet Crump ought to be a front-runner in anyone's last-man
contest. But Crump, a clean-liver for all 105 of his years, has
never drank intoxicating spirits. Buttermilk, not French brandy, is
more his style.
</P>
<P>
   French medals, however, are a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful,'' Crump said with a warm smile when asked about the
red-ribboned Legion of Honor that hangs from his lapel.
``Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the French government tracked Crump down to the
Issaquah Care Center. France's counsul general from San Francisco
pinned the medal on him in a ceremony that included local
dignitaries and veterans of other wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can get one someday, too,'' Crump joked with a
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never expected the honor. There's little wonder in
that since he left France for the last time in March 1919, and the
Army a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Then he just kept heading west, working his way across North
America until the continent ended. He got a job, found a wife, and
raised a daughter in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If he talked about the Great War in those years, his daughter,
Margie Celaya, said she doesn't remember the stories. If he told
them, she said, she wasn't paying much attention.
</P>
<P>
   The French government did not forget.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac announced last year that his
government would award the Legion of Honor, France's highest
decoration, to all surviving World War I vets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 remain alive from the 4.7 million who served,
according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A year ago,
4,800 still survived.
</P>
<P>
   The French have found and honored 510. Thursday, those veterans
mark the 81st anniversary of the end of their war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in France, as you do, I am sure in the United States,
that it is our sacred duty to remember all those who fought to
preserve or restore our freedom and defend our values,'' said Andre
Parant, France's consul general in San Francisco, when he presented
the medal to Crump. ``We felt that it was important not to let the
memory of an entire generation vanish with the last survivors of
this period.''
</P>
<P>
   Crump's story is typical of how millions of Americans
transformed themselves from ordinary citizens to soldiers in two
world wars.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on a North Carolina farm, where they raised cotton,
tobacco and children. He was one of 21 children. His mother named
him ``Pet,'' Celaya said, because she liked the name. For decades,
people have figured the name is missing an ``e'' and called him
``Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently looked at a photo of himself in his Army uniform and
joked, ``That's Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm and pitching for an amateur baseball team were life for
Pet Crump. He had never been out of North Carolina until 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Congress declared war on Germany in April that year. Three
months later, when he was 23, Crump signed up in Wadesboro, N.C.
The years have dimmed the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been an adventure for the farm lad. There was the
trip to New York and the seasick days spent crossing the Atlantic.
He arrived in France in May 1918 as part of the American
Expeditionary Forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Army put his farm skills to work. He drove a wagon pulled by
``two nice little horses,'' Crump recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He worked at night, taking food to the doughboys in the
trenches. He used the cover of darkness to hide from German
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   His plan succeeded until the sun rose before he made it safely
back from the trenches. He spent a nervous day in the woods,
waiting for night. It all worked until one day he was still out
after the sun rose. He spent a nervous day hiding in the woods,
waiting for night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had found us, they would have shot us. They shot if
they saw you,'' Crump said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses didn't like it and neither did I. There was nothing
to eat and nothing to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 months in France, he served in sectors and battles
that are the stuff of history books: St. Mihiel, Meuse Argonne,
Woevre.
</P>
<P>
   The Army discharged him in April 1919. A captain declared him to
be of excellent character and noted that he had received his bonus
of $53.55, according to Crump's handwritten discharge papers.
</P>
<P>
   But $53.55 wasn't enough to support a 25-year-old man in
Carolina farm country suffering from a drought. He moved west,
working a time in Arizona, then in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He loaded boxcars, then was promoted to dispatcher for Railway
Express Agency, the United Parcel Service of its day. He met a
waitress named Mabel and successfully courted her.
</P>
<P>
   They spent 66 years together, raising their daughter. She died
in July at age 92.
</P>
<P>
   Family and work dominated Crump's life. So did a one-acre garden
in Los Angeles that he kept lush with fruits and vegetables, Celaya
said.
</P>
<P>
   He remained active into old age, helping with the chores at his
daughter's house at age 100. A fall, however, left him with a
broken leg and confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he remains in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Living long and well, he has been known to say, depends on three
ingredients: buttermilk, cornbread and a good marriage.

SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE OF STATES' RIGHTS VS. PERSONAL PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case pitting states' rights against personal
privacy, the Supreme Court on Wednesday weighed whether Congress
exceeded its power when it barred states from selling the personal
information that appears on drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, arguing for the federal law,
told the high court that ``selling my driver's license record is
... the equivalent in terms of personal safety to being required to
walk around all day with a sign with my address, age, name, medical
record and driving record on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina Attorney General Charles Condon insisted that
the case was not about privacy but the right of states to govern
themselves. ``We're simply saying let South Carolina be run by
South Carolinians,'' Condon said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law in 1994 after hearing testimony about
several gruesome murders _ including the 1989 death of actress
Rebecca Schaeffer, who was killed at her California home by a
stalker who had obtained her address from driver's license records.
</P>
<P>
   The law, known as Driver's Privacy Protection Act, barred the
routine release of motor-vehicle records to make it as hard as
possible for stalkers, criminals, telemarketers, and news reporters
to obtain personal information given to state officials on
applications to drive or register a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 South Carolina, which was considering selling
drivers' license information to businesses that wanted it for
commercial use, challenged the law, saying Congress had no right to
regulate state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, ruling
that the law was unconstitutional. The appeals court said the law
had offended ``our system of dual sovereignty'' by telling the
states what they could and could not do with their drivers'
records.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Supreme Court must decide whether principles of
federalism embedded in the Constitution bar Congress from passing
such a law.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the justices will examine whether the act is a
permissible exercise of federal authority under Congress's power to
regulate interstate commerce or whether it is an unconstitutional
intrusion into an area of regulation that the nation's founders
sought to reserve to the states under the 10th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   That amendment says, ``The powers not delegated to the United
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are
reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is one of at least four federal-vs.-state cases to
be argued this session before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court has tended to
favor the states. Beginning in 1992, when the justices said
Congress had no constitutional power to make states accept nuclear
waste, they have also rejected the idea that Congress can give the
federal government authority over states on issues such as gun-free
school zones and gambling on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's arguments, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
appeared unconvinced that Congress had the right to regulate how
states manage their drivers' records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find any cases that back up your argument,'' he told
Waxman. ``The assumption for 150 years is that Congress can't
regulate the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia added that ``state records and what a
state does with its records are very much its own business.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Scalia later questioned Condon's contention that the
law unconstitutionally ``pressed into federal service'' state
employees to enforce a federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they're telling you is don't give out information,''
Scalia said. ``What's the big burden?''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer suggested to Condon that ruling in his
favor could force the high court to ``throw out'' all federal
commerce laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commerce laws constantly say to states, `You can't do this'
and `You can't do that' in just the same way this case does,''
Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   David H. Souter also questioned whether Condon's argument would
mean the federal minimum wage law could not be enforced against the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Condon argued that this case was different from other federal
regulations because it involved an ``integral state function,''
which he said should not be under the control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Many states, earning millions of dollars each year, routinely
sold drivers' license information to businesses and political
candidates before the federal law took effect in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Clinton signed a new law intended to
buttress Congress' authority to keep states from making motor
vehicle records public. The law bars states and their employees
from releasing personal information from motor vehicle records,
although some exceptions are allowed for disclosure to law
enforcement officials, courts and sometimes to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is not tied to Congress' power over commerce.
Instead, it is based on Congress' broader authority over spending.
It would withhold federal transportation funds from states that
violate its terms in disclosing motor-vehicle information.
</P>
<P>
   After the president signed the new law, the Justice Department
suggested that the Supreme Court might want to set aside the
appeals court's ruling in the South Carolina case and order
reconsideration in light of the new law.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's lawyers predicted in court papers that the new
law also would not withstand constitutional scrutiny, but they
agreed that the justices should consider returning the case to the
lower courts.

 &HT;    Teacher keeps memory of Vietman alive
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ann Rogers looks into the faces of the 17-year-old
boys in her history class and sees mirror images of the
fuzzy-cheeked young men she taught who died in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even talk about it now without getting choked up,''
says Rogers, 58, who taught high school during the bloodiest years
of the Vietnam War. ``I had a lot of students who were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of her kids at metro Atlanta's Walton High School know
little about the only war America has lost. Even though many of
their dads served there.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, Rogers and other teachers around the country
will have an easy-to-use new tool to help youngsters learn about a
time many Americans have tried to forget.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, the organization that built
the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, is launching a
paper-and-Web site program and urging educators to use it in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than $2 million, the VVMF has sent out
curriculum packets to 26,000 high schools around the country. It
contains a maps, a time line, video tapes and lessons with
suggested questions. And it explains in detail how America got into
the war, and how the conflict evolved into the worst internal
crisis since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But the cornerstone of the program is the Web site, at
www.teachvietnam.org, formally titled ``Echoes From the Wall:
History, Learning and Leadership Through the Lens of Vietnam War
Era.''
</P>
<P>
   Browsers can watch ex-CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite discuss the
war, and search a database of government and military documents and
an expanding archive of photographs, video and audio clips, and
newspaper articles about the period 1954-1975.
</P>
<P>
   The educational aid is being launched exactly a year after the
VVMF set up The Virtual Vietnam Wall. That site,
www.thevirtualwall.org/, contains information on all 58,219 men and
women whose names are on the famous wall in Washington. It also
holds tens of thousands of touching remembrances posted by
relatives and friends. The Virtual Wall has received 22 million
hits so far. Jan Scruggs, the 49-year-old Vietnam vet who founded
the VVMF, says the ``Echoes'' initiative is the most ambitious
undertaking for the group since it raised funds to build the wall,
which opened in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs expects many men and women who served, or lost loved
ones, to post essays on the ``Echoes'' site. Such postings could
add material on the war that would be useful to historians as well
as students.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no one knows very much about the role of Army scout
dogs. Scruggs encourages any ex-dog handler to send up a 1,200 word
essay explaining what the animals did. ``That's the kind of thing
that would bring this site alive,'' Scruggs says. ``We want things
of emotional and educational value.''
</P>
<P>
   Sha-Chelle Devlin-Manning, an executive with telecommunications
company WinStar Communications, which supported the VVMF on both
Web projects, says the ``Echoes'' site would also be a good place
for loved ones of soldiers to post essays about what it was like on
the home front. ``It's a great way for students to get the
emotional impact they might not find in a book or lecture,'' she
says. ``We're putting up personal essays to give it all a personal,
more emotional touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel L. Turner, 46, of Conyers, Ga., plans to post some
thoughts. He was living in Decatur, Ga., when his brother Michael,
a young Marine, was killed just a week after arriving in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell about the other guys from DeKalb County, Ga., who
were killed in action,'' says Turner. ``It'd be a way to make the
war very personal, very poignant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site already contains a song written and sung by Don
England, 64, of Athens, Ga., to honor his brother Mike, who was
killed in a firefight March 3, 1969, a few weeks after he arrived.
The song can be played by clicking on ``resources,'' then ``echoes
gallery'' from the home page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope others will get some inspiration from listening to
it,'' says England. ``Maybe it'll touch some people, because what
happened to our family did to lots of others. I wrote just what I
was thinking right after we got the news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Echoes'' organizers hope their curriculum will fill a void. A
new survey, released Thursday by International Communiations
Research, found that only a third of American teens are taught
about the Vietnam War in school. Most don't even know Vietnam is in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in high school, the teacher would say, 'Doggone it,
no matter what happens, I can never fit the Korean War into the
curriculum. Time's run out,''' says Scruggs. ``Until now, teachers
have never had a way to teach the Vietnam War well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers thinks the ``Echoes'' program will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives me the basis to let the kids go out and learn some
things on their own,'' Rogers says. ``I'm planning to have them do
a short research project, writing a diary. I want them to know what
it was like, day-to-day, and not from the few movies they may have
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who want more information about the ``Echoes'' program
can contact the VVMF at 202-393-0090 or vvmf(at)vvmf.org.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first, they poured into the Post Office at a
rate of about 1,000 a day, as if they were patriots rushing to
answer a call to arms. Letters from the front, letters from home,
they had been written in wartime and had survived in attics and at
the bottom of drawers, the buried testimony of men and women who
had known war too well. Now veterans were mailing them in; wives,
children and descendants of soldiers and sailors were mailing them
in. They were becoming a great massing of American voices of war,
arriving from all directions, rising out of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were a few florid lines from the Revolution and
batches more from the Civil War. There were trickles of letters
from the smaller conflicts _ 1812, the Indian wars in the West, the
Spanish-American War, the Persian Gulf; stronger streams from World
War I, Korea and Vietnam. From World War II came a torrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mitchell,'' begins one, dated May 28, 1944, from a GI to
his younger brother in Sequatchie, Tenn. ``I don't think any man
can explain combat. It's beyond words. Take a combination of fear,
anger, hunger, thirst, exhaustion, disgust, loneliness,
homesickness, and wrap that all up in one reaction and you might
approach the feelings a fellow has. It makes you feel mighty small,
helpless and alone.'' The soldier, Paul Curtis, was killed three
days later at Anzio, Italy. He was one of three Curtis brothers
killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   At the post office, in the Adams-Morgan section, the tide of
mail had gotten out of hand. A clerk on duty phoned Andrew Carroll,
the young, energetic, self-employed archivist who was responsible
for the deluge, and told him to get over there quick. ``I tell him,
`I'm just a few blocks away; I'll bike over this minute,''' Carroll
recalled. ``He says, `Bring a car.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was last November, and thus did Carroll's campaign to
preserve American wartime correspondence get rolling, after
receiving a decisive push from an enthusiastic Abigail Van Buren.
Through her syndicated ``Dear Abby'' column, she had asked readers
to donate copies of letters to the effort, a nonprofit enterprise
that Carroll had christened the Legacy Project.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the response has overwhelmed his small apartment on
Connecticut Avenue. Encamped across the living room floor are 15
white plastic postal bins holding more than 15,000 letters, a
number still growing through word of mouth. And Thursday, Veterans
Day, some of them are appearing in public for the first time. The
collection forms the basis of a History Channel documentary, ``Dear
Home: Letters From World War II,'' Thursday night at 8, and six of
the World War II letters will go on view at the Smithsonian's
National Postal Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is also talking to publishers about compiling the
letters for a book, a terrain he's familiar with. He has edited a
collection of historical letters, ``Letters of a Nation''; a book
of 20th-century American speeches, ``In Our Own Words,'' which he
compiled with Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.; and, working with
Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky, an anthology of poems that Carroll,
taking a page from the Gideon Bibles, distributes to hotels and
motels in another nonprofit endeavor that he has carried on alone
since Brodsky's death in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll says his passion for preserving letters was born the day
his family's home in Washington burned down while he was in New
York attending Columbia University. ``What struck me the most was
that all the letters were gone,'' he said, ``letters from friends,
old love letters. I had always taken them for granted.'' Today, he
said, with war generations aging or passing away, he feels an
urgency about saving these ``valuable testaments'' from oblivion;
indeed, one batch mailed to him had been rescued from a Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   His relative youth also has something to do with it; he just
turned 30. ``My fear is that the younger generations don't
appreciate enough what these guys did,'' he said over lunch
recently at a neighborhood pub. ``For my generation, war is
sanitized. All we know is the Gulf war and Kosovo, and it's a video
game. But it's important to remember the graphic nature of war, and
I think nothing strips away the glamour and the romance more than
these letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his apartment, Carroll pulled a letter from a pile as
a case in point. ``My Darling Mother, Dad and all,'' writes Hugh
McGee of Kruger, Miss., a grandson of a Confederate soldier. The
letter is dated Dec. 14, 1918, about a month after the end of World
War I. ``I lived for forty days on the Argonne front in the very
midst of the fiercest struggle of the whole war,'' he writes,
``forty days with the booming of the guns, the nerve-racking whine
of the projectiles and the crash of the bombs ever in my ears,
breathing and eating the damnable gases that have shocked the
civilized world.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes ``a gray cob-webby vapor'' that hung over the
trenches. ``It seemed to clog the lungs,'' he says. ``A man gets
hungry for just one blast of sunshine. Sleep was almost an
impossibility. No man can sleep in a cold puddle or a mud hole with
gun fire for a lullaby.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lines reflect a kind of poetry of common men found in so
many of these letters. One, by a World War II infantryman,
observes: ``In their fighting, men begin to show their souls.''
It's a characteristic that also impressed Harry Smith, a former CBS
correspondent, who conceived the History Channel documentary after
hearing of Carroll's project and who acts as the program's host.
``You can't help but be struck by the eloquence of these people,''
he said. ``I think we educated people better then.''
</P>
<P>
   And they often used their pens to express their weariness, and
even anger. ``Sunday Nov 3, 1862 Camp Edwards Near Aquia Creek
Landing Va.,'' begins a Civil War letter, shot through with
misspellings, from Joseph Coryell to his wife, Sarah, of Clinton
County, Mich. ``Burnside has made preparations for a big fight up
here at Fredericksburg,'' he writes, ``but I hope it will never
come off for we have had plenty of fighting already. O Sackey dear,
you know nothing at all of the horrors of this war and the worst of
it is, it is a war of speculation at the expence of the lives and
comforts and property of the poor privates. I have great faith in
the justess of a great over ruling Power. I have no faith in our
Generals.''
</P>
<P>
   Others write of episodes that troubled them _ the firing-squad
execution of a Union deserter during the Civil War, for example _
or that amazed and horrified them. ``Today I am sitting in Hitler's
luxuriously furnished apartment in Munich,'' Staff Sgt. Horace
Evers writes in a letter to ``Mom and Lou'' on May 2, 1945. The
yellow stationery bears the Nazi insignia, an eagle clasping a
swastika, and the name Adolf Hitler. Sweeping through the city,
Evers and his comrades had stumbled onto the apartment two days
after Hitler's apparent suicide in Berlin. Only a day earlier,
Evers had entered the Dachau concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still find it hard to believe what my eyes told me,'' he
writes in the same letter. He describes rooms ``full of bodies
waiting to be cremated,'' a boxcar jammed with ``what were once
humans; all were just bone with a layer of skin over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has received ``quite a few'' of what he describes as
Holocaust letters, mostly written by soldiers who had helped
liberate the death camps. But the collection also runs the gamut of
wartime experience, from gripes about military life to paeans to
the cause to ``Dear John'' letters. Some letters have surprising
historical resonance: one, from the Civil War, is by Gen. George S.
Patton Jr.'s grandfather, six months before he was reported missing
in action; another is by Mary Morris, the wife of a future
Pennsylvania senator, Robert Morris, in which she scoffs at the
British general William Howe's ``evacuating the Jerseys'' during
the Revolution. (Many of the letters are originals rather than
copies, the senders choosing to entrust Carroll with them.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost invariably, though, the letters are personal, often
intimate; reading them may even provoke an uneasy feeling that a
certain privacy is being violated, even from a distance of years.
Yet the soldiers' talk of ordinary life, and their longing for it,
often gives the letters a kind of unforeseen emotional power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty convinced that I've grown up, ain't I, Mom,'' Pvt.
Richard Cowan writes on his 22nd birthday, Dec. 5, 1944. ``Well I
still count on your tucking me into bed when I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later he was killed at the Battle of the Bulge.

 &HT;    Rail heyday gone, but charm still on track
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   OPELIKA, Ala. _ It's easy to like Opelika.
</P>
<P>
   From its charming Victorian homes and restored train station to
the inviting antiques stores and gift shops, this east Alabama town
of 28,000 offers plenty of Southern hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of a princely Croak-a-Lika Frog.
</P>
<P>
   In the heyday of trains, Opelika was a transportation hub and
had many railroad tracks. The section of track that crossed was
held together by metal frogs _ devices for keeping cars on the
right rails at intersections. Artistic license has been taken with
the word frog by local artist Jan Jones, who makes amusing
papier-mache frog collectibles and dresses them in a variety of
clothing ($38-$50).
</P>
<P>
   Even today, trains chug through Opelika on historic Railroad
Avenue, home to a variety of shops in refurbished buildings. It's
also the perfect place to park your car and stroll the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some engineers blow their horns all the way through town,''
said Joanne Woodall of Southern Crossing, a gift shop on Railroad
Avenue. ``Others just give a short beep. But after a while, you
don't pay any attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall and five other women have owned the shop, a former
hardware store, for four years. Each does her own buying, and the
mix includes everything from Davis' frogs and painted furniture to
jewelry and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six women, we all get along and have a good time,''
laughed Woodall. ``When we have a difference of opinion, we vote,
and whatever the consensus, that's what goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor on this historic avenue is the two-story shop
The Gallery. Built in 1865, the building was originally a saloon,
but for the past 20 years it has housed frames, prints, European
garden ornaments, accessories and gifts. Owner Deborah S. Purves
said there's ``a whole new beat going on'' in downtown Opelika.
``Thank goodness, people are revitalizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers make her shop a destination. ``Lots of people
will come from Atlanta or Columbus to a ballgame (at nearby Auburn
University) and bring in prints to be framed,'' she said. ``Three
games later they pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the tracks, but still on the avenue, is High Cotton, an
eclectic gift shop in an old cotton warehouse. Items range from
Vera Bradley's floral-patterned soft luggage to Vietri Italian
pottery and Mississippi artist Vicki Carroll's handpainted china.
On a recent Friday, two friends from Baton Rouge, La., Sally Pareti
and Debbie Sikes, were shopping for Christmas gifts _ and for
themselves. The two had stopped on their way to Atlanta to visit
relatives. ``There's a charm about Opelika,'' said Pareti, who was
looking for something ``I can't find at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Opelika derives its name from the Creek Indian words ``Opila''
for swamp and ``laka'' for large or big, thus meaning Big Swamp.
Since Opelika is actually the highest elevation between Atlanta and
New Orleans, why the name Big Swamp? Historians say the streams and
creeks being fed by the lakes caused the Indians to choose swamp as
a descriptive term. The town was incorporated in February 1854.
</P>
<P>
   Like many smaller places, downtown Opelika has had its retail
ups and downs. ``In the early '70s, streets were closed off and
monstrous steel awnings were put on storefronts,'' said Sherri
Sumners, president of the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacancies were running 40 percent. It was a ghost town. The
city fathers saw that something had to be done. They refurbished
the train station, which now houses the arts association,
demolished some buildings to build a park and took down those
awnings. Between 1989 and 1999, $22 million in capital investment,
both public and private, was pumped into Opelika.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the vacancy rate is 5 percent, and the town is working to
build loft apartments in the 100-year-old buildings to attract
residents downtown. ``Because the space is old, it takes time,
money and lots of steps to renovate,'' said Sumners. ``However,
property owners and locals agree that a vibrant downtown is
important to the overall economic health of Opelika.''
</P>
<P>
   One shop that's been a constant is Winston Smith T Hardware on
Railroad Avenue. For more than 60 years, this store, in a
turn-of-the-century building, has been selling everything from
building supplies and mailboxes to tools. ``I have an old invoice
book from '44, which lists transactions,'' said Dozier Smith T,
grandson of the original owner, Winston. ``Now I have the sons and
daughters of those customers as my customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what separates our store from the other boys. We go
for the service aspect. We know each customer by name.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take 1-85 south to Exit 62. Take U.S. 280 west,
less than two miles, and turn right on Sixth Street. It's about 100
miles from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Mondays-
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays; however, some close early Wednesday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Plenty of on-street
</P>
<P>
   parking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most stores are accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: In shops and
</P>
<P>

334-745-4861; or, 1-800-673-5452. The Web site is www.opelika.com.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Venable's: It has lace curtains at the window and Miss Martha
as the gracious hostess and owner who whips up pure comfort food.
If you want light fare, try the cold plate: chicken salad,
raspberry congealed salad, fresh fruit and deviled eggs ($6.75).
For heartier appetites, go for the Southern sideboard buffet, which
might feature chicken pot pie, meatloaf, mashed potatoes,
black-eyed peas and broccoli casserole, plus yeast rolls and corn
bread muffins ($7.25). Save room for banana pudding or coconut
cream pie ($2.95). Hours: 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Mondays-Fridays. 913 S.
Railroad Ave. 334-745-0834.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other recommendations: Try soul food at Made From Scratch, 124
S. Eighth St. (334-741-7736). It's chicken fingers at The
Breezeway, 213 S. Eighth St. (334-749-5167) and Continental
specialties at Warehouse Bistro, 105 Rocket Ave. (334-745-6353).
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Heritage House: The innkeeper is Opelika Mayor Barbara
Patton, who with her son Richard oversees an elegant 1914 home in a
historic neighborhood. It's minutes from downtown, championship
golf at the Grand National Robert Trent Jones Golf Course and
Auburn University. Each of the five rooms has a private bath, and
the rate includes a full breakfast. $70-$95. No smoking or pets.
714 Second Ave. 334-705-0485.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Victorian Front Porch Christmas. One night six years ago,
local artist Jan Jones secretly placed life-size Santas, angels,
carousel horses, teddy bears and toys on the porches of Victorian
homes in her north Opelika historic neighborhood. Word got out and
people from around the area came to see these elaborately dressed
figures. Today, more than 10,000 visitors are expected at the
event, which runs Dec. 9-12. Carolers and neighbors in Victorian
costume add to the fun. The free tour is open to automobiles and
walkers 6-9 p.m. Dec. 9-10 and Dec.12; walkers only 6-9 p.m. Dec.
11.

wasn't there. Could you find out if it still exists?
</P>
<P>
   _ Phyllis Kaltenbach, Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Both of these products still exist. They are just not always
on grocers' shelves because of limited distribution. However, you
can order them through the manufacturer, Reckitt &AMP; Colman. Ultra
Vivid, which contains no chlorine bleach, is $3.29 for a 50-ounce
bottle; a 100-ounce bottle is $5.99. Easy Wash, a laundry and stain
remover, is $1.99 for a 22-ounce bottle and $2.49 for a 32-ounce
bottle. To order: 1-800-456-9477.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you locate Merry Mules house shoes by Beacon? My
mother-in-law claims they are the most comfortable she's ever worn.
The old box indicated the company was in Jonesburg, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lauren Vaillancourt, Lawrenceville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another Merry request: I can't find the bedroom slippers called
Merry Mules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Planer, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We got a kick out of these requests. Merry Mules by Beacon
are wedge-heel slippers with no back that have extra-cushioned
insoles for comfy wear. Although not available in the Atlanta area,
you can buy them through the Anthony Richards catalog. They are
available in gold, pink, blue, black or white at $19.99 a pair. To
order: 1-800-359-5933.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to locate L'Oreal Grow Stronger Nail Treatment.
It's a strenghthening base coat and it's done wonders for my nails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martha Bodkin, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon your nails will be as tough as, well, nails. L'Oreal has
introduced a treatment line called the Nail Specialistes. And your
favorite product, the Grow Stronger base coat, is included, but in
new packaging. However, according to a spokeswoman, the formula did
not change. A .5-ounce bottle of Grow Stronger is $8.25 at Eckerd
Drugs, 2480 Briarcliff Road N.E. (404-321-4250) Some CVS stores
also carry this product.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have ``bubbling'' (liquid-filled) Christmas lights
(standard C-7 base bulbs) for our tree, but some have worn out. The
company name is Roman from Roselle, Ill. Any help you could provide
in finding these replacement bulbs, to carry on a family tradition,
would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve and
</P>
<P>
   Mary Alice
</P>
<P>
   Bancroft,
</P>
<P>
   Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't have to drink bubbly to get a festive glow during
the holidays. Simply string bubble lights on your tree. First
popular in the '50s, these colorful sparkle lights have made a
nostalgic comeback. Roman manufactures them under the label
Bethlehem Lights. Glass candles are filled with a green, blue,
yellow, red or clear liquid. The plastic bases are red/green,
yellow/green or red/blue. When the lights warm up, they start to
bubble. We found our Roman lights at the Christmas House, 993 Main
St., Stone Mountain (770-498-9887).
</P>
<P>
   A string of seven 4 1/2-high lights, spaced 20 inches apart, is
$23.99. Replacement lights are three for $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   Bubble lights are also available from other manufacturers at a
variety of stores. For example, Noma Bubble Lights, multicolor and
clear, are $15.99 for a string of seven. Three replacement lights
are $4.79 at Workbench Ace Hardware, 1544 Piedmont Ave. N.E.
(404-872-1000).

   COMPLETE WEB STUDIO 2.0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Home; $79.95; Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0.)
</P>
<P>
   It seems everybody has a Web site these days _ businesses,
television shows, grandmothers and pets. If you're feeling left
out, Sierra Home has recently released its Complete Web Studio 2.0
software for home users.
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed for people who just want to make a Web
site on their own, without having to marry an HTML manual or invest
in high-end Web development programs like Adobe's GoLive or
Macromedia's Dreamweaver. Web Studio not only makes creating a Web
site about as easy as pointing and clicking, but it can also make
uploading the site to the Web a breeze, even for nontechnical
users.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``dragging and dropping'' might be a more appropriate
comparison, because that is what you pretty much do to create a
page with Complete Web Studio. The program, on two CDs, comes with
more than 37,000 graphics, photographs, backgrounds, animations,
sounds and page templates.
</P>
<P>
   If you have spent any amount of time on the Web, you have
probably run into your fair share of truly hideous and poorly
designed sites. Many of them are most likely labors of love from
people still learning this relatively new medium. The Web Studio
program gives you a generous number of templates that you can
select and modify to your own tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The overall look of the templates is quite conservative, but
there seems to be one for every occasion, including graphically
appropriate blueprints named such things as ``A history links
page!'' and ``A page about your auto collection!'' Perhaps in an
attempt to cover all bases, the template file also contains such
narrowly focused themes as ``A page about Grandpa in the war'' and
``A page for your Japanese exchange family.''
</P>
<P>
   To make a Web page with the program, you simply pick a template
or start with a blank work space, and then drag and drop desired
page elements into place. Tiny samples of all potential page parts
are arranged on a multilayered, tabbed palette next to the main
on-screen work space.
</P>
<P>
   To add a colorful background to your page, click on the sample
and drag it onto the main window. You can type in and style your
own text, add your own pictures or choose from the vast array of
clip art and stock photos.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clip art and backgrounds included look a bit
amateurish, but there are scads of others to choose from. You can
shift and move items around on the canvas and even place things
like hit counters and calendars on your page.
</P>
<P>
   Web Studio allows you to drag and drop links from your browser's
Bookmarks or Favorites file, and you can easily add more pages to
your site to link to the first one you have created.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have completed your site, Web Studio will convert your
creation to HTML and save your file and all its parts in a folder.
The program is fairly intuitive to use, but if you do have
questions, Web Studio conveniently comes with multimedia tutorials
to explain the steps and a 110-page manual.
</P>
<P>
   As software manuals go, this one is fairly understandable,
although it tries to water down some subjects too much. In Chapter
6, which explains how to get your newly made site off your hard
drive and onto the Internet, the manual refers to File Transfer
Protocol, or FTP, as ``Friendly virTual Postman.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the manual's index gives the proper rendering, it is
somewhat aggravating to see abbreviation abuse in a program aimed
at nontechnical users who are probably easily confused as it is.
</P>
<P>
   But on the subject of FTP, users don't really have to know what
it is anyway, because the Web Studio's Upload Wizard takes the
headache out of uploading the finished site to the Web for all to
see. The Upload Wizard allows you to post the page by typing in a
user name and password and clicking with the mouse a few times.
</P>
<P>
   The program contains a database of many popular Internet service
providers that provide free Web space to their members (like
America Online, MindSpring and Xoom), which provides an even faster
shortcut to uploading.
</P>
<P>
   Complete Web Studio 2.0 also includes two other programs:
SnapShot Express, a picture-editing application, and iCollect,
which lets you download entire Web sites for offline browsing and
study. A recent version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser,
required for the program's Help files, is included on one of the
CDs as well.
</P>
<P>
   To install Web Studio, at minimum you will need a PC with 16
megabytes of RAM, a Pentium-class 100-megahertz processor, a CD-ROM
drive and 50 megabytes of hard drive space. Web Studio runs better
with 32 megabytes of RAM, though, and the standard install needs
160 megabytes of hard drive space.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Complete Web Studio works well in its mission of
bringing easy site creation to the nontechnical masses. Using the
software is vaguely reminiscent of tossing items into a shopping
cart in an enormous supermarket _ except instead of a week's worth
of meals, you have a complete Web site when you're done.

ALL HOT AIR AND NO ACTION FOR THE 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Pro football's version of the Hindenburg
is going down, in slow motion, for all to see. It's a great, big
fragile craft, held aloft by hot air and hope, and it's descending
to earth nose-first, about to burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen the grainy black-and-white footage of the big
oblate spheroid as it began its fateful descent so long ago. It's
fitting that smaller oblate spheroids as thrown in living color by
Jeff Garcia of the San Francisco 49ers have been similarly crashing
into the ground of late.
</P>
<P>
   As a commentator said plaintively of that famous 1937 crash and
burn, ``Oh, the humanity!''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the humanity is located in Santa Clara, home of
the Team of the '80s as it skulks ingloriously into the '00s.
Unlike the Hindenburg tragedy, no one is expected to die from the
developing disaster that is the 49ers' 1999 season, although heads
may roll.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are a mess-in-progress. For the last several years
they mortgaged their future for the present and continued to win.
It's not working now and the club is stuck with a bill that comes
due after the season in the form of another salary-cap overrun.
</P>
<P>
   On the field of play, the team that likes to think it
revolutionized the forward pass suddenly cannot throw the ball, no
how, no way. Imagine coach Steve Mariucci's mortification at that.
</P>
<P>
   He's an offensive coach, a quarterback guru who once guru-ed
Brett Favre, and now he's considering changing from Garcia to Steve
Stenstrom, who was 1-6 as a starter for the talent-poor Chicago
Bears last year.
</P>
<P>
   That the 49ers are contemplating a change at quarterback at the
halfway point in the season indicates how far they have fallen from
the days of bounty when they had such capable backups as Steve
Bono, Elvis Grbac and Ty Detmer spilling out of the old cornucopia.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci wanted to keep aw-shucks Detmer but lost out to the
intractable Bill Walsh, as he has ever since the former coach
returned in the guise of vice president, general manager and grand
high exalted mystic ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci also lost out on Marc Edwards, the young fullback who
was shipped to Cleveland, and on Kevin Gogan, the towering guard
with the personality of a barbed-wire suppository. The 49ers were
able to cover the loss of Edwards by discovering the gem they had
in Fred Beasley, who should be their fullback for the next 10
years. Gogan could be as abrasive as sandpaper shorts but he was a
nasty, powerful presence on the interior of the line.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear division of authority on this team. Walsh has
all of it. He makes a decision and Mariucci hears about it later.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be a head coach in the league more in the dark
about what happens around and above him than Mariucci. He's a good
man wronged by a gap in communication from the front office to the
coach's office.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see this skewed arrangement persisting beyond this
dismal season.
</P>
<P>
   That could impede the club's ability to rebuild, a necessity now
that the Hindenburg has begun its slow descent, with no air brakes
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   With the injured Steve Young unlikely to play again as
quarterback for the 49ers, it's essential for the club to find and
develop its long anticipated successor. If Garcia or Stenstrom
represent the future, then liquefaction is in the offing for all
the stability they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the next draft class of quarterbacks is nowhere near
as talented as this year's. There is no Tim Couch or Akili Smith.
Instead, there are Chris Redman of Louisville and Chad Pennington
of Marshall, the two highest-rated players at the position, and a
smallish fellow named Tim Rattay of Louisiana Tech. No heartthrobs
in the bunch, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly not as strong as last year,'' Terry Donahue, the
49ers' director of player personnel said. ``There's not going to be
the frenzy that was created last year at that position. Redman and
Pennington are at the top of that group. But that certainly hasn't
been finalized yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What's important is that Walsh, Mariucci and Donahue come up
with a plan for the quarterback position, not just a stop-gap
measure like Garcia and Stenstrom. That involves communication, not
a papal edict.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, all that remains is to get a good seat for
viewing the old airship as it comes down in a whoosh of hot air and
flames, twisted metal and tattered fabric, the last act of a mighty
vessel that remained aloft for nearly two decades on the strength
and will of men like Young and Joe Montana. Amidst the smoking
rubble can be found Garcia and Stenstrom, men who gave it a go when
the old dirigible was all out of go.

AT RADIO CITY, A HOLIDAY SPECTACLE IN NEW FINERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Radio City Music Hall isn't alone in undergoing a
refurbishing this year. So has its ``Christmas Spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the kitchen where big, cheery, colorful, crowd-pleasing
shows like this are cooked up comes a ``Christmas Spectacular''
that is primed and ready to go on making big and little children
happy well into the millennium to come.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Robert Longbottom, who staged Broadway's
``Scarlet Pimpernel,'' this generous 90-minute entertainment trots
along at a merry clip, with a sharpened arrival of Santa in New
York, a refreshed ``Santa's Gonna Rock 'n' Roll,'' a revised
``White Christmas in New York'' and a redone visit to the North
Pole and Santa's workshop, where the Rockettes as reindeer in furry
finery show off much sleeker lines than Donner and Blitzen.
</P>
<P>
   But in ringing in the new, including more references to e-mail,
cell phones and faxes, the 66th ``Radio City Christmas
Spectacular'' hasn't tossed out the old.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockettes are as precise and talented as ever, and their
bright smiles and unison dancing evoke cheers and applause in old
favorites like ``The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers.'' The Reader's
Digest version of ``The Nutcracker,'' with its bears of all
nations, still capers delightfully.
</P>
<P>
   And humor, Clausian crimson and happy feet again fill the
enormous stage in ``Here Comes Santa Claus'' when Santa (heartily
portrayed by Charles Edward Hall) answers the question of how he
manages to be everywhere on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the sides of the stage, the Mighty Wurlitzer organs still
thunder carols and hymns; from onstage, under and behind the
action, the huge orchestra delivers a generous supply of seasonal
favorites, and the towering, sparkling Christmas tree, the statue
of Prometheus and the skaters are all back, as is the reverent
human and animal pageantry of ``The Living Nativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Radio City Christmas Spectacular'' runs for more than 200
performances through Jan. 5, after which the show's satisfied
devotees will probably start lining up to buy tickets for the next
one.

THE EVER-MULTIPLYING MILLENNIAL LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's List-O-Mania! As if they needed more of an excuse, the
impending arrival of Y2K seems to be giving publications extra
incentive to churn out list after list of the top 50, 100 or 101
things and people in entertainment. The other incentive: Lists are
fairly easy to produce and extremely easy to sell to consumers and
advertisers, and they lend an aura of authority to a publication.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly is the leader of the pack. So far this
year, they've produced four ``special collectors issues''
(Translation: We charge you 96 cents more and sell more ads) of
``The 100 Greatest Moments'' in rock, television and movies, and
``The 100 Greatest Entertainers.'' These, in addition to EW's
annual Power Issue _ not a keeper, apparently, since it's not
labeled a collector's issue _ the idea for which EW essentially
swiped from Premiere magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Movieline, which has also carved out a niche with attitude-heavy
lists, offers up the ``50 Best Insults in Hollywood History'' in
its current issue. This one at least gets points for bitchiness
instead of a high-handed tone.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a high-handed tone, Rolling Stone and Vibe have both
weighed in on the music side. The Stone came out with a list of the
century's (or half-century's, since rock is about that old) top
rock concerts. Vibe has just issued its list of the 100 ``essential
albums of the 20th century'' (no, none of Leonard Bernstein's
recordings of the Mahler symphonies made the cut).
</P>
<P>
   Even nonprofit organizations have caught the bug. The American
Film Institute, which until recently was a rather quiet
organization in a grand Hollywood mansion, has become the EW of
nonprofits. It's already put out a (controversial) list of top 100
films, along with a (noncontroversial) list of top film actors who
began working by midcentury. Apparently they've enjoyed the media
attention and have no intention of stopping ... they're now sending
journalists ballots to vote for the funniest movies of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, lists are so pervasive, we were considering coming up
with a list of the best lists of the 20th century, but we're too
busy. We have a millennium list to work on ... &QL;

   BALTIMORE _ When it comes to the current availability of
bandwidth, there are vastly more have-nots than haves. I should
know. Despite seven months of promises, I learned recently that
there would be no high-speed digital subscriber line in my home.
</P>
<P>
   When I first started the process, it seemed that my house was
close enough to the telephone switch in the local office, a crucial
measure because the technology only works over shorter wires. But
measurements showed that the wire was 22,500 feet, considerably
more than the acceptable distance.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems are out of the picture. TCI, the company with
Baltimore's cable contract, is only beginning to plan how to
provide fast cable modems to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Anderson, a local cable executive, said the company hoped
to be able to roll out the service by the fourth quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That news wouldn't be so tough to handle if the fast service
wasn't so tantalizingly close. Comcast, the cable company serving
the substantially richer suburbs only a few miles away, added cable
modem service several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And satellite service is out because of location. There's a hill
in the way, blocking line-of-sight reception.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Waldhuter, director of technology for Bell Atlantic, said
that the company was committed to making high-speed lines as
widespread as touch-tone service but that it was going to take
time. The company has 20 million customers, and Waldhuter said 20
percent to 40 percent of them would end up being too far from a
central office to receive DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic hopes that better DSL technology will one day let
it reach everyone here in Baltimore, but that is not going to
happen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some competition in the DSL arena, it doesn't
help me. All the competitors use Bell Atlantic's wires.
</P>
<P>
   So I get Bell Atlantic and its competitors, NorthPoint
Communications and Covad Communications, fighting for the chance to
reject me.
</P>
<P>
   One technician told me that my best option was to move because
I'm going to stay 22,500 feet from the office for as long as he can
see.
</P>
<P>
   My only option at the moment is to pay $500 or more each month
for a dedicated line like a T-1. At that price, Bell Atlantic would
find a way to get a signal to my house.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons one neighborhood gets service and one doesn't are
not clear. The placement of the local telephone office produces
more random results. My central switching station just happened to
lie on a dividing line between some of the most expensive
neighborhoods in the city and some that are obviously struggling.
That means half the people in the circle blessed with DSL service
are rich, and half are not.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research group
in Bethesda, Md., said that geographic discrimination differed
from, say, building a noisy or smelly industrial plant in a poor
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're disenfranchising people who know what they can have and
know how to make a stink politically,'' he said. ``I can see the
commissioner will be deluged with complaints from people who know
very well what they're missing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is getting plenty of
complaints. Its chairman, William E. Kennard, said in a recent
speech, ``What I am hearing on this issue is a lot of rhetoric that
the sky is falling, but when I look out in the marketplace and see
only a million cable modem subscribers and about 200,000 DSL
subscribers, my first reaction is to allow this marketplace to play
out for a while before we step in and start regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Maryland Public Service Commission,
which regulates the phone company, told me that it had already
examined the issue. The costs were too prohibitive to force Bell
Atlantic to serve everyone equally, and DSL was too seductive to
keep out. So the commission has approved it, but it is hoping that
a new technology will come along to serve everyone.
</P>
<P>
   That may work. Integrated Telecom Express, a technology company
in Santa Clara, Calif., just announced a new version of DSL modems
that can carry signals more than 20,000 feet, a distance the
company says should reach 75 percent of the customers. I hope
someone can get to 22,500 feet. Until then, I'm stuck with a 56K
modem.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The key to happiness in the Internet age is
bandwidth. Bandwidth, bandwidth, bandwidth. Fat pipes, capable of
sucking down Web pages, music files, video clips, e-mail and other
forms of digital information and entertainment from the Internet in
the blink of an eye. A data spigot that is always open, without
busy signals and without the kinds of delays and service
interruptions that drive most computer users mad.
</P>
<P>
   Bandwidth _ a measure of the flow of information, in bits, that
moves over a given distance in a period of time _ is the most
important factor in the development of new types of services on the
Internet, more so than increases in personal computer processing
power or new types of Internet communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, high-bandwidth connections to the Internet were
available mainly to businesses and certain lucky people willing and
able to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month for
so-called broadband Internet access. But with the development of
cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL) modems and satellite
data services, several million Americans now have access to
high-speed, broadband data services.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell who they are by the smug look on their faces. I
know, because I see the face of a bandwidth glutton in the mirror
each morning. I am rich in bandwidth, wallowing in a broadband
trough.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months I have had the luxury of using not just one
broadband connection in my home office but three: a cable modem, a
DSL modem and a satellite modem. I've been testing them to see
which one to keep, a decision that sooner or later a lot of Net
surfers are going to make.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only a small percentage of Americans live in the right
geographic or service area to get any one of these services, and
even fewer _ perhaps 1 percent, according to market researchers _
have a choice of two. But by the grace of whatever digital deities
watch over the Internet, my house in Austin is in a rare sweet
spot, where cable, DSL and satellite coverage overlap. I also had
ISDN (integrated services digital network, which essentially
combines the capacity of two phones lines), but I had it ripped
from my house when its cost and complexity far outstripped the
modest speed improvements it offered over regular dial-up phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   My files are downloaded in a snap. Web pages pop onto my screen.
I do not think twice about downloading video clips or MP3 music
files. Multiplayer network games and home videoconferences suddenly
become practical. But the thing that changes everything is the fact
that the Internet is always on, whenever I want it.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest nightmare is that I will wake up someday and have to
connect to the Internet using _ the horror, the horror _ an
old-fashioned 56K modem on a dial-up telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example: Earlier this year, the movie trailer for
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' was made available
for downloading from the Internet, but it was a 25-megabyte file.
The fastest conventional modems available today, at 56K, can
download nearly 56,000 bits per second. There are 8 bits in a byte,
and, because of way binary numbers are counted, 1,048,576 bytes, or
8,388,608 bits, in a megabyte and roughly 200 million bits in a
25-megabyte file. In the time it takes to do the calculation of how
long it would take a regular modem to download the file, it would
already be done via a cable or DSL modem.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I cannot put all three broadband services on my expense
account indefinitely, so I have to choose. Following is a
discussion of the three broadband options, and what went into my
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cable
</P>
<P>
   The black coaxial cable that carries cable television signals to
tens of millions of households can also handle high-bandwidth data
connections. Analysts expect cable to become the dominant method
for high-speed Internet connections at home, in part because cable
already passes by the majority of houses in the country. But older
cable systems were designed to be only one-way, sending video to
the home, so cable providers have to upgrade their systems to give
them the two-way capabilities needed for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The top speed of a cable modem, at least in theory, is about 30
million bits per second (30 mbps), but a more realistic expectation
is around 1 mbps. It can be a bit faster, but considering that most
of us connect a cable modem to a 10-mbps Ethernet card, 30 mbps is
a pipe dream. Uploading is somewhat slower, but that is usually not
a problem for most home users.
</P>
<P>
   More important is that cable downloading can be even slower,
depending on how many of your neighbors are also using the
neighborhood cable pipe at the same time. It is a shared service.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the local cable line all to yourself, you can easily
top 1 mbps. But if all of your neighbors have cable modems, things
can slow down so much that you might actually yearn to have your
dial-up modem back. If one of your cable-using neighbors starts
running a Web server out of the home, you can imagine neighbors
marching with torches and pitchforks. The two leading cable data
services, Time Warner's Roadrunner and AT&AMP;T Cable's (AT)Home,
forbid residential customers to run Web server computers on the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, however, that the practical speed of any broadband
network, no matter what its theoretical speed, is limited by the
slowest link on the network. If you link to a popular site that is
congested, or to an obscure site that may be attached to the
Internet through the equivalent of a hand-cranked computer, your
multimegabit broadband connection will slow down accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   My monthly cable data fee is $44.95 because I also subscribe to
the cable company's standard (as opposed to basic) television
services. If I were not already a cable television customer, I
would have to become one to get the data services, taking my
monthly cost to a minimum of about $65 a month. With my extra
television channels, I'm now paying Time Warner $85 a month, which
includes the rental of the cable modem. Adding e-mail addresses for
family members costs $5 a month each. If I want to have a home page
on the Web, it is $5 extra per month.
</P>
<P>
   There was a setup and installation charge of $130, but periodic
promotional deals cut that price in half. It took several
frustrating exchanges with the local company before technicians
finally came to my house. Overall, the installation process was
about what I had come to expect from my cable company: a logistical
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Jekyll and Hyde speed issues that affect cable
modems, a big drawback is that cable customers have no choice of
Internet service providers. America Online and other popular ISP's
are challenging the cable companies in court to open cable services
to competition, but for now, it's either Roadrunner or (AT)Home.
Time Warner is my local cable company, and Roadrunner is the only
choice I have for cable ISP service.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is data security. Because it is a shared
network, any of your devious neighbors with the technical expertise
to run a network sniffer can intercept data packets from your
computer. That is highly unlikely, but it is a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Try this: Lie to your neighbors, telling them that hackers came
in over your cable modem and wiped out your bank accounts. Mention
that you have heard that DSL service is more secure. Then you will
have the cable network all to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DSL
</P>
<P>
   DSL, which stands for digital subscriber line, enables
high-speed Internet connections to houses and small businesses over
the same copper telephone lines that handle voice and fax calls. It
does not interfere with voice traffic on the line, however, so one
person can make or receive calls while another is using the same
line to connect to the Internet. A big advantage, therefore, is
that DSL does not require the installation of a second phone line
or cable service.
</P>
<P>
   Its big drawback is that the service degrades quickly as a
function of distance, so customers are limited to a geographic
radius of about 3 miles from a telephone company's central office
(technically, about 17,500 feet). The phone company first checks to
see if your nearest central office offers digital service, then
checks to see if you live close enough to it and finally checks the
actual line to see if it can handle DSL bandwidth. If everything
checks out, the phone company will send out a crew to install a
splitter, which splits voice and data traffic on the line. A
splitterless form of the service is also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   There are many kinds of DSL. The most common for residential
service is the asynchronous kind, ADSL, or ADSL Lite, which offers
slightly lower data speeds. On an ADSL line, information is
uploaded to the Internet at one speed, typically 128 kilobits per
second, but downloaded at much higher speeds, typically 384
kilobits per second (kbps) to 1.544 megabits per second (mbps).
</P>
<P>
   The downloading speed is most important for most people, so it
is fair to say that downloading with DSL is anywhere from seven to
25 times as fast as with the fastest dial-up analog modems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cable modem users, who share a line, each DSL subscriber
has a dedicated line to the central office. Therefore, the speed is
more constant and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The top speed of a DSL modem is basically determined by how much
money you are willing to spend and how close you live to the
central telephone office. I live 200 yards from a central office,
and my basic DSL service regularly achieves more than the minimum
speed of 384 kbps downstream and often hovers near the 1.5 mbps
maximum; it is 128 kbps upstream.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about $70 a month, which includes the telephone company
line charge of $39 a month, the fee of the Internet service
provider, three e-mail addresses and other services for which the
cable company charges extra.
</P>
<P>
   I also paid $212 for a cable modem and a network adapter card. I
leased the modem instead of buying one outright because I wanted to
make sure it worked with the DSL equipment at the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   My monthly fee is high compared with other DSL offerings around
the country. In general, you can expect to pay $30 to $50 a month
for basic service.
</P>
<P>
   While DSL cannot compete with cable in terms of speed during the
day, when most of my neighbors are at their offices and I have the
cable line mostly to myself, it is routinely faster than cable in
the evenings, when my neighbors are sharing my cable pipe.
</P>
<P>
   I can increase my guaranteed DSL performance to a minimum of 384
kbps upstream and 1.544 mbps downstream by paying $170 or more a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The performance at this level is almost comparable with the
speeds of T-1 lines, which many companies use to operate Web-based
businesses. T-1 service typically costs $1,000 a month or more.
Other forms of DSL service can promise speeds up to 50 mbps, but at
monthly prices that would probably exceed your mortgage payment.
</P>
<P>
   As with cable, my DSL connection is always on.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite
</P>
<P>
   Satellite data service has so much promise, especially for
people in areas not served by DSL or cable. But satellite also has
many challenges. The Web is an interactive medium, while satellite
is intrinsically a one-way medium (most of us do not routinely
communicate with satellites). To send mouse clicks and typed
commands to the Internet, you have to have an open telephone line
in addition to the satellite connection.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite service requires the installation of a receiver dish
antenna, which is about the size of a garbage can lid and costs
$200 to $400. The dish has to have a clear line of sight to the
satellite, which in the New York City area is typically in the
southwestern sky.
</P>
<P>
   The installation and alignment of the dish is not for
technological sissies, and I highly recommend paying the extra $200
to $300 for professional installation. Once installed, moreover,
the data signal can be knocked out of whack by high winds or other
bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   I signed up for Hughes DirecPC satellite data services as part
of a package with Compaq Computer. Compaq, like many other PC
makers, is trying to make it as easy as possible for its customers
to be ready for broadband access. Besides the dish and installation
cost, monthly satellite data service costs $30 to $130 a month,
depending on how many hours you spend online.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 plan is good for a measly 25 hours a month. The $130
plan allows up to 200 hours a month (versus unlimited time with
cable or DSL service).
</P>
<P>
   Satellite data services may someday be ubiquitous and reach
speeds of 45 mbps, but for now the maximum speed is a relatively
pokey 400 kbps. More users can mean slower speeds and,
occasionally, busy signals when you're trying to connect with the
local satellite ISP.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so bad. The guys who wired my satellite system were
apparently receiving their orders directly from deep space. Despite
my request that they mount the dish on the side of the house and
not drill holes in my roof, I now have a dish bolted through my
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite is a swell choice for people who cannot get cable or
DSL service, especially people who live in remote areas. But a
satellite broadband connection requires a phone line, and that can
be a major problem if you live in Whitefish, Mont., and the nearest
satellite ISP is a long-distance call away in Bozeman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Decisions
</P>
<P>
   If you spend only a few minutes on line every day, switching to
a broadband modem may not make much financial sense. But if you
find yourself spending more time connected to the Internet each day
and becoming more impatient with busy signals and the time spent
waiting for pages to load, a broadband connection may be the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite was scratched off my list first. If I lived in an area
where satellite was my only choice, I could live with it. But since
I have a choice, satellite isn't it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still going to use an analog modem because it is impossible
to take my cable modem and DSL modem with me on trips.
</P>
<P>
   The choice, then, comes down to two contenders, cable and DSL.
Either is vastly more satisfactory than a regular modem, and if I
had no choice and had to take one or the other, I would still
consider myself very fortunate, no matter which one I had. The
speed is nice, but more than that, I have come to rely on the
always-on connection. There are no busy signals, no delays in
getting online, no screeching, beep-boop modem sounds and no
interruptions if I stay idle longer than the service provider
thinks is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cable's theoretical speed advantage, the actual
performances of cable and DSL are comparable. Therefore, the
determinants come down to price and, to a lesser extent, to
security, the choice of ISP and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to choose _ and economics dictate that I must _ I would
keep DSL. Performance is steady and reliable. From the start, the
phone company has been easier to deal with than my cable company,
although both could improve their customer service skills.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, many people have drawn exactly the opposite
conclusion. They found their local phone company impossible to deal
with and had no trouble with cable. It all depends on the skills
and temperament of the local service providers. The best tactic, as
always, is to ask neighbors and friends who have local broadband
access about their experiences.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning high pressure over eastern Canada will drive a cold
front south through the Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states on
Thursday, bringing an end to the unseasonable warmth of recent
days. Afternoon temperatures will average 20 degrees lower than
Wednesday from central and southern New England to the eastern
Great Lakes. Brisk breezes from the northeast will augment the
chill early Thursday, but winds will diminish later in the day.
Clouds and a few showers will linger near the front from the
eastern Ohio Valley to the Carolina coast. Farther north, partly to
mostly sunny skies will prevail. Under clear skies and calm winds
Thursday night, temperatures will plummet into the teens from
northern Pennsylvania to interior New England.
</P>
<P>
   Another mild, tranquil day with ample sunshine will occur across
much of the Southeast and southern Plains as a ridge of high
pressure remains steadfast near the Gulf Coast. Farther west, sunny
and warm conditions will cover the southern and central Plains,
although patchy clouds will linger across southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A moisture-starved front marking the leading edge of another
mild Pacific air mass will move east from the Dakotas. Clouds will
develop in the northern Mississippi Valley as the mild air is
forced to rise over cooler air in place over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and gusty breezes will sweep across the Pacific Northwest
coast. Some snow will fall in the higher elevations of the northern
Cascades. Farther east, showers will occur from eastern Washington
to the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Mirror
</P>
<P>
   During the cold season, the temperature pattern in Alaska is
often a mirror image of the eastern United States. On Tuesday and
Wednesday dozens of record high temperatures were set from the
Middle West to the Northeast. Meanwhile, a chill reminiscent of
mid-winter had settled across Alaska. Early Wednesday the mercury
dipped to -40 degrees in the village of Bettles. When cold air
plunges south at the longitude of Alaska, mild winds from the south
tend to strengthen over the center of the continent. As a result,
warmth is drawn into the Middle West which eventually spreads to
the East.

   BEDFORD, Texas _ Four years ago, the biggest venue that Chris
Faulkner and Erin Bullock attended together was their senior prom
at Grapevine High School. They are about to have another coming-out
party _ this time in Las Vegas. While many 22-year-olds sweat job
interviews at their college placement offices, Faulkner and Bullock
hold the reins of CI Host, an Internet services company with 65
workers and a client base that has almost doubled since July. Of
16,000 Web hosts worldwide, CI Host is routinely ranked among the
top five by three ratings firms. Its major clients include the

the continuous stream of teen fare at the local megaplex, it seems

`DEAR HOME' WOUNDS THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DEAR HOME: LETTERS FROM WWII 
Produced and written by: Alison Guss, Christina Lowery, Molly
Thompson 
On: The History Channel 
Date: Thursday at 8 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Impossible as it sounds, in the space of an hour, the History
Channel manages to present a deeply personal and memorably
affecting summary of World War II. The vehicle, a documentary as
unpretentious as it is economical, is called ``Dear Home: Letters
From WWII,'' airing Thursday at 8 p.m. I can't recommend it highly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   It is simple in concept, low tech really, chronologically
ordered, and notable for its terse narration and black-and-white
images. It is woven from words, mostly of men, written home as they
trained for, fought, and won the war; as they waited for eruptions
of combat and, later, as they waited, by then often profoundly
changed by their wartime experience, to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Even single sentences, voiced over images that sometimes include
the letter-writer and even the recipient, can be surprisingly
potent. Writing to his parents from boot camp, a 15-year-old boy
who lied about his age to join the Marines begs: ``Tell them the
truth about my age and get me out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a young Tennessean in combat in Italy writes of the
action as ``horrible beyond words. . . . The battlefield is the
saddest place I have ever been. Don't let anyone tell you the
wounded don't cry.'' His directness is typical of the
correspondence ``Dear Home'' draws on, and hearing it and letters
like it read simply, without unnecessary affect, can be emotionally
devastating. Writes a soldier staggered by the shells exploding
near him during the Normandy landing: ``I never screamed so much in
my life.'' He goes on to tell his brother not to pass this
admission on to their parents. A letter from a fighter pilot in the
Pacific to his parents begins by explaining that if they receive
it, it means he has died. ``Please don't let my going change your
life too much,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The archival footage in the film gains a powerful immediacy
through its association with these letters. Images that have become
so familiar that they seem like icons _ of wounded men, exhausted
soldiers having a smoke, combatants fighting through urban rubble _
suddenly reveal painfully real, sharply individualized instances of
suffering, boredom, fear.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, we are able to track the fortunes of individuals
as they correspond over a period of months or even years. One is
New York cartoonist George Rarey, whose letters to his wife, Betty
Lou, have a jaunty sort of intimacy and, among other things, reveal
a young artist searching for a style with which to present himself
both to his wife and to the world. He receives news of their
newborn son in the mail. He sends back his love. Then we learn he
was killed in action in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Home'' makes your heart swell and then breaks it. It
personalizes the experience of the war in such a way that you can't
forget it. Out of its humble resources, ``Dear Home'' fashions
something far more valuable, and memorable, than ``Saving Private
Ryan.''

 &HT;    UTILITIES PUSH POWER PLANT RIDER
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spokesmen for the electric power industry and
environmentalists continued to disagree Wednesday over the effect a
one-paragraph rider would have on the government's air pollution
lawsuit against power plants in the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The unsigned paragraph, which has been circulating among
congressional offices this week, could be attached to any of
several federal appropriations bills still awaiting final action.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to say that a suit by the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Justice Department charging seven utilities with
massive violations of the Clean Air Act since the 1970s would have
no effect on continued repair and maintenance at the plants where
the pollution allegedly originated.
</P>
<P>
   The suit charged that the seven companies updated and expanded
32 coal-fired power plants that had been exempt from the Clean Air
Act since the 1970s because Congress had assumed they would be
phased out. As a result, EPA Administrator Carol Browner charged,
the companies have been violating the law to the tune of millions
of tons of air pollution every year for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rider would give the companies permission to
continue to operate and maintain the plants while courts were
hearing the government lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry initiative, which we support,'' said Buddy
Eller, a spokesman for the Southern Co. in Atlanta, one of the
seven defendants in the EPA suit. ``We are simply seeking
legislation that would allow utilities to perform routine
maintenance and repair.''
</P>
<P>
   By environmental groups say the paragraph is a cleverly drafted
sneak attack on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond allowing the companies to perform ``routine maintenance''
on the plants, the language is written to give them amnesty against
civil or criminal penalities as long as the case is in court, said
David Hawkins, a senior attorney for the National Resources Defense
Council and a former assistant administrator of EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could tell their lawyers to just go to court and let the
meter run for ten years,'' said Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Six northeastern senators -- Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; James
Jeffords, R-Vt; Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and John Kerry, D-Mass -- issued
a joint statement saying they would oppose attaching the rider to
any appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   -- A group of industries and labor unions, led by the power
company trade association the Edison Electric Institute, wrote to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Minority
Leader Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, warning that the EPA
lawsuit threatened to interfere with ``routine maintenance
activities'' at the plants and calling for an unspecified
``legislative solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations signing the letter were the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the
American Agriculture Movement, the National Association of
Manufacturers, the National Mining Association, the Association of
American Railroads, the American Corngrowers Association and the
United Mineworkers of America.

the government promised when they enlisted and has not fulfilled.

 &HT;    CLINTON POSTPONES GREECE TRIP AMID ANTI-AMERICAN PROTESTS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - President Clinton said Wednesday he would postpone
and cut short a long-scheduled weekend visit to Greece, amid a
rising tide of violent Greek protests against the United States and
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the demonstrations by Greek ``communists'' and
``anarchists'' were largely in opposition to his leadership of
NATO's air war against Serbia last spring over the future of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were right, and I disagree with them,'' Clinton
told reporters at the White House. ``But the fact that they have
the right to free speech doesn't concern me.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt postponement, which Clinton said came at the request
of the Greek government, seemed only to reinforce Greece's image as
an unstable Western ally and NATO partner. It also may leave the
Greek government in a weaker position in talks over war-divided
Cyprus and other disputes with rival Turkey, where the president is
scheduled to spend five days, compared with less than 24 hours in
Greece, during his four-nation European trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damaging,'' Theodore Couloumbis, a professor of
international relations at the University of Athens, told the
Associated Press. ``We have not adjusted or updated our image to
today's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not know whether the anti-American
demonstrations had anything to do with the change. ``They might
have,'' he said. ``But I am not bothered about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials made clear that concerns over the
president's potential safety were behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a grave error to dismiss security concerns and
then potentially have a disaster on
</P>
<P>
   our hands,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters. ``We don't believe the Greek government has any interest
in allowing a security situation to develop which would pose risks
</P>
<P>
   to the president any more than our Secret Service does.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been scheduled to leave Friday evening for a weekend
state visit to Greece, kicking off an 11-day swing that would also
take him to neighboring Turkey, as well as Italy and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton scrubbed the weekend schedule, though, and is now slated
to leave Washington early Sunday for a flight directly to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans an abbreviated visit to Greece Nov. 19 and 20,
following a summit meeting in Istanbul with 53 of his counterparts
from European and former Soviet nations that belong to the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not degrading the trip to Athens,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The Greek government made the
determination that it would be more productive for us to come after
our stop in Turkey. And we certainly agree with their assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart, ``Hopefully it'll be a better environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impending visit has charged strong anti-American
currents within Greece, a NATO member that sits on the geographical
and ideological fringes of the U.S.-centered military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anti-American protests and demonstrations have prompted
U.S. diplomats to caution American visitors to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Many Greeks still hold the United States partly culpable for the
military regime that governed the ancient cradle of western
democracy from 1967-1974.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, a powerful bomb rocked an Athens store selling
Levi's jeans _ a symbol of American culture. Shots were also fired
at a Greek-American cultural institution. No one was injured in
either incident, the Associated Press reported from Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Greek governments have performed a tenuous balancing
act in trying to reconcile membership in the alliance with often
harsh domestic opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Relations were strained near the political breaking point last
spring, when Clinton led his NATO allies, Greece among them, into a
78-day bombing campaign against Serbia, which shares close
historical, cultural and political ties with Greece.

   GRAPEFRUIT-FORECAST _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The USDA dropped
its grapefruit forecast by 8 percent today, following a special
survey to determine how much damage Hurricane Irene inflicted.
About 46 million 85-pound boxes are now expected, down from 50
million. This should mean even better prices for grapefruit
growers. (Waresh, Palm Beach Post). 8-10.

   ENVIRONMENTAL-HEALTH _ ATLANTA _ Dezirae Bridges travels a lot
in her job as a Delta flight attendant. But the southwest Atlanta
woman noticed that she was always sick. Finally, she realized what
was happening. Her hotel room was making her sick. Bridges has
severe allergies and was reacting to the mold in the vents,
cleaning solutions and detergents used on the linens and towels.
The lodging industry is starting to respond to complaints from

and US Franchise Systems, are offering allergy-free rooms. (Poole,

   TURNERIV _ This is not the first time Teddy Turner has tried to
make a name for himself independent of his father. He nearly went
bankrupt earlier this decade, spending much of a
multimillion-dollar trust fund trying to turn his love of
professional sailboat racing _ a passion he shares with his father
_ into a business. That failure taught Turner a tough lesson.
``When I was younger I felt a lot more drive to compete with Ted,''
says Turner, who often refers to his father by his first name.
``Now I don't see any sense in it. Today I want to take what he's
given me and move forward.''(Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   FANS-EMOTIONS _ WACO, Texas _ The professional football players
who dot television screens every Sunday at sports bars and in
living rooms across the country are interested in delivering
knockout blows, not Emmy-winning performances. Their goal is to
outscore the other team, not act out juicy plots. But some
researches say the drama of a game's outcome can seriously affect
how some fans, especially men, feel. Many researchers agree that
serious fan interest in sports has increased in the last 10 years.
The reasons vary, they say, but one predominant fact is that
watching and following sports of all kinds is easier now with the
proliferation of television stations devoted solely to sports
programming. (O'Brien, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

the fight were later reprimanded for their actions. The judging in

   BOX-ARCHDEACON-COLUMN _ LAS VEGAS _ As Evander Holyfield and

the ring count begins to sound too much like a death knell. Even

   FANS-EMOTIONS _ WACO, Texas _ The professional football players
who dot television screens every Sunday at sports bars and in
living rooms across the country are interested in delivering
knockout blows, not Emmy-winning performances. Their goal is to
outscore the other team, not act out juicy plots. But some
researches say the drama of a game's outcome can seriously affect
how some fans, especially men, feel. Many researchers agree that
serious fan interest in sports has increased in the last 10 years.
The reasons vary, they say, but one predominant fact is that
watching and following sports of all kinds is easier now with the
proliferation of television stations devoted solely to sports
programming. (O'Brien, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    EDS: Runs with TURNER-SIDE-COX
 &HT;    Ted Turner tours South Africa
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ Ted Turner, who could have been anywhere in
the world he wanted to be, knelt beside a metal box on the ground
of southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   He turned a key _ and a few hundred feet across the scrub, a
land mine exploded, shooting a plume of dirt into the air and a
startling shock wave through the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based businessman and founder of CNN was not just
playing games. Eager to learn the details of this demining program
_ a joint project of the United Nations and the Mozambican
government _ he peppered Jacky D'Almeida, the former Mozambican
army officer who heads it, with questions.
</P>
<P>
   How much did it cost to train each mine-sniffing dog? $25,000?
Why train them in the United States? Why not train them here, where
it would cost less?
</P>
<P>
   Turner and his wife, actress Jane Fonda, had come to southern
Africa for a meeting of the board of the U.N. Foundation, the
organization created to disburse his donation of $1 billion over 10
years to U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone under the impression that Turner just wrote out a big
check and walked away feeling good about himself has not seen
Turner in action. He is totally engaged in the process of deciding
which grant proposals to approve, and in shaping the kinds of
projects that he thinks are likely to achieve concrete, visible
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligent philanthropy, like anything that's intelligent, is
hard work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boar of Turner's foundation had come to southern Africa at
the invitation of one of its members, Graca Machel, the former
first lady of Mozambique and current wife of Nelson Mandela, the
former president of South Africa. Next year, board members will
hold one of their meetings in Brazil; another member, Ruth Cardoso,
is that country's first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The board began its meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, and
finished up in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, awarding $51
million to various projects, many of which were designed to improve
the health of children around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then Turner and other board members set about educating
themselves more fully about the problems of Mozambique and the way
that U.N. projects work _ or fail to work _ in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Different U.N. agencies have historically had trouble working
together, much less planning coordinated assaults on various
problems. But U.N. staffers in Mozambique seemed to have gotten the
message that Turner's U.N. Foundation is not interested in funding
projects that do not involve several agencies working in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of several U.N. agencies held a joint briefing
for Turner and the other board members in which they stressed that
agency representatives met together regularly and worked to develop
joint priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting dwelt heavily on AIDS, which, it is projected, will
kill by the year 2030 half of all Mozambicans who are now 15 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   After the presentation, the first questions came from Turner, a
man uninterested in action plans or commitments by government
ministers to hold high-level conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is prophylactic use or condom use only 2 percent when that
would do so much to stop the spread?'' he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied with the answer, that more education is needed,
Turner fired off more questions. Why is AIDS education so lacking?
Are condoms available everywhere? Are they free?
</P>
<P>
   Told that they were not universally available, Turner dropped
his hands to the table in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation is going to be absolutely devastated,'' he said.
``What kind of irresponsible government doesn't make it the No. 1
priority?''
</P>
<P>
   And how, he asked, could the U.N. come in and do anything
effective when the national will seemed to be absent?
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sea change,'' said Mark Stirling, a UNICEF
representative. ``The government has been very responsible in
responding now. It's unfortunate it has taken so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Machel, the country's former first lady and minister of
education, explained that until recently, Mozambique had been
preoccupied with reunification and repatriation following a civil
war. And because many refugees from the war went abroad to refugee
camps, contracted the HIV virus, then returned to their villages,
AIDS here is largely a problem of rural areas where people are
beyond the reach of television, radio, and even schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about putting a loud speaker on top of a car and driving
around?'' Turner asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda interjected that the problem is laced with issues of
gender and power. Women cannot force men to wear condoms, and are
sometimes even beaten to death for asking, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Turner, practical in the extreme, does not like to hear
why things cannot be done. He has no patience for theories or
bureaucracy. He seizes on solutions that are utterly simple and
undeniably true.
</P>
<P>
   If AIDS is an epidemic, condoms should be available. And if more
people picked up litter than tossed it around, the world would be a
cleaner place. Doing his part, he picks up trash wherever he sees
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the mine field, he reached for a piece of garbage on the
ground, but was reprimanded by D'Almeida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't touch anything!'' D'Almeida barked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm going to touch it,'' Turner said, stooping to pick
up the debris, ``and if I blow up, that's just too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A bundle of energy and expletives, Turner charges around saying
exactly what he thinks, oblivious to how he sounds or whom he might
offend.
</P>
<P>
   After the briefing on interagency cooperation, he saw Dr.
Georges Georgi, the United Nations Population Fund representative,
step outside and light a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a doctor and you're smoking?'' Turner bellowed.
``Dumbest thing I ever fing heard of!''
</P>
<P>
   Georgi made no reply as he was berated by one of the world's
most famous billionaires, and seemed to be trying to sink straight
into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst did not surprise those who knew Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very blunt,'' said Muhammad Yunus, a foundation board
member. ``I enjoy it very much because he's so transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yunus, who is the founder of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh and
pioneer of small ``microcredit'' loans to the world's poorest
women, said he was skeptical when he first heard that Turner was
giving $1 billion to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, I thought he was just a rich man,'' Yunus
said. But the Bangladeshi banker became a convert. ``He's a
fantastic human being,'' Yunus said. ``Very straightforward, very
focused. And he very quickly gets to the heart of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner is loud and brash, but also a man with deep feelings.
During a visit to a ward for premature infants at Maputo Central
Hospital, Fonda called him over to look at a baby with AIDS. The
baby, tiny and withered, weighed perhaps 2 pounds, a doctor said,
and lived in an incubator.
</P>
<P>
   Turner glanced at the baby for a moment, looked stricken, and
quickly left the room. The look of horror remained on his face for
some time afterward.
</P>
<P>
   While the work of the foundation is clearly important to Turner,
it may be even more so to his wife. Fonda has worked extensively on
issues related to adolescent girls and teen pregnancy in Georgia,
and she rained questions on both children and adults at the
hospital as they discussed sex education, condom use and AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different for me,'' she said. ``I have no more career. I
have no more things I used to do. I am totally focused on children
and adolescent pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of convincing young people in Mozambique to
change their sexual behavior reminded her, she said, of the
recently reported incidence of teen promiscuity and sexually
transmitted disease in Georgia 's Rockdale county.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are just the same,'' she said. ``For me, this is a
confirmation that there are some universal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   While the business of the foundation is hard work, Turner does
like to have fun. Sometimes, those around him say, he seems like a
little boy.
</P>
<P>
   On a bus trip to one of the board's site visits, he suddenly
came up with a trivia question: ``How many women have been first
lady of two countries?''
</P>
<P>
   Machel, who has been first lady of both Mozambique and South
Africa, looked perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two,'' Turner said. ``Graca Machel and Helen of Troy. Of
course, Graca could still make it three.''
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of days earlier, in a game park in KwaZulu-Natal
province in South Africa, according to staffers who were there,
Turner was ebullient as he cruised through a game preserve, calling
greetings from his open land rover to tourists in other cars.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of carloads of people made no response and looked
at him strangely, perhaps because they did not speak English,
Turner greeted the next carload of people by calling out, ``Hey,
have you seen the white whale?''
</P>
<P>
   Without a pause, a large women in a white T-shirt stood up in
the other vehicle and called back, ``Here I am!'' _ much to the
delight of everyone present.
</P>
<P>
   But the work of the foundation itself, Turner said, cannot be
described as fun. It is serious: It involves death and illness,
AIDS and land mines, child mortality and premature babies.
</P>
<P>
   But he could be doing anything in the world he wants and, among
his other activities, he has chosen this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm doing my part,'' he said, ``and that's a
wonderful feeling.''

 &HT;    EDS: RUNS WITH TURNER-COX
 &HT;    TED TURNER Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique _ Jouncing over dirt roads in a bus to a
field of land mines in Mozambique, Atlanta billionaire Ted Turner
shared his views on living full _ and not dying alone. The
conversation with Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Don
Melvin this week focused on Turner's trip to southern Africa, his
$1 billion donation to the United Nations and his efforts to
persuade other wealthy people to donate to similar causes:
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm talking about is making an investment in the future
of humanity, and how much joy it gives you. You feel better about
yourself when you're generous rather than when you're stingy.
Usually stingy people aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good example is that movie, ``Citizen Kane.'' There he
was, by himself, no wife, no nothing _ stinker! When he died,
nobody gave a damn. One of his employees came in and pulled a sheet
over him and nobody was there. I don't want to die like that _ all
alone, nobody there to mourn your passing. You know, gotta hire
your pall-bearers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:You could be doing whatever you want to do. Why do you choose
this? Are you having fun at it?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't know if fun is the right word. I think it's the right
thing to do. I think that with wealth and privilege comes
responsibility. I was always taught that, by my school, by my
parents, and I thought by my society.
</P>
<P>
   I made a lot of money out in the world. I just figured that with
so many problems out there in the world, why not? I'd been doing
already a lot philanthropy in the United States, primarily. But the
needs are so great out here in the world and there's so little
being done.
</P>
<P>
   The world is so interconnected that every day it seems to
shrink, with the Internet, global satellite communication and jet
travel. So the problems here are our problems. We have only one
atmosphere over the earth. Global warming is a global problem.
Depletion of ocean fisheries is a global problem. Nuclear weapons
are everybody's problem, because if there's a major nuclear
exchange, virtually everybody's going to die.
</P>
<P>
   We're in an interconnected world, and those congressmen that we
have in the United States who think that we can just pull up the
drawbridge and survive and prosper while the rest of the world
around us is in misery are absolutely wrong. It's spaceship earth.
We all are going to survive or none of us are, at the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Let's take away the word ``fun,'' but is it fulfilling work?
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, when you get over here and look at how dire the
circumstances are, it's a little bit overwhelming. But you do the
best you can. And yes it is satisfying because, you know, at least
we're trying. We're in the game. It's like the (Atlanta) Braves _
they didn't win the World Series, but they were there.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Tell me about the advantages of having the meeting here in
southern Africa rather than every single time in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A:Graca Machel is the former first lady of Mozambique and South
Africa, so that's why we came here. And Africa gets a higher
percentage of our funds than any other region. After that, Asia and
Central and South America. But the needs are the greatest here;
that's why we came here first. And it's really going to be good for
us to see what the problems and opportunities are first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How much have you traveled in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   A:This is only my third trip to Africa. It's not a place I've
really spent a whole lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I was watching the meeting yesterday. You seem to really be
interested in practical results. People are telling you about their
action plans and how their action plans are going to be
implemented, and you want to know why aren't the condoms free and
why aren't they out there.
</P>
<P>
   A:'Cause you know I've got a common-sense practical
approach.That's how I got CNN. It's my nature. It's that old
American can-do spirit. It sounded to me like it was a bunch of
excuses. And it is, because they've been in denial about it. At the
beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, a lot of our
establishment looked the other way, didn't tackle it head-on, which
is always the best way to handle a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Early cancer can be cured, and that's true of problems in
business or problems in your relationship or with your wife _ go to
counseling right away. If you have a problem, recognize it, face it
and then deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It's also not your nature, I gather, to just give some money,
say, ``Hey, you guys are the experts, I'm writing a check,'' and
then figure you've done your part.
</P>
<P>
   A:It's very, very hard to get a complete accounting. But we're
doing the best that we can. We don't want the money to be wasted or
embezzled, just like we don't want our tax money in the States to
be wasted or embezzled or inefficiently used, but we know that a
lot of it is.
</P>
<P>
   We can quit funding operations if we know that there's fraud or
embezzlement or waste.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How come you took off on that guy who was smoking?
</P>
<P>
   A:We're spending billions of dollars to combat smoking and that
guy was in the health area. My father died from smoking cigarettes.
He ended up killing himself; he had emphysema. It's just, how that
crap's still with us? Like asbestos, they don't use that anymore,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Q:How, overall, do you think the U.N. Foundation is going?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think it's going great. I feel like I'm doing my part, and
that's a wonderful feeling. Who wants to be an old Scrooge, right?
All by yourself, lonesome with all your money?
</P>
<P>
   Q:How's it going in terms of persuading other rich people to
become donors?
</P>
<P>
   A:My father always said, if you want to make money, don't try
and get it from the super-rich. The super-rich got rich by not
spending.
</P>
<P>
   And also the super-rich are so busy working to try and be the
richest that they don't have any time. It is work. Intelligent
philanthropy, like anything that's intelligent, is hard work.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an obligation. It's your money; do whatever you want to
with it. If you want to make a big pile of it and burn it, you can
do it.
</P>
<P>
   But what I'm talking about is making an investment in the future
of humanity, and how much joy it gives you. You feel better about
yourself when you're generous rather than when you're stingy.
Usually stingy people aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   Another good example is that movie, ``Citizen Kane.'' There he
was, by himself, no wife, no nothing _ stinker! When he died,
nobody gave a damn. One of his employees came in and pulled a sheet
over him and nobody was there. I don't want to die like that _ all
alone, nobody there to mourn your passing. You know, gotta hire
your pall-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to get (the super-rich) to give. But Gates has now
put $17 billion. And he's written me and said, ``Ted, you helped
call this to my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Buffett says: ``Well, I'm providing a lot of employment
for people.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``That's exactly right, Warren, you are. But you could
also, you know, you got $30 billion or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said, ``Ted, I'm leaving every penny I have, except a
little bit to my kids, to population progress.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Warren, you're in great health. You could live 20 more
years. There will be 2 billion more people. Well, how 'bout a
little bit of it now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I just can't do it. I need every penny.''
</P>
<P>
   I think what Warren wants to do is be the richest man in the
world. There's nothing wrong with having a list of who's the
richest. But they ought to have a list somewhere of who the biggest
givers are, because a lot of these people just want to get on some
kind of list. But several magazines now have published a list of
the biggest givers, and it's just _ where are you on that list?
</P>
<P>
   When I made the first $200 million donation to my foundation
(the Turner Foundation, which does domestic philanthropy), my hand
shook because I was taking myself out of the race for the richest
man. At that time I put about 15, 18 percent of what I had _ gave
that away over a two or three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   And then, when I committed that billion dollars (to the U.N.
Foundation), I was worth 3. So that was 33 percent. Thirty-three
and 18 _ I gave away half of what I had in a five-year period. To
give away half in a five-year period is a significant amount.
That's not tithing.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Overall, do you enjoy being wealthy?
</P>
<P>
   A:Sure! That's a sign of success. I didn't start out to be
fabulously wealthy. I started out like everybody else; I wanted to
be a success. I wanted to be able to afford to educate my children.
I wanted to be able to own my own home. And I wanted enough to be
able to not be afraid of retirement, to have enough stashed away to
have a decent life.

OWNERS MAY CRY FOUL BUT BASEBALL ENDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mike Marshall, one of the dominant relief
pitchers of the 1970s, once produced a college paper entitled,
``Baseball Is An Ass.'' There was no sex to speak of in the paper,
and the plot dragged a bit at the beginning and end and really
stalled in the middle, but as history it was unassailable, and its
predictive elements are still the talk of Michigan State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the developments of the last several days in
the grand old scam. Shawn Green is now a Dodger, and will be paid
$14 million per season to be so.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not why baseball is an ass.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, one of the most productive hitters of this
decade, was traded from one team that said it can't afford him, the
Texas Rangers, to another team that says it can't afford him, the
Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not why baseball is an ass, either.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. says he wants to be traded from Seattle to a
team closer to his home and family in Orlando, Fla., but he doesn't
want to be traded to either of the teams closest to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. You're still cold.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball writers and broadcasters who gathered at the general
managers' meetings in Laguna Niguel, Calif., where the Green trade
happened and the Griffey rumors grow exponentially, are worried
again that the game's richest owners are pulling away from its
near-rich, sort-of-rich, and pretty damned wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   That is why baseball is an ass. Because after two generations of
people complaining about other people's spending habits, we still
don't get it. And we almost surely never will.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Green is just today's fresh menu item. By moving to Los
Angeles, he has now guaranteed himself riches beyond his wildest
fantasies, and the agony of playing for the Dodgers, the team that
never met an excuse it couldn't use.
</P>
<P>
   And Griffey is just the latest example of a guy who has decided
to upgrade to higher ground. True, his stated excuse for wanting
out of Seattle is lame on lame with a side of lame, but who still
believes what athletes say about their motivations?
</P>
<P>
   What is less excusable is the vat of crocodile tears being shed
for the state of the game, as though the current imbalance toward
the rich were something new and pernicious.
</P>
<P>
   It surely isn't new. The rich have always done better than the
poor when the issue is buying talent, and the only thing that has
changed has been the identity of the rich guy in question.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, the Kansas City Royals were the most
profligate team in baseball. Ten years ago, it was the Oakland A's.
Five years ago, it was the Toronto Blue Jays. Now it's the Dodgers
and the Baltimore Orioles. The Pittsburgh Pirates have had their
turn; so have the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees have been there forever, but only now have
figured out that it doesn't hurt to have a brain, too _ as opposed
to the Dodgers and Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   So what we're talking about here is not the ability to pay, but
the willingness. If the same teams were always doing the buying and
the winning, then you'd have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   And if the same teams were always crying poverty and
hopelessness, we'd have had some bankruptcies by now. And that
would really be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the problem that we do have is the general inability to
understand that when baseball people claim impending doom, they are
either lying or whining, unpleasant traits in 5-year-olds and
downright repellent in moneyed adults.
</P>
<P>
   The problems baseball owners have are all about themselves. They
always play for the short dollar, which is why they have expanded
beyond their means in the last decade. They complain about
competition when what they really care about is finding someone who
will build a stadium free and clear while letting them keep the
parking and hot dog money. They complain about the players when
their real problem is their incompatibility with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, Shawn Green thinks he was anonymous in Toronto but
has no idea how easy it is to remain out of sight and out of mind
in Southern California. It's still mind over matter in baseball,
and money is just the tool that separates those who want to win
from those who can take or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   This was true 25 years ago when free agency began, and it is
true today. That so many people still don't understand that after
all this time is not why baseball is an ass.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is an ass because for all the disingenuous and
repetitive bleating about haves and have-nots, it thrives despite
all the obituaries delivered on its behalf. Baseball is an ass
because its most ardent defenders still don't know the difference
between a position paper and an obituary.

WHAT MAKES COUPLES FALL APART
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, single guys and gals: Marie Claire magazine _ which also
reveals that  &UR; Demi Moore &LR; 's intuition adviser wears size 2 jeans _
provides a series of educational interviews with gents who took out
women they never called again:
</P>
<P>
   After ordering sashimi in a restaurant, one woman ``pulled out a
scale from her backpack and weighed the fish.'' When another fellow
went to pick up his date, ``first thing she did was show me her
extensive shoe collection. Then she talked about her shoes the
entire night.''
</P>
<P>
   A vegetarian woman gave her date graphic details about the
slaughter of all the food he was about to order.
</P>
<P>
   After one date went to the rest room during dinner, ``she
accidentally sat down at another man's table. ... The guy didn't
look anything like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a guy who ``likes women who party'' wasn't turned on by
a woman who was drunk when he picked her up at her workplace, a
bar. ``Later, she vomited in my car.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In other relationship news, the Washington Post reports
that  &UR; Callista Bisek &LR; ,  &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR; 's girlfriend, was questioned
this week by Newtie's lawyers in matters having to do with his
divorce (which the Post calls ``the marital equivalent of the
Microsoft suit''). Asked about gifts bestowed upon her by her
suitor, Bisek enumerated:
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he gave her one Christmas CD and one of  &UR; Johann &LR; 
 &UR; Strauss &LR;  music, and a book about  &UR; Pope John Paul II &LR; ; this year, he
gave her a pearl ring, golf clubs and some luggage.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S: Capitol Records has announced that  &UR; Bonnie Raitt  &LR; and
 &UR; Michael O'Keefe  &LR; are divorcing; and  &UR; Jerry Hall  &LR; told the British
magazine Tatler that she and  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR;  had managed a ``perfect
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT MAKES COUPLES STAY TOGETHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Washington say they can watch
newlyweds discussing a disagreement for three minutes, and predict
whether they'll stay together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest lesson to be learned from this study,'' said
psychologist  &UR; John Gottman &LR; , ``is that the way couples begin a
discussion about a problem _ how you present an issue and how your
partner responds to you _ is absolutely critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to bring up problems 80 percent of the times. The
wife in a couple headed for trouble usually begins the discussion
with criticism (``You're lazy'') than with a complaint (``You
didn't help with the dishes yesterday''). In problem marriages, the
husband's response is purely defensive; in more stable marriages,
the husband doesn't raise the level of negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wife doesn't know how to present a problem to her husband
and the husband doesn't know how to respond,'' researcher
 &UR; Sybil Carre &LR;  said. ``What typically happens,'' Gottman said, ``is
one person reaches out to the other to get the partner's interest
and it just falls flat. The basic problem is emotional
connectedness, and people are just asking their partner to `show me
you love me.' Many people live in an emotional desert.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEEING IS BELIEVING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don Hewitt &LR; , the ``60 Minutes'' producer who appears eager to
bow to corporate pressure in ``The Insider,'' told the New York
Post about his emotional reaction to the movie's making only $7
million in its first weekend. He said he hadn't seen the film,
didn't intend to, and ``I'm very happy it went into the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Daily News reported yesterday that Hewitt was spotted
watching the movie at a theater in East Hampton last weekend. A
spokesman told that paper that the Daily News had misunderstood his
first statement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANOTHER DOUGLAS CAUSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before  &UR; Michael Douglas &LR;  takes the Davies Hall stage Monday to
raise money for UCSF's Brain Tumor Research Center, he'll attend a
reception for the Ploughshares Fund, a proponent of disarmament.
When friends at a recent birthday party in New York asked Douglas _
who is a UN Messenger of Peace _ his favorite charity, he named the
Ploughshares Fund.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Danny DeVito &LR; 's been added to the list of stars who will
participate in the UCSF event. Dinner's sold out, but tickets to
the performance are still available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``With a book, you have a great starting point, this rich,
extremely undiluted world. ... If I had the book too close to me,
I'd be tempted to copy every characteristic and stay too close to
the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Director/screenwriter Anthony Minghella, telling the Los
Angeles Times that threw away the novel for his forthcoming movie,
``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''

 &HT;    UPS raises $5.4 billion in public offering
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street enthusiastically welcomed United Parcel Service to
the ranks of public companies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the Atlanta-based delivery giant jumped in the first
day of trading, following a record-setting $5.47 billion initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   UPS shares, priced at $50 in the offering, shot up to $65 within
minutes of the start of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
They closed at $67.75.
</P>
<P>
   The offering included 109.4 million new Class B shares,
representing about 10 percent of UPS' private stock. The rest
remains in the hands of employees and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors scooped up big chunks of what is seen as
the newest blue chip stock. By the end of the day trading volume
totaled nearly 78 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a company with a household name, and you just don't get
an IPO from one of them very often,'' said Jeffrey Pittsburg of the
research firm Pittsburg Institutional.
</P>
<P>
   UPS Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Kelly _ one of several top
executives who saw the value of their stock jump by millions of
dollars in the IPO _ rang the opening bell at the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a historic day for UPS and we're very pleased with
the response,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburg and other analysts said investors' embrace of UPS
stemmed both from its long history of profitability and recent
investments in electronic commerce and supply chain management.
That makes it a quasi-technology stock, they said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS is ``a great e-commerce play,'' said Kunal Kapoor, an
analyst at Morningstar, the mutual fund rating firm. But he also
advised caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with most good things, UPS' shares are commanding a
premium,'' Kapoor said. ``Based on the IPO price, the stock sells
at close to 40 times its trailing 12-month earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapoor said that's about twice the multiple for FDX Corp.,
parent of archrival FedEx. He also noted that the core of UPS's
business, domestic ground delivery, remains vulnerable to economic
swings, rising fuel prices and labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
   For small investors who want to own UPS stock, Kapoor suggested,
``it may be worthwhile to wait a little until the euphoria dies
down. Conversely, you might give serious thought to the
much-cheaper shares of FDX.'' FDX shares closed Wednesday at $42.81
1/4, down $1.18 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   UPS said the offering was aimed at creating a class of public
stock that can be used as currency in future acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced the planned offering in July, then saw the
Dow Jones average lose 20 percent in an early fall correction. UPS
also endured negative publicity after the U.S. Tax Court ruled it
could owe up to $1 billion in back taxes. But in the end neither
event dampened investor enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   About 125,000 UPS employees own stock and realized big paper
gains in the IPO. However, most stock is in the hands of executives
and managers. Hourly workers have only been able to buy stock since
1995, at a price set quarterly by the board. Prior to the public
offering the internal price was $25.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   UPS spokesmen said the company had no information on average
employee holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But Kelly, Chief Financial Officer Robert Clanin and two retired
CEOs on UPS' board have the most stock, according to a company
regulatory filing on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   It showed Kelly with 414,344 shares, worth $10.6 million prior
to the offering and $28.3 million at Wednesday's closing price.
Clanin owns 420,018 shares worth $10.7 million before the offering
and $28.6 million afterward. Retired Chairman/CEO John Rogers owns
901,942 shares, worth $23 million before the offering and $61.5
million afterward. Retired Chairman/CEO Kent ``Oz'' Nelson owns
540,896 shares, worth $13.8 million before the offering and $36.9
million afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Under securities rules, neither executives nor other employees
can begin selling stock on the public market for at least six
months.
</P>
<P>
   However, UPS next month plans to use proceeds of the public
offering to launch a tender offer for up to 10 percent of stock
owned by employees, giving them a chance to partially cash in on
the new market value.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly downplayed the paper gains by top executives, saying the
offering ``wasn't about money.'' He added: ``Whether you have $1
million or $2 million, or whatever the number is, I'm not sure that
makes any difference in the way you run the company.''

COURT WEIGHS HOW MUCH PROTECTION 1ST AMENDMENT GIVES STRIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nude dancing may be protected as a form of free
speech, but that shouldn't prevent cities from banning strip clubs
if those bars lead to crimes such prostitution and fights, the
Supreme Court was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving an Erie, Pa., strip club called
``Kandyland,'' the high court heard arguments on whether the city
violated the First Amendment's freedom of expression provision when
it passed a law banning nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar's presence resulted in house prices falling, increased
traffic and more crime,'' Gregory A. Karle, city solicitor for
Erie, told the high court. ``This law was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Weston, a Los Angeles lawyer representing the club's
owner, who recently sold the establishment, said the city never
provided any studies showing that the strip club caused additional
crime in the area and that the law was designed solely to stop nude
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for a way, any way, to shut down my client's
club; so they came up with this excuse,'' Weston said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision in this case could have a major impact on
the ability of cities and counties to ban activities they find
objectionable by requiring them to prove that the activities are
causing negative effects on neighborhoods and crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Erie City Council announced that it was going after
live nude dancing by passing a public indecency ordinance, which
prohibited ``knowingly or intentionally appearing in a state of
nudity for the purpose of arousing anyone other than the person's
spouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The law allowed two theatrical companies to continue with their
1994 productions of ``Hair'' and ``Equus,'' both of which contained
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The Erie council patterned the law after an Indiana public
decency statute that banned all public nudity. That law was upheld
by the Supreme Court in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Erie law went into effect, Kandyland's owner, Nick
Panos, challenged the statute, arguing that it would violate his
dancers' right to free expression guaranteed under the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, a state trial court in Erie ruled the law was
``too broad'' and therefore unconstitutional. Four years later, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed, saying that the law was not
intended to stem crime but to ``suppress a disfavored form of free
expression _ nude dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The state high court said the city could have imposed less
burdensome requirements on nude dancing, such as limiting the hours
of operation, establishing buffer zones between bar patrons and
dancers, and enforcing existing laws against sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's arguments, Justice David Souter suggested to
Karle that the law was a ``value-based'' judgment of the purpose of
nudity. ``You say a theater production of `Equus' is all right, but
bar room dancing isn't,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens also said the law would be difficult
to enforce. ``Suppose someone was nude in public for the sole
purpose of getting an all-around sun tan. Would that be legal?'' he
asked
</P>
<P>
   Karle answered: ``It would because the person wouldn't be
attempting to arouse others.''
</P>
<P>
   Several justices questioned attorney Weston's contention that
the law was too broad to comply with the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislatures frequently target certain activities but write
the law broadly,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist said.

WHAT MAKES COUPLES FALL APART

 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, single guys and gals: Marie Claire magazine _ which also
reveals that  &UR; Demi Moore &LR; 's intuition adviser wears size 2 jeans _
provides a series of educational interviews with gents who took out
women they never called again:
</P>
<P>
   After ordering sashimi in a restaurant, one woman ``pulled out a
scale from her backpack and weighed the fish.'' When another fellow
went to pick up his date, ``first thing she did was show me her
extensive shoe collection. Then she talked about her shoes the
entire night.''
</P>
<P>
   A vegetarian woman gave her date graphic details about the
slaughter of all the food he was about to order.
</P>
<P>
   After one date went to the rest room during dinner, ``she
accidentally sat down at another man's table. ... The guy didn't
look anything like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a guy who ``likes women who party'' wasn't turned on by
a woman who was drunk when he picked her up at her workplace, a
bar. ``Later, she vomited in my car.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In other relationship news, the Washington Post reports
that  &UR; Callista Bisek &LR; ,  &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR; 's girlfriend, was questioned
this week by Newtie's lawyers in matters having to do with his
divorce (which the Post calls ``the marital equivalent of the
Microsoft suit''). Asked about gifts bestowed upon her by her
suitor, Bisek enumerated:
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he gave her one Christmas CD and one of  &UR; Johann &LR; 
 &UR; Strauss &LR;  music, and a book about  &UR; Pope John Paul II &LR; ; this year, he
gave her a pearl ring, golf clubs and some luggage.
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S: Capitol Records has announced that  &UR; Bonnie Raitt  &LR; and
 &UR; Michael O'Keefe  &LR; are divorcing; and  &UR; Jerry Hall  &LR; told the British
magazine Tatler that she and  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR;  had managed a ``perfect
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT MAKES COUPLES STAY TOGETHER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Washington say they can watch
newlyweds discussing a disagreement for three minutes, and predict
whether they'll stay together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest lesson to be learned from this study,'' said
psychologist  &UR; John Gottman &LR; , ``is that the way couples begin a
discussion about a problem _ how you present an issue and how your
partner responds to you _ is absolutely critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to bring up problems 80 percent of the times. The
wife in a couple headed for trouble usually begins the discussion
with criticism (``You're lazy'') than with a complaint (``You
didn't help with the dishes yesterday''). In problem marriages, the
husband's response is purely defensive; in more stable marriages,
the husband doesn't raise the level of negativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wife doesn't know how to present a problem to her husband
and the husband doesn't know how to respond,'' researcher
 &UR; Sybil Carre &LR;  said. ``What typically happens,'' Gottman said, ``is
one person reaches out to the other to get the partner's interest
and it just falls flat. The basic problem is emotional
connectedness, and people are just asking their partner to `show me
you love me.' Many people live in an emotional desert.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEEING IS BELIEVING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don Hewitt &LR; , the ``60 Minutes'' producer who appears eager to
bow to corporate pressure in ``The Insider,'' told the New York
Post about his emotional reaction to the movie's making only $7
million in its first weekend. He said he hadn't seen the film,
didn't intend to, and ``I'm very happy it went into the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Daily News reported yesterday that Hewitt was spotted
watching the movie at a theater in East Hampton last weekend. A
spokesman told that paper that the Daily News had misunderstood his
first statement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANOTHER DOUGLAS CAUSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before  &UR; Michael Douglas &LR;  takes the Davies Hall stage Monday to
raise money for UCSF's Brain Tumor Research Center, he'll attend a
reception for the Ploughshares Fund, a proponent of disarmament.
When friends at a recent birthday party in New York asked Douglas _
who is a UN Messenger of Peace _ his favorite charity, he named the
Ploughshares Fund.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.  &UR; Danny DeVito &LR; 's been added to the list of stars who will
participate in the UCSF event. Dinner's sold out, but tickets to
the performance are still available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``With a book, you have a great starting point, this rich,
extremely undiluted world. ... If I had the book too close to me,
I'd be tempted to copy every characteristic and stay too close to
the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Director/screenwriter Anthony Minghella, telling the Los
Angeles Times that threw away the novel for his forthcoming movie,
``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''

 &HT;    Pop tests of candidates trivialize foreign affairs
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You get the feeling this could quickly become a pattern: George
W. doesn't know about it, Al makes a joke about it, and no matter
how important whatever it is may be, we forget about it in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Alert to the likelihood of a copycat gotcha, Vice President Al
Gore, with tongue in cheek, quickly dropped a string of foreign
leader's names Monday when Don Imus, this era's answer to Lawrence
Spivak, tried to give him a foreign policy pop quiz similar to the
one which tripped up Texas Gov. George W. Bush last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was best for Gore to pass lightly over Bush's inability to
name the leaders of India, Pakistan and Chechnya, even if he is
better briefed on foreign affairs. These days anybody could make a
mistake. But the matter goes by so easily, the impression that
remains is that the nuclear standoff on the Indian subcontinent or
China's designs on Taiwan may not really be such a big deal, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   It was easier to make a political issue out of our relations
with India when the only two names a politician had to remember
were Gandhi and Nehru. The world has become a vastly more
complicated subject, little suited to the bland generalities of
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   These days when the candidates talk about foreign policy, they
are usually talking about different things.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer talks about China as the focal point for the moral
and political failures of the Clinton administration. Steve Forbes
denounces the ``kleptocrats'' in Russia for fleecing honest
American taxpayers while Gore looked past the problem. Pat Buchanan
goes all the way back to Berlin in the '30s to critique U.S.
involvement in foreign entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rattles off a lot of names, even when he isn't joking with
Imus.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush knows the foreign minister of Mexico, which may have
been a lame comeback when he mentioned it after the quiz was popped
on him, but it does say something about where he comes from and
what his priorities are. It's an increasingly important name to
know, incidentally.
</P>
<P>
   With no single framework for discussing foreign policy issues,
such as there was during the Cold War, they have largely become the
loose ends of the candidates' speeches, chosen to coordinate with
their domestic message.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign policy issues _ to cite one troubling example, the
murky civil war in Colombia, with its Vietnam overtones and
connection to the U.S. drug problem _ have been so far left off the
table.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the media's scrutiny remains at the pop-test level,
it's unlikely such matters will get any attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can fairly complain that he was the victim of a cheap shot
last week, but it should also be pointed out this is a campaign
that guards the media's access to the candidate jealously. How many
times can a candidate who's surrounded by bodyguards fall for an
ambush?

COLD WAR WATER OFFERS TASTE OF THE PAST  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WALES, Fla. _ The Cuban Missile Crisis is a distant memory,
but Cold War enthusiasts can still get a taste of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Chalet Suzanne Foods Inc., the company that made soup for space
missions, is selling water canned in response to the 1962 crisis
that many feared would lead to a nuclear war between the United
States and Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The collector cans will sell for $15 each to raise money for the
Cold War Museum in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Carl and Vita Hinshaw, who also own Chalet Suzanne Restaurant
and Country Inn, were commissioned by a Tampa company 37 years ago
to can water, an essential ingredient in the official Nuclear
Attack Survival Kit. About 300 cases of water _ 12 cans per case _
of the 4,000 cases made remain.
</P>
<P>
   The cans, designed to Navy and NASA specifications, contain
water from the inn's well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy,'' Vita Hinshaw recalled Monday. ``We used a
special can that was lithographed instead of paper-labeled in case
anything happened to it. It had to be able to be frozen, so we left
a certain amount of space. It makes a click if you hit it with your
palm.''
</P>
<P>
   A tin plate seal ensured the cans would not rust and the water
would stay fresh indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tasted it recently, say it's as good as new.
``When we decided to sell it, we opened a can and drank it down,''
Hinshaw said. ``It was perfectly delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War Museum was founded by Gary Powers Jr., son of the
American U2 pilot shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 and
imprisoned as a spy. Cans of the Lake Wales water also will be sold
there.
</P>
<P>
   Hinshaw said the cans were being sold with certificates of
authenticity.

   LAKE WALES, Fla. _ The Cuban Missile Crisis is a distant memory,
but Cold War enthusiasts can still get a taste of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Chalet Suzanne Foods Inc., the company that made soup for space
missions, is selling water canned in response to the 1962 crisis
that many feared would lead to a nuclear war between the United
States and Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The collector cans will sell for $15 each to raise money for the
Cold War Museum in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Carl and Vita Hinshaw, who also own Chalet Suzanne Restaurant
and Country Inn, were commissioned by a Tampa company 37 years ago
to can water, an essential ingredient in the official Nuclear
Attack Survival Kit. About 300 cases of water _ 12 cans per case _
of the 4,000 cases made remain.
</P>
<P>
   The cans, designed to Navy and NASA specifications, contain
water from the inn's well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy,'' Vita Hinshaw recalled Monday. ``We used a
special can that was lithographed instead of paper-labeled in case
anything happened to it. It had to be able to be frozen, so we left
a certain amount of space. It makes a click if you hit it with your
palm.''
</P>
<P>
   A tin plate seal ensured the cans would not rust and the water
would stay fresh indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tasted it recently, say it's as good as new.
``When we decided to sell it, we opened a can and drank it down,''
Hinshaw said. ``It was perfectly delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War Museum was founded by Gary Powers Jr., son of the
American U2 pilot shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 and
imprisoned as a spy. Cans of the Lake Wales water also will be sold
there.
</P>
<P>
   Hinshaw said the cans were being sold with certificates of
authenticity.

   J. Crew Web Goof Results in Discount  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want a cashmere sweater from J. Crew for $18? For several hours
this week, J. Crew's Web site, www.jcrew.com, inadvertently listed
a $218 cashmere sweater for $18, leading several hundred e-shoppers
to quickly add the item to their digital shopping carts in hopes
that the pricing glitch would go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   J. Crew officials soon discovered the mistake on the site and
removed the item. But did the sly surfers who ordered the $18
sweater really get away with a $200 discount?
</P>
<P>
   For about 24 hours, that seemed to be the case. Then, the e-mail
message arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big mistake!'' said Emily Woods, chairwoman of J. Crew, in an
e-mail message to customers. ``I wish we could sell such an amazing
sweater for only $18. Our price mistake on your new cashmere zip
turtleneck probably went right by you, but rather than charge you
such a large difference, I'm writing to alert you that this item
has been removed from your recent order.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is allowing customers who ordered the sweater at $18
to reorder it for $118.80 to $130.80 depending on the size through
a special address on the Web site. But that plan could also run
into trouble because anyone who knows the address can buy the
sweater at the discount. &QL;

   CD-ROM Drive Maker Strives for a Quick Burn
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest must-have devices turning up in personal
computers is the recordable CD drive, or in the parlance of PC
mavens, a CD burner.
</P>
<P>
   Looking much like standard CD-ROM drives, the devices, which
usually can record both rewritable discs (CD-RW) and write-once
discs (CD-R), are a dependable way to make or copy audio CDs and
CD-ROMs or to back up computer files. The only drawback has been
speed; they do a slow burn.
</P>
<P>
   But Creative Labs says its latest drive is a relative speed
demon.
</P>
<P>
   Called the CD-RW Blaster 8432, the drive promises to record up
to 60 minutes' worth of sound (or 545 megabytes of data) in about
nine minutes or less, according to Creative Labs spokesmen who
announced the release of the new drive this week. That represents a
30 percent increase in speed over the company's earlier generation
of drives. The drive costs $299.99
</P>
<P>
   But those speeds can be achieved only in the drive's write-once
mode. Writing data onto rewritable discs, those that can be erased
and reused, is considerably slower. &QL;

   Lifetimes of Memories Preserved on CD-ROMs
</P>
<P>
   A new Internet company is betting its existence on a truism:
People like to talk about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Life.com, has recently released a CD-ROM called My
Life that encourages people to assemble their memories, thoughts
and long-held secrets into a multimedia memoir. My Life asks people
to select a electronic cards from 230 categories, like
``Creativity'' or ``As a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Each card poses questions that range from practical to probing.
One asks: ``What is the flat-out stupidest thing you have ever
done?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a lot of research to make the questions
interesting in and of themselves,'' said Kent Ertugrul, the
company's founder. Life.com, whose employees now number 60, spent
five years and $2.8 million coming up with 50,000 questions and
building the software around them, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Users can enter responses by typing them or recording them using
their computer's microphone or Webcam. The software also allows the
inclusion of scanned snapshots and home movies. For information
that is provided with dates, My Life creates timelines.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM, which is now available in stores and online at
www.life.com for $69.95, also enables people to publish their
memoirs to a password-protected Web site, so that relatives and
friends can participate or just take a look.
</P>
<P>
   While Ertugrul acknowledges that not everyone has the time, or
inclination, to log their life on a computer, he says he believes
that a market exists for people who want to be nudged toward
introspection _ or at least preserve their memories for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot out there that really resonates
emotionally,'' Ertugrul said. ``This is emotional. It's deeply
personal.'' &QL;

   Snippets to Remember: The Fall of the Wall
</P>
<P>
   Here's something the Internet didn't have a role in: the fall of
the Berlin Wall. But making up for lost time, the Web has an
abundance of sites that pay homage to the event, which occurred 10
years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   The National Archives and Records Administration has a small
exhibit on its Web site
(www.nara.gov/exhall/originals/kennedy.html) with a reproduction of
a handwritten cue card from President John F. Kennedy's ``Ich bin
ein Berliner'' speech near the wall on June 26, 1963, and a
typewritten card from President Reagan's 1987 address in which he
implored Mikhail Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A more personal look at the wall can be found at Chris De Witt's
Berlin Wall page
(www.appropriatesoftware.com/BerlinWall/welcome.html), which
includes essays and photographs by De Witt, a Briton. And The
Berliner Morgenpost has the sad tale of Chris Gueffroy at
(www.go-on.de/bm/international/inhalt/0499/wallvictim.html), the
wall's last victim, who was shot to death less than a year before
the wall came down. &QL;

   A Way to Check E-Mail Without Logging On
</P>
<P>
   Can't get enough e-mail? Tired of having to fire up the old PC
and modem every couple of hours at home just to check for new
messages? Notify Technology, based in San Jose, Calif., has
developed a device that lets you check for e-mail at a glance,
without logging on.
</P>
<P>
   The gadget, called the eView 100, connects to a telephone and
looks and works something like a Caller ID box. (In fact, in
addition to its e-mail functions, it will also provide Caller ID if
you have that service from the phone company.)
</P>
<P>
   The eView works with most e-mail accounts with an Internet
service provider or e-mail service (but it will not work with
systems that are behind firewalls). Users must first sign up at
www.visualgotmail.com for Notify Technology's Visual Got Mail
service.
</P>
<P>
   The Visual Got Mail service checks the user's e-mail accounts at
regular intervals; when it finds new messages, an amber light on
the device lights up and the e-mail headers are displayed on the
eView's display.
</P>
<P>
   The device and the Visual Got Mail service will be sold through
some service providers, with pilot programs expected to begin this
month. The eView will also be available through the company's Web
site beginning next month for $59.95, with a $4.95 monthly fee for
Visual Got Mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company is figuring that people will keep the device near
the kitchen phone so the whole family can watch for e-mail (it can
handle multiple accounts). Of course, if you want to read the body
of a message, you still have to fire up the old computer.
</P>
<P>
   New Web Service Offers Portable Bookmark Lists
</P>
<P>
   For regular Web users, browser lists of bookmarks or favorites
are personal bibliographies. Unlike lists on paper, unfortunately,
browser lists of Web addresses cannot easily be transferred between
computers, at the home and the office, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Blink.com is hoping to persuade users of multiple computers to
move their personal lists of greatest hits from their browsers to
Blink.com's Web-based service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as Hotmail for bookmarks,'' said Ross
Garon, the company's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   When a subscriber registers for Blink's advertising-supported
service, the company's software automatically copies the
subscriber's favorites list from the browser. Then, users of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser download a tiny screen icon
(the Blink Bar) that can be clicked on to add future entries. Users
of Netscape Navigator must use a slightly less convenient program
(the Blinker) that lurks in the background of the active screen.
</P>
<P>
   Blink's favorites lists can be organized into categories and can
include site descriptions. The lists can also be searched using
keywords. If they wish, users can also share their lists with
specific subscribers to the service or the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   And because Blink lists are accessible only with a password,
Garon said, they are more private than browser-based lists. &QL;

`MRS. BRADLEY MYSTERIES': DIANA RIGG AS DETECTIVE ARMED WITH
ONE-LINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Speedy Death'' has everything a comfortable British mystery
should have: Chayning Court, a country estate with an Upstairs and
Downstairs abounding in suspects or victims with Woodhousian names
like Alistair Bing, Bertie Philipson, Everard Mountjoy and Baxter
the Butler; weddings and funerals as required and lines like ``Have
you taken leave of your senses, boy?''; motives, financial and
romantic; weapons, including a gun, a knife and a bathtub;
prowlings in the night; shattered glass; eavesdropping, and a
worldly sleuth (abetted by an upwardly mobile chauffeur) who sees
everything and can tell a clue from a herring: ``The door unlocked
 &UR; and &LR;  the window opened?''
</P>
<P>
   So here's ``The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries,'' some 66 of which were
written by Gladys Mitchell, who died in 1983 after a career that
rivaled Agatha Christie's for prolific longevity. In the first of
her efforts to be celebrated by ``Mystery,'' her sleuth, Adela
Bradley, famous for catching the Bombay poisoner and the
blackmailer of Belgrave Square, is played by none other than Diana
Rigg, Madame Mystery herself. Dame Diana, in a designer's fantasy
of Jazz Age get-ups, turns in a stylish performance, marked by
asides to viewers about marriage (``one of those things it's best
to get over and done with early in life, like chicken pox'') and
other one-liners that distance her from the country-house dimwits.
</P>
<P>
   The case at hand, concocted in 1929, has to do with the death of
the aforementioned Mountjoy, who turns out not to be what he seems.
But then hardly anybody in this household is what he or she seems.
</P>
<P>
   Is Bertie a hero or a bounder? Is Eleanor a victim? Is Pamela a
gold digger? What about that torn-up check? And what are we to make
of that seemingly stolen necklace? You will not be astonished to
learn that, as Mrs. Bradley announces, ``Someone in this house''
pause ``is a murderer.'' (Nobody believes the butler did it.)
</P>
<P>
   The period production canters right along. The entire cast keeps
tongue in cheek even while dining and drinking, which is evidently
what inmates of those big houses mainly do or did. And the tunes,
circa ``You're the Cream in My Coffee,'' keep toes tapping when
they are not treading into forbidden bedrooms. While Mrs. Bradley
is sleuthing, the flappers and their dates occupy themselves by
showing off Charleston steps to ``Let's Misbehave.'' Be assured,
several of them need no such encouragement.

PROGRAMS THAT CAN TURN YOUR COMPUTER INTO A HOME RECORDING STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With Computer-Recording)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Top-of-the-line home-recording programs are generally priced
from $700 to $800, but most companies also offer cheaper and
somewhat less elaborate programs for beginners and midlevel users.
The prices listed here are suggested retail; store prices are often
significantly lower.
</P>
<P>
   A processor speed of about 200 megahertz is generally the
minimum necessary to begin experimenting with these programs. You
will also probably need at least 64 megabytes of RAM, as well as at
least a four- or five-gigabyte hard drive (mono audio files take up
about five megabytes for each minute) and a sound card specially
made for audio recording. To find out more about hard-disk
recording, Harmony Central (www.harmonycentral.com) is a good place
to start.
</P>
<P>
   CUBASE VST 4.1: Steinberg; $399; Power Macintosh and Windows 95
and 98.
</P>
<P>
   This midlevel version of Steinberg's flagship Cubase program is
particularly good for dance music and other loop-based genres: The
software supports a proprietary file format that allows rhythmic
loops to be easily stretched and chopped to match a song's tempo.
Cubase comes with a basic but good software synthesizer. Steinberg
also offers Cubasis AV ($99), a simplified program aimed at
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   LOGIC AUDIO SILVER: Emagic; $299; Power Macintosh and Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   This younger sibling of the Platinum and Gold versions of Logic
Audio is a powerful, fully featured recording program that includes
a wealth of multitrack audio and MIDI capabilities. The Logic Audio
programs are especially strong on plug-in effects; the Silver
version has 20, including chorus, flanger and tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   MICROLOGIC AV: Emagic; $99; Power Macintosh and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   This basic program allows you to record up to 16 tracks of
audio, experiment with MIDI and apply basic reverb, delay, chorus
and equalization.
</P>
<P>
   GUITAR STUDIO 2: Cakewalk; $249; Windows 95 and 98 and NT 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   With an interface modeled on an old multitrack cassette
recorder, this program includes many features especially for
guitarists, like a built-in tuner. A demonstration is available at
www.cakewalk.com.
</P>
<P>
   DIGI 001: Digidesign; $995; Power Macintosh 9600, G3 and G4.
</P>
<P>
   Digidesign, the maker of Pro Tools, recently unveiled this
impressive home version of the professional Pro Tools system.
Unlike the other systems reviewed here, Digi 001 includes a highly
versatile sound card with many built-in features.
</P>
<P>
   ACID PRO 2.0: Sonic Foundry; $399; Windows 95 and 98 and NT 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   This loop-based program is not really a full-blown recording
studio. Instead, it allows you to easily create complicated
dance-oriented music using prerecorded loops, plug-in effects and
your own original sounds. The software can do real-time scrunching
and stretching of files so that they match a set tempo or musical
key. A demo is downloadable from www.sonicfoundry.com.

 &HT;    Pillowtext to allow union vote
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANNAPOLIS, N.C. _ A union has prevailed in its quarter-century
battle to represent Fieldcrest Cannon workers in one of the South's
oldest and most labor-defiant textile towns.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldcrest's owner, Dallas-based Pillowtex Corp., said Wednesday
it dropped its objections to the vote by workers in June to be
represented by the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in December, UNITE and the towel-and-bedding
manufacturer will negotiate a collective bargaining agreement.
Union officials said they'll focus on pay and benefits, working
conditions and job security.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations will cover 5,000 workers in six Fieldcrest
Cannon factories here in Cabarrus County and adjacent Rowan County.
Talks also will cover the renewal of contracts for another 3,000
Fieldcrest workers represented by the union elsewhere in North
Carolina and in Virginia, Georgia and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Those Fieldcrest employees represent the nation's largest group
of unionized textile workers, said Bruce Raynor, the union's
secretary-treasurer. In Georgia, UNITE represents an estimated
1,000 Fieldcrest employees in Columbus, Macon and Hawkinsville, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in a symbolic moment for such historic rivals,
Raynor and Pillowtex CEO Chuck Hansen shook hands in a hotel
conference room amid cheering and crying factory workers wearing
red-white-and-blue UNITE caps and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials vowed to seek a collective bargainning agreement
that will enable Pillowtex to improve its financial performance.
``The bigger profits the company makes, the more we will be able to
negotiate,'' Raynor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can voice our opinion now,'' said 52-year-old Janet
Patterson, who for 35 years has hemmed fitted sheets in
Fieldcrest's Plant No. 6 in nearby Concord.
</P>
<P>
   A Fieldcrest employee for 19 years, Kemberly Taylor said she
will push for benefits, such as paid sick days, not presently
offered to factory workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you stay at home with your sick child or go to work to
pay the bills, that should not even be a question,'' said Taylor,
35, who quit school after the eighth grade to work for Fieldcrest.
``If they give us three or four sick days a year, that is better
than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday certified the
union as the collective bargaining representative and the final
vote from the June 22-23 election: 2,270 in favor and 2,102
against. The board ruled that another 153 votes that had been
challenged ``are not sufficient to affect the results of the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This changes the terms of the relationship between the workers
and the management, and the union and the management of this
company,'' said Raynor, greeted by whistles and shouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will start to work with the management ... against the real
enemy, which is not each other,'' the union leader said. ``The real
enemy is the competition ... that threatens the jobs of U.S.
textile workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other U.S. textile manufacturers, Pillowtex has struggled
against foreign competition, despite record shipments of towels,
sheets and other goods. Meanwhile, unions are struggling against
decades-old membership declines and are fighting to make inroads in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   UNITE's victory occurred in a state where 4.2 percent of wage
and salary workers belong to unions _ the nation's lowest level of
union participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect in this case both combatants were looking for a
settlement on mutually acceptable terms,'' said Leon Fink, a labor
historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
``Both are fighting in some sense for stability in a sea of
economic uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   With its $700 million acquisition of Fieldcrest Cannon nearly
two years ago, Pillowtex opposed the union, but did so without
violating labor laws. By contrast, in its four previous losses
since 1974, the union had accused Fieldcrest Cannon of intimidating
employees with warnings that the company could go out of business
if a union moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldcrest Cannon ``campaigned rigorously, but we won,'' Raynor
said. ``I do not think it is the outcome they wanted, but it is the
outcome they accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said Pillowtex's decision to accept the union vote had
nothing to do with the company's financial difficulties. ``At the
end of the day, I believe continued litigation creates nothing but
a divisive force within our factories,'' the executive said.

   Remember Candyland? First published by Milton Bradley in 1949,
Candyland is a board game in which players race through a
psychedelic landscape filled with gumdrop mountains, gingerbread
houses and other illustrated bonbons. For anyone under 10,
Candyland is more than a mere rainy day pastime. It is the
sugar-coated paradise where you would live if such a thing were
possible. It is a visual proxy for heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Catapult Candyland forward 50 years, spin it through a Sega
Dreamcast, and you have Pen Pen Tri-Icelon, a rock-candy mountain
of crystalline imagery that will inspire the next generation of
saucer eyes and small drooly mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Pen Pen _ Japanese (sort of) for Penguin _ hurls a group of
small, round, vaguely arctic creatures onto a slippery, snowy
winter wonderland where they waddle, belly surf and swim along a
twisty route bordered by Popsicle trees and other sugary delights.
At the end of the sweets level, glowing colored snow falls onto the
ice at night.
</P>
<P>
   On the toy course, giant floating ducks, Lego soldiers and
pinball bumpers bar your way. The horror level is a whimsical spook
house of jack-o-lanterns, skeletons and foggy ghosts whose swirling
slows you down. It could have been salvaged from the cutting-room
floor of ``A Nightmare Before Christmas.'' The underwater areas of
each level are luminous with jellyfish, bubbles and colorful
creatures blossoming from every crevice.
</P>
<P>
   If you watch a film like ``Fantasia,'' you can sense the texture
of the world as the camera moves through it. But in a video game,
you can sense the texture of the world as you play through it.
</P>
<P>
   Designers usually use force-feedback as a haptic clue, to let
you know you're rolling over something or bumping into something.
</P>
<P>
   That's a literal way to convey texture. Pen Pen takes a more
subtle approach. Unlike most racing games, which are engine-based,
Pen-Pen is body-based. You're swimming or belly-surfing or skating.
So you have to generate speed as if you were using your arms and
legs, pushing and coasting, pushing and coasting, building
momentum. You accelerate with rhythm, not by mashing the game pad.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple interface _ one button, one stroke _ but it's
remarkably organic, and it creates an almost palpable illusion of
surface consistency. Because you are constantly pushing against the
environment (instead of just zooming through it), you can sense its
resistance: the hardness and smoothness of the ice or the viscosity
of the water or the fluffiness of a snowdrift as you veer into it,
kicking up clouds of powder without much traction.
</P>
<P>
   You can sense the surface when you play Pen Pen. You can also
sense the surface when you watch the ESPN-worthy instant replay _
the camera angle switches every few seconds, swooping from a rear
shot overhead to a forward shot, then cutting to a section of the
race course just ahead as you skate onto the horizon, then panning
as you pass.
</P>
<P>
   Some very high-caliber sports videography is programmed into
this system, and it heightens the drama of what you've just done.
Your performance becomes more than just a score _ it is transformed
into a six-minute, tension-filled account of your maneuvers and
mistakes. The thrill of Pen Pen victory, the agony of Pen Pen
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tipping point here, between game and story. The game
is what happens while you play. The story is what happens after you
play, when you tell people what happened or watch what happened or
remember what happened. At the end of a race, you can try the
course again or view the video _ play the game or play the story.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Pen Pen succeeds as a game. But it also succeeds as a
storytelling medium. Not only is the visual environment beautiful,
but there is a lot of freedom within it. You don't have to barrel
forward. You can wander around. You can turn underwater
somersaults.
</P>
<P>
   You can weave circles through the snow. Two players could invent
games that have nothing to do with who finishes first. All of it is
recorded, and the awareness of the record turns the game into a
performance medium of sorts, an animated dance.
</P>
<P>
   Within the story, there is freedom. But there is also a
structure that contains the story, that gives it a satisfying
shape. The race has a beginning, a middle and an end. There will be
peaks. There will be a resolution. There will be something worth
watching, perhaps repeatedly (depending on your age and whether you
enjoy hearing the same story four times in a row).
</P>
<P>
   The race is a frame for the story. And the game itself is
framed, by an opening cartoon that says hello and by an image that
waves goodnight: a Pen Pen sleeping, Snoopy-like, above his house.
His round belly puffs up and down against the night sky. Text glows
against the snowy landscape: ``You did a good job for today. Have a
rest. Pen Pen.''

CHOOSING A LEADER BY ANAGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, Nov. 12)  
(EDS: Note language in graf 6.) 
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune

<TEXT>
<P>
   While some people judge a candidate by his record or how he
stands on the issues, I've found that I have as good, if not
better, luck choosing a candidate according to how many funny
anagrams you can make from his name.
</P>
<P>
   An anagram is what happens when you make a new word or phrase by
rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. An example would
be rearranging the letters of ``satin'' to form `stain.''
</P>
<P>
   Anagrams have been popular for a long time. In the 17th century,
King Louis XIII had a Royal Anagrammist on staff and paid him 1,200
pounds a year. Whether this was one of the contributing factors
leading to the French Revolution (anagrams: cover rifle, hunt on;
clever fun, hit or no; clever if Hun, no rot) I can't say.
</P>
<P>
   Although I would love to take credit for it, I didn't work out
the French Revolution anagrams myself. Even humor columnists don't
have that much time on their hands. Anagrams, it turns out, are one
of the few things that personal computers are really good at. The
site I used is called the Internet Anagram Server
(www.wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html). It will anagram any word
you can think of (up to 20 letters) in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The best anagrams are the ones that reveal something about the
word or name you're anagramming. For example, an anagram of
Slobodan Milosevic is ``O, I'm an evil, cold boss.'' An anagram of
Clint Eastwood is ``Old West Action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal, as you might imagine, kept the anagram
computers humming night and day. Impeach Clinton translated to
``Let Monica pinch'' and President Clinton of the USA became ``to
copulate, he finds interns.'' And, of course, William Jefferson
Clinton anagrams to ``Firm, clean fellow. Joint? Sin!''
</P>
<P>
   Previous presidents got the anagram business as well. Ronald
Reagan becomes ``A darn long era'' and George Bush is ``He bugs
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to anagram the names of some candidates, presidential
and otherwise, to find out what, if anything, might be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   For George W. Bush we get:
</P>
<P>
   _ Beg worse. Ugh!
</P>
<P>
   _ Rube egg show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brew ego gush.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bush ego grew.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore anagrams into:
</P>
<P>
   _ A lob regret.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garble rote.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bleat err go.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bare leg rot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Realtor beg.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump becomes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Damplord nut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rant, odd lump.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mad lord punt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Land dump rot.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley gets off easy with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Blab red lily.
</P>
<P>
   _ All Bible dry.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan's anagrams make a lot more sense than he does. They
include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A chap, tan bun.
</P>
<P>
   _ NAACP? Bah! Nut!
</P>
<P>
   _ Aha, pa! NBC nut!
</P>
<P>
   _ Cuba, than nap.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ban paunch at.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura's view on religion and other things were
apparently anticipated by these anagrams:
</P>
<P>
   _ Veteran Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ear Jesus vent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rave, Jesse nut.
</P>
<P>
   _ USA never jest.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes is ``verbose fest'' and Orrin Hatch is ``a rich
thorn,'' which just goes to show that you can't completely trust
anagrams because it should be the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's anagrams are unlikely to help her get elected
to the senate. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A corny hill lint.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ah, Cyril. Till non.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hall Clint irony.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rant, chilly loin.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Rudolph Giuliani's chances aren't helped much,
either:
</P>
<P>
   _ A god uphill I ruin.
</P>
<P>
   _ A lurid ghoul I nip.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'd hug, I ruin poll.
</P>
<P>
   _ A dull Igor ... Hi! I pun!
</P>
<P>
   _ A dull gin ... Hi! I pour!
</P>
<P>
   _ Hairdo pig in lulu.
</P>
<P>
   _ Urinal lid go hi up.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not running for anything, but I thought you might be
interested in knowing that an anagram of David Grimes is
``gas-dried vim,'' which I'm choosing to interpret in the most
flattering way possible.

MCCAIN, BUSH VIE FOR VETERANS' VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ It's Veterans Day in the first-in-the-nation
primary state, and a skirmish has broken out.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, the Arizona senator and former prisoner of war, has
centered his campaign here on winning veterans' votes. Thursday he
will release a list of more than 500 veterans who are backing his
candidacy, and he will tour the state. He will visit a veteran's
home in Tilton, march in Nashua's Veterans Day parade, and salute
veterans at the Hudson Veterans of Foreign Wars, with the actress
Connie Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes George W. Bush, the front-running Texas governor and a
former pilot in the Texas Air National Guard, who is making a bid
for some of that support for himself. This week, he released a list
of 15 veterans who are endorsing him, and Wednesday, in Vermont, he
trotted out a retired Army lieutenant colonel, Dwight Lorenz, who
has switched his allegiance from McCain to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This tussle between McCain and Bush, however, is about far more
than endorsements and parades. In a state that boasts more veterans
per capita than does any other state _ there are 139,000 people
here with some sort of military background _ the support of
veterans could tip the balance for either candidate on primary day.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have found that McCain is rising in popularity
among likely GOP primary voters, while Bush has been slipping
somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, clearly, Senator McCain has the edge among
veterans,'' said Steve Duprey, the Republican party chairman in New
Hampshire. ``He's a war hero, and veterans obviously can relate to
that. On the other hand, Governor Bush is smart to realize they are
an important constituency, and to aggressively court them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush said that despite the intensifying competition,
he views McCain as a friend and not a political foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why veterans would be for Senator John
McCain, why they would choose a man of his caliber,'' Bush said.
``He served with distinction in the military. He's a noble man and
he's a good guy and I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a visit to the North Country, Bush met with John
Smart of Hudson, the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, and with six members of Smart's leadership team. They rode in
Bush's camper from Gorham to Littleton, and got to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't cede any group to anyone, whether it's veterans or
police chiefs or fire chiefs,'' said Joel Maiola, Bush's New
Hampshire director.
</P>
<P>
   Maiola said he does not believe that veterans will automatically
vote for McCain just because of his celebrated naval career, which
included 5 1/2 years in a North Vietnamese prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has a strong resume in this area, but New
Hampshire people make up their minds using a variety of issues,''
Maiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dennehy, McCain's New England director, said he is pleased
to see Bush going after veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that George Bush spends as much time as possible wooing
veterans, because he will know the strength of John McCain's
support by spending his resources there,'' Dennehy said. ``He does
not have the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy was dismissive of Bush's veterans list, describing those
listed as political activists, rather than as veterans' group
leaders. Included on the Bush list is a congressional staff member
for Senator Judd Gregg, who is Bush's state chairman, two state
representatives, a former Gregg employee from his days as governor,
and a former aide to Steve Merrill, also a former New Hampshire
governor supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have the rank-and-file support and the
leadership among veterans that John McCain has than the outspoken
partisan political activists that George Bush and Judd Gregg has
compiled as their veteran leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has been honing his credentials on
veterans' issues, and has been trying to overcome doubts about his
ability to manage the nation's foreign affairs. In last week's trip
to New Hampshire, every speech Bush gave was preceded by an
introduction, prepared by his campaign, that reminded voters he had
served in the Texas Air National Guard as a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also been trying to dispel doubts about his prowess on
the international front, since he flunked a television reporters'
pop quiz on the names of foreign leaders. He said Wednesday that
each candidate for president has had different experiences with
regard to foreign policy, and that no one has endured the ultimate
test of serving as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a foreign policy component to being governor of
Texas, and that's dealing with Mexico, and Central America, and
South America,'' he said. ``The question that the people of New
Hampshire ask is, `Do I know how to keep the peace, do I know what
it takes to maintain the peace . . . I'm going to convince America
that I've got the judgment necessary and the vision necessary to
keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina on Tuesday, Bush accused the Clinton
administration of failing to deliver adequate health care to
ex-soldiers. He promised to produce a top-to-bottom overhaul of the
veterans' health care system, to make it easier to file claims, and
to place veterans' advocates in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Bush had similar words prepared for the
Association of the United States Army Granite State Chapter's
annual dinner in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has worked on veterans' issues, as well as foreign
affairs, in the Congress for years. And in a televised town-hall
meeting in Hanover, he complained vigorously that it is wrong for
the nation's military families to be forced to use food stamps
because their pay is inadequate.

GARTH FAGAN DANCE: A NEW STRUCTURAL CLARITY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The genius is in the detail. If any choreographer
knows how to make one part of a dancer's body move in rhythmic
counterpoint to another, it is Garth Fagan. Teaming up again with
the South African composer known as Lebo M, one of his
collaborators in ``The Lion King,'' Fagan has come up with a
dazzling piece: from finger to toe, everything dances in ``Woza,''
which had its premiere on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's suite here includes a slave ship sequence that has the
evocative power of a poem rather than the bluntness of a
declarative sentence. In the overall context of ``Woza,'' this
passage becomes part of a meditation on human existence. The other
segments that frame this scene suggest solitude, love and communal
celebration. In images that underscore the individual humanity of
those on the slave ship, Fagan destroys the stereotype of a
faceless mass but brings out feelings universal to all.
</P>
<P>
   To use abstraction rather than the literal to depict people who
are anything but abstract is the tour de force of ``Woza,'' whose
subtitle in the program reads as ``Zulu for `Come.''' On its
surface level, in fact, ``Woza'' looks like pure dance. Its high
energy and startling body shapes, enhanced by the lyrical beat of
Lebo M, understandably whips the audience into an enthusiastic
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Originality has always been Fagan's strong suit, not least in
his transformation of recognizable idioms into a dance language
that looks not only fresh but even idiosyncratic. The extreme
spring and height of the male dancers' leaps, the speed of all the
dancers' turns, often with arms flung out to recall photographs in
multiple exposure, and the women's remarkable fluidity in movement
adapted from Afro-Caribbean dance are all part of the eclectic
vocabulary of Garth Fagan Dance. It is common to see ballet's
pirouettes or chaine turns and the back falls of mainstream modern
dance absorbed into this collage.
</P>
<P>
   The Fagan signature is not in the use of juxtaposition of
seemingly unrelated movements, a method favored by many others. It
is rather in the geyserlike spurt of new movement within a phrase:
the sudden suspension of a dancer in the air, the unexpected whirl,
the rhythmic change within a leap.
</P>
<P>
   As seen in this opening of a two-week season at the Joyce, this
method occasionally made for an arbitrary look in Fagan's early
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Without sacrificing any of its maverick flavor, the vocabulary
is now polished: ``In the Beat,'' this program's excerpt from ``Mix
25,'' a 1996 work set to jazz music by Wynton Marsalis, is an
example.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it is also Fagan's experience as the Tony-winning
choreographer in the Broadway production of ``The Lion King'' that
encouraged a new structural clarity in his work. Just as his
spectacular processional at the start of ``The Lion King'' was
predicated on different rhythms for each set of animals, so
``Woza'' has a glittering complexity in the rhythmic counterpoint
of its various units.
</P>
<P>
   The finale, ``Come ... Celebration,'' contrasts a happy duet
with a quickstepping trio that evolves into a sextet of three
couples. Suddenly a single file of four dancers weaves through the
increasingly large group. Not only is the quartet acting in
counterpoint to the others but its basic step uses different
movements for each foot as the dancers fling out rotating arms.
</P>
<P>
   Using instrumental and choral recordings by Lebo M of music by
himself and his collaborators, Chico Sello Twala and Thapelo Khomo,
``Woza'' begins with a solo for the extraordinary Sharon Skepple,
starting out in a Brancusi-like pose, head down on one leg with
hand held to the ankle of the other, bent, leg. Like an ostrich in
arabesque penche, she explores the space around her. The limbs of
Norwood Pennewell and Natalie Rogers are entangled in the same
one-legged shape: their acrobatic embrace becomes a tender and then
lively duet, superbly danced.
</P>
<P>
   The slave ship section, ``Come ... Forced Voyage,'' conveys the
rhythm of a rolling sea as four women and a man rock between the
soles of other dancers lying on their backs. The image of prisoners
in the ship's hold flows into a wave of embraces, with women
reaching upward in hope and desperation. The power of this section
is matched by the equally strong ode to joy in the final
celebration, danced also by Chris Morrison, Steve Humphrey, Erin
Barnett, Nicolette Depass, Bill Ferguson, Lutin Tanner and Aisha
Benjamin. Alan Miller and Steve St. Juste appeared in the ``Forced
Voyage'' section. Mary Nemecek Peterson did the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, Pennewell and Morrison were outstanding in a polished
company which appeared also in ``Prelude,'' ``Oatka Trail'' and
``Postscript Posthumous: Ellington.''

ASSASSINATION REIGNITES TURKEY'S DEBATE OVER ISLAM AND SECULARISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The assassination of a leading secularist
intellectual has revived the battle over Islamic politics that has
polarized Turkey over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Ahmet Taner Kislali, a newspaper columnist and
former culture minister, was killed by a car bomb in Ankara in
October. An obscure group of Islamic fighters claimed
responsibility, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   But some Turks doubt that Muslim fanatics were responsible for
the attack. They suspect that it was engineered by a group close to
the state that wants to raise the specter of an imminent religious
threat. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The killing has stepped up the debate over the role of religion
in public life. It has reached a level not seen since 1997, when
fiercely secular military commanders orchestrated a campaign that
forced Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to resign. They charged
that Erbakan, the guiding figure in Turkey's Islamic political
movement, was trying to impose religious rule, a charge he has
vigorously denied.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 95 percent of Turks are Muslim, the country
is a secular republic and religious influence is severely
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's senior prosecutor, Vural Savas, has asked a court to
close Erbakan's religious-based party on the ground that it is
plotting to transform Turkey into an Islamic state. The party,
called Virtue, received 15.5 percent of the vote in the national
election last April.
</P>
<P>
   Savas has also filed charges against Erbakan, asserting that he
sought to destroy Turkey's secular system while he was prime
minister during 1996 and 1997. One charge, which alleges treason,
could carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to reclaim the republic,'' Savas said at a recent
news conference. ``If this mission is delayed until tomorrow,
believe me, it will be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempers are flaring here as Savas issues dire warnings and his
critics ridicule them as wildly exaggerated. A wide gap has opened
between those who believe radical measures are needed to suppress
an imminent threat to the secular order and those who believe that
Islamic politicians and others should be allowed to express their
views without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this conflict is one of the most profound questions
facing Turkey: Is there a threat to secularism and national unity
so great that it justifies continued restrictions on freedom of
speech, or has the country developed to the point at which all
ideas can be safely discussed and debated in public?
</P>
<P>
   For years Erbakan's Islamic political movement was part of the
political mainstream, and it joined with other parties in
supporting restrictions on political freedom. Its members, for
example, backed the expulsion of Kurdish nationalists from
Parliament in 1994 on the ground that their opinions were
subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Islamic politicians have themselves become the
object of lawsuits, political bans and jail sentences. As a result,
in a remarkable turnaround, they have come to embrace the cause of
free expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights and democracy must be fully implemented in
Turkey, not just discussed but fully implemented,'' Erbakan said at
a news conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is said that if full democracy is permitted in Turkey,
certain ideas and opinions will gain strength, and in the end, all
women will be forced to wear veils and then democracy will be
destroyed,'' he said. ``These horror stories have nothing to do
with reality. They are simply fabrications.''
</P>
<P>
   Erbakan has been banned from politics for five years, but he
appears to be influencing the Virtue party from behind the scenes.
The party's current leader, Recai Kutan, visited the United States
in October and gave speeches declaring his ``unconditional support
for secularism.''
</P>

   ``Can we say that there aren't any people in Turkey that want an
Islamist regime like the one in Iran?'' Kutan asked during one

would not exceed 1 or 2 percent of the population.

   ``No threats prevail in an environment where issues like human
rights and other freedoms are recognized,'' he said. ``A

disappeared. Restrictions inevitably inflame people's passion.''

   CHICAGO _ ``Good night,'' bass baritone Timothy Nolen sang at
the Civic Opera House here on Friday night, in the melancholy
concluding notes of ``A View From the Bridge,'' William Bolcom's
operatic adaptation of the Arthur Miller play.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the quietly final punctuation of a storied
tragedy, the words held another piquant layer of meaning, for it
was the closing night of the world premiere engagement of the
opera, the last of nine performances. Those performances were the
culmination of nearly five years of work; it was in 1995 that Lyric
Opera of Chicago commissioned Bolcom and his librettist, Arnold
Weinstein, to transform Miller's play for the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   By the most immediate standards, the production was an
unqualified success, selling out the 3,600-seat hall for every
performance. Nearly 1,000 tickets returned by subscribers were
resold, and another 1,000 people were turned away, an indication
that reviews and word of mouth created a hot ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyric's longer-range goal was to create a work that would
enter the standard repertory and bolster the limited canon of
American opera, and the conclusion of ``View'' here only begins the
drama of whether that goal will be achieved. ``View'' was reviewed
by more than 80 publications around the country and a handful in
Europe; except for a few qualified judgments (largely that it was
not ambitious enough about stretching the genre), nearly all the
notices were favorable. In fact, many critics were ecstatic. And
the opera was seen _ that is, scouted _ by at least two dozen
directors of opera companies.
</P>
<P>
   The attention seems a positive harbinger for the opera's future,
but even amid a flurry of new works at major companies around the
country, the established audience for opera remains devoted to the
European classics, and thus the business of sustaining new American
operas remains tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after Nolen's farewell on Friday night (as the lawyer
Alfieri, the narrator), as the audience took a moment to
collectively swallow before bursting into sustained applause, it
was reasonable to wonder when, or if, ``A View From the Bridge''
will be appreciated by an audience again, and if it is, how often.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, what does the perceived success of ``View'' portend
for the season's other significant premieres, John Harbison's
``Great Gatsby'' at the Metropolitan Opera in New York next month
and Carlisle Floyd's ``Cold Sassy Tree'' at the Houston Grand Opera
in the spring? These works, added to Andre Previn's adaptation of
``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' which had its premiere at the San
Francisco Opera in 1998 (and will be restaged by the New Orleans
Opera in March), are populating the American opera landscape with a
rare bounty of high-profile new projects.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for the creation of an often performed body of
American work has never been greater, and as the century turns it
is tempting to see the moment as a swivel in the fortunes of the
genre. But Marc Scorca, the executive director of Opera America, an
organization for professional companies, urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a nice, strong success,'' Scorca said. ``But that
doesn't mean the risk and potential for failure have been removed
from the process of creating and sustaining new work. We are still
working against a negative stereotype of new opera being
necessarily difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the positive reaction to ``View'' has much to do with
how the opera combats the stereotype. Reviewers and, in interviews,
opera company officials applied the ``A'' word _ accessible _ again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   In his score, Bolcom, whose work draws on eclectic American
forms from ragtime to doo-wop, eschewed the deliberately
experimental sounds of academic composition (``the broken crockery
stuff,'' in the phrase of Richard Gaddes, the associate general
director of the Santa Fe Opera).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he infused the dissonances and shifting time signatures
of the contemporary classical idiom with references from pop tunes
and show music, embraced the melodramatic rumbles and crescendos of
movie scores and even provided a consonant melody or two for those
who like to exit whistling.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a score that treats its popular elements as
serious music, a step that many in the opera world recognize as
necessary for the further development of an American opera
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of catching up to do,'' said David Gockley,
general director of the Houston Grand Opera, who pronounced
``View'' to be ``eminently revivable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 80 years of serious music tradition that went down
blind alleys and left the mainstream of broad popular appeal, and
we have got to make up for a lot of lost time,'' Gockley said.
``We've got to fast track some of this stuff to get back in
relationship with the public, which is the only thing that, in
turn, would drive the creative muse. Opera is not academic, not
just a coterie of composers writing for their peers. It's for
public delectation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the score, the direction by Frank Galati, the
sets by Santo Loquasto and the large-screen projections by Wendall
K. Harrington were roundly praised for their effective
theatricality. It was a production that, right down to the exacting
supertitles by Frank Rizzo, was concerned with making the audience
comfortable as it spent a moderate length of time (including
intermission, the opera takes only 2 1-2 hours) on a story set in
Red Hook, Brooklyn, circa 1950.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, ``A View From the Bridge'' had the significant
advantage of Miller's simple, powerful (and for many theatergoers,
familiar) story of the dockworker Eddie Carbone, a good man undone
by forbidden desire, which provided a welcome narrative lifeline.
The cast members, led by Kim Josephson as Eddie and Catherine
Malfitano as his wife, Beatrice, were admired as frequently for
their acting skills as for their musical ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics noted that the melding of music and drama was
particularly pungent _ ``For its dramatic power alone, the opera
deserves to be seen everywhere,'' Heidi Waleson wrote in The Wall
Street Journal _ and several opera officials, independently and
unbidden, used the phrase ``musical theater'' to describe what they
had seen.

EVICTION LEAVES ISRAELI SETTLERS DISPOSSESSED, BITTER

<P>
   HAVAT MAON, West Bank - At sunrise Wednesday, the 1,000 Israeli
police and soldiers who had carried out a predawn eviction of a few
dozen protesters and a handful of residents of this bunkered desert
outpost were lounging on broken furniture dragged from the evicted
settlers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   There were cooking pans, plates, beds, sheets, a crib, and a
guitar strewn across the rocky hilltop outside a cluster of
ramshackle homes, a makeshift synagogue, and tents, all of which
were being bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his cabinet ministers that
the eviction of the settlers was a ``complex test of democracy and
a red light on the way to anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the youngsters at Maon can teach me about the love of
Israel,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation at Havat Maon, which translates roughly as
``The Homestead,'' has been portrayed as the most dramatic clash
between Israeli settlers and the government since 1982, when Israel
leveled the Yamit settlement in the Sinai Peninsula as part of its
peace treaty with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But some 400 to 600 families lived at Yamit. Only 12 lived at
Maon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has successfully presented his stand at Maon as a bold
move toward peace, but the peace movement in Israel and the
Palestinian leadership see it as a cynical exercise by a man who
has given the green light to more expansion of settlements than his
more conservative predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a negotiator in the peace process and senior aid to
Arafat, said, he he hoped people would see the Maon eviction ``for
the public relations stunt that it is. I hope the world will not be
fooled by tearing down a few trailers where 12 people live, while
allowing the construction of thousands of homes in other
settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said he had written a letter to Barak last week
protesting the issuing of ``tenders,'' or contracts, to build 3,084
units of housing in settlements throughout out the West Bank and on
the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some 200,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank,
which Israel captured from Jordan in a 1967 war. Their heavily
guarded communities dot the chalky, terraced hillsides amid the
villages where some 1.6 million Palestinians live.
</P>
<P>
   Havat Maon was one of a chain of 42 unauthorized outposts
established under Netanyahu and during Barak's transition to power
in a brazen attempt by settlers to stake a claim to as much West
Bank land as possible and prevent it from being handed over to the
Palestinians as part of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat added, ``Barak has made a deal with the settlers, and it
is devastating to the peace process. He will have to focus on
making peace with us, not the settler movement, if he wants the
peace process to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how carefully he is orchestrating his
leadership, Barak's cabinet voted 17-1 just hours after the
eviction to approve an Israeli troop withdrawal next week under the
terms spelled out in the so-called ``Wye II'' agreement signed in
September to restart a peace process that had been ground to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim accord, Israel pledged to withdraw from 18.1
percent of the West Bank in three stages, ending in January. In
September, Israel transferred 7 percent of the West Bank to
Palestinian administrative control, while retaining control of
security. In the second stage, to be implemented Monday, Israel
will transfer 2 percent of the land from joint to sole Palestinian
control and will shift another 3 percent from sole Israeli control
to joint administration.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said the transfer plan will be presented to the
Palestinian government's cabinet and is expected to be approved
prior to Monday's planned withdrawal. But he pointed out that the
mere carrying out of the previously signed agreement should not
obscure the problems that are arising as a result of what he called
``Barak's confrontational expansion of settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu did not challenge the unauthorized settlements, but
Barak has tried to limit their construction, which has accelerated
since he became prime minister in July. Under a deal with Barak,
leaders of the settler movement had agreed to leave 12 sites
voluntarily, including Havat Maon, in exchange for retroactive
government approval of the other 30.
</P>
<P>
   The settler leadership persuaded the residents of 11 outposts to
leave, but Havat Maon became a magnet for a younger, more radical
group of settlers who vowed not to leave.
</P>
<P>
   After about five hours after it began in the predawn darkness,
the evacuation of Havat Maon, a cluster of shacks and tents, was
completed, and 27 settlers were detained.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the furnishings scattered around the rocky hillside at dawn
were posters remembering the founder of the settlement, Dov
Dribben, who was killed 18 months ago in a dispute over land with
several Palestinian farmers. It is land that the Palestinians say
they had tilled for generations, and which Dribben insisted was
granted to Jews in the bible.
</P>
<P>
   There was red paint splattered on the soldiers' uniforms, which
settlers said was meant to show that ``Jewish blood was spilled
here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the order of the Israeli Civil Administration authorities,
immigrant laborers from Ghana picked through the refuse and packed
it in boxes, which will be given back to the four families who
lived at Maon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from smoldering fires lifted into the sky as settlers in
prayer shawls slung over machine guns said their morning prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Matti Shevo, 24, a father of two children who lived at Maon, was
crying as he lay on a rock outside the encampment where his crudely
constructed home of wood and corrugated tin had just been
bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our home was destroyed. Everything is lost, and these soldiers
should be ashamed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Lapid, 24, a friend of Shevo and a resident of the nearby
militant settlement Kryat Arba, said he had come to stand in
solidarity with the people of Maon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zionism is dying. It has been broken in the Sinai by Menachem
Begin, and now it is clear that secular Zionism is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Barak, he added, ``He is a little man, thinking
about his four years at the sake of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Rubin, deputy director of the Begin-Sadat Center, a policy
think tank in Tel Aviv, said, ``Maon was a test: Can a tiny group
of people tell everybody else what to do, and control the future of
a country?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting on a show. Trying to make it as dramatic as
possible for future considerations,'' Rubin added, ``But it's more
than just theater. No country can tolerate this anarchy.''

 CHICAGO: had seen. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a very good piece of music theater, and the production
was excellent,'' said Lotfi Mansouri, the general director of the
San Francisco Opera, which has another world premiere, Jake
Heggie's adaptation of the Helen Prejean memoir, ``Dead Man
Walking,'' in the works. Mansouri is scheduled to step down in
2001, but he said of ``View'' that ``I'm going to recommend it to
my successor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other directors _ including Gockley in Houston, Michael Harrison
at the Baltimore Opera and Kevin Smith at the Minnesota Opera in
Minneapolis _ commented that the production should be adaptable for
smaller houses and that the roles did not make the kinds of demands
that limit casting possibilities. They said they would be likely to
consider ``View'' for future seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bailey, general director of the Portland Opera in Oregon,
is already negotiating with Lyric to present ``View'' in the spring
of 2002. Bailey hopes to persuade Josephson, who played Eddie in
Chicago, to reprise his role in Portland, and to engage Galati and
the orchestra conductor, Dennis Russell Davies. ``I saw what I
think is one of the major musical theater pieces of our time, and
I'm determined to bring it here,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, one thing that could stand in his way is the
previously announced production of ``View'' at the Met, which has
scheduled it for the fall of 2002 as part of an unusual swap: Lyric
is to present ``Gatsby'' next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he feared that the Met, which has not completed its
contractual arrangements for ``View,'' would insist that the New
York production be the next.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Volpe, the Met's general director, declined to comment on
any aspect of his plans for ``View.''
</P>
<P>
   There were minor criticisms of the opera; it was a little
``schmaltzy'' in spots, to use the word of one general director,
and it lacked a significant aria for Eddie. Bolcom said he would be
conferring with Miller and Weinstein soon to discuss some
additions, another aria and perhaps a duet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Arthur wants, I'll be happy to do,'' Bolcom said.
``Everybody wants another aria. The head waiter at Coco Pazzo said
to me, `Hey, I loved your opera, but you need another aria.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics and visiting opera officials did say, however,
that by opera's grandest standards, ``View'' did not rise high
enough, perhaps because of the very popularizing qualities that
many of them admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not break new ground in the genre, or even attempt
to,'' Anthony Tommasini, the New York Times' critic, wrote in an
otherwise favorable review. He was seconded by Alex Ross in the New
Yorker: ```A View from the Bridge' falls short of greatness, but it
does not aim for greatness, either. It wears the ruddy complexion
of a work that achieved exactly what it set out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bailey in Portland distinguished between the work's
achievement as music theater and its achievement as opera. He said
of Bolcom: ``I think the man has it in him to write the great
American opera. This is close to being it. I hope he doesn't stop
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bolcom, who at 61 has been a prolific composer of
orchestral and vocal works in many forms, is a relative novice as
an opera composer; his only previous work, ``McTeague,'' premiered
at Lyric in 1992. The difficulty not only of writing operas but of
having them regularly performed as well has long been cited as a
deterrent to the kind of persistence that might drive composers to
develop of masterpieces. Bolcom has spoken of his desire to write a
comic opera, and evidently he will have that chance: Lyric has
commissioned him for another project, though the specifics will not
be disclosed until next month, when the company is to announce a
plan for the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   William Mason, the company's general director, said he also
hoped to restage ``View.'' Asked when, though, he grinned and said,
``In the fullness of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so naive as to think that the immediate success of
this means that in 50 years people will still be listening to this
piece,'' Mason said. ``If you do 50 operas and one or two enter the
repertory, you consider yourselves geniuses. Take away the major
geniuses _ Verdi, Wagner, Mozart and Puccini _ and how many great
works have we produced in four centuries? Think of the tens of
thousands that have been written, and we've got maybe 15 or 20
sure-fire box office hits, and 30, maybe 50, with some level of
audience recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to encourage people to write. The more people
who write, the better chance another genius will come along.''
</P>
<P>

From the Bridge,'' which was adapted from the Arthur Miller play

BOULEZ GETS A CHANCE TO MAKE CONVERTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Boulez will probably never shake off the reputation he
earned in his 20s as a fearsome polemicist on behalf of the most
complex contemporary music, including his own. He emerged from
Europe in the 1950s as the leading advocate of the post-Webern
school of serialism, or 12-tone music, or _ to use the term Boulez
preferred in his theoretical writings _ dodecaphonic music.
</P>
<P>
   In one essay, published in Paris in 1952, he unequivocally
declared that any musician who has not felt ``the necessity of the
dodecaphonic language is of no use.'' So much for Stravinsky, who
was still producing Neo-Classical masterpieces at the time, as well
as such essentially tonal composers as Britten and Shostakovich,
who were then in their creative primes.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez's image with the mainstream concertgoing public softened
considerably in subsequent decades because of his acclaimed work as
a conductor. He has given sensitive, texturally clear performances
of Debussy and Ravel; probing, structurally lucid accounts of the
symphonies of Mahler and Bruckner, and, though less universally
admired, fleet and lean performances of music by Wagner, a composer
Boulez, as a student, once disdained, partly in reaction to his
harmony teacher, Messiaen, a Wagnerite.
</P>
<P>
   As a polemicist, Boulez has also mellowed considerably. He now
speaks with wistful amusement of the days when he and his radical
composer friends attended concerts of new music in Paris to boo and
jeer works they considered hopelessly bound to Classical forms and
conservative languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are young, you must reject,'' Boulez said during a
recent visit to New York. ``In the 1950s, if I was very sarcastic
toward some periods of Stravinsky's work, I was also very much
under the spell of Stravinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like fighting against your teacher, whom you revere but
must eventually break from, Boulez said. Or fighting against your
father, something Boulez experienced firsthand. His father, a steel
industrialist, expected his young son, who had shown a keen
aptitude for mathematics, to pursue a career in engineering. Boulez
enrolled instead at the Paris Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the larger musical public has mellowed as well and is
ready to reconsider the ideas of this major musical thinker, and
hear his music anew. There are opportunities to do both as Boulez
assumes the 1999-2000 Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair at
Carnegie Hall. With this appointment he will advise on
contemporary-music programming and preside over eight events
focusing on his own work: concerts, discussions and a performance
workshop. The events will be presented in two segments, one this
month, the other in March, when Boulez turns 75.
</P>
<P>
   The series begins on Tuesday evening, when Boulez, an engaging
speaker, gives an informal talk at Weill Recital Hall about his
life and work. He will also conduct the renowned new-music group
that he founded, Ensemble Intercontemporain, in three programs: a
Schoenberg concert on Friday at Weill Hall; a program of Boulez,
Berio and Schoenberg on Saturday at Carnegie Hall, and a Boulez
chamber music program on Sunday, again at Weill.

<P>
   In March he will lead four programs at Carnegie Hall with the
London Symphony Orchestra, all 20th-century music, ranging from
Schoenberg's early, Expressionist tone poem ``Pelleas und
Melisande'' and premieres of works by Salvatore Sciarrino, Olga
Neuwirth and George Benjamin to his own ``Originel'' from ``...
explosante-fixe. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Concertgoers who are prone to think that this weekend's
programs, rife with works by Boulez, will make for heavy-duty
listening were probably not at an exciting program last December by
the New Juilliard Ensemble. David Robertson conducted works by
Stravinsky and Elliott Carter, and Boulez's 40-minute ``Sur
Incises.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience's response to Boulez's piece suggested that his
music, always respected by musician-soldiers in the struggle for
new music, might finally be reaching civilians as well.
</P>
<P>
   Composed during the years 1996 to 1998, ``Sur Incises'' is
scored for three pianos, three harps and three percussionists,
placed on the stage in mixed groups to enhance the listener's
ability to hear the music spatially. The sheer riot of color is
engrossing. As the music unfolds, episodes of sustained,
quasi-lyrical dreaminess alternate abruptly with outbursts of
pulsating intensity that suggest ``organized delirium,'' in the
term Boulez has used to describe an effect he is after in his
works.
</P>
<P>
   When the performance ended that night, the audience erupted with
its own brand of organized delirium. Perhaps after a couple of
decades of neo-Romantic works by composers craving appreciation,
the audience found it bracing to hear Boulez's wildly colorful,
almost crazed and uncompromisingly difficult music. This work will
be performed on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Though imposingly brilliant, Boulez is a courtly Frenchman who
frets over the chasm that developed in this century between
exploratory composers and recalcitrant audiences. As early as 1971,
when he assumed the music directorship of the New York
Philharmonic, he tried to do something about it. And his six-year
tenure in that position is often misrepresented today.
</P>
<P>
   When Boulez was announced as the improbable successor to Leonard
Bernstein (no two musicians could have been more different in
temperament), it seemed to music students from the baby-boomer
generation, including me, that our beloved Uncle Lennie, Let's Find
Out, was being replaced by some stern taskmaster who would teach us
our tone rows. Would Boulez turn the Philharmonic into a
cutting-edge new-music orchestra?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, it turned out. In fact, although new works were
regularly presented, the programs were more varied than is
generally remembered today. The first season, for example, included
lots of lesser-know works by, of all people, Liszt. And Boulez
experimented with breaking down the formal structure of the
subscription concert more radically than Bernstein did.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez wanted at least some concerts to be interactive
experiences. During the off-season he had the seats taken out of
Philharmonic Hall (as Avery Fisher Hall was called until 1973) to
present his Rug Concerts, in which the players performed on the
floor of the auditorium, and the audience sat on cushions and rugs.
The programs enticingly mixed chamber and orchestral works, music
from diverse eras and styles: Ligeti and Mahler, or Bach and
Varese.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were his Prospective Encounters, held at smaller
sites. Contemporary works were played, discussed and, often, played
again. I remember two evenings in particular.
</P>
<P>
   One, in January 1973 at the Juilliard Theater, was devoted to a
single work, Webern's Five Movements (Op. 5) for string quartet,
played first by the Gramercy String Quartet, then, in the string
orchestra version, by the Philharmonic. Two months later, I was at
New York University for a concert of works by Milton Babbitt and
Gyorgy Ligeti.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez helpfully discussed the music in detail, avoiding jargon.
Questions were encouraged, and no questioner, however uninformed,
was made to feel stupid. At the Webern event, one young man with a
fuzzy beard, wearing a sweatshirt and dingy jeans, commented, ``I
don't understand what you are conducting, since the music doesn't
have any beats.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulez could not have been more agreeable as he explained that a
lot of music is very rhythmic without being pulsating. He
demonstrated the meaning of his hand gestures and revealed the
nature of Webern's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, though fascinating and often exciting, the events were
also intimidating. What came through, the subtext of Boulez's
programming and commentary, was his conviction that this new,
complex music had come to stay, that tonality was passe and we were
all going to have to make the adjustment. But not to worry, he was
there to help us, and we would all get through this just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things didn't turn out that way. Tonality fought
back, resisted the assault, sometimes bending, sometimes adapting.
But it did not go away. We live today with multiple musical
languages, making this a time of either stylistic chaos or
challenging opportunity, depending on your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez has not changed his attitude about tonal music, but he
now frames his objections as personal. Composers writing any type
of tonal music, he said, are ``on the wrong wavelength, for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't go deep enough,'' he explained. ``They try
solutions to the questions of composition which have been
experimented with in other times with another frame of action. And
therefore, for me, the questions posed in the compositions are
legitimate, but the answers are irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this does not mean that serialism has triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the debate about serialism comes 50 years too late,'' he
said. ``The period of serialism, where people like Stockhausen,
Nono and me were trying to find a new language, was really from
1951 to 1953. That was it. When I hear, `Serialism is dead,' I
think, `It was a long time dead.' It was killed by the same people
who wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Boulez is referring to is the strict kind of serialism he
and his colleagues were attempting, in which not just pitches but
also accents, dynamics and durations were serialized (that is,
taken from preconceived ordered rows, or series). Boulez calls his
great work for alto and six instruments, ``Le Marteau Sans
Maitre,'' composed from 1952 to 1954, his fight against the ``very
narrow kind of serialism'' that became ``very academic
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   During this period, he said, he was in a ``narrow tunnel trying
to find a vocabulary'' of his own. He did, he feels. The vibrantly
original ``Marteau'' was his declaration of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But for all Boulez's talk of liberation, few listeners will
discern the difference between his strictly serial works and ``Sur
Incises,'' which is, by comparison, quite free. Boulez still uses
serial principles to generate basic ideas and, in his words, ``draw
consequences'' from them, and the avoidance of tonal centers, the
zigzag character of the lines, and the substitution of organic,
kinetic rhythm for regular pulse combine to make many listeners
think of the music, however inaccurately, as serialized. It is
perhaps too facile to suggest that because the strictest
experiments in serialism were short-lived, serialism itself is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The truly interesting issues in music, Boulez maintains, go
beyond questions of harmonic language, tonality or nontonality.
Stravinsky and Schoenberg, the two great pioneering composers of
the early 20th century, whose explorations compelled them to
abandon conventional tonality, understood this point, Boulez notes.
But in his opinion they both went wrong by the late 1920s, when
they tried to adapt their post-tonal harmonic languages to
Neo-Classical forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stravinsky goes to the Classical tradition like you go to an
antique shop,'' Boulez said. ``You buy an old trumpet, but not to
be played. Instead, you put something on it, and it becomes a lamp.
This is funny. But basically Stravinsky is toying with the style. I
can still barely stand pieces like `Apollon Musagete' and `Oedipus
Rex,' which I find dead wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Many musicians would disagree. A Neo-Classical work like the
opera ``The Rake's Progress'' can be heard as Stravinsky's loving
commentary on Mozart opera, transformed radically into something
utterly original and thoroughly modern. Boulez is not impressed.
``I prefer Mozart with the right notes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has somewhat more sympathy for the Neo-Classical works of
Schoenberg. ``At his core,'' he said, ``Schoenberg is at least a
real Neo-Classicist who tries to be integrated with the
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulez was not always so open-minded. He published an incendiary
article, ``Schoenberg Is Dead,'' in 1952, just a year after the
composer's death. In it, he argued that Schoenberg, by returning to
Classical forms after he had developed his 12-tone technique, had
failed to recognize the consequences of his own discoveries. The
Classical forms, by definition, involved juxtaposing musical
materials written in related keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can one associate oneself unreservedly with an output that
displays such contradictions, such illogic?'' Boulez wrote.
Schoenberg was ``a sort of Moses dying within sight of the Promised
Land, having brought the sacred tablets of the law from a Sinai
which many insist on confusing with Valhalla.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's student Webern was the composer who, for Boulez and
his radical friends, realized the implications of Schoenberg's
work. A composer of Schoenberg's importance, Boulez later
explained, ``has to die through his real successors.''
</P>
<P>
   He has mellowed in his attitude toward Schoenberg's
Neo-Classical works, though he still prefers the early period, the
composer of ``Erwartung.'' ``That's the real Schoenberg,'' he said,
``the one who was really historical.''
</P>
<P>
   Approaching 75, Boulez can still sound like a firebrand. He
deplores the obsession with the past in modern concert life and
bemoans the ``burden'' of the library. ``A civilization which is so
charged with memory is a civilization which is not living
anymore,'' he said. ``I think civilizations which are really
strong, really vivacious, can still destroy. In the 16th century,
Renaissance architecture was built to replace Romanesque
architecture, which they were getting rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he is not alone in complaining about the musty
staleness of concerts today and the stifling weight of European
culture. With his radical critique he offers exciting possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orchestra concerts must be changed,'' he said. ``We are like
restaurants: we open at 8, we close at 11, nothing before or after.
Especially on Saturday and Sunday, we can do much more than that.
We can invite people to teach themselves. Museums have understood
that for years. We have CD-ROMs at the Louvre. You really visit the
museum. Imagine a Saturday spent hearing about music, listening to
CD-ROMs and finishing with a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine indeed. Especially if the mellowed yet still feisty
Boulez were there to guide us.

U.N. TRIBUNAL DROPS GENOCIDE CHARGES AGAINST EX-RWANDA OFFICIAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Switzerland)   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The decision of a U.N. tribunal to drop its
case against a former Rwandan official accused of helping to
organize the Hutu-led genocide in 1994 has outraged the Rwandan
government and threatened to unravel efforts to bring the most
prominent suspects to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, 49, was director of
political affairs in the Rwandan foreign ministry. He led a Hutu
political party that espoused hatred of the country's Tutsi
minority and is also said to have helped start a radio and
television station whose broadcasts incited Hutu to attack Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated half million Rwandans, almost all Tutsi, were
killed in the 1994 massacres, which ended when a Tutsi-led revolt
overthrew the Hutu-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3 the tribunal's appeals court dismissed charges against
Barayagwiza and ordered him returned to Cameroon, where he was
arrested in March 1996 and detained 19 months before being
delivered to the tribunal, in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the tribunal prosecutor had failed to
inform Barayagwiza of the charges against him and had not
transferred him promptly enough from Cameroon. Barayagwiza was
accused of genocide, incitement of genocide and crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   This week Human Rights Watch deplored what it called
``prosecutorial incompetence'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor at the time was Louise Arbour, who was also
pursuing suspected war criminals in the Balkans. She quit on Sept.
15 to accept a seat on the Canadian Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Del Ponte, a Swiss jurist who succeeded Ms. Arbour,
acknowledged that the appeals court had strongly criticized the
prosecutor's office for a perceived lack of diligence in pressing
the case. She promised to visit Rwanda this month and ``stay as
long as necessary to examine the circumstances of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the dismissal of the charges, the chief
prosecutor of Rwanda, Gerard Gahima, declared over the weekend that
the government would suspend its cooperation with the tribunal,
which the Security Council set up in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's president, Navanethem Pillay, met on Tuesday with
Joseph Mutaboba, Rwanda's chief delegate at the United Nations.
``I'm very distressed over the reaction of the Rwandan government
and I'm prepared to explain,'' Pillay said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Rwanda's cooperation, Pillay said at a news briefing,
prosecuting 31 other Rwandan detainees awaiting trial will be
harder. ``We do need the cooperation of the Rwandan government,''
she said, in making witnesses and other evidence available.
</P>
<P>
   Pillay, a South African, said she understood the anger of the
Rwandan government. ``For the last three years, we've been sitting
day in and day out listening to testimony of survivors, and we're
deeply moved by that testimony,'' she said. ``But as judges, we
still have to be detached and apply the law. This is our mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are presumed innocent and their guilt has to be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt. And we cannot have cooperation just
tailored on the delivery of convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barayagwiza, who remains in custody in Tanzania, has asked that
he be allowed to choose his destination, saying he has no legal
status, resources or family in Cameroon. There had been speculation
that Cameroon might consent to extradite him to Rwanda, but Pillay
said Cameroon had turned down such a request.

<P>
   IN THE JUDEAN FOOTHILLS, Israel _ ``Come, climb into the
grave,'' said Amir Ganor, an archaeologist-cop, his hand reaching
out from an underground hole. ``See what the robbers have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a ruin. A tomb from the first century B.C., one
of thousands hidden in an ancient urban center under the desolate,
cactus-strewn hills, had been vandalized and plundered of
antiquities. Stone doors were pried from the burial holes, human
bones scattered in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They leave the bones, take the goods and destroy the site
forever,'' Ganor said, shining a flashlight to show three burial
places, typical for a Jewish grave site from the early Roman
period. ``When I first saw this, I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Grave-robbing is as old as time, especially in these parts,
where time really stretches back. But in expectation of sharply
increased religious tourism to the Holy Land at the turn of the
millennium, the robbers appear to be working overtime, Israeli
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   They say that as antiquities dealers seek to stockpile
merchandise, an open season on rare coins, oil lamps and precious
glass has been unofficially declared. But merchants themselves say
that they don't have great hopes for an increase in sales in the
year 2000. It must be the middlemen, they say, who are filling the
diggers' heads with dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect much from the millennium,'' said Khader Baidun,
a dealer in the Old City of Jerusalem. ``Those who do come, the
pilgrims, are unlikely to do much rare antiquities shopping. But
there is a new phenomenon that has no basis in the market. The
hysteria among people has increased. They have started thinking the
land is full of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   With guns on their hips, cell phones in their pockets and
shovels in their jeeps, Ganor, 31, and a band of about a dozen
agents patrol off-road Israel in defense of history. But the
Antiquities Authority's anti-theft unit is essentially powerless to
stop the destruction. Not only is its turf vast _ 50,000
archaeological sites _ but the laws are not on its side. Only the
little guys _ the diggers and the middlemen _ are acting illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the sole country in the Middle East that allows a
free market for antiquities, it is perfectly legal to sell the
fruits of pilfered graves. Some 80 dealers are licensed by the
state and do a $5 million-a-year business, according to Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The plunderers follow in the grand tradition of the late Moshe
Dayan, a master digger with an obsessive hunger for valuable
archaeological finds. Dayan, Israel's legendary general, used to go
so far as to use Israeli soldiers and army helicopters to assist
him as he liberated national treasures for his private home.
</P>
<P>
   But antiquities authorities refrained from cracking down on him,
even when they caught him red-handed, as when he was nearly buried
alive during an illegal dig. In exchange, he told them to help
themselves to anything in his house that they wanted to display in
the Israel Museum _ and they did.
</P>
<P>
   The motives of Dayan, an addicted collector, were never
pecuniary. But today's grave robbers, focusing on a hoped-for
millennial rush, are driven by the expectation of double or nothing
_ about $40 _ for an oil lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Even with dwindling resources and staff cuts, the tiny
anti-theft unit of Israel's antiquities agency has nabbed 15
would-be grave robbers in the last month, compared with 100 in a
typical year. They have caught 20 middlemen so far this year, up
from four in 1996. Each middleman was found with at least $50,000
worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities authorities say that dealers, who usually do not
keep a lot of stock and only buy rare objects, are stocking up. The
evidence lies in their registers, which undergo spot checks, the
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What could be better in the year 2000 than to take home some
souvenir _ a coin, an oil lamp, from the Jesus period?'' Ganor
said, sounding like a huckster for the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But the dealers themselves, who have no reason to lie since
their end of the business is perfectly legal, say they are not in
fact increasing their buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antiquities is a dead business,'' said Abu Shakra, another
dealer in the Old City. ``Look at my stock. I haven't bought
anything in seven years. And I don't particularly see a reason the
year 2000 will be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-theft unit's job is an almost ludicrous pursuit.
Working with tips from informers in Arab villages, where they say
most robbers come from, they roam a vast area in the dead of night.
Wearing night-vision goggles, they try to sneak up on the small
gangs of men who work with pick-axes, spades and metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   At ruins south of Bet Shemesh and a couple of miles from the
Palestinian territories, Ganor covered the terrain as if he knew
what lay beneath every mound, which he probably does. To most
Israelis, the hills are geographically and psychologically
off-limits, part of a forbidding landscape that surrounds them. But
to Ganor, the dirt is just cover for an extensive early Roman and
Byzantine-era city beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbers really like this place because it's a huge
graveyard,'' he said, as he descended crumbling steps and wriggled
his tall body head-first into a hollow beneath the earth. ``They
search for the smoothly cut rock, with curves, which indicate the
entrance. They are good, like archaeologists.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he sat underground, his cell phone rang. ``We have one,
come,'' he said, scrambling up and into his jeep. One of his agents
had caught a man with a metal detector at an already excavated site
in Bet Shemesh. Ganor drove on and off the road, then clambered up
a hill, physically transforming in a matter of minutes from
mild-mannered archaeologist to Israeli policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, the man was cuffed and seated on an ancient
mosaic floor as Ganor and his agent searched his bag. ``If I had
found something it would be in my pockets,'' the man informed them,
asking for the apple in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I find coins; today, nothing,'' he whispered so the
officers couldn't hear.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers drove the man, who would not give his name, to
the Bet Shemesh police station, an agent, Alon Klein, said: ``That
was a stupid one, broad daylight. I could see him from the road. I
parked my car behind and then I sneaked through the brush like
Indiana Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, an Israeli, started to cry. It would later turn out
that he had a long rap sheet of plunder and pilfer, all to support
a drug habit, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very good profession,'' the man said, hanging his
head.
</P>
<P>
   The real professionals, though, work under cover of darkness and
rarely get caught. They use expensive, finely tuned metal
detectors, and then hack away at layers of history, leaving Ganor
to stumble on the wreckage of another site ruined and, sometimes,
in a manly way, to cry himself.

 HIGH COURT HEARS FEDERALISM CASE INVOLVING STATE RECORDS ON
DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The five Supreme Court justices who have been
leading the court's drive to expand states' rights at the expense
of federal authority peered into the future Wednesday and just
maybe _ momentarily and almost imperceptibly _ blinked.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the argument in the court's latest federalism
case, challenging a 1994 federal law that bars states from
disclosing personal information contained in motor vehicle records.
States have made millions of dollars selling drivers' addresses and
photographs to commercial database services.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is appealing a ruling, by the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va., last year, that by
directly regulating a state activity, the law violated principles
of state sovereignty embodied in the 10th Amendment. This was the
same amendment the justices invoked two years ago in a 5-4 decision
striking down part of the Brady gun control law that required local
sheriffs to perform background checks on prospective gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices who voted to strike down that Brady-law provision
expressed no more fondness Wednesday for the Drivers' Privacy
Protection Act, which Justice Anthony M. Kennedy described as an
example of federal intervention into state affairs at once
``unnecessary and intrusive.'' And Justice Antonin Scalia said to
Solicitor General Seth Waxman, ``You have to assume that if the
states didn't have this restrictive policy, then the states don't
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the question hanging in the air of the crowded courtroom
was not the future of the driver privacy law as such, but what
might be the logical, perhaps inevitable next step in the
federalism battle if the court did strike down the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you sell hot dogs at the state park,'' Justice Stephen
G. Breyer said to South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon,
who brought the state's successful attack on the driver privacy law
in the lower courts and was defending his victory Wednesday.
``Don't you have to comply with the federal food and drug laws?''
Breyer continued. ``Is your argument going to set aside all federal
regulation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question that goes to the heart of this case,''
Condon replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I possibly rule for you,'' Breyer persisted, without
overturning an entire body of law under which the authority of
Congress to regulate interstate commerce has been understood to
place corresponding limits on state authority. ``Are you asking us
to set aside all of that?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As Condon fumbled for an answer, Justice David H. Souter,
speaking up from the opposite end of the bench, interrupted him
forcefully. ``Answer Justice Breyer's question!'' he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy then tried to come to the South Carolina official's
rescue, offering him some key words and phrases that might have
deflected the issue, such as ``federal pre-emption'' and
``supremacy clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon, tongue-tied, fell back on the slogans he had brought
with him. ``This court has breathed new life into the system of
dual sovereignty,'' he began.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer cut him off impatiently. ``I'll ask Justice Kennedy
later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the court's federalism divide has developed over the past
several years, Breyer and Souter have been on the losing side,
along with Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist, Kennedy and Scalia have comprised the
majority. There has been little common ground between the two
sides, and neither is likely to relinquish or even modify its
deeply held view of the essential nature of the federal-state
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, some members of the majority have appeared
more comfortable dealing with federalism on a case-by-case basis,
and might look for a way to issue a limited decision in this case,
Reno vs. Condon, No. 98-1464, that would avoid the far-reaching
scenario that Breyer depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia appeared to be looking for such a path when he suggested
to Condon that the court might treat state motor vehicle records as
``a special category,'' requiring special solicitude toward the
states but not necessarily calling into question broad categories
of federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the federal government can't tell a state to move its
capital, it can't tell the states what to do with their records,''
Scalia said. ``They're sacred. They belong to the state, and the
federal government mucking around with them goes over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a possibility,'' Condon said tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there seemed to be no support on the court for South
Carolina's view that the same analysis that proved fatal to the
Brady gun control law also applied to the driver privacy law. In
the Brady case, Printz vs. United States, the constitutional flaw
that the majority found was that the law ``commandeered'' services
of local officials to administer a federal program.
</P>
<P>
   But under the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act, Scalia said,
``they haven't commandeered at all.'' He added: ``No one can give
out the information. Federal law doesn't require you affirmatively
to do anything. You can just sit on your hands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of the various constitutional battlegrounds on which the
federalism wars are being fought, the 10th Amendment has the
sharpest conflict within the court. Its text is opaque, providing
only that power not expressly given to the federal government, nor
prohibited to the states ``are reserved to the states respectively,
or to the people.'' The court has seesawed three times in 25 years
over whether the 10th amendment permitted Congress to apply federal
wage and hour regulations to state employees. Most recently, in a
1985 decision called Garcia vs. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit
Authority, the court ruled by a 5-4 vote that it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was Garcia wrongly decided?'' Souter asked Condon.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general replied that the court did not need
to revisit that issue in order to decide this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might need to,'' O'Connor said. ``That's the point.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the driver privacy law, the 4th Circuit gave
its own twist to the Garcia decision, interpreting it more narrowly
than most other courts to permit Congress to regulate state
activities only as part of a general regulation of the private
sector. Since only states operate motor vehicle bureaus, the 4th
Circuit held, the Garcia precedent did not authorize the regulation
in question.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman disputed this interpretation. ``Congress must have the
ability to tailor its laws to the problem at hand,'' he said. He
said that in enacting the law, Congress had determined that the
release of personal information from drivers' records threatened
not only privacy but personal safety; in one well-known incident
that spurred the legislative effort, an actress, Rebecca Schaeffer,
was stalked and killed by a man who got her address from motor
vehicle records although her address and phone number were
unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   One complicating element in this case is a new congressional
approach to driver privacy, incorporated into the appropriations
bill for the Transportation Department that President Clinton
signed in October. For the next fiscal year, it makes states'
adherence to the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act a condition of
receiving federal highway money. The justices expressed some
puzzlement about the new law but seemed to agree with both sides
that it did not make the issues in Wednesday's case moot.

RECALLING THE ARMY'S FIRST BLACK PARACHUTE BATTALION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by the official military history of World War II, the
555th Parachute Infantry Battalion could hardly have been less
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns: None
</P>
<P>
   Battles: None
</P>
<P>
   Losses in action: None
</P>
<P>
   The official record does not even begin to tell the tale of the
nation's first black paratroopers, men who succeeded despite having
been programmed to fail, athletes and college boys whose desire for
combat was rejected for social reasons, soldiers who finally
distinguished themselves in a semisecret effort to thwart a
Japanese attempt to set the Pacific northwest aflame with
incendiary bombs borne by high-altitude balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integration of the army rode in on the backs of the 555,''
said Bradley Biggs, who was a young second lieutenant, the first
officer assigned to the unit. Biggs, who retired as a lieutenant
colonel in 1961, subsequently headed the Boston Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   From 1941 until the present, Americans have honored whites who
rushed to the defense of their country in what has been widely
accepted as ``the good war.'' Only in recent years have they begun
to appreciate the blacks who soldiered loyally in the face of
demeaning, discriminatory treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am invited to the different camps now for Black History
Month or Veterans Day, and I see the Army integrated, male and
female, black and white and red and yellow, all colors of people
working together, it is so uplifting,'' said Walter Morris, 78, the
first black man to receive paratrooper's wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back when we couldn't go into a post exchange _ even
in uniform,'' said Morris, a native of Waynesboro, Ga., who grew up
in Newark, N.J. More than a half century after the fact, his voice
is softly incredulous. ``They let (white) prisoners of war go in
and sit down and have a Coke and not their own soldiers. Young
people now can hardly believe it when we tell them, but that is
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   About one million blacks served in the US armed forces in World
War II, and a few _ notably the now-famous Tuskegee airmen and the
Buffalo division infantry _ distinguished themselves in combat. The
overwhelming majority never got the chance; they were assigned to
service companies, where they were little more than servants to
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was made acting first sergeant of such a company, serving
a white paratroop corps at Fort Benning in Georgia. The unit's sole
duty was guarding the barracks, training fields, and aircraft that
the white paratroopers used.
</P>
<P>
   Housed next to the calisthenics field, where day after day they
watched white paratrooper candidates training, the blacks were
commanded by a white officer who had washed out of paratroop school
and spent his days in the officers' club awaiting reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale and self-esteem among the men was as low as it could
get,'' Morris said. ``We were walking around with empty guns doing
guard duty from 4 p.m. to 8 the next morning, 24 hours on weekends.
They wouldn't even give us live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not like the Tuskegee airmen, who were for the most
part college graduates,'' he said. ``We were blue-collar folks and
these guys were looking at themselves as servants. I thought it
would help them to go through the training routine of those white
paratroop students.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, all the blacks not on guard duty were running onto the
training fields on the double and going through training drills
daily when the whites departed. Behavior, attitude, and appearance
improved as they began to feel like trainees and act like soldiers.
They were not servants any more.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Brigadier General Ridgley A. Gaither,
commander of the parachute school, passed the training area at a
time when it normally would have been empty. He saw the field
filled with black soldiers, and instructed an aide to find out what
was going on. Morris was summoned to headquarters the next morning
to speak with Gaither.
</P>
<P>
   Gaither ``was tough, but he was straight as an arrow,'' Morris
said. ``When I finished explaining, he said he was going to let me
in on a secret _ that in a few weeks the Army was going to
authorize a company of black paratroopers.'' The general asked
whether Morris would like to be the first sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so glad, my heart just about jumped out of my chest,''
Morris said. ``How I got back to my office, I don't know. Maybe I
flew back on wings. I honestly don't remember going.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first year of the war, black leaders, including A.
Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, and Benjamin Oliver Davis, the first
black general, had been pressing President Roosevelt to open up
more opportunities to blacks in defense industries and in the armed
services. Now, halfway through the conflict, the effects were
percolating down to the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a visit by Davis to the Buffalo Division, stationed at
Camp Robinson in Arkansas, that set Biggs on the road to being the
first officer assigned to the 555th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to talk with him about the shabby treatment of black
officers. We were being pushed around like we were animals,'' Biggs
said. ``He told me, `Keep your temper, curb your tongue, because
things are going to be breaking for you. There's going to be guys
going into all areas.' He mentioned the paratroopers and that
struck my ear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army sent Biggs and five other black officers to Fort
Benning to run the new unit, which was started as a platoon _ the
smallest military unit _ despite Roosevelt's expressed desire that
it be a battalion. Biggs and the other original members of the
555th took this as indicative of senior commanders' conviction that
they would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were programmed for failure, and we were determined
none of us was going to quit,'' Biggs said. ``We were not only
trying to prove those people wrong, we felt the entire nation, the
entire Negro race was looking at us. We said we would soldier right
down to the wire, that no matter what job came along we were going
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one candidate for the initial platoon wa unable to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Once the others earned their wings, other blacks were allowed to
volunteer, and they came in droves, from Europe, the Pacific
theater, and posts around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a paratrooper, you had to come in as a private, but we
had sergeants coming anyway,'' Morris said. ``They were so anxious
to become real soldiers that they gave up their stripes gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, ``we were ready for combat and we thought we were going
overseas,'' Morris said. ``What we didn't know was General
Eisenhower and General Mark Clark (commander of the Italian
theater) didn't have any intention of having black paratroopers,''
because they feared friction with whites. ``We thought, `maybe the
Pacific,' and when the order came to move West for a secret
mission. we thought we were going to General MacArthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 555th was sent to Camp Pendleton, Oregon, where
they learned that numerous incendiary bombs, launched from Japan on
helium balloons, had been exploding in the American West, starting
forest fires and, at one point, endangering the nuclear reactor
where components of US atomic weapons were being made.
</P>
<P>
   The number of bombs reaching the US was far greater than the
public _ or the Japanese _ were aware, and the 555th was assigned
to detonate unexploded bombs and fight the fires. To avoid
panicking the public, and to keep the Japanese ignorant of the
success rate _ in all, nearly 300 of the bombs landed _ the
operation was to be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the end of the war, and almost a year before
President Truman ordered the desegregation of the armed services,
the military leadership paid its greatest compliment to the 555th:
It ended the life of the battalion by dispersing it into previously
all-white paratroop units. Its members became some of first black
soldiers ever to give orders to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``when I look ahead, I think about Texas, where they picked
up this black man and chained him to a pickup truck, and I think
`Damn, we haven't moved an inch,' '' Morris said. ``But that's not
true. We have. There's just still a long way to go. This is our
country, and we have to fight for it. We have to keep on keeping
on.''

PARCELLS NAMES LUCAS TO START   AGAINST PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Even winning was not enough to keep Rick Mirer
as the New York Jets' starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, who had been lukewarm in assessing Mirer
after Sunday's victory over the mediocre Cardinals, sent Mirer to
the bench Wednesday and brought back the inexperienced, but eager,
Ray Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than Lucas could have bargained for: Next Monday
night, in New England, where he began his so-far unfulfilled NF L
career in 1996, Lucas will get his second start at quarterback, and
in prime time on national television.
</P>
<P>
   His elevation should be a jolt to his former teammates, Lucas
admitted. They remember him primarily as a rookie on the practice
squad and as a special-teams player. ``I think anyone who sees me
now is thinking, `Wow, this kid came a long way,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer had directed the Jets to two victories in six appearances
as the starter. Lucas' only previous career start came on Oct. 17
against the Colts. Lucas provided a spark, as Parcells had hoped,
and the Jets were tied in the final period. But from the Colts'
3-yard line, looking for Keyshawn Johnson, Lucas was intercepted.
The turnover set up the field goal that defeated the Jets. On the
game's final play, Lucas was sacked and suffered a sprained ankle.
He sat out the next two games.
</P>
<P>
   The switch from Mirer to Lucas will be the 11th quarterback
shift in Parcells' two and a half seasons with the Jets.
Altogether, he has started five different players at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again,'' Johnson said. ``Round and round we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he simply needed more offensive production. ``The
relevant factor is I just don't feel we can continue at this
pace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Mirer, the Jets, who are 2-6, are averaging 14 points a
game. In three of his six starts, Mirer failed to direct a
touchdown drive by halftime. On third downs, the Jets' major
problem area, he is a 42 percent passer, ranking him 29th out of 31
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Mirer showed little emotion after being told of the
change by quarterback coach Dan Henning. ``There was nothing to
say,'' Mirer said. ``When decisions like that are made, they're
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells would not be specific on what he wanted Lucas to do
differently. ``It comes down to getting your team in the end zone
and not making bad plays,'' Parcells said. ``I've got to say Rick
didn't make many bad plays. But with Ray you risk that _ the thing
is whether he can offset the mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is a high-energy performer who, as a rookie out of
Rutgers, hooked up with Parcells at New England three years ago.
But Lucas was a special-teams player, running upfield and downfield
on kickoffs and punts. He did much the same with the Jets in 1997,
when he followed Parcells here. He did throw four passes in relief
of Neil O'Donnell that season. Then last year, Parcells decided
Lucas would get a trial as a backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Wednesday's shift brought a smirk to Johnson's face.
Since his rookie season in 1996, he has received passes from seven
different quarterbacks. ``The way this is going, by Thursday
there's going to be a different quarterback,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What will Johnson tell Lucas?
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing I told him last game: just be patient,'' he
said. ``I told him his talents will carry him. The first throw of
the game, you'd think he was a 10-year man.''
</P>
<P>
   That first throw was on the money to Johnson. But there was also
at least one high throw that Johnson grabbed, getting belted by the
defender because he was extended too far. ``I'm going to tell him
to get all the high throws out of his system in practice,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer threw the winning touchdown pass to Johnson last Sunday, a
43-yarder; the receiver left his route, but Mirer adjusted with
him, hitting Johnson in stride in the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the kind of play I could do with Vinny,'' said
Johnson, referring to Vinny Testaverde, who suffered a torn
Achilles' tendon in the opening game, ending his season.
</P>
<P>
   But in Johnson's view, there have not been enough of those
plays. ``They call plays, but they're just not getting thrown to
me,'' he said. ``Maybe that's why Parcells is making a change. I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, perhaps the only surprised player in the locker room,
said he had learned something from his only start. ``Yeah, don't
throw an interception on the 3-yard line,'' he said.

<P>
   Andruw Jones is glad to have his name in the news for something
other than a Ken Griffey Jr. trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' 22-year-old center-fielding phenom won his second
consecutive Gold Glove as one of the top three defensive
outfielders in the National League, Rawlings announced Wednesday.
Jones won his first Gold Glove last season in only his second full
season in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   This season he led all major-league outfielders with 492 putouts
and was tied for sixth among National League outfielders with 13
assists. He committed 10 errors, up from only two in 1998. But most
of them were aggressive mistakes, something he doesn't apologize
for.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' defensive highlight of the season came on Aug. 9 when he
made a wall-scaling, over-the-shoulder catch of a Bill Spiers shot
to the deepest part of center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get an award like that,'' Jones said. ``It shows
you're one of the best outfielders, (since there) are only three
people that win it. It means a lot. After you're done (playing),
you can see that in your trophy case.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose name has been tossed around the most in
Griffey-trade scenarios, is glad that the Braves appear not to be
considering giving him up and that the trade talk is beginning to
die down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Jones said. ``It'd be hard to leave, but I
guess baseball continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitcher Greg Maddux won an unprecedented 10th consecutive
Gold Glove award as the best defensive pitcher in the National
League. Maddux was in a tie with Bob Gibson for the N.L. lead after
winning his ninth Gold Glove last season.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who has played in the majors for 14 years, needs six
more Gold Gloves to catch Jim Kaat for the most Gold Gloves won by
a pitcher overall. Kaat, who played in both leagues, won 16.
Maddux, known for his quick-reacting stabs at line drives and
choppers back to the mound, has committed only 28 errors this
decade, including four this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were the only other NL team with two Gold Glove
winners, third baseman Robin Ventura and shortstop Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' Pokey Reese won the Gold Glove for second base. The
other National League winners were the Giants' J.T. Snow at first
base, the Rockies' Larry Walker in the outfield, the Diamondbacks'
Steve Finley in the outfield, and the Phillies' Mike Lieberthal at
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Gloves awards are voted on by the National League managers
and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate award, Braves manager Bobby Cox finished second in
the voting for National League manager of the year to Cincinnati's
Jack McKeon. McKeon had 115 points to Cox's 98 points and received
17 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers of America to Cox's
10.

 &HT;    Return to East Lake
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is fate. East Lake Golf Club walked away with
pleasant memories after being the host of the Tour Championship in
1998. But for the Champions Club in Houston, the event became a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bringing together the PGA Tour's top 30 players to
show their skills, it assembled 29 others to mourn the death of
U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cross, who will direct the 2000 Tour Championship at East
Lake, sympathized with how such a tragedy affected Houston's
two-year effort and its 1,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody did a great job pulling together,'' Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   Cross and his Atlanta vice chairmen did not feel the need to
attend the event in Houston because they learned how to run a
successful Tour Championship a year ago. And nobody can remember
the last time a new venue was the host of an established golf event
with such near-flawless efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magic,'' Cross said. ``It really was.''
</P>
<P>
   Things went so smoothly at East Lake, Bobby Jones' boyhood
course refurbished five years ago, that the PGA Tour announced a
return to East Lake in 2000 before Hal Sutton had beaten Vijay
Singh on the first playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the Tour Championship started with the highest
expectations and ended with all those expectations having been
reached,'' said Bob Combs, the PGA Tour's senior vice president for
public relations and communications. ``There was positive feedback
every day of the tournament, from the course to the facility to the
weather to the general sense of history at East Lake. And most of
all, the players were excited about East Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   And if and when the PGA Tour establishes a permanent four-city
rotation for the Tour Championship, Combs said, ``Atlanta certainly
has established itself as a contender for that kind of status.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 2000 tournament Nov. 2-5, a week later than 1998 and
1999, another week of 80-degree temperatures is not likely to be
matched. But even at 15 degrees cooler, conditions would be
pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Although some talk existed after last year's Tour Championship
about increasing the par to 71 and making the fifth hole a par-5,
the change doesn't seem likely. The fifth fairway will be widened
by about 10 yards on the long par-4, which will allow the ball to
hit the down slope and remain in the fairway. The 10th hole will
stay a tough, par-4, although it plays as a par-5 the rest of the
year for East Lake members.
</P>
<P>
   East Lake's Bermuda rough might be the most altered. Left at 4-5
inches last fall to penalize missed fairways, the rough is expected
to be at 2-3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's return Tour Championship could gain another bit of
good fortune over Houston. The players want money from WGC events
to be unofficial. If that becomes policy, then the 2000 Tour
Championship, like 1998, again will be the last word for
determining the money champion, the Vardon Trophy winner for
scoring average and the player of the year.

 &HT;    Lewis hopes to take judges out of his bout
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Lennox Lewis looked down at his two, massive
clinched fists. Then he declared them lethal beyond their intended
purpose for Saturday night's heavyweight championship unification
bout with Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge and jury,'' he said. ``I'm bringing my own two judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' stance is a direct response to the controversial ruling
on his March 13 fight with Holyfield in New York's Madison Square
Garden _ and to decisions in other fights in recent months that
have drawn criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In Lewis' case, his fight was ruled a draw by the three judges,
even though the pervasive opinion of observers was that he won the
match handily over Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Lewis said he will take matters into his own hands _
literally _ on Saturday and out of the those of the judges. ``I
have real confidence in the Nevada Boxing Commission,'' he said.
``I believe they are aboveboard. But I'm going to go for a knockout
if the opportunity presents itself. Then we won't have to worrry
about the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the March decision _ and to a lesser degree, including
Felix Trinidad's more recent decision over Oscar De la Hoya and the
Mike Tyson fiasco against Orlin Norris _ the subject of judges'
scoring has been an open debate. So has the state of boxing, which
continues to take several body blows, because of questionable
decisions and uninspiring competition in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfield-Lewis bout carries more significance than just the
unification of the heavyweight championship. In the bigger picture,
it's boxing last chance this year, and in the 1900s, to save itself
from itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing is not a bad game,'' Holyfield said. ``It just has bad
people. We just have to weed out those people.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, ``those people'' include promoter Don King. ``There's
only one Don King,'' he said. ``In the back of my mind, I'm
thinking: `Boy, anything can happen.' There are always funny things
happening when Don King is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to look into the judges, because there could be
some underhanded stuf,'' Lewis said. ``If the promoters are looking
for favors (from judges), the judges are thinking `Where is my next
meal coming from?'
</P>
<P>
   ``A fix, I'll never say it will not happen,'' he said. ``But I
do believe (that March 13) was an aberration. Boxing never had a
clean book. I realize things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's fixing in boxing, it's not in the judges being
paid,'' Hoylfield's attorney, Jim Thomas, said. ``It's in the
matchmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   King is the ultimate matchmaker. ``I'm promoting the fight,''
King said. ``Everybody has to come to grips with this: This thing
ain't about Don King or Bob Arum. It's easy to attack me. This is
about Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevada Boxing Commissioner Marc Ratner shuns such talk and
professes to be happy with the judges for Saturday night: Jerry
Roth, Chuck Giampa and Bill Graham. Together, they have judged more
than 200 championship fights, and all have solid reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who the judges are,'' Holyfield said. ``I
don't pay attention to the judges, because I don't look for any
favors. If you let it fall into the judges' hands, anything can
happen. You've got to go in there and fight. . . . It would help if
the judges were more accountable (for bad decisions). But do people
make mistakes? Yes. The judges are there if you, the fighter, don't
do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he prefers the so-called open scoring, where a
judge's score is posted for all to see after each round. ``Let the
public see the scoring every couple of rounds,'' he said. ``Let
everyone know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Holyfield, that system would result in chaos.
``What would happen if you do show the scoring?'' he asked
rhetorically. ``A guy would say, `I'm ahead. Why should I fight?'
He'll dance and do all he can to hold on. What happens then? Do the
judges go back and change their cards?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have more fights in the stands. Somebody would say,
`They're cheating.' And then the fan of the other guy would get
mad, and they'd start fighting. There's one thing about boxing:
People want to see someone win or lose. There'd be a lot of fights,
because people can't control their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the debate rages. The solution, everyone agrees, lies in
education. And ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't keep saying it was a bad decision,'' Lewis'
trainer, Emanuel Steward, said. ``They have to actually suspend
these people and have their license taken away. The judging
situation is not good at all. Some judges come into the fight with
their minds already determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Determining a scoring blow is another area of concern. ``What is
a good jab and an effective punch?'' Holyfield asked. ``It's
someone's opinion. A punch should break down the fighter. Scoring
is about will, effective punches, aggression, scoring punches.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also about opinion. ``That's why they are called `judges,'
`` Holyfield trainer Don Turner said. ``People like certain things.
It's a personal call. You're dealing with people's emotions. And
most judges have been taught by someone who never has been in the
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``School should be open, and these people should be taught what
to look for in judging a fight,'' Lewis said. ``Right now, some
score on aggression, some score on jabs, (and) some score on body
punches.''
</P>
<P>
   The shots the sport has taken clearly dissatisfied many. And
yet, the game continues. ``A fact of life is that people love
boxing,'' Holyfield said. ``It's a replica of life. . . . Boxing
definitely needs something. I can't say right now what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   What it needs on Saturday is a well-contested fight without a
controversial decision by the judges, referees _ anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, in an understatement, said, ``We could use a good, solid
fight.''

   Hooliganism worries in Euro 2000c. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Fears of hooliganism put a halt to the England-Scotland rivalry
a decade ago. But similar concerns going into their Euro 2000
playoff encounter this weekend have been hyped in the tabloids and
practically nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the recent playing form of the ``Auld Enemies'' has
been nothing to get excited about. Things are so placid that the
main point of contention has been Scottish complaints that they
have been allocated only a handful of tickets for Wednesday's
second leg at London's Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When the two teams line up for Saturday's opener in Hampden Park
in Glasgow, it will be the 109th renewal of a series played
annually, except during both World Wars, from 1872 through 1989.
England's record of 44-40-24 includes a 2-0 win over Scotland
during the 1996 European Championships, their last meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the other playoff series, also kicking off this weekend,
Slovenia plays the Ukraine, Israel takes on Denmark and the
Republic of Ireland meets Turkey. The four winners will take the
last remaining spots in next season's 16-team finals in Holland and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   England, which ``earned'' a playoff spot by virtue of Sweden's
defeat of Poland on the final day of group play, will be looking to
reverse a mediocre stretch of play under boss Kevin Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in months, the English are relatively healthy
on the attack, but Keegan's main problem might be finding the right
partner up front with captain Alan Shearer. The Newcastle star has
been playing well lately, as has Manchester United's Andy Cole, who
recently blasted his lack of call-ups to the England side because
of ``golden boy'' treatment afforded to Shearer. Cole's spectacular
bicycle-kick goal against Leicester City on Saturday might make it
hard to leave him on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be a problem with those two,'' Keegan
said. Liverpool's Michael Owen finally seems fit to take on a
larger role.
</P>
<P>
   The Scots are limping badly. Celtic midfielder Paul Lambert is
out after breaking his jaw making a hard tackle in Sunday's game
with Rangers. Defender Colin Hendry was named to the squad despite
being out of Rangers' lineup the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Barca, Lazio favored
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers have installed Barcelona and Italian Serie A leader
Lazio as the favorites after the draw last week for the
second-round groups.
</P>
<P>
   Barca should romp in Group A against Sparta Prague, Porto and
Hertha Berlin. Group D might be the toughest with Lazio, Chelsea,
Olympique Marseille and Feyenoord.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Manchester United is clustered in a
substantial Group B field that includes Fiorentina, Bordeaux and
Valencia. Group C also should be tough, with Real Madrid, Bayern
Munich, Norwegian champion Rosenborg and Dynamo Kyiv.
</P>
<P>
   Play resumes Nov. 23 and stretches into March. The top two clubs
in each group advance to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the UEFA Cup, five Italian teams remain among the last 32,
including defending champion Parma, which takes on Sturm Graz in a
two-leg series starting Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Inter takes a dive
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was AC Milan's turn to cry after being bounced out
of the Champions League. Now, crosstown rival Inter Milan is in the
dumps after losing 3-0 to Bologna. Kennet Andersson scored twice
for Bologna, which is 3-0 under new coach Francesco Guidolin....
Juan Veron scored a goal from the corner-kick spot and had two
assists as Lazio trounced Verona 4-0. However, Veron suffered a
knee injury and had to be taken off the field.... Torino earned a
0-0 draw with Juventus in the first Serie A Turin derby since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Raul rescues Real
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid's dramatic 3-2 win over Rayo Vallecano on Saturday
took some of the heat off embattled manager John Toshack. A
splendid chip shot from Raul Gonzalez with five minutes to play
capped the comeback for Real, which trailed 2-0 at halftime....
Barcelona blew a chance to take the Primera Division lead and lost
2-1 at lowly Malaga.... Zaragoza moved into second place by beating
Alaves 2-1. Both goals came from Savo Milosevic, who has 12 for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: K'lautern pulls one out
</P>
<P>
   After getting off to a bad start in the Bundesliga,
Kaiserslautern is moving up the table with some late-match
dramatics. On Sunday, the club scored twice in the final six
minutes to beat Schalke 2-1. Martin Wagner equalized in the 84th
minute, while Youri Djorkaeff's penalty kick with a minute to play
was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico: Bebeto wants out
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that he hasn't been paid for several weeks, former
Brazilian World Cup star Bebeto says he will leave dismal Toros
Neza at the end of the season. The 35-year-old striker has scored
one goal while battling injuries with the club, which has the worst
record in the Torneo Invierno at 3-9-3 and 12 points. Bebeto
indicated that he won't honor the terms of a two-year contract
signed over the summer. ``There's no way I'm staying here that
long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil: Flamengo flames out
</P>
<P>
   The national championship season comes down to its final round
this weekend, with several surprise teams having reached the
eight-team playoffs. Ponte Preta stunned first-place Corinthians
2-1 Sunday to qualify for the first time since 1985. High-profile
Flamengo has been eliminated, and Libertadores Cup champion
Palmeiras is on the edge. Cruzeiro took the lead with a 5-2 win
over Parana, getting four goals from Alex Alves, who leads the
league with 20 goals.

JUSTICES WEIGH CITY LAW BANNING NUDE DANCING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, delving into the issue of
freedom of erotic expression Wednesday, weighed the
constitutionality of a local Pennsylvania ordinance that prohibits
nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Karle of Eri defended the city's law as a
constitutionally valid way to outlaw all public displays of nudity,
not just nude dancing. But attorney John Weston, representing a
nude-dancing establishment, said the ordinance was directed
primarily at that form of entertainment, in violation of the
owner's First Amendment right of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   The justices appeared divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several, including Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H.
Souter, criticized the ordinance as a translucent effort by city
leaders to ban nude dancing under the guise of prohibiting all
public nudity. Others, such as Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, expressed the view that the law was a
constitutional way to eliminate the controversial dance.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, in a legal brief to the justices, joined 13 other states
in urging the high court to uphold the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger issue in this case involves the extent to which
states and local governments will be permitted to exercise their
traditional police powers to promote the public health, safety and
morals of their citizens by regulating undesirable conduct without
being found to have violated the First Amendment,'' the states
wrote. ``Thus, the issues raised in this case implicate more than
just nude dancing, and are of critical importance to the states'
ability to vindicate and protect the morals of their citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has struck down the law as a
violation of the First Amendment. The court held that the clear
intent of the law was to ban nude dancing, which the state judges
called a constitutionally protected form of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Karle, city solicitor for Erie, urged the justices to overrule
the Pennsylvania court and hold the law to be a valid method for
protecting the welfare of city residents. He said the ordinance is
constitutional because it does not single out nude dancing but
rather bans all public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor noted that the law contains a preamble that
expressly states that the measure was enacted in response to a
disturbing rise in the number of nude-dancing establishments in
Erie. The ordinance might be unconstitutional if it was intended to
address a ``specific problem'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Souter echoed O'Connor's concerns that the law was designed
primarily to attack nude dancing. He also noted that Erie made no
effort to shut down the critically acclaimed play ``Equus'' when
the production was onstage in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ```Equus' is left alone,`` Souter said. ''The barroom dancing is
not left alone.``
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in an apparent effort to help Karle
defend the ordinance, said a preamble is meaningless if the words
of the ordinance do not single out activities that are banned.
Scalia, noting its general prohibition on nudity, said the law
would prohibit people from prancing down Main Street ``in the
buff'' as well as nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia also said, with regard to Equus, that perhaps a legally
significant distinction can be drawn between smut and nudity that
has ``redeeming artistic or social value.``
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Stephen G. Breyer interjected that the First
Amendment does not permit such fine distinctions between
expressions, saying that ``a low brow kind of art'' might be as
constitutionally permissible as a fine play.
</P>
<P>
   Karle, responding to the justices, said the letter of the law
would allow the city to ban the nude scenes in Equus.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, however, assailed the law as a ``charade'' and said the
target of the statute is not all public nudity but just nude
dancing. The First Amendment historically protects even unpopular
forms of expression, added Weston of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is terribly hostile with respect to these
businesses,'' Weston said of nude dancing. ``Dance, itself, is a
recognized form of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, however, appeared unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in the case,
Erie, Pa., vs. Kandyland, by July.
</P>
<P>
   However, several justices raised concerns during the hourlong
argument that perhaps the court should dismiss the case as moot.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Panos, the former owner of Kandyland, the nude-dancing
establishment, sold the property after the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court decision. Weston, Kandyland's attorney, had urged the
justices to dismiss the case before argument, but the justices
rejected the motion without comment.

UN PROSECUTOR SAYS SERBIA A HAVEN FOR WAR CRIMINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Serbia has become a haven for indicted war
criminals from across the former Yugoslavia, the chief prosecutor
of the UN's International Criminal Tribunal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Del Ponte said some of the 30 indicted war criminals still
at large from Yugoslavia's ethnic wars have crossed into the
republic of Serbia, where they are being harbored by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, himself an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that Serbia is becoming a safe haven for indicted war
criminals who have been accused of serious crimes in Croatia,
Bosnia and Kosovo,'' Del Ponte told the Security Council. ``This
situation cannot be allowed to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte returned this week from her first visit to the former
Yugoslavia where she personally inspected exhumed mass graves in
Kosovo. She said the tribunal has examined 195 of 529 known grave
sites, slightly more than a third, and has uncovered 2,108 bodies
so far, nearly all Kosovar Albanians. More than 4,000 bodies were
reported to have been in the 159 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's findings are the most substantive account so far
of the Serbs' campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has reports of 11,334 dead in Kosovo from various
sources, including the media and eyewitnesses, Del Ponte said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte also said she is pressing NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia
to make more arrests there. ``I will continue to press for
increasingly strong action against all those accused, including
those at the highest level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far only 14 people indicted by the tribunal have been
detained by SFOR, the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte conceded that a prosecutor doesn't normally need to
push the police to make arrests. ``It's true, a public prosecutor
must just give an arrest warrant. But SFOR is military, not a
police group. I am asking them to not just meet a fugitive
somewhere, but to search for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials have voiced frustration that NATO troops have
not arrested the two biggest suspects in Bosnia _ Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, General Ratko
Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, outgoing president of the tribunal,
told the General Assembly this week that ``SFOR needs to arrest
them, very simple. What does it take? It takes action.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte Wednesday predicted more arrests in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   While Serbia harbors alleged war criminals, Croatia has also
proven an obstacle for Del Ponte, the former attorney general of
Switzerland, who was known for pursuing mafiosi, terrorists and
money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   Zagreb has refused to hand over evidence that could implicate
its army and police in alleged crimes against Serb civilians when
they were driven out of central and southern Croatia in two
lightning attacks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow Croatia to withhold its cooperation because
unilaterally it decides that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to
investigate the actions of its armed services,'' Del Ponte told the
council. ``It is essential . . . that states are not permitted to
dictate what events shall and shall not be investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said she will also look into possible NATO war crimes
during its air campaign against Yugoslavia, though she said it was
not a priority. Belgrade says thousands of civilians were killed by
NATO bombs.

EGYPTAIR 990 FLYING NORMALLY, EARLY TAPE DATA SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preliminary data from one of the black boxes of
EgyptAir Flight 990 offered no clear mechanical reason why the
Cairo-bound jet plummeted from its cruising altitude and crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean last month, killing all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an uneventful flight and the airplane was cruising at
flight level 33,000 feet,'' said James E. Hall, chairman of the
National Transportation and Safety Board at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first event of note is the autopilot disconnect and eight
seconds later the airplane begins what appears to be a controlled
descent. Data indicates the airplane descended to about 19,000
feet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A controlled descent means that the flight crew was in command
of the airplane. And aviation specialists said an autopilot can be
disconnected manually or if a pilot commands the plane to
counteract it, much like an automobile's cruise control, which
disengages when brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   While the data also indicated that the plane's thrust reversers
_ a focus of early speculation _ did not deploy in flight,
investigators were left with no mechanical clue as to why what
seemed to be a perfectly good airplane would begin a terrifying
roller-coaster ride before breaking apart in the sky some 60 miles
south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no smoking gun,'' said John Hansman, professor of
aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were even more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to solve it, it will be on the voice recorder;
otherwise we are in big trouble,'' said one investigator speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Hall acknowledged as much Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We await information off the cockpit voice recorder,'' he
said. ``When it is recovered, that can help us put this information
in context.''
</P>
<P>
   The recorder, the second of two so-called ``black boxes,'' is a
30-minute continuous tape loop which records cockpit conversation
as well as many noises in the cabin, which can yield important
clues about the performance of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   As the hunt for that device continued, weather at the crash site
worsened Wednesday, driving many of the high-tech vessels,
including the USS Grapple, to safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The ship Carolyn Chouest remained on site and its submersible
drone, the Magnum, continued to hunt for the cockpit voice
recorder, picking through a stack of aircraft debris on the sandy
ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder, which monitored at least 155 separate
functions of the 10-year-old airplane ranging from speed to the
position of flaps on the wings, was pulled from the ocean floor
early Tuesday morning and flown to Washington for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Search crews found it even though the underwater locator, which
emits a pinging noise, had become separated from the recorder.
Investigators noticed the orange-colored box on videotape as the
USS Grapple's Deep Drone was targeting the pinger.
</P>
<P>
   At the briefing Wednesday, Hall stressed that the data obtained
from the flight data recorder was preliminary and that specialists
from government and industry will keep working to glean more
information from the device.
</P>
<P>
   The data released Wednesday indicates everything was normal from
the time the Boeing 767-300ER left New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport early on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Since the preliminary analysis indicates the plane's systems and
operations were functioning properly, the investigator said, the
possibility of a criminal act _ either terrorism or some deliberate
act by a crew member _ had to be considered more prominently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one might be an FBI issue,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansman said the flight data recorder information appears to
rule out a mechanical or hydraulic failure which could have
resulted in an uncommanded movement of the plane's flaps or
elevator sending it into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential now for a human-induced cause, but we
don't know that yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said about five to 10 seconds of data remains to be
extracted from the flight data recorder, which ends at that point.
Officials presume the power supply to the flight data recorder
ended at the same time the plane's transponder stopped working when
the airplane reached 16,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the plane did not reach supersonic speed in its
initial dive, as some specialists had speculated. He said the data
from the flight recorder and radar tracks are consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Once the plane's transponder failed, Federal Aviation
Administration radar had no way of determining the plane's
altitude. But Air Force radar indicates the plane climbed to about
24,000 feet before beginning one last dive and breaking apart
before hitting the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the plane lost electrical power, which
would have shut down the transponder and the flight data recorder,
when it began to climb again, or if the loss was somehow connected
to the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said all the information gleaned from the flight data
recorder was shared with Egyptian authorities before he held the
briefing. Egyptian officials will assist in the further analysis of
the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Though it hasn't been located yet, Hall noted that the pinger
from the cockpit voice recorder is still operating and the Magnum
is continuing to search for the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we have gotton to the point where we are not confused
(by two pingers) anymore,'' he said.

JUSTICES WEIGH STATES' RIGHTS AGAINST FEDERAL DRIVER'S LICENSE LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An inquisitive Supreme Court on Wednesday
considered whether states must comply with a federal law
prohibiting them from publicly selling the personal information
gleaned from driver's license applications.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the controversial law, the 1994 Driver's Privacy
Protection Act, after it was revealed that Rebecca Schaeffer's
killer, Robert John Bardo, tracked down the California home address
of the television actress through state motor-vehicle records in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, defending the law before the
justices, said Congress' constitutional authority to regulate
interstate commerce allows the federal government to bar states
from selling their license information. U.S. Solicitor General Seth
Waxman, the administration's chief advocate at the high court,
added that the federal restriction on the information sale is
necessary to protect the privacy of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon countered
that the law unconstitutionally intrudes on the state's sovereign
right to decide what it does with information it collects from its
residents. Condon argued that the U.S. government has no authority
to deputize state officials, in this case motor-vehicle agency
employees, and require them to participate in a federal program.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, however, appeared to be as divided on the issue as
the government attorneys who argued before them.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Anthony M. Kennedy, for
example, peppered Waxman with questions indicating their view that
Congress overstepped its authority in prohibiting states from
selling the information. But Justices Antonin Scalia and David H.
Souter were just as persistent in attacking Condon's argument,
noting that the federal government often imposes requirements on
states.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of driver's license records can be quite lucrative for
states, as New York in one recent year earned $17 million from
individuals and businesses who sought access to the information,
the federal government reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the federal
restriction on the sale of driver's license information violates
the constitutional separation between federal and state
governmental authority.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman, in urging the justices to uphold the law, said Congress
restricted the sale of information in light of computer advances
that now enable personal data to be transmitted to many places at
the same time. People should not have to surrender their privacy
when they apply for driver's licenses, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to tie your address and your picture to a license
plate is the equivalent of walking around with a sign that says,
`My name is Seth Waxman,''' Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although states have an interest in the information they
collect, the federal government has an overriding duty to protect
its citizens, Waxman said. A national law to protect privacy is
necessary because states could otherwise sell the information to an
individual across the continent without any regard for the person's
motives, he added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Schaeffer's killer could easily have been someone
from New York who chose to buy information gleaned from California
driver's licenses, Waxman argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist expressed concern that the law requires state
employees to become, in effect, federal agents who then enforce the
government's plan to bar the sale of driver's licence information.
The chief justice cited the Supreme Court's 1997 Printz vs. United
States decision prohibiting Congress from ordering state police to
conduct federal criminal background checks on people seeking to buy
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, echoing Rehnquist, said the law's imposition on state
officials ``blurs the line'' between federal and state authority.
``This you may not do,'' Kennedy added.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman responded that the federal government can regulate state
activities as long as the national law imposes no ``undue burden''
on local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Condon countered that Congress overstepped its authority by
prohibiting states from selling the information. Specifically, he
said state motor-vehicle department workers are being ``pressed
into service'' by the federal government in violation of the 10th
Amendment's limitation on national authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being commandeered by the Congress,'' Condon said of
the state workers. ``Congress has decided that privacy is the issue
du jour.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scalia appeared unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   He said the law does not require state employees to act on
behalf of the federal government. Rather, Scalia said, the law
demands that the workers not act, that they refrain from selling
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't been commandeered at all,'' he added. ``All you
(workers) have to do is sit on your hands. What's so hard about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Scalia, Souter said that the law imposes no additional
burden on state workers that they do not already have under other
federal statutes the Supreme Court has upheld, such as the law
imposing wage-and-hour guarantees for civil employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden argument takes you nowhere,'' Souter told Condon.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected decide the case, Reno vs. Condon, by
July.

MCCAIN (Undated) - John McCain trod a lonely road in a visit to
Michigan Wednesday, a state whose governor has attacked him and
spoken bluntly about McCain's temper. Gov. Engler refused even to
appear with McCain. It was the sort of challenge McCain will face
more and more if he successfully moves beyond New Hampshire and
South Carolina and into states where Bush has locked up support and
where the party faithful have rallied behind the Texas governor.
McCain aides believe Michigan also shows the Bush campaign has
begun to see McCain in the rear-view mirror and has aggressively
sought to attack or snub him.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain faces both an attack and a snub. By JEFF

   Unbeaten three have
</P>
<P>
   something to prove
</P>
<P>
   By Tony Barnhart
</P>
<P>
   For three undefeated top 10 teams, Saturday is about more than
bowls, BCS rankings or even conference championships. It's about
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The ``We get no respect'' theme is overused in sports. But these
three teams might have a case as they head into important games
this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Virginia Tech (8-0): The Hokies are dumbfounded that they
are No. 2 in the polls but No. 3 behind once-beaten Tennessee in
the rankings of the Bowl Championship Series. But those standings
could change if Virginia Tech, at home, beats No. 19 Miami, which
has the second-toughest schedule in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech says the Vols do not deserve a shot at the
national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an opportunity early in the season to take care of
their business against Florida and they didn't get it done,''
defensive end Corey Moore said. ``So stop crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Virginia Tech was this fired up before a home
game, the Hokies crushed Syracuse 62-0.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Kansas State (9-0): The Wildcats are undefeated, including
a win over Texas, but they still are ranked behind Tennessee and
Florida, teams with one loss. Few people believe in K-State, but
that opinion could change Saturday if it wins at No. 7 Nebraska.
The Wildcats have not won at Lincoln since 1968, and Nebraska is
coming off its best performance of the year, the 37-0 thumping of
Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   After Kansas State's lackluster win over Colorado, 20-14, last
week, a lot of folks believe that the Wildcats will get their
comeuppance in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Mississippi State (8-0): The Bulldogs are off to the best
start in school history, but they are living on borrowed time. They
have rallied from double-digit deficits in their past three games.
Mississippi State's schedule is rated No. 94 out of 114 Division I
teams. Mississippi State, however, has a chance to prove itself by
ending the season with wins over a strong trio of opponents,
Alabama on Saturday, followed by Arkansas and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody keeps waiting for the Bulldogs to crumble. It won't
happen, safety Ashley Cooper said, ``We just don't fall down.''

CLINTON DELAYS, ABBREVIATES TRIP TO GREECE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATHENS _ To the delight of Greek leftists, President Clinton
Wednesday delayed and shortened his upcoming trip here to avoid
potentially violent demonstrations against his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development in the Clinton visit is beneficial and not a
detriment to the real national interests,'' said the Communist
Party in a statement Wednesday. ``It gives the Greek people the
strength to intensify its demonstrations so that the US recognizes
the people's sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The party said the Greek government should ``not have free rein
to follow the commands of Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement caused an uproar, and many blamed the Greek
government for failing to find a way to ensure Clinton's safety
while honoring the right of its citizens to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postponement and downgrading of the visit by the American
president to Greece is a blow for the international prestige of our
country at the moment,'' said Stephanos Manos, leader of Greece's
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unfortunate development, in which extremists have seized
control of the foreign policy agenda, should never have been
permitted to transpire,'' said John Sitilides, executive director
of the Washington-based Western Policy Center. ``Greece's national
interests have been undermined by this irrational and reckless
hostility to the US president, at least in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday for an 11-day trip to
Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Italy, and possibly Kosovo. But after
talks between the Greek and US governments over security concerns,
the White House opted to leave Sunday and cram his time in Greece
into a one-day stopover next week.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is meant to avoid having Clinton in Greece on or
before Nov. 17, a traditional day of protest by Greek communists
and other leftists. The date commemorates a student uprising
against the Greek military junta, which ruled Greece from 1967 to
1974 with the tacit support of the US government.
</P>
<P>
   Greek officials insist that the schedule shuffle had more to do
with a US agenda that included issues the Greeks were not prepared
to discuss. The Greek press speculated that Clinton administration
officials panicked at the possibility that violent protesters would
get close to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks ``asked me to do it. Whether the demonstrations had
anything to do with it, I don't know, but they might have,''
Clinton told reporters. ``But I'm not bothered by it. It's going to
happen, and you all get to take picture of it.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart refused to discuss specific
security threats. He said the Greek government believed the visit
would be more productive if it occurred after Clinton visits Turkey
to attend a conference of the Organization on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For many Greeks, the shortening of the trip was an
embarrassment. As the only European Union and NATO member in the
Balkan peninsula, Greece stands out as the most stable and
US-friendly nation in an otherwise volatile and troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around us is going to give him a warm welcome, but in
Greece we again have to do it differently,'' said commentator Nikos
Kakaounakis. Others talked of a ``fiasco'' that will have negative
implications for Greece in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the visit until next week spares Clinton some of the
embarrassment of a hostile reception by the Greek people, most of
whom strongly opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While Greece is an ally and fellow NATO member, simmering
hostility toward the US has long made it a dangerous place for US
diplomats and officials. Many Greeks believe Washington looked the
other way when Turkey invaded and divided the island of Cyprus in
1974.

 &HT;    Gingriches go to court
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's divorce moves to a courtroom for the first time
today as lawyers argue whether 32 questions is really just 32
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Gingrich say he will skip today's hearing. His
estranged wife, Marianne, plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich has asked Judge Dorothy Robinson to force
Gingrich to answer pages of questions designed to uncover evidence
that can be used at trial. Most of the questions concern the former
U.S. House speaker's finances and his admitted affair with Callista
Bisek, 33, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich contends his wife's multiple-part questions actually
amount to as many as 150 questions. Georgia law allows just
one-third that many, so Gingrich wants his wife to pare them down.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious divorce has been full of unusual turns,
including Gingrich's deposition Tuesday in Virginia of Bisek, who
admitted the two have carried on a six-year affair. Such moves have
left divorce attorneys outside the case shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bisek has refused to answer a Washington subpoena
that requires her to sit for questioning by Marianne Gingrich's
attorney. The subpoena also requires Bisek to produce gifts and
other documents that evidence her affair with Gingrich. A
Washington judge will decide that dispute after a Nov. 23 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce in July, just days before the
couple's 18th wedding anniversary. Months earlier, Gingrich had
called his wife at her childhood home in Ohio to say he wanted out
of the marriage and that he was having an affair with Bisek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Marianne Gingrich has said of that day. ``I
had no idea about any of it.''

EXECUTIVES WARNED ABOUT CRIMINAL SYNDICATES OPERATING IN SOUTH
AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, Norway, Britain, Netherlands, Germany) (rk) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The unsolved killing of one foreign
businessman here and the mysterious disappearance of another has
local and international law enforcement agents warning overseas
executives and entrepreneurs to be wary of West African criminal
syndicates that in recent years have made this, the continent's
financial capital, their second home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Be Fooled! Many Have Lost Money!,'' read a recent
advertisement run by the Nigerian government in The International
Herald Tribune. The ad describes one of the most common variations
of a ``4-1-9'' fraud, so called for its statute number in the penal
code of Nigeria, the birthplace of the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Purporting to be Nigerian civil servants conspiring to inflate a
government contract and pocket the difference, the schemers send
letters to thousands of foreign businesspeople seeking access to a
clean overseas bank account where embezzled money can be
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective accomplices are promised a cut of the
multimillion-dollar sum. Once lured to Africa, they are often shown
the supposed money, most or all of it actually fake.
</P>
<P>
   Entangled in the ruse, the accomplices are duped into handing
over money, usually when the scheme is said to encounter unforeseen
problems that can be resolved only with five- or six-figure fees.
Desperate to exploit what they perceive as a fleeting opportunity,
the victims usually pay. By the time they realize the deception,
they are out many thousands of dollars. In one case to come to
light this year, a syndicate bilked a Japanese businessman of $7
million, according to South African police.
</P>
<P>
   Simple as the scheme is, it results in tens of millions of
dollars in losses each year, according to the U.S. Secret Service,
which opened an office in South Africa several weeks ago to
coordinate the agency's fight against commercial fraud in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to be a problem here in the United States and
around the world,'' John Tomlinson, a spokesman for the Secret
Service, said in a phone interview from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even after a decade or so, the ruse continues to be a
reliable moneymaker for the maturing network of organized crime
that emanates from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Nigerian syndicates dates to the late 1970s and
early 1980s when the West African country was hit hard by the
global collapse in oil prices. Thousands of enterprising and
well-educated Nigerian oil industry employees were left to look for
jobs. Some took their acquired skills in trade and communications
into organized crime, said Peter Gastrow, a researcher at the
Institute for Security Studies in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, the criminal networks have grown in
number and sophistication. From their beginnings in credit card
scams, they have widened their repertory of frauds.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that the FBI and the Secret Service
have been in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, for years. The Secret
Service has a crime-monitoring initiative known as Operation 4-1-9.
With the West Africans' move into South Africa, it became clear to
the Secret Service that it should be here, too, alongside the FBI,
which already has an office in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized there was a need for a presence here,'' said
Mitch Price, the special agent who heads the new office. ``The bad
guys know this is the economic hub of the region, and they have
come here to operate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fighting this sort of fraud is made more difficult by the fact
that victims are often too embarrassed or too scared to approach
authorities; when they do come forward, what little information
they have about their contacts is usually bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Pierre Tin Nok Il Shing Tat, a 42-year-old businessman from
Mauritius, never had the chance to come forward. On June 4, he was
kidnapped from an area hotel. Twelve days later, his body was found
near an old mine along a highway in Heidelberg, southeast of here.
He had been shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are certain he was caught in a 4-1-9 scam. They
now believe Kjetil Moe, an industrialist from Norway who was
ensnared in a similar scam, is dead, too, said Lawrence van der
Westhuizen, a South African police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Moe, a 65-year-old mechanical engineer, arrived here Sept. 24
and disappeared three days later, after contacting Nigerians who
instructed him to hand over $5,000 to what turned out to be a
fictitious company, said van der Westhuizen, who leads the
Johannesburg commercial crimes unit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Moe disappeared, the unit had amassed considerable
evidence of the criminal network's expanding influence in South
Africa. At least three other foreign businessmen involved in the
syndicate scams have been kidnapped this year. Unlike Tat, and
apparently Moe, each escaped or was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, this wasn't a big problem here,'' van der
Westhuizen said. ``Now it's an enormous problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of apartheid eased restrictions on immigration to
South Africa, criminal operatives from Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast,
Liberia, and Sierra Leone, have migrated to Johannesburg, and the
impact has begun to be felt, law enforcement agents here say.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing frequency, the letters about 4-1-9 bear
Johannesburg postmarks when they arrive in Britain, the
Netherlands, Germany, the United States and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Home to Africa's biggest stock exchange, its biggest banks and
many of its biggest companies, Johannesburg offers confidence men
what Lagos cannot: a cloak of respectability and credibility. A
businessman scared off by a letter from Nigeria and fearful of
traveling there might not be as wary of a solicitation sent from
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities here worry that South Africa's image will not
remain untainted for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you receive a letter or a contract from South Africa, you
will think twice about it,'' van der Westhuizen said. ``Is this a
real deal or is it a bogus one? People will be asking, `Why should
we go to South Africa? It's not safe to do business there.'''

BOND PRICES FALL AFTER PRODUCER PRICES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices fell Wednesday for the second
consecutive day after a report showed that the core rate of
producer prices in October rose more than expected. The strong data
raised speculation again that the Federal Reserve will increase
short-term interest rates to keep inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 8/32, to 100 16/32.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government completed its quarterly refunding Wednesday with
the sale of $10 billion of 10-year notes. It followed Tuesday's $15
billion sale of five-year notes. The 10-year notes, which were a
reopening of an issue sold in August, had good demand and helped to
buttress the market, which got off to a shaky start after the
report on producer prices, which showed that prices outside of food
and energy rose 0.3 percent in October. Some market participants
are speculating the Fed will raise short-term interest rates on
Tuesday when the Federal Open Market Committee meets; others are
less certain. But most agree that the Fed's bias will have an
equally important effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
   While the producer prices report might have surprised the market
a little, some economists, like Phil Hill of Briefing.com, a market
analysis firm in Burlingame, Calif., still thinks rates will remain
unchanged next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though core prices, which exclude food and energy, came
in larger than expected, it was still another benign month for
producer prices,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen M. Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker
Anthony Inc., said Treasuries recovered from early losses after the
producer prices report on the strength of traders closing short
positions. ``It appears that some people went into today's 10-year
note auction expecting to buy notes at cheaper prices but instead
wound up scrambling to cover short positions after the auction went
better than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes were awarded at a yield of 6.007 percent, with the
bid-to-cover ratio a healthy 2.48-to-1 as traders were quick to
remind people that the auction had been reduced to $10 billion from
$12 billion. The result helped Treasuries close off their daily
lows.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants think the Fed's decision on interest rates
could hinge on productivity and retail sales data to be released
Friday. But Fed fears are expected to keep the market vulnerable at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Camilli said the market was expecting a quarter-point
increase in short-term rates. ``The bond market is awaiting further
confirming evidence that the economy is returning to a more
sustainable rate of inflationary GDP growth around 3 to 3.5
percent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities,
said: ``Today's report is disappointing. The higher-than-expected
core finished goods result, the surge in prices further down the
production chain and the recent recovery in oil prices all fuel the
view that inflation pressures will continue to build, negative for
financial markets.''

AMGEN BREAKS GROUND FOR NORTHEASTERN FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Facing stiff competition in recruiting
researchers and scientists to southern California, Amgen Corp., the
world's largest biotechnology company, broke ground Wednesday on an
eight-story, 285,000-square-foot research center near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need access to talent which includes college graduates,
post-doctoral students, and university faculty,'' Gordon Binder,
Amgen chairman and chief executive, said. ``Frankly, when we had to
decide where to go, it took us probably a millisecond to say
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., is building its research
facility next to the Genzyme Corp. headquarters and near the Biogen
headquarters. The site is also close to the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, where Amgen has an academic research agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The building was designed by Stubbins &AMP; Associates and is
scheduled for completion in mid-2001. Binder said Amgen expects
initially to use up to two floors and lease the rest of the space.
By 2006, though, he said Amgen expects to have as many as 500
researchers occupying the entire facility.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said most of the researchers will be hired locally, and
played down the idea that West Coast employees would be shifted to
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci used the groundbreaking ceremony to
promote a further reduction in the state's personal income tax
rate, to 5 percent, which would put the rate below California's.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the help of companies like Amgen, Massachusetts will
continue to be a leader in the world of biotechnology,'' said
Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said Amgen's location near Los Angeles, where there are
relatively few biotechnology companies, has given the firm a hiring
disadvantage. ``In our area of California, we did not have the
venture capital community for biotech that you have here in
Boston,'' or that exists in and around San Francisco and San Diego,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only risk money in Los Angeles when Amgen was started went
to the movie industry, which is why we got some of our initial
funding out of Boston,'' Binder said.

CONGRESS APPROVES FIFTH TEMPORARY SPENDING MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Unable to reach a final budget deal, Congress
approved another temporary spending measure Wednesday to keep the
government operating through Nov. 17 before taking a break in
negotiations for Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton and Republican leaders continued to
express optimism about the possibility of a deal, it appeared that
it would be at the least the weekend, and more likely Monday,
before an agreement on final Year 2000 spending matters is ironed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders ordered House and Senate members to be
back in town by noon EDT Friday, after taking Thursday off for
Veterans Day, in anticipation of possible votes on an agreement to
fund health, education, labor, foreign, justice, interior and
commerce programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republican negotiators maintained that both sides were ``very
close'' to resolving remaining differences over education money for
new teachers, overdue U.S. dues to the United Nations and several
environmental disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is just in the final tuning stages now,'' said
House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W. ``Bill'' Young, R-Fla.
``We're very close to settling that whole package.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, said there were still significant differences between
Clinton and Republicans on major issues, including teacher funding,
and that it would likely be early next week before those problems
are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Congress and Clinton gave their approval to the
fifth in a series of temporary spending measures, known as
continuing resolutions, that have been passed since the start of
the 2000 fiscal year Oct. 1. The measures are necessary to prevent
a partial government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has passed eight of the 13 appropriations
bills needed to fund the government on an annual basis and have
agreed on a ninth, the remaining four in dispute account for more
than half of the $618 billion in discretionary spending in the 2000
budget. If a final agreement cannot be reached, Congress and
Clinton would have to continue funding the government on a partial
basis through next year or allow it to shut down until their
differences can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have stressed that they do not intend to repeat the
1995-96 shutdowns for which Republicans were generally blamed. But
White House officials have said negotiations cannot go on forever
and that Clinton may not accept the idea of extending temporary
spending through the end of the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Wednesday before departing for a brief
trip to Pennsylvania that ``good progress'' was being made. But he
acknowledged that GOP leaders were still balking at his request for
$1.4 billion to continue his program aimed at hiring 100,000 new
teachers. He also said disagreements still remain over several
environmental issues and whether the U.S. payment of nearly $1
billion in overdue money to the United Nations should be tied to
anti-abortion language favored by GOP conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton said he was ``hopeful'' that a deal would be
worked out by the time he is scheduled to depart Monday on a
weeklong European trip.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations between White House Budget Director Jack Lew
and Republican leaders has been contentious at times. Sources said
Wednesday that Lew, furious with Republicans for trying to ``play
politics'' with the budget by claiming that it does not spend
Social Security surpluses, stormed out of one meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Obey later told reporters that ``the boxing gloves have been
put away'' and that ``more productive'' talks are now taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how productive the talks were Wednesday, John Czwartacki,
a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said,
``We're all but there.'' But he added that even if an agreement is
reached before Friday it may be Tuesday or Wednesday before the
House and Senate holds a final vote approving all spending measures
and adjourns for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, it may be difficult to tie up all the loose ends
before then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations continued, the House and Senate prepared to
recess for Veterans Day. But some members protested when House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told them that they would have
to cut their holiday weekend short and return to Washington on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inconveniencing a member of Congress should be of no
consequence, but showing a lack of respect to the veterans who have
fought those two World Wars, many of whom will not be around to see
the next Veterans Day, is a totally different thing,'' Chet
Edwards, D-Texas, said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, however, turned aside the complaints. He said he was
aware of the importance of Veterans Day observances. But he
reminded members that finishing up the 2000 budget work is also
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there is that magic moment when everybody says we
can agree (on spending). That moment is at hand,'' he said.

RENEWED TALKS MAY REVEAL CHINA'S INTENTION ON TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ With both sides expressing cautious hope, senior
American and Chinese trade officials met Wednesday in renewed
negotiations over China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of on-and-off negotiations, including a near-miss
in April, there is a wide sense that this week's talks may answer
the key question: Is China ready to make the major market-opening
concessions demanded by the United States and Europe?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, along with
presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling and other officials,
arrived Tuesday night for what is supposed to be two days of talks.
Sperling said Wednesday morning that President Clinton had sent him
along ``to make clear his belief that we have a historical
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese were represented by Shi Guangsheng, the foreign
trade minister, and officials from the central bank and affected
ministries. Opening the session Wednesday morning, Shi said China
was ``positive and earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   Other countries are closely watching the Beijing talks, and not
only because of the potentially huge economic effects if China is
admitted to the organization that sets international trade rules
and works for less fettered commerce.
</P>
<P>
   China's willingness to open up cherished industries to global
competition will also signal its commitment to far-reaching
domestic economic and social changes, economists say, and may also
reveal the power of reformers in the government, especially Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu was embarrassed in Washington in April when Clinton rejected
as inadequate what the Chinese felt were major concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chinese industries that would be threatened by a
rapid market opening, like telecommunications and automobile
production, have fought to preserve more protections. The
leadership has become increasingly worried about a threat to social
stability if unemployment worsens in the short term because of
reductions in tariffs and investment barriers.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin badly wants the increased foreign
investment that would follow membership in the trade organization.
But he must also placate conservatives and threatened industries
and workers, and it is unclear if the leadership has the political
will to proceed with painful concessions right now.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for its part, will have to relax controls on
textile imports from China for an agreement to be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is said to regret his failure to reach agreement in
April. He now sees securing China's admission to the World Trade
Organization as an important foreign policy goal, but he cannot
relent on the commercial terms, because he needs the support of
business interests and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, American officials repeatedly said it was
vital for China to join the trade group before Nov. 30, when a new
round of global talks to revise trading rules will begin in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Trade experts said that even if China and the United States
reached substantial agreement this week, it appeared unlikely that
China could cross all hurdles, including agreement with the
European Union and other countries, in time for the start of the
Seattle talks. But if it becomes apparent that China will succeed,
the experts said, it will be easier to take its concerns into
account in the global round.

SECURITY FEARS RISE AT CLINICS FOR ABORTIONS IN CANADA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ This is the season when doctors who perform
abortions consider going on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this time of time of year, do not walk or jog in your
neighborhood or anywhere else on a regular schedule,'' warned a
police bulletin distributed last week by the Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada to its members.
``Consider wearing body armor, including at home. Do not put on or
take off your body armor in public, including parking lots and
public bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last five years, a Canadian or an American doctor
who performed abortions has been shot on or around Nov. 11, which
is Remembrance Day, a Canadian version of Veterans Day. But Nov. 11
is recognized differently by some anti-abortion militants on both
sides of the border. They call it Remember the Unborn Children Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bad time of the year for abortion providers in
Canada,'' Marilyn M. Wilson, executive director of Canadian
Abortion Rights Action League, said from Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Winnipeg, a binational police group was set up days
after a doctor who performed abortions was shot and wounded on Nov.
11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be hard pressed to find anyone in the abortion field
who is not aware of the risk at this time of year,'' said Inspector
Keith McCaskill of the Winnipeg police, a spokesman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   The group draws on police forces across Canada and western New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that based on the similarities, all five
shootings are likely linked,'' McCaskill said. He pulled from a
file a wanted poster with a photograph of a 45-year-old bearded
man. In U.S. dollars, the reward is $377,000 for the arrest and
conviction of the man, James Charles Kopp.
</P>
<P>
   A fugitive on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, Kopp was indicted
in June in Buffalo, N.Y., in the killing on Oct. 23, 1998, of Dr.
Barnett A. Slepian, an obstetrician who performed abortions. In
Canada, Kopp is wanted on an immigration warrant and for
questioning in the shootings of three doctors here. They survived.
</P>
<P>
   The last known sighting of Kopp was in New Jersey, 10 days after
Slepian was slain. In December 1998, one of Kopp's cars was found
in a parking lot at Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation is that he may be getting assistance from
somebody else,'' McCaskill said, referring to a loose underground
network of anti-abortion radicals.
</P>
<P>
   With the prime suspect in the attacks on the run, Canada may now
be returning to the nonviolent debate of the last 30 years over
abortion. Last month, Preston Manning, leader of the Reform Party,
the official opposition party in Parliament, challenged the
governing Liberals to show ``moral nerve, by defining the rights of
the unborn.'' The Reform Party, centered largely here in the West,
enjoys growing support from evangelical Christians, about 15
percent of Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a setback to anti-abortion forces, a pharmaceutical
company, Roberts Pharmaceutical Canada Inc., announced last week
that it would start marketing Preven, a ``morning after'' pill, in
Canada. Approved in the United States two years ago, Preven,
according to its manufacturer, prevents pregnancy. Abortion
opponents denounce it as an abortion drug.
</P>
<P>
   If widely used, the drug is generally expected to lead to a
decline in the number of abortions performed in clinics and
hospitals nationwide. After doubling in 20 years, the number of
abortions hit a plateau in the mid-90s, staying around 106,000.
Abortion is available in major cities in all 10 provinces, except
Prince Edward Island, the smallest. In 1988, the Supreme Court
voided the criminal code provisions on abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in abortion accompanied a sharp drop in live births to
teen-agers. Since 1974, the teen-age birth rate declined 38
percent, to 22.1 per 1,000 in 1996. In the United States, the
teen-age birth rate also dropped, but remains about double the
Canadian rate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the fear of violence and retirements are
believed to have contributed to a 30 percent drop in the number of
doctors who perform abortions in Canada, the National Obstetricians
and Gynecologists Society estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 20 years of intense debate over abortion, Gallup polling
indicates that opinions have changed only marginally since 1975. In
the latest poll on abortion, conducted a year ago, 12 percent said
abortion should be ``illegal under any circumstances,'' 55 percent
said it should be permitted under certain circumstances, and 30
percent said it should be legal under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably be like Holland,'' said Henry Morgentaler, an
abortion rights pioneer who owns eight clinics across Canada,
including one here that takes extra security measures in November.
``Abortions will plateau, then decline as sex education in the
schools take off and women use contraception in a better way.''

 &HT;    GORE ESCALATES HEALTH DEBATE WITH NEW CAMPAIGN AD
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The sparring between Democratic presidential
contenders Al Gore and Bill Bradley over health care intensified
Wednesday with a new Gore TV ad promising health insurance for all
children within five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, which began airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, the
vice president says it is ``unconscionable'' that millions of
children have no health insurance in an economy as strong as the
current one.
</P>
<P>
   And in an apparent response to Bradley's criticism of his health
care proposal, Gore suggests in the ad that ``down the road'' there
may be an opportunity to expand coverage to all uninsured
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Eskew, Gore's chief media strategist, acknowledged he was
``a little surprised'' that health care has become such an issue in
the Democratic presidential campaign. But he insisted that the new
ad is not a response to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley's proposal may have been a response to ours,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign accused Gore of plagiarizing some of the
language that the former New Jersey senator has used to describe
his own health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stealing our language, and the claim in the ad isn't
true,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser. ``He's claiming that
he's covering all children and he's not. It's literally stealing
our language.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns are also at odds over the cost of their differing
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign also trumpeted a new study performed by the
Consumers Union that declared Bradley's health care plan to be
preferable to Gore's in seven out of eight areas.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine,
said that Bradley's plan was a ``more meaningful starting point for
tackling the problem of the uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eskew emphasized that Gore's plan would not jeopardize the
federal budget surplus, a criticism Gore has repeatedly leveled at
Bradley's plan. ``It's is fiscally responsible,'' Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, which was shot in a private residence in the vice
president's hometown of Carthage, Tenn., Gore is wearing a white
shirt with rolled-up sleeves and a dark necktie that is not
loosened. He speaks into the camera. His image cuts intermittently
to scenes of a mother cradling a feverish child, two boys flipping
through a schoolbook, and a child in a doctor's examination room.
All of the people in the ad are residents of Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth ad of the Gore campaign. It includes no details
of how Gore would provide universal coverage for children or how
much such a program would cost.

FDA SEEKS REGULATIONS FOR REUSED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As hospitals and other medical providers strive to cut costs,
many have resorted to reducing equipment expenses by sterilizing
and reusing millions of dollars worth of medical items created to
be used one time and disposed.
</P>
<P>
   The money-saving phenomenon started in the 1970s and has become
so common that the US Food and Drug Administration is now proposing
regulations for something that is not supposed to happen _ but
does. And Wednesday, device reuse was the subject of a nationwide
teleconference organized by the FDA. On Dec. 14, the FDA will hold
a public meeting about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For some devices, proper sterilization is enough for reuse. But
more complex ones with minute parts can break during cleaning,
which manufacturers and physicians worry about. The items can range
from drill bits and tiny scissors for cutting tissue, which can be
reused safely, to hard-to-clean balloon angioplasty catheters that
go into the coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FDA considers the reprocessors to be manufacturers,
which subjects them to the same regulations as the original device
makers, the FDA has so far declined to ask the reprocessors to
submit evidence that devices are safe and effective after they are
cleaned. Now, the FDA is reconsidering that.
</P>
<P>
   While recycling saves health providers money, it cuts into the
revenues of device manufacturers like Boston Scientific of Natick,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Davis, electrical engineer and senior patent attorney
at Boston Scientific, said her company, like other manufacturers
and hospitals, has tested some of the reprocessed devices for
sterility. ``At least 45 percent of them were contaminated,'' Davis
said several of their studies indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that if the reprocessors are regulated in the same
fashion as the makers of these devices, her company would welcome
FDA regulation.
</P>
<P>
   So would Stephen Northrup, executive director of the 130-member
Medical Device Manufacturers Association, who watched the
teleconference Wednesday at Boston Scientific's facility. The
association had petitioned the FDA to ban the reprocessing of
single-use devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you manufacture a single-use device and wanted to change
that to multiple use, you would have to file an application to the
FDA to make that change to demonstrate that it can be reused
safely,'' Northrup said. ``Hospitals and third-party reprocessors
don't have to, so that's two different standards. We would be
satisfied if there was a level of regulated scrutiny for
reprocessors to protect the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   So far no one has died from a reprocessed device, but some of
them have failed and been reported to the FDA, said Dr. David
Feigal, director of the FDA's Center For Devices and Radiological
Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are not different kinds of failures than from new
devices. A catheter tip may separate, but we see that happening
with the same catheters that are used for the first time,'' Feigal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Feigal said that some manufacturers have labeled a device
single-use because it is faster to get the product onto market than
to do the extra studies needed to show it is still safe and
effective when reused. He said other devices cannot be adequately
cleaned and should not be reused, but are currently anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Devices are divided into three categories, Feigal said, and the
level of regulation will depend on the category. He explained that
low-risk devices, such as saw blades and scalpels, can be easily
reused.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, a Class III product has a detailed application
and both the original maker and a reprocessor should have to
provide clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Such
items would include ballon angioplasty catheters, which must
inflate to precise sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying that the burden is on the reprocessor to show
that they can get (a device) back to the specification of the
original manufacturer,'' Feigal said.
</P>
<P>
   Mac McKibbin, owner of Surgical Instrument Service and Savings,
a reprocessing company based in Sisters, Ore. said that he can
reprocess a device for half the cost of buying a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The device manufacturers have more or less created this
problem because their prices are so high. Hospitals can't afford to
pay their prices,'' said McKibbin.

EGYPTAIR 990 FLYING NORMALLY, EARLY TAPE DATA SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preliminary data from one of the black boxes of
EgyptAir Flight 990 offered no clear mechanical reason why the
Cairo-bound jet plummeted from its cruising altitude and crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean last month, killing all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an uneventful flight and the airplane was cruising at
flight level 33,000 feet,'' said James E. Hall, chairman of the
National Transportation and Safety Board at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first event of note is the autopilot disconnect and eight
seconds later the airplane begins what appears to be a controlled
descent. Data indicates the airplane descended to about 19,000
feet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A controlled descent means that the flight crew was in command
of the airplane. And aviation specialists said an autopilot can be
disconnected manually or if a pilot commands the plane to
counteract it, much like an automobile's cruise control, which
disengages when brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   While the data also indicated that the plane's thrust reversers
_ a focus of early speculation _ did not deploy in flight,
investigators were left with no mechanical clue as to why what
seemed to be a perfectly good airplane would begin a terrifying
roller-coaster ride before breaking apart in the sky some 60 miles
south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no smoking gun,'' said John Hansman, professor of
aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were even more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to solve it, it will be on the voice recorder;
otherwise we are in big trouble,'' said one investigator speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Hall acknowledged as much Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We await information off the cockpit voice recorder,'' he
said. ``When it is recovered, that can help us put this information
in context.''
</P>
<P>
   The recorder, the second of two so-called ``black boxes,'' is a
30-minute continuous tape loop which records cockpit conversation
as well as many noises in the cabin, which can yield important
clues about the performance of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   As the hunt for that device continued, weather at the crash site
worsened Wednesday, driving many of the high-tech vessels,
including the USS Grapple, to safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The ship Carolyn Chouest remained on site and its submersible
drone, the Magnum, continued to hunt for the cockpit voice
recorder, picking through a stack of aircraft debris on the sandy
ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder, which monitored at least 155 separate
functions of the 10-year-old airplane ranging from speed to the
position of flaps on the wings, was pulled from the ocean floor
early Tuesday morning and flown to Washington for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Search crews found it even though the underwater locator, which
emits a pinging noise, had become separated from the recorder.
Investigators noticed the orange-colored box on videotape as the
USS Grapple's Deep Drone was targeting the pinger.
</P>
<P>
   At the briefing Wednesday, Hall stressed that the data obtained
from the flight data recorder was preliminary and that specialists
from government and industry will keep working to glean more
information from the device.
</P>
<P>
   The data released Wednesday indicates everything was normal from
the time the Boeing 767-300ER left New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport early on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Since the preliminary analysis indicates the plane's systems and
operations were functioning properly, the investigator said, the
possibility of a criminal act _ either terrorism or some deliberate
act by a crew member _ had to be considered more prominently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one might be an FBI issue,'' the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansman said the flight data recorder information appears to
rule out a mechanical or hydraulic failure which could have
resulted in an uncommanded movement of the plane's flaps or
elevator sending it into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the potential now for a human-induced cause, but we
don't know that yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said about five to 10 seconds of data remains to be
extracted from the flight data recorder, which ends at that point.
Officials presume the power supply to the flight data recorder
ended at the same time the plane's transponder stopped working when
the airplane reached 16,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the plane did not reach supersonic speed in its
initial dive, as some specialists had speculated. He said the data
from the flight recorder and radar tracks are consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Once the plane's transponder failed, Federal Aviation
Administration radar had no way of determining the plane's
altitude. But Air Force radar indicates the plane climbed to about
24,000 feet before beginning one last dive and breaking apart
before hitting the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the plane lost electrical power, which
would have shut down the transponder and the flight data recorder,
when it began to climb again, or if the loss was somehow connected
to the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said all the information gleaned from the flight data
recorder was shared with Egyptian authorities before he held the
briefing. Egyptian officials will assist in the further analysis of
the flight data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Though it hasn't been located yet, Hall noted that the pinger
from the cockpit voice recorder is still operating and the Magnum
is continuing to search for the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we have gotton to the point where we are not confused
(by two pingers) anymore,'' he said.

 By SAM QUINONES 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last year, the consejo nacional de la Industria Maquiladora de
Exportacion _ the maquiladora industry's chamber of commerce _
learned that the Mexican government was proposing several financial
reforms that would hurt its members.
 &HT;    One measure, for example, would impose a reimbursable
value-added tax on maquiladoras' domestic suppliers. Members saw
this as adding needless paperwork and hindering the development of
already scarce Mexican suppliers. Yet the Finance Secretariat was
proposing it, and the Congress was going to vote on it.
 &HT;    Faced with such an issue not so long ago, the group would have
sent a delegation to the secretariat to lobby its case. But now,
for the first time, Congress was involved. So the Consejo did what
it never had done before: It hired a lobbying firm _ newly formed
Mexico City-based Grupo Estrategia Politica, in which an ex-Consejo
director, Gustavo Almaraz, is a partner. ``The Consejo itself is a
lobbying organization,'' says Humberto Inzunza, the group's
president and owner of a maquiladora in Tijuana. ``But due to the
new realities, we want to learn to lobby in the Mexican Congress.''
 &HT;    So, seemingly, does much of Mexico these days. Businesses,
environmentalists, community organizations, chambers of commerce _
most anyone with a cause or interest is seeing the need to lobby,
and to lobby Congress more than any other institution.
 &HT;    Mexico is shaking off the authoritarian one-party state that has
governed it for most of this century, and a more plural and
democratic country is emerging. With it, too, a new political
culture is slowly forming, characterized for the first time by
negotiation and persuasion and democratic give-and-take. ``In
Mexico, the ways of legislating, and of doing politics, are in full
transition,'' says Almaraz, who is also a former senator from Baja
California Norte.
 &HT;    An important barometer of this has been the birth of a true
lobbying industry. About a half-dozen lobbying firms have formed
over the last few years. Silvia Hernandez, Mexico's former tourism
secretary, created a firm called Estrategia Publica Consultores
early last year; Maria Emilia Farias, a former congresswoman,
started a firm, Cabildeo y Comunicacion, with several partners in
December 1997. Antonio Ocarranza, former foreign press secretary to
President Ernesto Zedillo, heads the Mexico City office of
Texas-based Public Strategies. Jose Antonio Crespo, a political
scientist and newspaper columnist, is a partner in Lobbying y
Cabildeo de Mexico, which formed in April.
 &HT;    Dozens of grassroots groups are also getting into the act.
Mexico's first feminist lobby, known as El Consorcio, is just now
organizing. Meanwhile, Mexico City-based Movimiento Ciudadano por
la Democracia has held dozens of workshops for non-profit groups on
how to lobby.
 &HT;    Lobbying is a profession Americans love to hate. Yet in Mexico,
the new market for the profession is one of the best indicators of
the country's new democratic openness and the formation of a new
political culture.
 &HT;    The Mexican lobbying industry was born two years ago _
specifically, on July 6, 1997. On that election day, for the first
time in decades, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
lost control of the lower house of Congress, known as the Chamber
of Deputies. That event fundamentally changed Mexican politics.
 &HT;    Until then, what passed for lobbying was perverse practices
rooted in the supreme power of the president and the PRI's
uncontested dominion over the country. The Senate and the Chamber
of Deputies had done little more than rubberstamp whatever the
all-powerful president proposed. So businessmen and associations,
like the Consejo, met exclusively with their friends in the
executive branch. For them, doors were most always open. They'd
explain their problem to the secretary of health or agriculture.
Soon a law would be making its way from the executive branch to the
Congress for passage.
 &HT;    The poor and powerless often had no such access and had to
resort to mass protests and public hunger strikes. The rule was
that unless you made a spectacle or nuisance of yourself, the
government ignored you. Hence, endless marches clogged traffic in
downtown Mexico City. One debtors group once brought an elephant to
a demonstration.
 &HT;    However, in September 1997, opposition-party congressmen, now
with a combined majority, took office ready to enact their own
legislation. With that, the Chamber finally became an actor in
Mexico's political life. Suddenly, more people had to be persuaded
of a law's merits before it could pass.
 &HT;    Probably the first firm in Mexico to respond to the new niche
was Burson-Marsteller. Even before the election, the public
relations firm formed a lobbying division in its Mexico City
office, realizing that this would be a Congress like no other.
 &HT;    It was clear that most business groups were unaware of how the
new Congress would affect them. A good many businessmen couldn't
even name their congressman. ``One of the first acts we organized
was a seminar on divided governments, to show what happens when
there's one party in the executive branch and another party in
Congress,'' says Aliza Chelminsky, director of Burson-Marsteller's
Mexico office. ``People don't understand what the role of the
congressman is or what the different commissions deal with.''
 &HT;    As the Chamber's opposition coalition showed itself to be
independent, if not always fully united, others saw the need for
lobbyists and filled the niche. ``We understood that the new times
required someone who could guide the private company in a radically
changing atmosphere,'' says Ignacio Zamarron, a partner with
Hernandez in Estrategia Publica Consultores. ``Before, private
companies would head to the executive branch. You met with the
finance minister or commerce minister. That was enough. There
wasn't even much need to deal with the media. This (lobbying)
company wasn't necessary then. There wasn't a market for it.''
 &HT;    Today, the industry still shows the signs of its rookie status.
No Mexican lobbying firm is three years old yet. Moreover, many
Mexican companies still don't understand the need for lobbying.
 &HT;    ``(Companies) ask us for presentations,'' Cabildeo y
Comunicacion's Farias says. ``When we get to the question of money
is when the problems begin. If Mexican companies are willing to pay
an attorney $100 or $125 an hour, they're not willing to pay a
lobbyist. It sounds like just going to breakfast a lot.''
 &HT;    Farias's firm was hired by Amprofon _ the recording-industry
chamber of commerce _ to lobby for changes to the law regulating
merchandise piracy. From November to April, when the law was
passed, Farias and her partners spent 20 hours a week on just that
issue, attended countless meetings in Congress and met with 20 or
30 key congressmen.
 &HT;    In the end, their success was in getting the word ``piracy''
added to the crimes regarded serious enough to require bail. They
also changed wording in the penal code to require police to pursue
merchandise pirates as a matter of course, the way they do drug
smugglers, and not simply wait for a complaint of piracy to act.
 &HT;    It was a major policy shift, one that the music industry has
wanted for years. But it was accomplished by small changes to three
obscure sections of the penal code _ changes so minor they hardly
seemed representative of the effort they took to achieve.
 &HT;    Still, initially Amprofon almost decided it didn't need a
lobbyist. It only quickly relented when the executive branch
proposed the law without association input.
 &HT;    Being a young industry, Mexican lobbying has developed a
flexibility, perhaps absent in countries where the profession has
more history. Several firms, for example, see lobbying legislators
as only one part of an overall strategy to influence
decision-making. These firms have expanded their services to
include advising companies on building alliances with grassroots
groups or unions. Often, these firms themselves don't lobby at all,
but rather tutor executive clients on how to effectively present
arguments, who in which branch of government to see, when to place
an ad in a newspaper and when to appear on a talk show _ and with
what message.
 &HT;    This so-called ``public strategy'' is necessary because Congress
isn't the only part of Mexico that has changed. The government is
less able to impose decisions than in the past. Neighborhood and
grassroots groups are more organized and vocal.
 &HT;    Above all, the media are now more independent and must be
lobbied like any congressman. Newspapers are far more rambunctious.
Morning radio talk shows, especially, have become important
vehicles for forming public opinion. And more than ever,
politicians are paying attention to the media.
 &HT;    ``Before, Mexican politics were a little like Kremlinology,''
Public Strategies' Ocarranza says. ``Nobody knew what happened, who
wrote the decisions, why something happened. The government didn't
have any need to present a case. The media was not strong enough to
punish the government for not providing that kind of information.
That is no longer the case. Government officials are fearful of
looking as if they haven't properly explained or justified their
line of action.''
 &HT;    These are the new rules of Mexican politics. Things are more
open, more fluid, more democratic and, for business, not nearly as
easy. Many business associations will soon find they need full-time
lobbyists to handle the job the association president used to do
part time.
 &HT;    Moreover, most observers believe that even if the PRI wins the
presidency and takes back a majority in both houses of Congress in
next summer's elections, Mexico will not return to the old way of
doing politics. ``The monolithic world is behind us now. We're in a
world that's more complex, richer, more plural,'' Estrategia
Publica Consultores' Zamarron says.
 &HT;    So an activity entirely new to Mexico will likely stick around
as well. ``You're talking about something that's very new,'' Grupo
Estrategia Politica's Almaraz says. ``Before you had very clearly
defined rules. Things are very dynamic now. About the only thing we
can count on in the future is that we'll have more clients.''

rooted in the supreme power of the president and the PRI's
uncontested dominion over the country. The Senate and the Chamber
of Deputies had done little more than rubberstamp whatever the
all-powerful president proposed. So businessmen and associations,
like the Consejo, met exclusively with their friends in the
executive branch. For them, doors were most always open. They'd
explain their problem to the secretary of health or agriculture.
Soon a law would be making its way from the executive branch to the
Congress for passage.
 &HT;    The poor and powerless often had no such access and had to
resort to mass protests and public hunger strikes. The rule was
that unless you made a spectacle or nuisance of yourself, the
government ignored you. Hence, endless marches clogged traffic in
downtown Mexico City. One debtors group once brought an elephant to
a demonstration.
 &HT;    However, in September 1997, opposition-party congressmen, now
with a combined majority, took office ready to enact their own
legislation. With that, the Chamber finally became an actor in
Mexico's political life. Suddenly, more people had to be persuaded
of a law's merits before it could pass.
 &HT;    Probably the first firm in Mexico to respond to the new niche
was Burson-Marsteller. Even before the election, the public
relations firm formed a lobbying division in its Mexico City
office, realizing that this would be a Congress like no other.
 &HT;    It was clear that most business groups were unaware of how the
new Congress would affect them. A good many businessmen couldn't
even name their congressman. ``One of the first acts we organized
was a seminar on divided governments, to show what happens when
there's one party in the executive branch and another party in
Congress,'' says Aliza Chelminsky, director of Burson-Marsteller's
Mexico office. ``People don't understand what the role of the
congressman is or what the different commissions deal with.''
 &HT;    As the Chamber's opposition coalition showed itself to be
independent, if not always fully united, others saw the need for
lobbyists and filled the niche. ``We understood that the new times
required someone who could guide the private company in a radically
changing atmosphere,'' says Ignacio Zamarron, a partner with
Hernandez in Estrategia Publica Consultores. ``Before, private
companies would head to the executive branch. You met with the
finance minister or commerce minister. That was enough. There
wasn't even much need to deal with the media. This (lobbying)
company wasn't necessary then. There wasn't a market for it.''
 &HT;    Today, the industry still shows the signs of its rookie status.
No Mexican lobbying firm is three years old yet. Moreover, many
Mexican companies still don't understand the need for lobbying.
 &HT;    ``(Companies) ask us for presentations,'' Cabildeo y
Comunicacion's Farias says. ``When we get to the question of money
is when the problems begin. If Mexican companies are willing to pay
an attorney $100 or $125 an hour, they're not willing to pay a
lobbyist. It sounds like just going to breakfast a lot.''
 &HT;    Farias's firm was hired by Amprofon _ the recording-industry
chamber of commerce _ to lobby for changes to the law regulating
merchandise piracy. From November to April, when the law was
passed, Farias and her partners spent 20 hours a week on just that
issue, attended countless meetings in Congress and met with 20 or
30 key congressmen.
 &HT;    In the end, their success was in getting the word ``piracy''
added to the crimes regarded serious enough to require bail. They
also changed wording in the penal code to require police to pursue
merchandise pirates as a matter of course, the way they do drug
smugglers, and not simply wait for a complaint of piracy to act.
 &HT;    It was a major policy shift, one that the music industry has
wanted for years. But it was accomplished by small changes to three
obscure sections of the penal code _ changes so minor they hardly
seemed representative of the effort they took to achieve.
 &HT;    Still, initially Amprofon almost decided it didn't need a
lobbyist. It only quickly relented when the executive branch
proposed the law without association input.
 &HT;    Being a young industry, Mexican lobbying has developed a
flexibility, perhaps absent in countries where the profession has
more history. Several firms, for example, see lobbying legislators
as only one part of an overall strategy to influence
decision-making. These firms have expanded their services to
include advising companies on building alliances with grassroots
groups or unions. Often, these firms themselves don't lobby at all,
but rather tutor executive clients on how to effectively present
arguments, who in which branch of government to see, when to place
an ad in a newspaper and when to appear on a talk show _ and with
what message.
 &HT;    This so-called ``public strategy'' is necessary because Congress
isn't the only part of Mexico that has changed. The government is
less able to impose decisions than in the past. Neighborhood and
grassroots groups are more organized and vocal.
 &HT;    Above all, the media are now more independent and must be
lobbied like any congressman. Newspapers are far more rambunctious.
Morning radio talk shows, especially, have become important
vehicles for forming public opinion. And more than ever,
politicians are paying attention to the media.
 &HT;    ``Before, Mexican politics were a little like Kremlinology,''
Public Strategies' Ocarranza says. ``Nobody knew what happened, who
wrote the decisions, why something happened. The government didn't
have any need to present a case. The media was not strong enough to
punish the government for not providing that kind of information.
That is no longer the case. Government officials are fearful of
looking as if they haven't properly explained or justified their
line of action.''
 &HT;    These are the new rules of Mexican politics. Things are more
open, more fluid, more democratic and, for business, not nearly as
easy. Many business associations will soon find they need full-time
lobbyists to handle the job the association president used to do
part time.
 &HT;    Moreover, most observers believe that even if the PRI wins the
presidency and takes back a majority in both houses of Congress in
next summer's elections, Mexico will not return to the old way of
doing politics. ``The monolithic world is behind us now. We're in a
world that's more complex, richer, more plural,'' Estrategia
Publica Consultores' Zamarron says.
 &HT;    So an activity entirely new to Mexico will likely stick around
as well. ``You're talking about something that's very new,'' Grupo
Estrategia Politica's Almaraz says. ``Before you had very clearly
defined rules. Things are very dynamic now. About the only thing we
can count on in the future is that we'll have more clients.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PFASTATT, France _ Last year, the Beyer family, which owns a
small jam and fruit preserves pre near the Swiss border,
made a proposal to their 18 employees: Would they like a 35-hour
workweek and continue to be paid for working 39 hours?
</P>
<P>
   To no one's great surprise, the employees said yes. ``An hour
more for yourself is an hour more,'' said Christiane Grimm, whose
job includes slapping labels on jars, sorting through crates of
fruit and watching over bubbling vats of jam. ``There's lots you
can do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Beyers ended up happy, too. The company, one
of thousands of French enterprises that have reorganized their
businesses because of a 16-month-old law creating one of the
shortest work weeks in the world, believes that it is far better
off than before.
</P>
<P>
   In the reshuffle, Philippe Beyer split his 18 employees into two
teams and staggered their shifts. His factory here in the Alsace
region now operates 12 hours a day, up from 8. And it produces 30
percent more than it did last year with only two extra employees.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of 39 hours of pay for 35 hours of work was a
campaign plank that helped catapult Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's
leftist coalition to power in the 1997 parliamentary elections. And
it remains the glue that keeps Socialists, Communists and Greens
together. It was aimed at creating as many as 1 million jobs in a
country that has struggled with a double-digit rate of unemployment
for years.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts think that this bold experiment _ which
business leaders had warned would cripple France's economy _ is not
going to be a cure-all for the nearly 3 million unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it could accomplish something the leftist governing
coalition never aimed for: a kind of housecleaning in the French
workplace that will tear the cobwebs from French industry and lead
to a more productive and flexible work force, as it did at Beyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely,'' said
Emanuel Ferry, an economist at Banque National de Paris, who is
studying the policy. ``But it seems to be having a backdoor effect.
It is providing a very good opportunity to renovate the workplace.
And it is introducing these elements _ productivity, flexibility _
quietly without triggering social unrest. So even if the direct
goal of job creation is not achieved, it may still not necessarily
be a bad thing for the economy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That may be, but there is hardly a policy that has caused as
much furor in France as the 35-hour week. While labor was an early
advocate of the idea, many unions have recently demonstrated
against it, fearing that the way it is being carried out will
freeze salary levels and reverse hard-fought gains in employee
rights. Businesses have protested, too. In October, some 30,000
industrialists and executives gathered at a Paris conference center
to wave placards and chant slogans deploring the policy. They say
it will cost too much and destroy France's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Average citizens also seem to be losing their appetite for it.
Surveys show that the idea was very popular when first proposed,
but resistance grew the more the French considered it. A recent
poll found that less than 10 percent of France's citizens now
believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks. Most
people suspect that one way or another, they will be
inconvenienced. Either way, it is a subject almost sure to start a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel very strongly about it,'' Beyer said. ``In this
country we are a little retrograde, we live the way we lived 30
years ago, and this is forcing change and so people are uneasy with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is little proof that the 35-hour week has created
many jobs. Labor Ministry officials said in Parliament recently
that the plan had created or saved 120,000 new jobs. But one
legislator called the figures ``thin air,'' and most economists say
a more realistic number would probably be half that. Opponents also
point out that the government has been subsidizing the transition
with business tax cuts and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   France's economy grew at a healthy rate of 3.2 percent in 1998,
and is expected to do nearly as well this year. The unemployment
rate has dropped to 11.1 in August from a high of 12.6 percent in
June 1997. But few see much connection between the new jobs and the
35-hour policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 35 hours was a political decision,'' a Finance Ministry
official said, ``but it may become a really positive thing. Nothing
was moving before. Now suddenly everyone has to go back and look at
the way we have been doing business. People are talking and
thinking and being creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of carrying out this complicated law, passed in June
1998, is still in its early stages. This month, Parliament passed a
tangle of more than 100 amendments spelling out exactly how and
when the policy should be instituted. One rule: All companies with
20 employees or more must operate with a 35-work week by the year
2002. So far, only about 16,000 businesses, or little more than 1
percent of eligible French employers, have formally made plans for
the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly. Some
businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit. Others, including
service industries, are likely to have a much harder time.
</P>
<P>
   George Jallerat, who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant
in Chartres, says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees'
hours, pay them the same wages and not lose money. ``In the end, we
will have to raise prices,'' he said. ``There is no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect
themselves. Dr. Thierry Sandre employs 19 people in his medical lab
on the outskirts of Paris. He says he will do all that he can to
avoid hiring a 20th person and bring the 35-hour workweek into his
business.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not trust the government to leave him alone. So he
has not raised the pay of any of his employees in two years, as a
way of saving money for the day he has to give them a 35-hour
workweek for 39 hours of pay. He says he is not alone.

<P>
   While the 35-hour workweek was being debated, government
officials began trying to enforce the 39-hour limit, even among
managers. Agents prowled garages to see what time people were
actually leaving. Thousands of fines were issued, and in one case,
the director of a electronics factory owned by Thomson-RCM was
hauled into court for working too hard and allowing his engineers
and other managers to put in an average of 46 hours a week. In
June, he was hit with an $18,000 fine. The action prompted some
businesses to install time clocks even for managers and made the
government the butt of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those
who were already planning to expand their businesses. For instance,
the Packard Bell computer factory in the western town of Angers
went to the 35-hour week this year precisely because it wanted to
increase production by 30 percent. To do that, it needed to
reorganize its 1,200 employees into more teams and more shifts.
Offering a 35-hour week was a way of opening negotiations with its
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Luc Bayel, the director of human resources, said the plan
had worked out even better than anyone expected. ``We have far less
absenteeism,'' Bayel said. ``And we are seeing a better product.
People have to stand to do the job, and standing for eight hours is
hard. Now they stand for only seven and we are seeing a 5 percent
reduction in problem computers. We are very happy with the
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies
because it did not want to follow government rules. But others like
Beyer also saw in the new law a way of getting government aid to
pay for expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Beyer, for instance, the government aid package will pay
nearly 90 percent of the salary for the two employees he added this
year. Next year, it will pay about 70 percent and 50 percent the
year after that. But Beyer, who took over the business from his
father two years ago, wanted to expand anyway. He says he might
have gone ahead with his plans anyhow, but the law gave him a push.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Beyer's factory, Didier Thuet, who owns a small
heating installation business, adopted the 35-hour week for just
the same reason. ``It was an opportunity to try something,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thuet's business is seasonal. There is little work at all from
March to May. So he offered his employees a shorter workweek during
those months in exchange for a longer one during peak business
periods. They also got an additional six to eight days off. All six
of the employees agreed to a salary freeze until the year was over
and the company could see how much money it made.
</P>
<P>
   But both Thuet and Beyer have their doubts about whether the law
will work everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the
new jobs. At Beyer, Sarah Charro, who at 26 had a series of
temporary jobs, was hired because of the reorganization, but she
has little good to say about it. She says the atmosphere in the
factory is tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel in some ways like we went backward,'' Ms. Charro said.
``We are working only 35 hours, but they are trying to push a lot
into those hours _ push, push, push. We are all stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thuet's new employee, Christoffe Foulon, says the 35-hour week
is great if he does not lose any money. But in truth, he would
rather work more and earn more. He says few of his friends seem to
envy him. Instead, he says, most give him a hard time. ``They treat
me like I'm lazy,'' he said.

CLINTON DELAYS, ABBREVIATES TRIP TO GREECE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ To the delight of Greek leftists, President Clinton
Wednesday delayed and shortened his upcoming trip here to avoid
potentially violent demonstrations against his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development in the Clinton visit is beneficial and not a
detriment to the real national interests,'' said the Communist
Party in a statement Wednesday. ``It gives the Greek people the
strength to intensify its demonstrations so that the US recognizes
the people's sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The party said the Greek government should ``not have free rein
to follow the commands of Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement caused an uproar, and many blamed the Greek
government for failing to find a way to ensure Clinton's safety
while honoring the right of its citizens to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postponement and downgrading of the visit by the American
president to Greece is a blow for the international prestige of our
country at the moment,'' said Stephanos Manos, leader of Greece's
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unfortunate development, in which extremists have seized
control of the foreign policy agenda, should never have been
permitted to transpire,'' said John Sitilides, executive director
of the Washington-based Western Policy Center. ``Greece's national
interests have been undermined by this irrational and reckless
hostility to the US president, at least in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to leave Friday for an 11-day trip to
Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Italy, and possibly Kosovo. But after
talks between the Greek and US governments over security concerns,
the White House opted to leave Sunday and cram his time in Greece
into a one-day stopover next week.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is meant to avoid having Clinton in Greece on or
before Nov. 17, a traditional day of protest by Greek communists
and other leftists. The date commemorates a student uprising
against the Greek military junta, which ruled Greece from 1967 to
1974 with the tacit support of the US government.
</P>
<P>
   Greek officials insist that the schedule shuffle had more to do
with a US agenda that included issues the Greeks were not prepared
to discuss. The Greek press speculated that Clinton administration
officials panicked at the possibility that violent protesters would
get close to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks ``asked me to do it. Whether the demonstrations had
anything to do with it, I don't know, but they might have,''
Clinton told reporters. ``But I'm not bothered by it. It's going to
happen, and you all get to take picture of it.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart refused to discuss specific
security threats. He said the Greek government believed the visit
would be more productive if it occurred after Clinton visits Turkey
to attend a conference of the Organization on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For many Greeks, the shortening of the trip was an
embarrassment. As the only European Union and NATO member in the
Balkan peninsula, Greece stands out as the most stable and
US-friendly nation in an otherwise volatile and troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around us is going to give him a warm welcome, but in
Greece we again have to do it differently,'' said commentator Nikos
Kakaounakis. Others talked of a ``fiasco'' that will have negative
implications for Greece in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the visit until next week spares Clinton some of the
embarrassment of a hostile reception by the Greek people, most of
whom strongly opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While Greece is an ally and fellow NATO member, simmering
hostility toward the US has long made it a dangerous place for US
diplomats and officials. Many Greeks believe Washington looked the
other way when Turkey invaded and divided the island of Cyprus in
1974.

 &HT;    Compaq releases $499 PC
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. Wednesday announced its first Internet
appliance, a stripped-down, Internet-driven PC for corporate
customers that will sell for $499.
</P>
<P>
   The slender IPaq not only introduces what Compaq promises will
be a family of PC and hand-held devices to keep users perpetually
connected to the Internet. It also carries a burden of rebuilding
the company's corporate business, which has given up ground to Dell
Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make up 10-15 percent of our volume next year,''
predicted Mike Winkler, senior vice president of Compaq's
commercial PC group.
</P>
<P>
   That operation accounts for nearly one-third of Compaq's
business, but suffered a 12 percent drop in sales in the third
quarter and lost $169 million. Intended to directly challenge
inroads by Dell into that business, the IPaq will be built-to-order
whether customers buy it through one of Compaq's traditional
resellers or over the Internet from the Houston-based company,
</P>
<P>
   ``We ship direct to the customer under any circumstances,''
Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq expects to be the first PC maker to ship the Internet
appliance, when it rolls off the assembly line early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co., in a move that Compaq believes was an
attempt to upstage Wednesday's announcement, said Monday it will
ship test versions of its ePC next spring, with commercial
production to follow by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has teased the industry with glimpses of a web-PC prototype
since September. The company says it will announce the machine,
code-named Webster, late this month. The company hasn't said when
the machine will ship.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also expects to offer a Internet appliance early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is wide agreement that businesses and large
corporate customers will welcome Internet appliances, no one is
certain about how big the market will be.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not expected to displace the PC as the central computing
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years of increasing power on the desktop, I doubt
very much that users are going to consent to losing power,'' said
Bill Milton, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrades of PC models every three to six months irritated many
corporate customers that had ordered thousands of PCs to be
installed over as long as a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to have frrequent product roll-outs,'' said
Achim Kuttler, marketing manager for HP. ``Those customers hardly
upgrade hardware at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said its iPac, well suited for back-office employees at
banks, insurance companies or telemarketing operations, will have a
12-month life-cycle. That means customers can be sure that it won't
change during a year-long installation of thousands of machines.
</P>
<P>
   Both Compaq and HP's products will run Pentium III processors
and either Windows 2000 or NT, making them fully functional PCs.
But they can't be expanded or upgraded. Moreover, they will have
only USB ports for peripherals, a further industry move to
relegating so-called legacy connections like PCI and ISA expansion
slots to obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants that legacy stuff,'' said David Wu of ABM Amro, a
securities firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Floppy-disk drives, another standard feature since the early
1980s, also will be missing.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer Inc.'s iMac was the first computer to ditch the
floppy drive and to promote USB, for universal serial bus, as the
standard peripheral port. While its popularity helped turned
Apple's fortunes around when it was introduced early last year, it
is aimed at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Compaq announced an Internet-based partnership
with Intel Corp., Micrtosoft Corp., American Express and other to
help businesses handle administrative tasks and solve technological
problems.

 &HT;    Confederate group worried about protests
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Confederate heritage group planning a Charleston, S.C.,
funeral procession for the transfer of 22 Civil War dead is worried
that hate groups waving the Rebel battle flag will mar what
organizers hope to be a solemn, dignified service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Klan shows up, we will physically bar them from
participating,'' said Barry Gooch, a board member of the
Confederate Heritage Trust. ``We will not allow them to do anything
to create division between the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the largest military funeral procession in South
Carolina's history, Friday's 4.2-mile trek from the Fort Sumter
monument on Charleston's battery waterfront to Magnolia Cemetery
comes as debate is intensifying over the Confederate flag flying
atop the state capitol in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that still flies the flag atop
its Statehouse, a source of political feuding and, in recent weeks,
the NAACP's national tourism boycott of the state.
</P>
<P>
   This week, joining dozens of groups calling for the flag's
removal, the South Carolina Baptist Convention voted to approve a
resolution asking the General Assembly to consider moving the
banner to a ``public place of heritage, honor and recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges reignited the debate two weeks
ago when he met with political, business and university leaders in
the first of a series of meetings about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The first-term Democrat drew criticism from NAACP officials, who
were not invited to the meeting, although they and the governor had
discussed the flag in earlier meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges also angered some flag supporters, including the Southern
Heritage Association, for raising the prospect of removing the flag
from the spot from which it has flown since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, members of the Confederate Heritage Trust hope
flag protests or hate-group interference doesn't disrupt the
funeral procession or the burial.
</P>
<P>
   Gooch said the group, which obtained a city march permit, has
arranged for Charleston police to escort the procession and prevent
hate-group members from joining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like they've stolen a flag of honor from our ancestors
and tried to defile it,'' Gooch said.
</P>
<P>
   James Gallman, president of the NAACP's South Carolina chapter,
said the procession doesn't worry him, despite the presence of the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with people wanting to recognize their
heritage, or show respect for deceased family members,'' Gallman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My issue is that the Confederate flag has no place flying atop
the state capitol,'' he said. ``The state capitol represents all of
the people, and the flag atop it does not represent all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The heritage trust has been planning the funeral services since
July, when its members excavated under The Citadel's football
stadium, the site of an old mariner's cemetery dating back to the
1860s. Directed by a state archaeologist, volunteers discovered the
skeletons of 22 Confederate sailors, marines and infantrymen, as
well as the remains of a child figured to be 3 years old when he
died.
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel dig also recovered the remains of four Confederate
crew members of the Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy
vessel in combat. Those remains will be reinterred later in
Magnolia Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three flag-draped caskets containing the other remains
will rest in state overnight Thursday at Charleston's St. Johannes
Lutheran Church, where a prayer service is planned. Horse-drawn
artillery limbers will carry the coffins in the procession expected
to draw more than 500 Civil War re-enactors in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the burial will be the largest reinterment of
Confederate soldiers who died in the war since July 1871. Then, the
Ladies Memorial Association returned to Charleston the bodies of 86
South Carolinians who died at the Battle of Gettysburg. Those
remains are in Magnolia Cemetery.

 &HT;    Bush offers new budget plan
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. - Presidential frontrunner George W. Bush, looking
to his home state for a solution, on Wednesday came up with a
sure-fire way to end the annual budget impasses that cause
Congressional gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to replace the annual budget haggling with bi-annual
budget haggling. It's time, said Bush, for Congress to write
two-year spending plans instead of budgeting one year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the budget process has become an annual ritual where
government locks down,'' Bush said outside the New Hampshire
Statehouse, where he filed his candidacy for the state's Feb. 1
primary. ``One way to reform the budget process is to have a
biennium budget so that the budget is decided on a two-year
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of many states that write two-year budgets, a
process that guarantees a spending plan is in place long before the
next budget period begins but also requires potentially tricky
long-term forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the second largest state in the union and we are able to
achieve budget stability on a two-year basis,'' Bush said of Texas.
``There needs to be some mechanisms, such as legislative budget
reviews, to be able to handle emergency situations. But I think a
lot of Americans, and I'm one, wish we would have a more stable
budgeting process.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Legislative Budget Board, which includes House and
Senate leaders, has the authority to re-arrange state spending to
meet emergencies when the Legislature, which meets in regular
session only in odd-numbered years, is not in session.
</P>
<P>
   The federal two-year budget is not a new idea. It's been offered
as legislation that has gone nowhere and as campaign-trail fodder
in presidential races gone by. Despite it's history as a
legislative loser, Texas' two senators think it's a winner of an
idea. Sen. Phil Gramm is co-sponsor of a current effort to scrap
the annual budget in favor of a two-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big advantages of biennial budgeting is that the
temptation to overspend would only occur every two years instead of
every year,'' said Gramm spokesman Larry Neal. ``The rush to push
through appropriations bills, particularly in election years,
sorely tempts those who are responsible for holding spending down.
Biennial budgeting has some strong advantages that Senator Gramm
has already considered and supports.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual budget causes Congress to spend more,'' she said.
``I favor it, the biennial budget. I worked with a biennial budget
in Texas and it worked well there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would favor a system in which Congress writes a
two-year budget and uses the non-budgeting year to review programs
to decide if they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comment came against a Washington backdrop in
which Democratic President Bill Clinton and the GOP-controlled
Congress are engaged in their annual budget skirmish. In
Greenville, South Carolina on Wednesday, Bush reluctantly endorsed
the GOP minimum-wage increase, which would add a dollar to the
hourly wage and link it to business tax cuts, but steered clear of
taking sides on the GOP plan to cut government spending by 1
percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sensitive time for the budget,'' he said in an
answer that shields him from criticizing his party or backing a
plan that would drain dollars from popular domestic programs,
including veterans' benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has pitched the two-year budget idea to Senate
Budget Chairman Pete Domenici, R-New Mexico, and other lawmakers
but drew mixed reviews. But something must be done, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a lot of Americans who are concerned about the
constant budget hassles that seem to dominate the Thanksgiving
season every time,'' he said.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ El ano pasado, el consejo nacional de la
Industria Maquiladora de Exportacion se entero de que el gobierno
mexicano proponia reformas financieras que afectarian a sus socios.
 &HT;    Una de estas medidas era un impuesto reembolsable al valor
agregado a los suministradores nacionales de las maquiladoras. Los
miembros vieron esta medida como algo innecesario y un obstaculo al
desarrollo de los ya escasos suministradores mexicanos. Pero la
Secretaria de Finanzas era la que proponia la medida, y el Congreso
la iba a aprobar.
 &HT;    No hace mucho, frente a un dilema de ese tipo, el grupo habria
enviado una delegacion a la Secretaria para que defendiera sus
intereses. Pero ahora, por primera vez, el Congreso tomaba cartas
en el asunto. Y el Consejo hizo lo que nunca habia hecho: contrato
a una firma de cabilderos, el recien formado Grupo de Estrategia
Politica, del que un ex director del Consejo, Gustavo Almaraz, es
socio.
 &HT;    ``El Consejo es una organizacion de cabildeo,'' dice Humberto
Inzunza, presidente del grupo y dueno de una maquiladora en
Tijuana. Pero debido a las nuevas realidades, queremos aprender a
cabildear en el Congreso mexicano..'
 &HT;    Y parece que muchos han tomado el mismo camino. Las empresas,
los ambientalistas, las organizaciones comunales, las camaras de
comercio, practicamente todo el que tenga una causa o un interes,
ve la necesidad de cabildear, y de cabildear en el Congreso.
 &HT;    Mexico se libra del Estado autoritario unipartidista que ha
gobernado la mayor parte de este siglo, mientras emerge un pais mas
plural y democratico. Junto con ese fenomeno se forma lentamente
una nueva cultura politica, caracterizada por la negociacion, la
persuasion y el toma y daca democratico. ``En Mexico, la forma de
legislar y de hacer politica esta en plena transicion,'' dice
Almaraz, que fue senador por el estado de Baja California Norte.
 &HT;    Un importante barometro de este fenomeno ha sido el surgimiento
de un sector del cabildeo en los ultimos anos.
 &HT;    Silvia Hernandez, ex secretaria de Turismo de Mexico, creo una
firma llamada Estrategia Publica Consultores a principios de 1998;
Maria Emilia Farias, ex congresista, tambien inauguro una firma,
Cabildeo y Comunicacion, con varios socios en diciembre de 1997.
Antonio Ocarranza, ex secretario de prensa del presidente Ernesto
Zedillo, dirige la oficina en Ciudad de Mexico de Public
Strategies, de Texas. Jose Antonio Crespo, politologo y columnista,
es socio de Lobbying y Cabildeo de Mexico, que se creo en abril.
 &HT;    Decenas de grupos populares tambien saltan a la palestra. El
primer grupo de cabildeo feminista mexicano, llamado El Consorcio,
se esta organizando. Entretanto, el Movimiento Ciudadano por la
Democracia, ofrece seminarios sobre como cabildear.
 &HT;    En Mexico, el nuevo mercado para los cabilderos es uno de los
mejores indicadores de la apertura democratica y de la formacion de
una nueva cultura politica.
 &HT;    La industria mexicana del cabildeo nacio el 6 de julio de 1997.
En ese dia de elecciones, por primera vez, el gobernante Partido
Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) perdio el control de la Camara
de Diputados, lo que represento un cambio radical en la politica
mexicana.
 &HT;    Hasta entonces, lo que se entendia por cabildeo era un metodo
nefasto, arraigado en el poder supremo del presidente y en el
indisputable dominio del PRI. El Senado y la Camara de Diputados
hacian poco mas que aprobar lo que el presidente proponia. Asi los
empresarios y las asociaciones, como el Consejo, se reunian
exclusivamente con sus amigos en la rama ejecutiva. Siempre tenian
las puertas abiertas: exponian sus problemas al secretario de Salud
o al de Agricultura y pronto el ejecutivo presentaba al Congreso un
proyecto de ley para su aprobacion.
 &HT;    Los pobres y los que no tenian influencia carecian de ese acceso
al poder y tenian que recurrir a protestas masivas y a huelgas de
hambre. Marchas interminables paralizaban el trafico en las zonas
centricas de Ciudad de Mexico. En una ocasion, un grupo de deudores
llevo un elefante a una manifestacion.
 &HT;    Pero en septiembre de 1997, los congresistas de la oposicion,
ahora en mayoria, ocuparon sus puestos preparados para promulgar
sus propias medidas. La Camara de Diputados por fin tenia un papel
decisivo en la vida politica mexicana. De repente, habia que
convencer a mas individuos de las bondades de una ley.
 &HT;    Probablemente la primera firma que respondio en Mexico a la
aparicion del nuevo nicho fue Burson-Marsteller. Incluso antes de
las elecciones, la firma de relaciones publicas formo una division
de cabildeo en su oficina de Ciudad de Mexico al percibir que este
Congreso seria distinto a todos los anteriores.
 &HT;    Era evidente que la mayoria de los grupos comerciales no estaban
al tanto de la forma en que el nuevo Congreso los afectaria. Muchos
empresarios ni siquiera conocian el nombre de su congresista.
 &HT;    ``Uno de los primeros actos que organizamos fue un seminario
para mostrar lo que ocurre cuando hay un partido en la rama
ejecutiva y otro en el Congreso,'' dijo Aliza Chelminsky, directora
de la oficina de Burson-Marsteller en Mexico. ``La gente no
entiende cual es el papel del congresista ni el de las
comisiones..'
 &HT;    Mientras la coalicion opositora de la Camara se revelaba como un
organismo independiente, aunque no completamente unido, otros
vieron la necesidad de cabilderos y llenaron ese vacio.
``Entendimos que los nuevos tiempos requerian a alguien que pudiera
guiar a la compania privada en un ambiente de cambios radicales,''
dice Ignacio Zamarron, socio de Hernandez en Estrategia Publica
Consultores. ``Antes, las companias privadas se dirigian a la rama
ejecutiva, al secretario de Finanzas o al de Comercio. Con eso
bastaba. Tampoco hacia falta batallar con con la prensa. Esta
compania (de cabildeo) no hacia falta en aquella epoca. No tenia un
mercado.''
 &HT;    Hoy, el sector todavia muestra su condicion de novato. Ninguna
firma mexicana de cabildeo tiene tres anos. Ademas, muchas empresas
mexicanas aun no entienden la necesidad de cabildear.
 &HT;    ``(Las companias) nos piden presentaciones,'' dice Farias, de
Cabildeo y Comunicacion. ``Los problemas surgen cuando se toca el
tema del dinero. Las companias mexicanas estan dispuestas a pagarle
a un abogado US$100 o US$125 la hora, pero no les gusta la idea de
pagarle a un cabildero.''
 &HT;    La firma de Farias fue contratada por Amprofon (la camara de
comercio de la industria de la grabacion) para cabildear por
cambios a la ley que regula la pirateria de productos.
 &HT;    Desde noviembre hasta abril, cuando se aprobo la ley, Farias y
sus socios dedicaron 20 horas a la semana solo a ese asunto,
asistieron a incontables reuniones en el Congreso y se reunieron
con 20 o 30 parlamentarios clave.
 &HT;    Al final, su exito fue que se anadio la palabra ``pirateria'' a
los delitos considerados lo suficientemente graves como para exigir
fianza. Tambien cambiaron la redaccion del codigo penal para exigir
a la policia que persiga a los piratas de mercancia igual que a los
narcotraficantes.
 &HT;    Fue un gran cambio, un cambio que la industria de las
grabaciones musicales pedia desde hace anos. Pero se logro mediante
cambios pequenos en tres oscuras secciones del codigo penal,
cambios tan pequenos que no parecian ameritar los grandes esfuerzos
que se hicieron para conseguirlos.
 &HT;    Inicialmente, Amprofon casi decidio que no necesitaba un
cabildero. Pero dio marcha atras rapidamente cuando la rama
ejecutiva propuso la ley sin contar con la opinion de la
asociacion.
 &HT;    Como es un sector joven, el cabildeo en Mexico ha desarrollado
una flexibilidad que quiza no existe en paises donde la profesion
tiene mas trastienda. Varias firmas, por ejemplo, consideran el
cabildeo en el Congreso como una parte de una estrategia global
para influir sobre las decisiones de gobierno. Estas firmas han
extendido sus servicios: ahora asesoran a empresas sobre la
creacion de alianzas con sindicatos o grupos de base. Muchas veces,
estas firmas no cabildean, sino que orientan a ejecutivos sobre la
forma mas eficaz de presentar sus argumentos, a quien ver en cada
rama del gobierno, cuando poner un anuncio en la prensa y cuando
presentarse en television, y con que mensaje.
 &HT;    Esta llamada ``estrategia publica'' es necesaria porque el
Congreso no es la unica parte de Mexico que ha cambiado. El
gobierno tiene menos capacidad que antes para imponer decisiones.
Los grupos de base y vecinales estan mas organizados y se hacen
sentir mas.
 &HT;    Sobre todo, la prensa es mas independiente y hay que acercarse a
ella como a cualquier congresista. Los periodicos son mucho mas
audaces. Especialmente los programas matutinos de radio con
participacion del publico se han convertido en importantes
formadores de opinion publica. Y los politicos prestan mas atencion
que nunca a los medios.
 &HT;    ``Antes, la politica mexicana se parecia un poco a la politica
del Kremlin,'' dice Ocarranza, de Public Strategies. ``Nadie sabia
lo que pasaba, quien tomaba las decisiones, por que sucedian las
cosas. El gobierno no necesitaba dar argumentos. Los medios no
tenian poder para castigar al gobierno por no dar informacion. Pero
ya no. Los funcionarios temen dar la impresion de que no han
explicado o justificado sus acciones adecuadamente.''
 &HT;    Estas son las nuevas reglas de la politica mexicana. Las cosas
son mas abiertas, mas fluidas, mas democraticas y, para los
negocios, menos faciles. Muchas sociedades comerciales no tardaran
en descubrir que necesitan cabilderos a tiempo completo para
ocuparse de tareas que el presidente de la asociacion solia hacer
en parte de su tiempo.
 &HT;    Ademas, muchos observadores piensan que aunque el PRI gane la
presidencia y recupere la mayoria en las dos camaras del Congreso
en las elecciones del proximo verano, Mexico no volvera a la vieja
forma de hacer politica.
 &HT;    ``El mundo monolitico es cosa del pasado. Estamos en un mundo
mas complejo, mas rico, mas plural,'' expresa Zamarron, de
Estrategia Publica Consultores.
 &HT;    Y, por lo tanto, tambien es muy probable que una actividad
completamente nueva en Mexico eche raices. ``Estamos hablando de
algo muy novedoso,'' dice Almaraz, del Grupo Estrategia Politica.
 &HT;    ``Antes habian reglas bien definidas. Ahora todo es muy
dinamico. Practicamente lo unico que podemos dar por sentado en el
futuro es que tendremos mas clientes.''

 &HT;    No hace mucho, frente a un dilema de ese tipo, el grupo habria
enviado una delegacion a la Secretaria para que defendiera sus
intereses. Pero ahora, por primera vez, el Congreso tomaba cartas
en el asunto. Y el Consejo hizo lo que nunca habia hecho: contrato
a una firma de cabilderos, el recien formado Grupo de Estrategia
Politica, del que un ex director del Consejo, Gustavo Almaraz, es
socio.
 &HT;    ``El Consejo es una organizacion de cabildeo,'' dice Humberto
Inzunza, presidente del grupo y dueno de una maquiladora en
Tijuana. Pero debido a las nuevas realidades, queremos aprender a
cabildear en el Congreso mexicano..'
 &HT;    Y parece que muchos han tomado el mismo camino. Las empresas,
los ambientalistas, las organizaciones comunales, las camaras de
comercio, practicamente todo el que tenga una causa o un interes,
ve la necesidad de cabildear, y de cabildear en el Congreso.
 &HT;    Mexico se libra del Estado autoritario unipartidista que ha
gobernado la mayor parte de este siglo, mientras emerge un pais mas
plural y democratico. Junto con ese fenomeno se forma lentamente
una nueva cultura politica, caracterizada por la negociacion, la
persuasion y el toma y daca democratico. ``En Mexico, la forma de
legislar y de hacer politica esta en plena transicion,'' dice
Almaraz, que fue senador por el estado de Baja California Norte.
 &HT;    Un importante barometro de este fenomeno ha sido el surgimiento
de un sector del cabildeo en los ultimos anos.
 &HT;    Silvia Hernandez, ex secretaria de Turismo de Mexico, creo una
firma llamada Estrategia Publica Consultores a principios de 1998;
Maria Emilia Farias, ex congresista, tambien inauguro una firma,
Cabildeo y Comunicacion, con varios socios en diciembre de 1997.
Antonio Ocarranza, ex secretario de prensa del presidente Ernesto
Zedillo, dirige la oficina en Ciudad de Mexico de Public
Strategies, de Texas. Jose Antonio Crespo, politologo y columnista,
es socio de Lobbying y Cabildeo de Mexico, que se creo en abril.
 &HT;    Decenas de grupos populares tambien saltan a la palestra. El
primer grupo de cabildeo feminista mexicano, llamado El Consorcio,
se esta organizando. Entretanto, el Movimiento Ciudadano por la
Democracia, ofrece seminarios sobre como cabildear.
 &HT;    En Mexico, el nuevo mercado para los cabilderos es uno de los
mejores indicadores de la apertura democratica y de la formacion de
una nueva cultura politica.
 &HT;    La industria mexicana del cabildeo nacio el 6 de julio de 1997.
En ese dia de elecciones, por primera vez, el gobernante Partido
Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) perdio el control de la Camara
de Diputados, lo que represento un cambio radical en la politica
mexicana.
 &HT;    Hasta entonces, lo que se entendia por cabildeo era un metodo
nefasto, arraigado en el poder supremo del presidente y en el
indisputable dominio del PRI. El Senado y la Camara de Diputados
hacian poco mas que aprobar lo que el presidente proponia. Asi los
empresarios y las asociaciones, como el Consejo, se reunian
exclusivamente con sus amigos en la rama ejecutiva. Siempre tenian
las puertas abiertas: exponian sus problemas al secretario de Salud
o al de Agricultura y pronto el ejecutivo presentaba al Congreso un
proyecto de ley para su aprobacion.
 &HT;    Los pobres y los que no tenian influencia carecian de ese acceso
al poder y tenian que recurrir a protestas masivas y a huelgas de
hambre. Marchas interminables paralizaban el trafico en las zonas
centricas de Ciudad de Mexico. En una ocasion, un grupo de deudores
llevo un elefante a una manifestacion.
 &HT;    Pero en septiembre de 1997, los congresistas de la oposicion,
ahora en mayoria, ocuparon sus puestos preparados para promulgar
sus propias medidas. La Camara de Diputados por fin tenia un papel
decisivo en la vida politica mexicana. De repente, habia que
convencer a mas individuos de las bondades de una ley.
 &HT;    Probablemente la primera firma que respondio en Mexico a la
aparicion del nuevo nicho fue Burson-Marsteller. Incluso antes de
las elecciones, la firma de relaciones publicas formo una division
de cabildeo en su oficina de Ciudad de Mexico al percibir que este
Congreso seria distinto a todos los anteriores.
 &HT;    Era evidente que la mayoria de los grupos comerciales no estaban
al tanto de la forma en que el nuevo Congreso los afectaria. Muchos
empresarios ni siquiera conocian el nombre de su congresista.
 &HT;    ``Uno de los primeros actos que organizamos fue un seminario
para mostrar lo que ocurre cuando hay uno en la rama
ejecutiva y otro en el Congreso,'' dijo Aliza Chelminsky, directora
de la oficina de Burson-Marsteller en Mexico. ``La gente no
entiende cual es el papel del congresista ni el de las
comisiones..'
 &HT;    Mientras la coalicion opositora de la Camara se revelaba como un
organismo independiente, aunque no completamente unido, otros
vieron la necesidad de cabilderos y llenaron ese vacio.
``Entendimos que los nuevos tiempos requerian a alguien que pudiera
guiar a la compania privada en un ambiente de cambios radicales,''
dice Ignacio Zamarron, socio de Hernandez en Estrategia Publica
Consultores. ``Antes, las companias privadas se dirigian a la rama
ejecutiva, al secretario de Finanzas o al de Comercio. Con eso
bastaba. Tampoco hacia falta batallar con con la prensa. Esta
compania (de cabildeo) no hacia falta en aquella epoca. No tenia un
mercado.''
 &HT;    Hoy, el sector todavia muestra su condicion de novato. Ninguna
firma mexicana de cabildeo tiene tres anos. Ademas, muchas empresas
mexicanas aun no entienden la necesidad de cabildear.
 &HT;    ``(Las companias) nos piden presentaciones,'' dice Farias, de
Cabildeo y Comunicacion. ``Los problemas surgen cuando se toca el
tema del dinero. Las companias mexicanas estan dispuestas a pagarle
a un abogado US$100 o US$125 la hora, pero no les gusta la idea de
pagarle a un cabildero.''
 &HT;    La firma de Farias fue contratada por Amprofon (la camara de
comercio de la industria de la grabacion) para cabildear por
cambios a la ley que regula la pirateria de productos.
 &HT;    Desde noviembre hasta abril, cuando se aprobo la ley, Farias y
sus socios dedicaron 20 horas a la semana solo a ese asunto,
asistieron a incontables reuniones en el Congreso y se reunieron
con 20 o 30 parlamentarios clave.
 &HT;    Al final, su exito fue que se anadio la palabra ``pirateria'' a
los delitos considerados lo suficientemente graves como para exigir
fianza. Tambien cambiaron la redaccion del codigo penal para exigir
a la policia que persiga a los piratas de mercancia igual que a los
narcotraficantes.
 &HT;    Fue un gran cambio, un cambio que la industria de las
grabaciones musicales pedia desde hace anos. Pero se logro mediante
cambios pequenos en tres oscuras secciones del codigo penal,
cambios tan pequenos que no parecian ameritar los grandes esfuerzos
que se hicieron para conseguirlos.
 &HT;    Inicialmente, Amprofon casi decidio que no necesitaba un
cabildero. Pero dio marcha atras rapidamente cuando la rama
ejecutiva propuso la ley sin contar con la opinion de la
asociacion.
 &HT;    Como es un sector joven, el cabildeo en Mexico ha desarrollado
una flexibilidad que quiza no existe en paises donde la profesion
tiene mas trastienda. Varias firmas, por ejemplo, consideran el
cabildeo en el Congreso como una parte de una estrategia global
para influir sobre las decisiones de gobierno. Estas firmas han
extendido sus servicios: ahora asesoran a empresas sobre la
creacion de alianzas con sindicatos o grupos de base. Muchas veces,
estas firmas no cabildean, sino que orientan a ejecutivos sobre la
forma mas eficaz de presentar sus argumentos, a quien ver en cada
rama del gobierno, cuando poner un anuncio en la prensa y cuando
presentarse en television, y con que mensaje.
 &HT;    Esta llamada ``estrategia publica'' es necesaria porque el
Congreso no es la unica parte de Mexico que ha cambiado. El
gobierno tiene menos capacidad que antes para imponer decisiones.
Los grupos de base y vecinales estan mas organizados y se hacen
sentir mas.
 &HT;    Sobre todo, la prensa es mas independiente y hay que acercarse a
ella como a cualquier congresista. Los periodicos son mucho mas
audaces. Especialmente los programas matutinos de radio con
participacion del publico se han convertido en importantes
formadores de opinion publica. Y los politicos prestan mas atencion
que nunca a los medios.
 &HT;    ``Antes, la politica mexicana se parecia un poco a la politica
del Kremlin,'' dice Ocarranza, de Public Strategies. ``Nadie sabia
lo que pasaba, quien tomaba las decisiones, por que sucedian las
cosas. El gobierno no necesitaba dar argumentos. Los medios no
tenian poder para castigar al gobierno por no dar informacion. Pero
ya no. Los funcionarios temen dar la impresion de que no han
explicado o justificado sus acciones adecuadamente.''
 &HT;    Estas son las nuevas reglas de la politica mexicana. Las cosas
son mas abiertas, mas fluidas, mas democraticas y, para los
negocios, menos faciles. Muchas sociedades comerciales no tardaran
en descubrir que necesitan cabilderos a tiempo completo para
ocuparse de tareas que el presidente de la asociacion solia hacer
en parte de su tiempo.
 &HT;    Ademas, muchos observadores piensan que aunque el PRI gane la
presidencia y recupere la mayoria en las dos camaras del Congreso
en las elecciones del proximo verano, Mexico no volvera a la vieja
forma de hacer politica.
 &HT;    ``El mundo monolitico es cosa del pasado. Estamos en un mundo
mas complejo, mas rico, mas plural,'' expresa Zamarron, de
Estrategia Publica Consultores.
 &HT;    Y, por lo tanto, tambien es muy probable que una actividad
completamente nueva en Mexico eche raices. ``Estamos hablando de
algo muy novedoso,'' dice Almaraz, del Grupo Estrategia Politica.
 &HT;    ``Antes habian reglas bien definidas. Ahora todo es muy
dinamico. Practicamente lo unico que podemos dar por sentado en el
futuro es que tendremos mas clientes.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN PLANE CRASH RAISES QUESTIONS OF AIRLINE'S SAFETY FROM
PILOTS, ATTENDANTS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A TAESA Airlines crash that killed 18 people in
Mexico revived allegations Wednesday from Mexican flight attendants
and a pilots group that the company's airplanes are poorly
maintained and unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane that crashed (Tuesday) was infamous among
(attendants) for having oil leaks,'' said Alejandra Barrales,
secretary general of the Association of Flight Attendants of
Mexico, or ASSA, which is embroiled in a labor dispute over wages,
overtime and safety conditions with TAESA.
</P>
<P>
   TAESA is a former Mexican charter airline that expanded into a
company offering cheap flights to Chicago, New York, Oakland,
Calif., and 25 cities in Mexico. On Tuesday one of its flights en
route to Mexico City from the western Mexican city of Uruapan
crashed in a remote avocado field, killing all 13 passengers and
five crew members on board.
</P>
<P>
   The flight had originated in Tijuana, Mexico, near San Diego,
Calif., carrying 91 passengers. Most disembarked in Guadalajara,
Mexico, before the plane flew on to Uruapan, a city in Mexico's
Michoacan state. It crashed shortly after take-off around 7 p.m.
CDT (8 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The company Wednesday disputed charges that its airlines are
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a position to say affirm that the airplane that
crashed complied with all norms of maintenance and supervision
required to safely transport passengers,'' TAESA said in a
statement released to the press. TAESA is short for Transportes
Aereos Ejecutivos SA, or Executive Air Transport Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities are investigating the crash, for which no
cause has yet been identified. Officials recovered the plane's
``black boxes,'' or recording devices, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In September the Mexican pilots union, known as the ASPA, issued
a report criticizing TAESA and the Mexican airlines Aviacsa,
Aerocalifornia and Aerocozumel for using an aging fleet of planes
on domestic routes. The pilots said 30 percent of the airplanes
used by the airlines were too substandard to be flown into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The airplanes mostly did not meet U.S. noise and contamination
standards, said ASPA spokesman Ariel Alvarez. But the pilots were
concerned with safety as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The age of an airplane does not cause an accident,'' Alvarez
said. ``The safety of planes has to do with the quality of
supervision and maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's accident, the flight attendants union had
already scheduled a news conference on Wednesday in Mexico City
with representatives of the United States' Association of Flight
Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The American flight attendants on Wednesday filed a complaint
with the U.S. Labor Department alleging that the Mexican government
was not enforcing its own labor laws in a dispute with TAESA.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed under the labor side agreement of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The grievance charges
that TAESA was allowed to fire nearly 100 of its attendants because
they voted to join an independent labor union.
</P>
<P>
   The American flight attendants complaint also describes alleged
defective smoke alarms, inoperative oxygen masks, broken seatbelts
and broken emergency lighting aboard TAESA aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's news conference, Barreles of the Mexican
attendants' association, said her affiliates at TAESA had gathered
observations of questionable safety standards and submitted them to
Mexican authorities five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   She presented a document she said outlined some alleged flaws
aboard the same airplane that crashed, which was a 29-year-old
Boeing DC-9.
</P>
<P>
   Attendants documented alleged leaking oil, broken or flawed fuel
indicators and doors that did not shut properly among other
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   TAESA flight attendant manager Jesus Vivar said flight
attendants were not qualified to judge safety and maintenance on
the planes.

TEXAS LAWMAKER UNDER PRESSURE TO RESIGN 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE JACKSON, Texas _ State Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown, who
apologized in September for making sexual advances on a 20-year-old
employee, is under pressure to resign because of his misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazoria County Republican Party Executive Committee passed
a resolution this week that ``insists'' Brown resign. It also
states that Brown should remove his name from consideration for the
lieutenant governor's position if Gov. George W. Bush is elected
president and is succeeded by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the ranking Republican in the Texas Senate, expressed no
intention of resigning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his Austin press secretary, Brown
stated:
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution came as a complete surprise! I was not notified
or invited to speak in the secret executive session. To take such a
step without affording me the courtesy to speak personally to the
members holding the closed meeting was a great disappointment.``
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County Republican Chairman Yvonne Dewey said Brown
shouldn't have been surprised because she and other party
officials, including a member of the Republican National Committee,
asked for his resignation during a Nov. 1 meeting at Brown's Lake
Jackson office.
</P>
<P>
   He declined, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted a chance to respond to our concerns, he should
have taken the opportunity Nov. 1,'' Dewey said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's press secretary, Wendy Taylor, said he does not plan to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey said the only negative reaction she has received in
response to the resolution calling for Brown's resignation has come
from the senator himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since September I have gotten a flood of telephone calls from
precinct chairmen, other Republicans in the county and a few from
outside the county,'' she said. ``Most of them are workers who help
to elect Republicans and they feel like they've been betrayed by
him. Their common theme is (that) if we say and do nothing about
this, it's tantamount to condoning his behavior.``
</P>
<P>
   In September, Brown, who is 57 and married, apologized to his
former employee, Tiffany Black, a 20-year-old college student from
Angleton who complained to police that he had groped her and made
sexual comments to her in his Lake Jackson office during an
impromptu golf lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's written apology, which he read to Black in the presence
of his wife, Jill, Brazoria County District Attorney Jeri Yenne and
others, stated that he would seek corrective measures, including
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's behavior has concerned top Republican Party officials,
said Kathy McConn, one of two Republican National Committee members
from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the party aren't very happy,'' said McConn, a
Houston resident. ``It's not something that makes people want to
get behind a candidate, especially someone who's been there 20
years and would like to be lieutenant governor. So I think it's a
problem.``
</P>
<P>
   The resolution that was adopted Monday night by a 19-2 vote of
the county Republican Executive Committee states that the committee
members have a right to expect elected officials to adhere to
``family values'' and set an ``honorable example.``
</P>
<P>
   Brown's sexual harassment ``is not (an example) we want our
children to follow or to be subjected to,'' the resolution states.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also spoke of the need to demonstrate that there
is a difference between Republican principles and ``the party of
Clinton,'' and added that ``we are guilty of hypocrisy if we do
nothing in the face of this black mark against our Party.``
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has run unsuccessfully for attorney general, has
represented District 17 since 1981. The district encompasses parts
of Brazoria, Fort Bend and Harris counties.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, Brown is up
for re-election in 2002.
</P>

FRANCE SAYS SOME MISSIONS IN KOSOVO WERE MORE AMERICAN THAN
ALLIED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France drew up a list of lessons Wednesday that it had
learned from the allied bombing of Yugoslavia last spring. One of
them was that some missions were not really allied at all, but 100
percent American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion cannot be avoided that part of the military
operations were conducted by the United States outside the strict
framework of NATO and its procedures,'' said the Ministry of
Defense in a 55-page report approved by France's highest civilian
political authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The French statement added that the allied commander in charge
of the bombing that ended with the withdrawal of Serbian military
and police forces from Kosovo last June, Gen. Wesley K. Clark of
the United States, was ``responsible not only to the North Atlantic
Council'' of the alliance ``but also to his national hierarchy, at
the highest level.'' Clark is both Supreme Allied Commander and in
charge of all American forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Alain Richard, presenting the analysis to
reporters Wednesday, said France was not complaining that the
Americans had gone behind its back to hit targets like bridges over
the Danube in Belgrade that President Jacques Chirac had refused to
approve.
</P>
<P>
   All he meant, Richard said with a smile, was that France was not
the only member of the alliance whose military structure was not
entirely subordinated to NATO command. ``There was another country
not fully integrated into the alliance _ the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   American planes that were not under allied command, like the
sophisticated B-2 stealth bombers based in Missouri, flew many of
the biggest bombing raids, including the one that the alliance said
mistakenly hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   France did not have the technology to enable its own planes to
evade detection by anti-aircraft radar defenses, the Ministry of
Defense conceded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It also did not have the same ability as the Americans to
confuse enemy radar defenses with airborne electronic devices,
French officials said, or any of the precision weapons guidance
systems using navigation satellites that the B-2s used. France was
still two to three years away, officials said, from developing
cruise missiles like the American-made ones launched from American
B-52s and British and American ships that landed with what the
French said was ``remarkable'' accuracy and precision even in bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``A country that has cruise missiles retains control over how
they are used, but on the other hand, a country that doesn't have
any can find itself excluded from part of the decision-making
process on strikes,'' the ministry report noted, referring to
planning for the allied strikes during the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a certain number of things that we, France and other
Europeans, aren't yet able to do,'' said Gen. Jean-Pierre Kelche,
the French Army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the French lacked the ability to refuel in flight
all of the many French Mirage, Jaguar, and Super Etendard planes
that flew 12 percent of the 10,434 allied combat missions, Kelche
said. ``Without American support, we couldn't have done all that we
did,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, he and Richard said they were satisfied with
the French performance in the Kosovo campaign, and confident that
efforts to build stronger European defenses would rectify the
shortcomings the operations had revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Among these, the ministry's report said, were an inadequate
stockpile of French-made laser-guidance systems to drop bombs with
greater accuracy. French planes dropped 582 laser-guided bombs
during the campaign, the ministry has reported, but apparently it
nearly ran out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high consumption rate of this type of munitions raises the
question of the adequacy and the rebuilding of those stocks,'' the
ministry's report said, ``since it is possible to imagine conflicts
of greater intensity or longer duration.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Defense Ministry, in a similar analysis made public
earlier this fall, concluded, as the French have done, that
Europeans needed to build defense structures better suited to
operations like Kosovo in the future. The British, like the French,
said that Kosovo had shown that the ability of their armed forces
to gather and pass battlefield information securely and quickly to
and from headquarters and individual aircraft, tanks and ships
needed much improvement.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain, Richard said, were now committed to building
stronger European defenses. ``I tell my American friends that one
day I hope they will be able to have as much confidence in European
defense capabilities as they have in the Australians in East
Timor,'' he said.

   Expert sees competitive 2000
</P>
<P>
   Washington Bureau reporter Rebecca Carr interviewed on Wednesday
Republican political consultant Ralph Reed, president of
Atlanta-based Century Strategies, about the upcoming political
season.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, has
been a political consultant on six presidential campaigns and has
advised a nu+ber of Republican lawmakers. He is now a consultant to
the George W. Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During his 8-year tenure at the Christian Coalition, Reed built
the grass-roots organization from a budget of $200,000 to $27
million. By the time he left in 1997, the coalition had 2 million
members in 2,000 local chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What effect will the so-called Christian right have in the
upcoming election year?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think they're going to continue to play a major factor in
the Republican primaries particularly at the presidential level. I
think that religious conservatives have been hurt somewhat by the
fact that their vote has been cannibalized by a range of candidates
_ Alan Keyes, Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle, before he
got out of the race. That makes it harder for you to take that 25
to 30 percent of that vote and get it behind a single candidate and
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   They are clearly an important and key element of the Republican
coalition, but I don't think they'll be able to nominate someone by
themselves for president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you see the Christian right following Pat Buchanan from
the GOP to Ross Perot's Reform Party?
</P>
<P>
   A:No, I really don't. I think that if the Republican Party
nominates a pro-life presidential candidate and has a pro-life
ticket, a conservative pro-life ticket, and retains its traditional
pro-life stand in its platform, I think the vast and overwhelming
grass-roots conservatives will stay with the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue with Buchanan that no one is focusing on, and
this is assuming he is the Reform Party nominee, is that right now
the Reform Party is only guaranteed ballot access in 21 states and
there's no guarantee that they will be able to get on the ballot in
the majority of the remaining states, so there are going to be some
states where he won't even be on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What about the Democratic Party? Do you think that the
Democratic Party can win votes from the Christian right?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think Al Gore will be the nominee, and I expect Al Gore to
run as a centrist, or try to run as a centrist.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Atlanta and gave a major address on faith-based
charitable initiatives at the Salvation Army. He is clearly trying
to move to the center of values, trying to distance himself from
Bill Clinton, trying to move to the center on health care, taxes
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But he's got a problem. He's got a record of service in the
House, a voting record in the Senate and then a record of
supporting all of Bill Clinton's policies and defending him
personally as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think you can run from that. I think if you're vice
president you're strapped to the mast and there's no way to get
away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about a Boston television reporter asking
Gov. George Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, Pakistan
and India?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think the American people recognize the difference between
one's ability to lead and have a grasp of knowledge and have the
right values as a world leader, and the worst form of gotcha
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   We are not electing a ``Jeopardy'' contestant. We are electing
someone who can be the leader of the free world. In every national
poll that was done three days after, Gov. Bush's numbers went up in
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's approval rating nationally is around 68% and the
media's is around 15%.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What do you think about the Gore campaign hiring Naomi Wolf as
a consultant for $15,000 a month?
</P>
<P>
   A:I just wish that George W. Bush would pay his consultants
$15,000 to advocate anything! Politicians have the right to retain
whomever they want as advisers and to solicit those views.
</P>
<P>
   I think what is a little troubling for Gore and I think what is
a political problem for Gore about the Naomi Wolf situation is that
it appeared that someone who had been in public life for a quarter
of a century still didn't know who he really was and still didn't
know how to convey who he was to the American people. I think that
is highly problematic without regard to who the person is.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What are your predictions for 2000?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think this will be a very highly competitive environment. I
think the Republicans will retain the Senate and possibly pick up a
couple of Senate seats in Nevada and New York. I think we will win
the White House. I think George W. will be our nominee and I think
he will win.
</P>
<P>
   I think the House will be too close to call. You have a
five-seat margin, it's the closest margin the post-World War II
period; the Republicans have a larger number of open seats than the
Democrats do. I think it will be very close.

 &HT;    Despite criticism, Reagan biographer Morris at peace
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 14 years, they were polar opposites joined at the hip, one a
thoughtful writer trained in the art of observation, the other a
hearty public figure who appeared never to waste a thought on
himself or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it is all over, however, there's at least one thing
Edmund Morris and Ronald Reagan seem to have in common: Both are at
peace with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing new for Reagan, as Morris makes clear in
``Dutch,'' his controversial new ``memoir'' of the former
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been so sure of himself,'' Morris, 59, said
Wednesday in a downtown Atlanta hotel, a few hours before speaking
to a sold-out crowd at the Atlanta History Center. ``He knew what
he wanted and he knew what he believed in, and he was not remotely
interested if you happened to think differently.''
</P>
<P>
   For Morris, though, such inner unflappability seems more of an
accomplishment of late, given the heated reaction to ``Dutch.''
Having been selected from a stable of esteemed historians to write
the first-ever authorized biography of a sitting American
president, Morris admitted Wednesday that he had figured Reagan out
_ but only of a fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large pool of mystery I don't think anyone could
ever penetrate with him,'' Morris sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still are the waters that the Pulitzer Prize-winning
biographer of Theodore Roosevelt roiled when word got out that
``Dutch'' _ supposedly a work of nonfiction based on the author's
unprecedented access to Reagan during and after his White House
years _ contained several fictional characters. Chief among them
was ``Edmund Morris,'' a narrator-cum-commentator some 28 years
older than the real Morris and possessed of a seemingly uncanny
ability to be wherever Reagan was, from adolescence on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bizarre, irresponsible and monstrously self-absorbed,'' The
New York Times fumed about Morris' technique. A ``cinematic
biography'' that many will ``no doubt view as yet another assault
on the ever-weakening line between fact and fiction,'' Newsweek
fretted.
</P>
<P>
   Morris both does and doesn't get all the furor. He fully
anticipated the disappointment of Reagan acolytes and intimates,
like his wife, Nancy, who expected a standard, ``sentimental''
biography. As for academics and other ``intellectuals'' disturbed
by his technique, Morris simply shrugged and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a democracy,'' he said, pointing out that he never made
up words or thoughts for Reagan or any of the other real people in
the book. ``I've known ever since I was a small boy that if you
ever do anything original, it always creates violent reactions
until people get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Morris doesn't quite understand is what else people
expected him to do when Reagan turned out to defy nearly all of the
standard biographical techniques. Genial to a fault, almost
completely disinterested in self-examination, Reagan had spent all
of his adulthood acting in movies or acting like he was in a movie,
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   So did Reagan's son Ron when Morris interviewed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `You know, my dad has had all these different
careers, all these different parts that he's played: He was a radio
announcer, he was a film star, he was a soldier, he was a trade
union leader, he was a corporate spokesman, he was a governor and
he was president,''' Morris recounted the conversation with the
president's youngest son, whom the biographer has come to like and
admire greatly for his genuine attempts to understand his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `The weird thing about my dad is that not one of
these roles seems to have rubbed off on him,''' Morris continued.
``What he meant was that during the duration of each of these
roles, he was totally convincing. But in between each of these
roles, he reverted to this colorless neutrality. And then a new
role would come along, and he'd become magical again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from signing autographs at a movie premiere to signing a
nuclear treaty with former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev,
everything was a ``scene''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan played as if it had been written for him _ and only for
him, Morris said. And so his somewhat frustated official biographer
came up with a technique whereby fictional characters exchanged
increasingly admiring letters about him as his stature grew and in
which key events played out as movie scenes _ complete with
instructions about how Reagan looked, felt and reacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has become part of the story, that Edmund was so
desperate he had to do this,'' Morris said with a slight chuckle,
recalling an early interview when the president told him in the
most comfortable tone that he now had ``the biggest stage in the
world'' as president. ``Everything you've heard about Reagan's
strangely compelling quality on people, plus the way that he lived
happily on either side of the screen _ it's exactly why the method
suited him so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's the fact that Reagan was, well, boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were interviewing President Reagan right now, you would
be astonished by the dull ordinariness of the conversation,'' said
Morris, who initially found the leader of the free world so
``banal,'' he resisted several early entreaties from the White
House to accept the biographer's role.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the appeal of _ what else? _ the Reagan
storyline won him over. In the opening pages of ``Dutch,'' Morris
describes watching Reagan's heart-rending 1985 visit to the
Bergen-Belsen death camp on TV and regretting that he wasn't there
to record this dramatic moment. Soon after, Morris took on the role
of Reagan biographer and plunged headlong into the world of this
``ordinary'' man with the extraordinarily American lifestory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What may seem to Americans to be an All-American story, to an
immigrant is transcendentally strange,'' said Morris, a South
African native who became an American citizen after moving here in
1968, and who voted for Reagan in both presidential elections.
``Here is a young man of surpassing ordinariness, from the middle
of the Midwest, becoming the most powerful man in the world,
without any apparent discharge of effort. The paradox of Reagan was
that he remained ordinary in person, in private all his life, but
at the same time, he was an extraordinary public phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, being something of a public pheonomenon is something
Morris can relate to. After Wednesday night's sold-out speech, it
was off for more appearances on his multi-city promotional tour for
``Dutch.'' Sometime after New Year's, he'll get back to Part 2 of
his eventual three-volume series on Theodore Roosevelt, a project
he put aside while puzzling out and muscling through the writing of
``Dutch.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds complete, that Roosevelt book places readers
squarely in the time period between 1901 and 1909 and has no
fictional narrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``No hindsight, no history, it's all `You Are There,''' Morris
said with a smile. ``I will be happy to write about somebody who's
dead. It's very difficult to write about somebody who's alive,
because the people around them tend to be very protective and
you're dealing with current sensibilities, with children and wives.
And with everyone's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, in this case, for Ronald Reagan's. The man who, Morris
said, treated him ``no differently'' than anybody else, who evinced
little interest in what his official biographer was doing, and at
the same time displayed absolutely no hostility or suspicion toward
him, is now lost in the ravages of Alzheimer's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Morris hopes his subject of 14 years feels the same sense of
peace he does now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to articulate this, but Reagan is now wandering
around in a landscape of what seems to us to be madness,'' Morris
said pensively. ``But for all we know, he's happy in there. I do
know that up until very recently, he did seem to be happy where he
was. You could hear him humming to himself.''

 &HT;    Cyclone's aftermath dire
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ERSAMA, India _Even the harbingers of death were not spared by
the cyclone that hit India's Orissa state almost two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The air is thick with the stench of rotting flesh, but there
isn't a single vulture in sight.
</P>
<P>
   As a car approaches the village of Jappa, it's hard to tell
there once was a village here.
</P>
<P>
   What remains of a dirt road winds through vast lakes of
floodwater where corpses and carcasses still float.
</P>
<P>
   With 620 inhabitants, mostly small farmers, Jappa, is one of
several villages that make up the coastal Ersama area. Before the
cyclone roared into the eastern state of Orissa, this was an
idyllic hamlet surrounded by rice paddies. Mud huts with thatched
roofs nestled in the shade of lush vegetation. Cattle grazed in
nearby pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The supercyclone of Oct. 29 changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps of rubble are all that remains of Jappa. Twenty-two people
in the village perished. So did 126 cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors sit amid a confusion of bamboo, straw and
decomposing livestock and await the next relief supplies. Some
flock around visitors to describe the nightmare that struck them
when the storm hit. That nightmare has not ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were clinging to trees, to one another,'' said
Ramchandra Muduli, a village elder. He points to the bare tops of
20-foot tall palms to show how high the tidal surge was.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Mullick could do nothing as he watched the rising water
swallow his father, who had stepped outside to retrieve food for
his family. Mullick found the body five days later.
</P>
<P>
   It ``had rotted so much that we couldn't even cremate it,''
Mullick said. ``We had to throw it back in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The death count from the storm topped 7,600 Wednesday. The
Special Relief Commissioner's Office said 7,616 deaths had been
counted, and the Red Cross predicted the toll would climb past
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Monday alone, government workers discovered another 1,500
decomposing bodies in Ersama. The discovery prompted Indian army
officials to suggest total evacuation of the area before a cholera
epidemic sets in. So far, the evacuation has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-thousand Ersama residents have already made a trip to the
area's only clinic and complained of abdominal pains and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen such a catastrophic situation in my life,''
said Dr. Pramod Nayak, the doctor at the clinic. ``There are
thousands of corpses and carcasses contaminating the water. You
cannot avoid seeing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bodies, many villagers have no choice but to
continue bathing and washing clothes in the contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, the floodwaters had kept Ersama isolated
and inaccessible by road. Relief airdrops did arrive in some
places, but they did not make it to Jappa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two days, we were without food,'' Muduli said. ``People
survived on coconuts and rain water.''
</P>
<P>
   The village's entire stock of harvested rice was destroyed by
the water. The maturing kernels still in the fields were cracked
open by the high winds.
</P>
<P>
   Muduli said every man in his village spends the entire day
waiting for food at the relief distribution center about three
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we to do now?'' he said. ``We may have to pick up and
leave this place for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for help, the residents of Jappa take visiting relief
workers on a tour of the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Laprade, CARE's Atlanta-based deputy director for Asia and
Europe, said he was distressed by the lack of hope he found as he
assessed the area's needs. ``This is still going to be a disaster
six months from now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the village has a story to tell. All of them are
grim. Amidst a crowd of anxious elders sharing a litany of travails
stands a 13-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his name, he replied, ``Kaushik Swain.'' The look on his
face is vacant. He has lost both his parents. He has lost
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there is silence, and no one in Jappa has anything
more to say.

<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ He got a prolonged standing ovation on the way
to the podium, and he was mobbed by autograph seekers on the way
out.
</P>
<P>
   But in between Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, fielded some
questions from his shareholders at the company's annual meeting
Wednesday that he might not have faced a week ago, questions about
whether his legal team had failed him and whether the company might
even be broken up in the wake of its antitrust fight with the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In the main, the 44-year-old co-founder of the company was
speaking to a friendly audience, composed of about 2,500
shareholders, and he reiterated his stance that Microsoft's
``innovations and behavior were completely fair and brought
tremendous benefits to millions of consumers.'' The meeting came
five days after a federal judge issued a harsh denunciation of the
company in the antitrust case, saying it had abused its monopoly
power to bully and thwart the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But during a question-and-answer session with the shareholders,
Gates did hear from one man who urged the company to ``try your
damnedest to see that this here suit is settled out of court.'' And
another man spoke of ``the feelings of disappointment at best that
I have and humiliation at worst that I have at how the case against
Microsoft was handled by our counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   With the company's general counsel and chief legal strategist,
William H. Neukom, seated on the dais with Gates, the shareholder
asked the chairman whether he might hire a new legal team so that
``we are not outrun and outmaneuvered by the government,'' putting
such a sarcastic emphasis on the word ``government'' that several
in the audience laughed or applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates launched into a defense of the company's legal
approach and, by implication, of Neukom, who sat silently through
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty important in a case like this not to look in a
very superficial way for someone to blame,'' said Gates. ``When the
government decides they're going to block innovation, your own
government decides they're going to take you to court and say you
should not make those kinds of advances, it's not going to be a
pleasant experience. It's not going to be something that anyone
should have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said: ``The way we've put forth the story through our
internal and external counsel about why our work is good for the
economy, good for consumers, I'm quite proud of what's been done
there. I'm really quite supportive of what's been done there. We're
going to continue to tell that story.'' His remarks drew applause
from the audience, and many shareholders said afterwards that they
were fully behind Gates and his defense of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they should fight this,'' said Don Benusa, a retired
papermaker from Everett, Wash., who described himself as a ``small
shareholder'' of the company. ``Just because the company's a huge
success, the government comes after them. I don't like government
poking its nose into business.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Microsoft stockholders said they remained very high on
Gates, but agreed with the man who stood to criticize the company's
legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled at the whole way the case has been mishandled,''
said Leonard Samuels, who owns a small printing business in
Woodland Hills, Calif., and said he owns 4,200 shares of Microsoft
stock. ``They've made a mess of it. It should never have gotten to
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings, while not a final
verdict, have already had a financial impact. Shares in Microsoft,
the world's most highly valued company, fell for the third day
Wednesday, to $87.125, down $1.75 for the day and almost 5 percent
below Friday's close. Still, even with the case pending, the
company has continued to enrich its investors, with its stock
rising more than 60 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's meeting, Gates and other company officials for
the most part maintained a calm and often smiling demeanor, even
when a loud fire alarm went off for a few moments in the convention
hall here. (A security official quickly cut in over the
loudspeakers to announce that it was a false alarm.) But the
company chairman did show a small flash of pique when he offered an
acerbic characterization of the government's case against his
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this lawsuit,'' he said, ``a software developer would
end up having to focus on questions like, is there anyone else
doing something similar? If so, we can't improve this product in
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is our innovation going to force competitors to work harder?''
he continued. ``If so, we can't improve the product in that way.
Someone might file a lawsuit! Are we providing any features at too
low of a price? Are they too good? Then someone might complain. The
net effect would be a chilling impact on innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, his pledge not to compromise with the government on the
company's ``freedom to innovate'' was met with widespread cheers
from the audience at the Meydenbauer Center here in Bellevue, just
a few miles from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gates and other company officials pledged not to
agree to any settlement that would force the giant software maker
to ``unbundle'' its Internet browser from its Windows operating
system, which currently powers the vast majority of computers
across the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to go a long way to address the government's
concerns,'' said Gates. ``But if we can't get Internet support, we
can't add any new features. No company should accept these kinds of
limitations on their ability to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``One of the most defensible things we've ever
done is to support the Internet in our operating system. We cannot
back off on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A question from another shareholder about whether the company
was making any contingency plans for a break-up, along the lines of
what was done in 1984 to AT&AMP;T Corp., was parried by Microsoft's
chief operating officer, Bob Herbold. He said company officials
firmly believed there was no justification for such an extreme
step.

   MAON FARM, West Bank _ Clutching an olive branch and draped in a
prayer shawl, Yehoshafat Tor, the leader of this militant outpost
of Jewish settlers, lay handcuffed on the ground Wednesday morning,
ringed by Israeli soldiers and police officers after he had been
dragged from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are spitting on this land!'' he shouted at the soldiers,
holding a branch from an olive tree planted at this illegal
settlement, whose residents were evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Tor was seized after a police team in helmets and bullet-proof
vests smashed its way into the back rooms of his stone house,
grabbing him and about a dozen supporters who had barricaded
themselves in a defiant last stand.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking through windows and battering down a door, the officers
emptied the house in short order, carrying off the occupants and
bundling them into police vans. Three hours later, the building was
razed.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition wrapped up a methodical operation by 1,000
soldiers and police officers that began in early morning darkness
to clear out what had become a hotbed of resistance to an accord
reached between settlers and Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a handful of prefabricated homes and wooden shacks
scattered on rocky hills south of Hebron, the squatters at Maon
Farm were the lone holdouts defying the agreement to dismantle 11
illegal Jewish outposts in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   As hundreds of soldiers and police officers arrived before dawn,
the four families living at the farm and about 300 supporters who
had come from other settlements put up fierce but generally
nonviolent resistance, urging soldiers to refuse to obey orders.
</P>
<P>
   On the roof of one mobile home, a group prayed loudly in the
dark, their leader stretching his hands to the heavens as the
police gathered below. Officers were pushed away as they tried to
clamber onto the roof, a ladder was shoved aside and an officer
fell before his comrades scrambled up and hauled off the settlers.
</P>
<P>
   People were also dragged out of a makeshift synagogue, where one
man emerged holding a Torah scroll. ``Traitors! Collaborators! You
are desecrating God's name!'' another man, Yehuda Richter, 37,
shouted as he was carried off. ``Aren't you ashamed?''
</P>
<P>
   One man being hauled off cried: ``This is our land. We've
dreamed about it for 2,000 years. I'm tied to this holy land.''
</P>
<P>
   While the farm was cleared, Barak fired a broadside at the
settlers there as his Cabinet approved a withdrawal from another 5
percent of the West Bank as part of the accords with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events at Maon Farm are a test of democracy and a red
light on the road to anarchy,'' he said in remarks made public by
his office. ``There was a minority there of extremist lunatics and
a majority of well-intentioned people who failed to understand that
this was a test of democracy. The issue is not the land of Israel,
but the priority of the rule of law and ensuring the government's
authority over its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   For the religious militants who wept and wailed as they were
dragged away, the expulsion was a sacrilege, nothing less than the
brutal uprooting of Jews from their ancestral homeland and a
prelude to the removal of more settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions were heightened by the memory of Dov Driben, a militant
settler who founded Maon Farm and was killed near here last year in
a violent clash with Palestinians. Driben was considered a martyr
by settlers at the farm, and his death a blood-pact with its soil.
</P>
<P>
   Holding her nine-month-old baby as military policewomen dragged
weeping teen-age girls from her house, Tor's wife, Shira, kept
repeating, ``Jewish blood was shed here.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the police pulled her away, she told them, ``This blood
is on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   On the walls, posters with the picture of the dead settler urged
soldiers: ``Don't destroy the home of Dov Driben, may God avenge
his blood, who was killed in this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a doorway behind his wife and the girls, Tor, 29,
urged the soldiers to resist orders. ``Say you can't do it!'' he
shouted. ``What's the matter with you? It's no bravery to act
against Jews. God is with us. He'll settle the score.''
</P>
<P>
   As they have often done in the past, some settlers faced the
soldiers while holding small children. ``My babies learn from year
zero what it means to love the land and to sacrifice for the Land
of Israel,'' one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the commander of Israeli forces in the
West Bank, acknowledged that the confrontations were trying for his
troops, who had been briefed about the settlers' likely reactions
and instructed to keep their emotions in check as they evicted
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trained to fight in battle against enemies, not against
Jews, so of course it was a difficult mission,'' Yaalon said.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, the hill had been taken by the army. Hundreds of
soldiers fanned out across the rocky terrain as bulldozers
demolished the remaining shacks and mobile homes were hoisted onto
flatbed trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In a last effort to prevent the destruction of Tor's house,
Rehavam Zeevi, a member of parliament from the far-right Moledet
Party, took a chair and sat inside. But he too was moved out by the
police, and the house was demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulldozers can destroy a house but they can't destroy a
homeland,'' Zeevi said. ``I'll be among the first to return _ once,
twice, a hundred times, until we stay forever.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' would be the irreverent masterpiece some say or the
sacrilegious outrage others have decried if it weren't such a goofy
mess. A stoner comedy, X-Men adventure, social critique and
metaphysical burlesque show never quite coherently rolled into one,
it's a film overflowing with smart ideas that nevertheless plays
out dumb. There are more bad laughs than good ones in this unwieldy
tall tale, but the film is fascinating, if just barely, for the
sheer uniqueness of its hodgepodge eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith, the master of studiedly inept visual storytelling
(``Clerks,'' ``Mallrats,'' ``Chasing Amy''), goes all-out with this
loopy parable of comic-book epiphany in our fallen contemporary
world. His theological ideas are mildly provocative, his
scatalogical humor is as childish as ever, performances are all
over the map and no aspiring filmmaker should even think of
emulating the way anything in this movie looks. All of which makes
``Dogma,'' for better or for worse, this termite artist's magnum
opus.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't make many new converts to the Church of
Clerks, but on the other hand, God is surely too busy to waste good
wrath time on such a silly endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith delights here in taking satiric jabs at all that
Christendom, and especially Catholicism, holds sacred, the movie's
real agenda runs on two rather pious tracks. It's about moralistic
judgment and unlikely redemption, themes it shares with the vast
majority of Sunday- morning sermons.
</P>
<P>
   Bartleby and Loki, two vengeful, sexless angels _ played with
alarming certitude by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon _ cut a violent
swath across an American landscape damned by corporate greed,
industrial blight and media overkill, seeking a return to the
heaven that they consider we mortals too corrupt to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a motley crew of divinely chosen screwballs tries to
prevent Loki and Bartleby from reaching a New Jersey church that
will mystically transport the angels home and destroy all God's
works in the process. Along the way, these kind-of-heroic prodigals
could earn themselves something like the gift of faith.
</P>
<P>
   What this means to you and me is that mankind's fate rests in
the shaky hands of the following, indifferently performed losers:
Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a lapsed Catholic-turned-abortion-
clinic worker and distant relative of Jesus; Rufus (Chris Rock),
the trash-talking, self-proclaimed 13th apostle, who explains that
he was left out of the Bible because he's black; Metatron (Alan
Rickman), God's own seraphic spokesman, who really ought to do
something about that snotty British attitude of his; Serendipity
(Salma Hayek), a heavenly muse now working as a lap dancer after
inspiring 19 of the top 20 box office hits of all time (as for the
one she can't explain, let's just say that the movie attacks John
Hughes more savagely than it does the church); and Jay and Silent
Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself), two cheap thrill-seeking
slackers who have been elevated from sidebar status in the
director's previous films to the ranks of prophets here.
</P>
<P>
   Between encounters with monsters made of holy excrement and
hopeless attempts to score with Bethany, our heroes debate the
usual questions naughty catechism students discuss among
themselves. God, the sound of whose voice will blow up a mortal's
brain, is played by Alanis Morissette _ a great joke of casting
that will probably be lost on the film's more pious protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Not that their complaints about ``Dogma'' are uniformly wrong.
From a devout point of view, this film is as nasty as it will be
perceived hilarious by those who think George Carlin as a priest
with a new ``Buddy Jesus'' marketing scheme is a stroke of genius.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will chuckle and groan in slightly unequal
measure. And those who worship film as art will pray that someday
Smith will let his director of photography (in this case,
``Drugstore Cowboy'' and ``Rushmore's'' accomplished Robert Yeoman)
and production designer do their jobs properly. And that he'll
maybe hire real editors and a dialogue coach, amen.

SECURITY FEARS RISE AT CLINICS FOR ABORTIONS IN CANADA
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to drop redundant words from quote.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ This is the season when doctors who perform
abortions consider going on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this time of year, do not walk or jog in your
neighborhood or anywhere else on a regular schedule,'' warned a
police bulletin distributed last week by the Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada to its members.
``Consider wearing body armor, including at home. Do not put on or
take off your body armor in public, including parking lots and
public bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last five years, five Canadian and American
doctors who perform abortions have been shot on or around Nov. 11,
which is Remembrance Day, a Canadian version of Veterans Day. But
Nov. 11 is recognized differently by some anti-abortion militants
on both sides of the border. They call it Remember the Unborn
Children Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bad time of the year for abortion providers in
Canada,'' Marilyn M. Wilson, executive director of Canadian
Abortion Rights Action League, said from Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Winnipeg, a binational police group was set up days
after a doctor who performed abortions was shot and wounded on Nov.
11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be hard pressed to find anyone in the abortion field
who is not aware of the risk at this time of year,'' said Inspector
Keith McCaskill of the Winnipeg police, a spokesman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   The group draws on police forces across Canada and western New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that based on the similarities that all five
shootings are likely linked,'' McCaskill said. He pulled from a
file a wanted poster with a photograph of a 45-year-old bearded
man. In U.S. dollars, the reward is $377,000 for the arrest and
conviction of the man, James Charles Kopp.
</P>
<P>
   A fugitive on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, Kopp was indicted
in June in Buffalo, N.Y., in the killing on Oct. 23, 1998, of Dr.
Barnett A. Slepian, an obstetrician who performed abortions. In
Canada, Kopp is wanted on an immigration warrant and for
questioning in the shootings of three doctors here, all of whom
survived.
</P>
<P>
   The last known sighting of Kopp was in New Jersey, 10 days after
Slepian was slain. In December 1998, one of Kopp's cars was found
in a parking lot at Newark International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation is that he may be getting assistance from
somebody else,'' McCaskill said, referring to a loose underground
network of anti-abortion radicals.
</P>
<P>
   With the prime suspect in the attacks on the run, Canada may now
be returning to the nonviolent debate of the last 30 years over
abortion. Last month, Preston Manning, leader of the Reform Party,
the official opposition party in Parliament, challenged the
governing Liberals to show ``moral nerve, by defining the rights of
the unborn.'' The Reform Party, centered largely here in the West,
enjoys growing support from evangelical Christians, who make up
about 15 percent of Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a setback to anti-abortion forces, a pharmaceutical
company, Roberts Pharmaceutical Canada Inc., announced last week
that it would start marketing Preven, a ``morning after'' pill, in
Canada. Approved in the United States two years ago, Preven,
according to its manufacturer, prevents pregnancy. Abortion
opponents denounce it as an abortion drug.
</P>
<P>
   If widely used, the drug is generally expected to lead to a
decline in the number of abortions performed in clinics and
hospitals nationwide. After doubling in 20 years, the number of
abortions hit a plateau in the mid-90s, staying around 106,000.
Abortion is available in major cities in all 10 provinces, except
Prince Edward Island, the smallest. In 1988, the Supreme Court
voided the criminal code provisions on abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in abortion accompanied a sharp drop in live births to
teen-agers. Since 1974, the teen-age birth rate declined 38
percent, to 22.1 per 1,000 in 1996. In the United States, the
teen-age birth rate also dropped, but remains about double the
Canadian rate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, the fear of violence and retirements are
believed to have contributed to a 30 percent drop in the number of
doctors who perform abortions in Canada, the National Obstetricians
and Gynecologists Society estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 20 years of intense debate over abortion, Gallup polling
indicates that opinions have changed only marginally since 1975. In
the latest poll on abortion, conducted a year ago, 12 percent said
abortion should be ``illegal under any circumstances,'' 55 percent
said it should be permitted under certain circumstances, and 30
percent said it should be legal under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably be like Holland,'' said Henry Morgentaler, an
abortion rights pioneer who owns eight clinics across Canada,
including one here that takes extra security measures in November.
``Abortions will plateau, then decline as sex education in the
schools take off and women use contraception in a better way.''

   FARRELL-DANCE (Undated) _ ``You see her yield completely,
fainting with a soft abandon in a supported deep back bend, and
before you see the recovery, she is already standing apart, mild
and free, as if in thought.'' The dancer was the teenage Suzanne
Farrell, in 1964. The writer was Edwin Denby, one of the great
chroniclers of the New York City Ballet, where Ms. Farrell danced.
The ballet he wrote about was ``Meditation,'' created for her by
George Balanchine, whose choosing of the young dancer as his muse
was to become a central metaphor in the lives of Ms. Farrell,
Balanchine and American ballet. Now Ms. Farrell, who retired from
the stage in 1989, has become a muse of another sort. Since 1993,
she has taught summer master classes at the Kennedy Center &UR;  &LR; in

   EMILY-WATSON-FILMS (Undated) _ Judging from her cinematic
repertory, one might think that the actress Emily Watson would be
tiny, vulnerable, an imperiled sprite of a woman. Her roles _ the
tormented young wife of a paraplegic in the 1997 film ``Breaking
the Waves''; the volcanic, terminally ill cellist Jacqueline du Pre
in ``Hilary and Jackie''; the impoverished Irish housewife in
``Angela's Ashes,'' opening Dec. 22 _ seem to call for someone
small whose intellectual and spiritual presence eventually
dominates the room. Surely, Ms. Watson must be tiny, doll-like and
fragile in real life, too. But she turns out to be a beanstalk,
more than 5-foot-9 in sneakers. By Alex Kuczynski. (Moved). Photo.

   SLEEPY-HOLLOW-FILM (New York) _ Tim Burton, in his suite at the
Regency Hotel here, after a day of interviews to promote his new
film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' appears to be equal parts funeral
director, mad scientist and Swifty Lazar. He does not mind jokes
about his hair looking as if it has been combed with a Mixmaster.
He's just glad he has a head. By the end of his new film, so few
cast members do. Based on Washington Irving's classic ``The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,'' this film is Burton's chance to make the kind

the 1950s and '60s so revered by hipsters today. By Frank DeCaro.

   HURRICANE-FILM (New York) _ ``I feel good about the work,'' said
Denzel Washington, seated at one of the prime banquettes in Jean
Georges restaurant at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. That film is
``The Hurricane,'' based on the story of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter,
the middleweight boxer who spent 19 years in New Jersey prisons for
murders he insisted he did not commit, until a federal judge
overturned his conviction and freed him. The film will be released
by Universal Studios on Dec. 29 in New York and Los Angeles to
qualify for Academy Award consideration. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).

   MOVIES-ENDINGS (Undated) _ Movies used to end. Audiences knew
the end was near when two lovers walked into a sunset, a cowpoke
rode off into a sunset, or Gloria Swanson descended the stairs in
her mansion on Sunset Boulevard. For those who couldn't take a
hint, filmmakers invariably flashed the phrase ``THE END.'' Like a
bartender flipping the lights on after last call, ``THE END'' told
moviegoers to beat it, pal. Such endings provided a punctuation
mark, finality, what Oprah acolytes call closure. But now ``THE
END'' is in foreclosure. Movies dribble out their final moments
like an NBA point guard trying to kill the clock. By Franz Lidz and

Who can watch ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and not feel a surge of

   BOULEZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ Pierre Boulez will probably never shake
off the reputation he earned in his 20s as a fearsome polemicist on
behalf of the most complex contemporary music, including his own.
He emerged from Europe in the 1950s as the leading advocate of the

music. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).

two-thirds of his 300 compositions for the piano and that an awful

comic voices, Stan Freberg's is a Stradivarius. To see his rubber
mouth, off-center jaw and wild eyes in person _ and hear that
sonorous, ever-shifting voice _ is to remember hours and years of
laughter that began in his head and went straight to your ear, and
belly. Now 73, Freberg is the grand old satirist of radio and
records. He began his career in the 1950s by puncturing the
stifling conventions of the Eisenhower era and lampooning the
prevailing pop-culture effluvia of everything from ``Dragnet'' to
the wailing androgynous singer Johnnie Ray. By Todd S. Purdum.

album, Tupac Shakur's ``All Eyez on Me,'' and Eminem's ``The Slim
Shady LP,'' all multimillion sellers, while rapping on their albums
and co-starring in their video clips. But on his new album, ``Dr.

   DREAMSCAPE-ARCH (Undated) _ Compared with other art forms,
architecture has remained remarkably impervious to the influence of
Freudian ideas. For many people, buildings still represent the
world of external reality: the faces we put on in public, the
appeals to science, civility, God, gravitas, nature, the past, the
future and other authorities outside the self. Subjective states _
dreams, fantasies, memories, fears and desires _ have been largely
contained within the compass of interior design. Among younger
architects, however, there is growing determination to break out of
this binary inside-outside structure. And the computer has emerged
as a highly effective tool for achieving that goal. By Herbert

   MALIBU, Calif. _ Would it be a surprise to know that before its
dedication as public open space, the property that now makes up
Sycamore Cove State Beach and the southern entrance to Big Sycamore
Canyon was slated for a harbor and hotel complex that would have
dwarfed Marina del Rey?
</P>
<P>
   If you're upset about that prospect, just think how the
opponents of it felt back in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for the detractors. Instead of commercial blight,
we have in southern Ventura County one of the largest undisturbed
examples of a Mediterranean habitat in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say there are no seasons in Southern California, but
you can see all four in Sycamore,'' said Joe Dillman, 75, of
Thousand Oaks, who has been riding mountain bikes in Big Sycamore
Canyon for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Point Mugu State Park, within which is found the canyon and
beach, is unique in that it spans uninterrupted between the
coastline and the inland community of Newbury Park.
</P>
<P>
   It provides a diverse backcountry experience for residents
surrounding the Santa Monica Mountains. And on any given weekend
one may find people from as far north as Santa Barbara and as far
south as Manhattan Beach visiting the revered sycamore- and
oak-canopied canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons I like coming to Sycamore Canyon is
that all the trail users respect and appreciate one another,'' said
Mansoor Sabbage, president of the South Bay Mountain Bike Club.
``There are rides for every level of rider. So no matter who we
bring up from the South Bay, we know they'll have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perennially running streams and a proximity to cool, moist ocean
breezes makes Big Sycamore Canyon as verdant as any area in the
Santa Monicas. And the towering ridges that descend to the breakers
provide spectacular vistas, including views of the Channel Islands.
And while many travel great distances to get here, it is the
advantage of having such a splendid backcountry right in their
backyard that keeps most people coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of Sycamore. It's where I go to both relax
and stay fit,'' said Jack Short, whose home adjoins the park's
boundary. ``Even if I just ride up and down the pavement hill a
couple of times, it's better than going to a gym and riding the
stationary bike.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail system in Point Mugu State Park is as diverse as the
terrain. With many miles of rolling fire road, beginning to
intermediate mountain bikers can find a leisurely ride along the
bottom of Big Sycamore Canyon. More experienced riders can revel in
the challenging singletrack of Guadalasca Trail and Wood Canyon
Vista Trail. And fitness freaks will enjoy the many hundreds of
feet of climbing from canyon bottom to ridge top. There are many
options off the main canyon, making loops and out-and-back rides of
varying lengths and difficulty easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite route of more experienced off-road riders is the
moderate to difficult loop that connects the Wood Canyon,
Guadalasca, North Overlook and Wood Canyon Vista trails. It can be
accessed from Big Sycamore Canyon Trail from either the coast or
Newbury Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trailhead on the coast, off Pacific Coast Highway, is about
30 miles north of Santa Monica. The day-use parking is $5. Once
parked, make your way through the campground to where the Big
Sycamore Canyon Trail _ a wide fire road _ begins at an elevation
of less than 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   From the gated entrance to canyon, ride 4 miles to a Y and bear
left into Wood Canyon via its namesake trail. Pedal eight-tenths of
a mile (mile 4.8, cumulative) to a T intersection at Deer Camp
Junction, with its shady oak grove and picnic table. Turn right and
continue on Wood Canyon Trail four-tenths of a mile to the signed
Guadalasca Trail and turn left on it (mile 5.2). At this point the
doubletrack terrain becomes more vertical, so dig in. Climb about
nine-tenths of a mile to the singletrack that comes in from the
left (mile 6.1). Next is a 2-mile climb up to the juncture with
North Overlook Trail (mile 8.1), which tops out at an elevation of
just more than 1,200 feet. Turn left. A short climb is followed by
an exhilarating 1-mile fire-road descent to the intersection with a
trail leading to the right into La Jolla Valley (mile 9.1). About
50 yards past this intersection is Wood Canyon Vista Trail on the
left. Take it for a challenging 1.8-mile drop back to Big Sycamore
Canyon Trail to complete your inland loop (mile 10.9).
</P>
<P>
   Turn right here to head back the 3.9 miles to where you started.
Total round-trip mileage is 14.8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To access Big Sycamore Canyon's northern and trailhead in
Newbury Park, take the Ventura Freeway (101) north, exit at Wendy
Drive and turn left. Turn right at Lynn Road. At Reino Road, Lynn
becomes Potrero Road. Continue 1{ miles to the entrance to the
National Park Service-held Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa Park. Follow
the road to the parking area, which is flagged by kiosks and
portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Start here and ride past the gate toward the park's cultural
center, veering right down the one-lane paved road after about
three-quarters of a mile. Here begin a steep half-mile descent into
Big Sycamore Canyon from a high point of 860 feet of elevation.
Curb the urge to go full throttle on this steep pitch as vehicles
often come up this road. At mile 2.7 is a T intersection. Continue
on the paved road 1.1 miles to Danielson Ranch (3.8 miles,
cumulative), where the trail turns to dirt. Remain on the main Big
Sycamore Canyon road downhill 1{ miles to Wood Canyon Trail on the
right (5.3 miles.) Now follow the same directions as above.
</P>
<P>
   Once completed the loop back to Big Sycamore Canyon, turn left
and return to Newbury Park. This option is 17{ miles round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   Note: While maps of the routes in and around Big Sycamore Canyon
are posted on signs, it's smart to have one in hand. Consider using
the 7.5-minute series topographic maps of Camarillo, Point Mugu and
Newbury Park, as well as Tom Harrison Cartography's ``Trail Map of
the Santa Monica Mountains West.''
</P>
<P>
   For maps and other information, call the National Park Service
at (805) 370-2301 or visit the headquarters of its Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive in
Thousand Oaks. &QL;

COMMENTARY: DISMANTLING MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is being praised for proposing a bold new plan to
make health insurance available to nearly all Americans, and for
putting the health care issue back on the national agenda in a
major way.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the strongest advocates of health care reform,
especially those concerned about the health of poor children, are
worried that Bradley's proposal is financially unrealistic and, in
some ways, could do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Causing the most worry is Bradley's plan to do away with
Medicaid, the federal and state program that provides health care
for the poor. It would be replaced by a system of vouchers and tax
credits designed to ``mainstream'' low-income people into the
private insurance market.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid has been like a safe house for the poor. The thought of
moving the poor out of Medicaid and into the health care
marketplace with only a voucher for protection fills many advocates
with dread.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers to purchase health insurance are, in fact, capped
subsidies, and the caps have been set quite low. So poor people in
many parts of the country may go into the private market only to
find that their vouchers will not cover the full cost of health
insurance. A big fear is that people now enrolled in Medicaid could
end up with no coverage at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled that health care is back on the agenda,'' said
Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund, which
is based in New York and has become a national model for providing
health care to poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to see this issue front and center like it is
now, and that's a good thing. But I think Senator Bradley's
proposal that Medicaid be eliminated is incredibly ill advised.
Medicaid to me is a 30-year-old bedrock safety net program for
children and poor pregnant women. For the life of me, I can't
understand how that can be replaced by what amounts to a voucher
program, which would both undermine the health care access that
children have gotten under Medicaid and, second of all, put a new
set of bureaucratic burdens on poor families that I think is just
unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Feder, the dean of policy studies at Georgetown University,
said there were aspects of Bradley's plan that she admired. But
she, too, is concerned about the elimination of Medicaid, which
provides not only health care but a range of related services to
the very poor. Those services can include personal assistance and
non-emergency transportation, as well as supplying beneficiaries
with eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs and other medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' said Ms. Feder, ``to understand the special
role of Medicaid. It treats a very disadvantaged population and
provides a broad array of services that private health insurance
has never touched.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other potential problems. Medicaid provides nursing
home care for the elderly, which is a significant benefit for both
low- and middle-class families. Under Bradley's plan, the
responsibility for long-term care would be turned over to the
states. What happens to long-term benefits and nursing home
standards under that scenario is, at the moment, anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   I asked David Cutler, a professor of economics at Harvard and a
health care adviser to the Bradley campaign, about the financial
hurdles faced by the plan. He said he expected the caps to be
raised, that the proposed $1,800-a-year ceiling on the health
insurance vouchers to be given to poor people would be increased to
better reflect the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subsidy is not up to the most generous plan, not even the
median plan, but a decent plan,'' said Cutler. His understanding,
he said, is that it ``is not fixed in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes to pay for his initiative with money from the
federal budget's non-Social Security surplus. Vice President Al
Gore, who is touting his own, more modest health care proposal _
and who also plans to pay for it with the surplus _ has said
Bradley's plan will devour the entire surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't eat up all of it,'' Cutler said, adding, ``To me,
the bigger issue is, before this gets enacted, or anything gets
enacted, will Congress have already spent the money, either on
silly tax cuts or something else.''

   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ With just over two weeks to go before
Uruguayans choose their next president, what had been a lively
campaign suddenly turned funereal after a bus plunged off a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was taking scores of activists from the governing
Colorado Party home from a campaign rally north of Montevideo.
Nineteen people were crushed to death, and many others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, politicians have been visiting funeral parlors
instead of glad-handing voters on the campaign trail. Press
releases from the usually fiery left now read like condolence
notices, and in place of front-page pictures of candidates on the
stump the papers have been filled with photographs of the tangled
wreckage and the fateful bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking pause in a race that had already remodeled
Uruguay's political map, making a leftist coalition that includes
former Tupamaro guerrillas a serious contender for power.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was part of a caravan of vehicles returning to
Montevideo from a rally for Jorge Batlle, the candidate of the
Colorado Party, last Saturday evening
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage promptly shifted from the campaign to what in
normal times would be standard disaster fare. New theories have
surfaced daily about what caused the wreck. Politicians have been
shown going through the task of consoling mourning families, and
campaign headquarters have been as solemn as funeral parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle, a 72-year-old former senator and four-time losing
presidential candidate, officially suspended all campaign
activities and advertising for three days, and he is expected to
take several more days to restart his flagging campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tabare Vazquez, an oncologist and candidate of a leftist
coalition who won a large plurality in October's first round of
voting, also took a few days off from campaigning out of respect,
though on Tuesday he quietly began a tour of the north that
included local media interviews but no rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say it is hard to tell what, if any, effect
the bus crash will have on the outcome of the vote Nov. 28, which
is likely to be very close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the intensity of the grief has shown how neighborly this
country of 3.2 million people still is. An event that somewhere
else might have been a regrettable but standard traffic accident
has shown Uruguay as a country that puts individuals above
politics, where people are so cordial that they typically pass
around gourds of mate, a somewhat bitter herbal drink, to friends
and even strangers with a single straw.
</P>
<P>
   But a related incident also reflected the deep-seated
polarization that remains a vestige of the urban guerrilla war and
military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the accident, as President Julio Maria Sanguinetti
was visiting a funeral parlor, he was met by 10 youthful supporters
of Vazquez's coalition, Frente Amplio, who jeered him and shot off
firecrackers. One youth shouted out, ``There are 20 fewer votes!''
_ referring to an early erroneous report that there had been 20
deaths in the accident. Sanguinetti, who supports Batlle, replied,
``Respect the dead, you shameless people!'' The incident was widely
reported in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``That spectacle had a negative impact not just for the Frente,
but it also reflected something negative about our culture,'' said
Claudio Paolillo, managing editor of the newspaper Busqueda. ``It
showed there is revenge in the Uruguayan spirit. This isn't
Colombia, so 19 people dying in one day in Uruguay seizes the
country. It's a disaster that has stopped everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez's coalition includes Socialists, Communists, former
Tupamaro guerrillas and Trotskyites, but he has kept his campaign
oratory relatively moderate and his promises vague. He won 39
percent of the vote in the first round, easily beating Batlle, who
had 31.7, but falling short of the necessary majority to win an
outright victory. His strong showing reflected a general weariness
with the two traditional centrist parties, which are viewed as
uncreative and unable to lift the country from a recession that has
left a tenth of the work force unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Tupamaro guerrillas won Senate seats in the balloting
Oct. 31, and the Frente Amplio will now control the largest blocs
of representatives in the two houses of Congress for the first time
since the coalition was formed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election has already determined that the Frente Amplio is
the No. 1 political force in the country,'' said Luis Eduardo
Gonzalez, a leading political consultant. ``The runoff is an
unpredictable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting a come-from-behind victory, Batlle has forged a deal
with the third-place candidate, former President Luis Alberto
Lacalle of the center-right National Party, who won 21.5 percent in
the first round. Should Batlle win, the National Party will receive
several cabinet positions. But Dr. Vazquez is making a strong pitch
to National Party voters, who are concentrated in more conservative
rural areas, with promises of ``a cautious revolution against
inequalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez was mayor of Montevideo in the early 1990s, and he
focused his efforts on such unideological matters as cleaning up
the waterfront and parks. He has publicly rejected several radical
proposals floated by aides, such as taxing bank accounts, and in
recent days has sent representatives to speak to officials at the
U.S. State Department, World Bank and European Community as signals
of moderation. He has also promised to pay interest due on the
foreign debt, not to devalue the Uruguayan peso, and not touch bank
secrecy laws that have helped make Montevideo a regional financial
center.
</P>
<P>
   Batlle, who has a reputation for being overly frank for a
politician, has been careful not to use heated political language
to criticize Vazquez or his radical followers. At the rally before
the bus accident, he warned in subtle, measured tones of Uruguayans
who ``have the same rights as we do but think they can impose
themselves on us with some form of aggression or excessive
exuberance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanguinetti has recently dropped his public attacks on the
Frente Amplio as a dangerous ``Marxist'' threat. In an interview
this week, he refused to comment on the election, except to say,
``In the first round people voted with their hearts, in the second
they will vote with their brains.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Every dramatist knows that before the plot can
thicken, a mix of characters must be stirred in. In the roman a
clef to be written about the Bush campaign, if it wins, here are
the real people on whom to base the cast:
</P>
<P>
   The cunning strategist: Karl Rove, professional pol, strives to
be grandmaster of the political chessboard, honing themes,
anticipating opponents' thrusts.
</P>
<P>
   Will Steve Forbes ever launch a TV campaign to brand the Texas
governor a heavy taxer? If he does, Rove's counter would measure
increases in Texas against Ronald Reagan's record in California. No
Bush litmus test on abortion for Supreme Court nominees? The answer
that turneth away pro-life wrath: Such a prejudgment would have to
be d to the Senate at confirmation, and the nominee would
then have to recuse himself when the issue comes before the court.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign durability is the strategist's mantra; rather than ``a
thousand points of light,'' he thinks of a $5 million TV buy as ``a
thousand points of penetration'' in California, ensuring that a
viewer sees a Bush ad 10 times in the critical state.
</P>
<P>
   The tough, take-charge campaign manager next bestrides the stage
of ``301 Congress Avenue,'' address of the headquarters and likely
title of the insiders' drama.
</P>
<P>
   He is big, burly, bombastic Joe Allbaugh, with a Haldeman crew
cut and an overpowering presence. The former Oklahoma farmer ran
Bush's victory over Ann Richards in 1994 and enforces the
candidate's will with Frank Nitti-like discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In command of the Bush calendar, he gives the candidate weekends
off; in December, Allbaugh schedules one joint TV appearance a week
and has Bush at home nearly half the days before Christmas. Not
overly taxing. If the nomination is decided by April, he'll send
Bush overseas before the convention to gain gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   The resident intellectual is the youthful but graying policy
adviser and outside-advice conduit, Joshua Bolten. He's the slot
man, turning to a capable triumvirate of Stephen Goldsmith,
Condoleezza Rice and Larry Lindsey for domestic, foreign and
economic positions. (Espousing competition in education may augur
resistance to monopoly in the marketplace.)
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't run a ``murder board'' _ the panel of tough
questioners that usually prepares candidates for debates and
penetrating interviews. That's because Bush is not receptive to the
scripting of quips, ripostes and zingers. This could be a mistake
in a head-to-head with John McCain, gaining every day; an
unrehearsed Bush failed to dominate a weak opponent in an El Paso
debate last year.
</P>
<P>
   The strong woman alter ego, now an indispensable public role, is
played by Karen Hughes, his longtime spokeswoman. This dedicated,
savvy media aide knows how he thinks and what he should say but
what he's likely to say, and is on a hair trigger to counter
charges of lightweightedness. She brooks no interference with her
access; nobody on the inside crosses her.
</P>
<P>
   The idealistic speechwriter, an appealing stock character in
political novels, is played by Michael Gerson, laboring behind a
closed door and a pile of books and papers at 301 Congress. A
theology student at Wheaton College, he wrote for Chuck Colson in
the Prison Fellowship, was one of Bob Dole's junior writers in
1996, and had turned to journalism at U.S. News before his
recruitment by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson has adopted his principal's style, remembered from a Yale
rhetoric course: three points and a peroration, elevated rather
than homey, with declarative sentences, no oratorical run-ups, with
topical organizers like ``prosperity with a purpose,''
``responsibility society'' and ``empowering faith-based
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows his boss is reading Pat Tyler's ``The Great Wall'' for
China policy, just as the strategic guru Rove is rereading William
Roepke's ``The Humane Economy.'' But Gerson no longer has time to
read; he must turn out a draft of a foreign policy address to be
given next week at the Reagan Library. He's looking for Reagan
quotes to advocate advancing freedom but husbanding military power
_ without appearing to straddle.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the cast at 301 Congress reflects well on Bush's
organizing ability, but it has not yet taken a body blow. Lest
overconfidence show, gruffs Allbaugh, the manager, ``There'll be no
measuring for White House drapes.'' But that's what the entire Bush
cast must be secretly doing. Even pols are human.

TV'S NEW ODD COUPLE: A BACHELOR AND HIS STYLISH PAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By KIMBERLY STEVENS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Television shows about single men at home have been
proliferating, and have come a long way since the days of Oscar and
Felix.
</P>
<P>
   Decor is muscling in.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Oscar Madison, the slob sportswriter of the '70s,
could barely find his sofa under the Chinese takeout food cartons?
</P>
<P>
   This season finds Ross of ``Friends'' (David Schwimmer) moving
into bachelor digs with Craftsman-style furniture and warm red
walls that signal ``he's ready to nest,'' said John Shaffner, the
show's production designer, whose set is intended to signal ``an
educated man who is not afraid of having an aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of male programming is trying to capture the male
viewer, and his wallet, maintained Shaffner, who also created sets
for two single-guy sitcoms, ``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``The Norm
Show.'' He added, ``Up until fairly recently, the programming was
driven by a female audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that shows have attracted male audiences, Shaffner said,
plot lines allow male characters to redo their bachelor digs. On
early episodes of ``Friends'' the guys were decora-phobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many characters have a lot of insecurity about making
decorating choices, and their apartments mirrored those feelings,''
he added. For the first season, Joey and Chandler lived in a
colorless apartment. ``Fear of color meant fear of choice,''
Shaffner said, translating. ``They slowly evolved and began to feel
more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Furniture can also telegraph upscale ambition. The deputy mayor
in ``Spin City,'' Michael Flaherty (played by Michael J. Fox),
lives in a tiny apartment, but it is filled with flea market finds
_ a Chinese Art Deco rug, McCoy pottery and a Beacon blanket _ that
signal a budding collector. ``My set is reality-based,'' insisted
Cabot McMullen, the show's production designer, who kept in mind
Flaherty's $80,000 annual City Hall salary. (There's an Ikea end
table and television cabinet.)
</P>
<P>
   The sea change in decor began in the early '90s, designers say,
with that lovable aesthete, Frasier, who is as picky about his
Italian lighting as his Armani suits. Seinfeld, around the same
time, was still decorating his New York apartment with cereal boxes
and an expensive Klein bicycle on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   During television's golden age, when the predominant audience
for sitcoms was families, men didn't make decorating decisions.
Bill Bixby, the single dad on ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father''
(1969-1972), had Mrs. Livingston, his housekeeper, to worry about
complementing the carpet. When Barbara Eden, in an episode of ``I
Dream of Jeannie'' (1965-1970), complained about her astronaut
beau's shoddy furniture, she did a makeover with magic. Ben
Cartwright on ``Bonanza'' (1959-1973) had a living room at the
Ponderosa the size of Lake Tahoe, with leather sofas that could
rival those at the University Club, but he was clearly most at home
on the range, where the leather was a saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Even today there are throwbacks to the unevolved males of
yesteryear. Don't expect Drew Carey to run out and buy an Eames
chair; he lives in his childhood home and nostalgically favors
Mom's and Dad's things. Nor will Joey on ``Friends'' part with his
recliner. (He could upgrade: La-Z-Boy introduced a recliner with a
built-in electric cooler that can hold six 12-ounce cans. The chair
also sports a telephone to order out for pizza.)
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, television bachelors are, like Frasier,
becoming more aspirational. In their third season, the two guys of
``Two Guys and a Girl,'' a show about three postcollege friends
sharing an apartment, got rid of their basketball hoop _ ``the
classic single-guy symbol,'' said David Sackeroff, the show's
production designer. Other changes include replacing posters with
framed prints.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffner says that losing the reminders of college life (hoops,
posters) is a milestone for today's television guys' guys. ``Now we
accept that a single man would have an opinion about his furniture
or the color of his walls,'' he said. ``He can bring a girlfriend
home and it's clear to her that he's an adult. His furniture is
matched in its wood tones.''

`CYBERSQUATTING' BILL IS ATTACHED TO SATELLITE TV MEASURE  
(DW) 
 BY JERI CLAUSING   
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to fend off a threatened veto of a
controversial bill to outlaw speculating in Internet addresses, or
``cybersquatting,'' congressional leaders have attached it to a
satellite television bill that has passed the House and is awaiting
a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the anti-cybersquatting legislation as part of
the Satellite Television Home Viewers Act marks a major victory for
the Motion Picture Association of America and other groups that
have sought to protect trademarks online.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House Tuesday night by a vote of 408 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet language was inserted into the satellite bill
because the White House had threatened to veto anti-cybersquatting
legislation. But the administration favors the satellite bill as a
way to help satellite TV companies compete with cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, may have thrown a monkey
wrench into that strategy, however, by threatening to block final
passage of the satellite bill because he opposes a financing
provision.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet speculation language would allow trademark holders
as well as politicians and athletes _ groups that increasingly have
been the targets cybersquatters _ to take civil action against
anyone who registers celebrity names or trademarks as Internet
addresses with hopes of reselling them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Trademark holders would be able to sue cybersquatters in the
nation where the domain name was registered and seek up to $100,000
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions were sought by the Motion Picture Association
of America and other groups representing trademark holders, who say
their members have spent millions of dollars in recent years buying
the rights to domain names, which cost only $70 to register.
Cybersquatters routinely register movie titles, company names or
the names of products, then demand large sums to turn them over to
trademark holders.
</P>
<P>
   Personal names would also be protected, although those suits
could not seek monetary damages. Among the proponents of that
language was Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Judiciary Committee
chairman and a Republican presidential candidate, who earlier this
year was solicited by cybersquatters who had registered names that
could be used for campaign Web sites, like hatch2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the legislation say they fear its impact on
Internet free speech and worry that it would put at a disadvantage
small companies that might have a legitimate claim to the same name
or word as a larger company's registered trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill will increase the problem of reverse domain name
hijacking, where someone who covets a domain name but has no legal
claim to it tries to coerce the domain name owner into handing over
the domain name,'' said Carl Oppedahl, a Colorado trademark lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several highly publicized cases of reverse
domain name hijacking, including that of a young boy nicknamed
Pokey who almost lost pokey.org to the toy company that owned the
rights to the Gumby and Pokey characters, and a young girl named
Veronica whose Web site was sought by Archie Comics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $100,000 is going to be used to intimidate people,'' said
A. Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor who has
been closely following international attempts to crack down on
cybersquatting. ``In a lot of these cases, the mom and pop type
operations will just go quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Heltzer, government relations manager of the
International Trademark Association, said groups like his were only
trying to target the ``bad faith actors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an effective and even-handed piece of
legislation,'' Heltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House last month opposed the cybersquatting
legislation, saying it preferred to see rules governing such
disputes set by the global network's executive body, the Internet
Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann. Icann is the
nonprofit entity picked by the administration last year to run the
Internet's domain name system.
</P>
<P>
   The group recently enacted a rule that sends all claims related
to trademarks to arbitration panels. The idea of the Icann policy
is to reduce the cost of litigation and make sure there is a
uniform set of rules that can be applied worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Icann officials have declined to comment on the congressional
bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first detailed remarks on the subject since
late last year, President Clinton predicted Wednesday that the year
2000 computer problem would not disrupt the federal government or
critical private sector companies, including those providing most
of the nation's financial services, power, phones and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is well on its way to being Y2K ready,'' Clinton said
at the White House, summarizing a progress report released later
Wednesday by his Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 preparedness advocates said that Clinton's assessment
was too rosy and undercut his own council's recommendations that
people prepare for possible disruptions as they would for a winter
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an overly optimistic view,'' said Norman L. Dean,
executive director of the Center for Y2K and Society, a
Washington-based nonprofit group promoting local preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements turn on how to assess the risks suggested by
the ever-changing preparedness data like that in the council's
report. For instance, the council reported that several important
services appeared to be far from ready, like 911 emergency phone
centers. Just 50 percent have fully prepared their computers for
the year 2000 as of Oct. 1, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But 911 experts say the centers will be able to receive and
process all calls even without such enhancements as automatically
pinpointing the origin of the calls. They argue that the problems
with wireless phones were a bigger threat than Y2K glitches to such
systems. Most major cities have announced that their 911 systems
are ready.
</P>
<P>
   The council also noted that year 2000 preparedness had been
moving too slowly in schools, local governments, small businesses
and developing countries, but in every case there are questions
about how complete a picture can be derived from its data. Most of
it comes from surveys in which data sources are unidentified and
the responses are combined before the council sees them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was confident that computer problems ``will not
put the savings or the safety of the American people at risk'' and
that government functions ``from air traffic control systems to
Social Security payment systems will continue to work exactly as
they should.''
</P>
<P>
   But preparedness advocates complained that Clinton, who in his
Internet chat on Monday told a questioner he saw no need to prepare
for the millennium by bunkering down, should nonetheless have
advised Americans to at least stockpile enough food, water and
other vital supplies for several days of possible disruption.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, John Koskinen, chairman of the Council on
Year 2000 Conversion, took a more cautious stance than Clinton.
While endorsing the bright national picture, Koskinen repeated the
council's longstanding advice that each community had to look at
its owns risks and that individuals should have the supplies on
hand they would want if they were facing a natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are urging people not only to prepare but to prepare
early,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the fourth in a series of quarterly reviews the
council began publishing in January. It is a compendium of data
provided to the council through groups created to represent various
sectors of the economy. But, Koskinen noted, such surveys have
produced results consistent with reviews by federal regulators of
some sectors like banks, energy and the drug industry .
</P>
<P>
   Important information in the report, like data showing lagging
preparations in small business and local governments, was gathered
in the spring and is undoubtedly out of date. But Koskinen said
that anyone still taking a wait-and-see approach to the computer
challenge is ``asking for trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem stems from the widespread use of just two
digits to represent the year in electronic dates, like 99 for 1999.
Some computers and other electronic equipment with embedded
computers do not recognize 00 as 2000. As a result, they may shut
down or generate faulty data.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said it might not seem irrational to a small business
with little reliance on computers to count on fixing failures when
they occur, but year 2000 faults might also affect building
security systems, office telephones and relationships with
customers and suppliers in ways they might not expect. Moreover,
repair support that would normally be quickly available might be
delayed for weeks or months if problems are widespread.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Koskinen said that there were continuing risks even for big
computer users who believed their preparations were done because
computer vendors continue to discover flaws in their equipment and
software.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, which Koskinen said he was briefed about on
Tuesday at an Office of Management and Budget meeting with computer
specialists, is that some computer systems that do not appear to
track the date may nonetheless have date-sensitive microchips in
them. Those systems also have to be tested and plans must be made
to handle breakdowns, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Contingency plans have become a focus because it is widely
recognized that some malfunctions are inevitable. Clinton noted
that a number of glitches occurred during the federal government's
transition to its fiscal year 2000 on Oct. 1 and said that the
``overriding lesson of that experience was that alert organizations
armed with good contingency plans can fix Y2K disruptions in short
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen cautioned though that the experience with computers
embedded in other equipment might not follow the fiscal year
precedent. Such embedded system problems are expected to hit
hardest in the first 10 days of next year. In some cases, they
might not knock out a complex structure like a power grid but
slowly degrade its performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lagging work on 911 systems raises similar concerns. In
towns where 911 systems are plagued with year 2000 problems, calls
will still reach switchboards but it may take longer to handle
them. Koskinen said the survey data provided no information on
which communities had such problems.

NEW YORK POLITICS FOLLOW FIRST LADY ON MIDEAST TRIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton landed in
Israel on Wednesday for a four-day visit to the Middle East that
has been widely interpreted as a bid for Jewish votes crucial to
her anticipated run for a Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her visit, Mrs. Clinton stuck to the business of
being first lady. She packed her first day here with a trip to a
community center for young people at risk of violence, where she
met with troubled teens, and a conference on youth and violence at
Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
   But New York politics was never far away.
</P>
<P>
   At the university, four students held a placard that read,
``American Jews support Rudy Giuliani,'' the New York mayor likely
to be her Republican opponent in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Even the timing of the trip has raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for May, Mrs. Clinton's trip was postponed
until now, her aides say, due to Israeli elections and the death of
Jordan's King Hussein. The fact that it is happening now has
sparked accusations that she is using her capacity as first lady to
campaign for election, which her aides deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not planned with that in mind at all,'' said Marsha
Berry, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary. ``She'd made a promise. I
think she needed to fulfill the promise to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the trip, Mrs. Clinton has walked a fine line between her
duties as first lady of a country that has played the role of
``honest broker'' in Middle East peacemaking and the requirements
of a potential candidate running for office in a heavily Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, for instance, she had no plans to visit
Palestinian-held areas or the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site,
omissions that aides say were due to unfinished scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   After protests from several Jewish organizations about her
absence from the Wall, she added the site to her itinerary,
scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Then she tacked on the
Palestinian town of Ramallah, where she will attend a mother-child
center with Suha Arafat, wife of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Mrs. Clinton has staked out some political positions
that differ from official U.S. policy. She came out in favor of
moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which
Palestinians say would scuttle peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israel, she steered clear of controversial statements.
</P>
<P>
   At the Elem center for youth at risk, she spoke for a few
minutes with teen-agers Ohad Bikovsky and Tamar Sclure. The center
includes a coffee shop where young people can come for counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in front of two blue vans used to distribute blankets and
hot meals to street children, the first lady shook hands, smiled
and talked with the teens out of earshot of news reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very nice. She asked us if (the center) really helped
us, and I told her, yes,'' said Bikovsky, an 18-year-old with
silver nose and lip rings who said he had abused alcohol and lived
on the street before he came to Elem.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton then went to Tel Aviv University, where she
participated in a conference on youth violence with Nava Barak, the
wife of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Mrs. Barak has been a
champion of campaigns against youth violence since long before her
husband entered public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe it takes a village to raise a child,'' Mrs.
Clinton said during her speech, referring to her best-selling book,
``It Takes A Village.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of us around the world, Israel has always represented
that village,'' she said. ``I've always felt welcome and at home in
a country whose people share so many of the dreams and aspirations
as my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the conference, Mrs. Clinton drove to Jerusalem, where
she attended a private dinner at the Baraks' residence. Her
daughter, Chelsea, accompanied her.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton planned to visit Yad Va Shem, Israel's
holocaust memorial and two medical centers, in addition to the
trips to Ramallah and to the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, she plans to fly to Jordan for a two-day
trip to the capital, Amman, and the ancient stone city of Petra.
She is scheduled to meet with Queen Ranya, wife of Jordan's King
Abdullah II, and with Queen Noor, the widow of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   From there, she plans to join President Clinton for state visits
to Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At the youth crisis center, some of the teens said they
suspected Mrs. Clinton's visit was part of her planned election
bid. But few seemed to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if the reason she does it is to get votes,'' said
Bikovsky, the 18-year-old with the nose ring. ``As long as she can
help, that's more important than the motive.''

   Under a pilot program that started last month, Michigan had been
requiring welfare applicants at three sites, including one in
Detroit, to pass a drug test or be denied benefits. Michigan is the
first state with such a program, which has been criticized by
social workers, civil libertarians and some welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union sued the state to stop the
drug tests, arguing that they violated the privacy of welfare
applicants and the constitutional protections against unreasonable
search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Judge Victoria A. Roberts of U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division, granted a
temporary restraining order that stops the tests at least until
Dec. 14, when another hearing has been scheduled. The judge said
she granted the order because the drug tests are probably
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Kary L. Moss, executive director of the Michigan office of the
ACLU, said the ruling means ``that for the time being, welfare
applicants will not be forced to choose between their
constitutional rights and providing for their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The state said it would comply with the court order but believes
it will ultimately prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to returning to this program, which was
allowed by federal legislation, enacted by the Michigan Legislature
and supported by our customers and the general public,'' Douglas E.
Howard, director of Michigan's welfare agency, the Family
Independence Agency, said. ``The drug testing pilot is an
opportunity to help individuals find employment and to strengthen
families. We believe it is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Smith, a spokeswoman for the agency, said 8.1 percent of
the applicants tested positive for drug use. No one refused the
test, Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 258 tests analyzed, 237 tested negative while 21 tested
positive. Of those, three tested positive for cocaine, while the
rest tested positive for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   While the state had results for only 258 tests, a total of 379
applicants had been tested at the three sites. Tests were required
in Alpena and Presque Isle counties in northeastern Michigan, in
Berrien County in southwestern Michigan and in one urban area, a
part of western Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has been one of the early leaders in the effort to end
traditional welfare, initiating programs intended to put recipients
into the work force. The state's caseload has dropped about 60
percent since October 1992, when changes in welfare rules and the
booming economy lowered the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's caseload stands at slightly more 80,000, down from
about 240,000 in the mid-1990s, said John Truscott, a spokesman for
Gov. John Engler, a Republican who has championed the welfare
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that drug abuse is a barrier to employment,'' Truscott
said. ``Our whole approach to welfare is helping people find a job
and keep a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who tested positive under the pilot program were required
to get drug treatment in order to receive a welfare check. Anyone
who refused treatment was denied benefits. In the first month, none
of those who tested positive refused treatment, Truscott said.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were mandatory for applicants under age 65, since they
are most likely to be in the work force. The state had planned to
expand the program statewide and to perform random drug tests of
all welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have considered requiring drug tests but have
backed away. Both Florida and Louisiana require applicants to
answer questions about drug use and then use the answers to
determine whether to administer a test. New York and Maryland had
planned to require tests but found that other types of screening _
like questionnaires _ were cheaper. New Jersey, South Carolina,
Wisconsin and Minnesota randomly test welfare recipients with
felony drug convictions.

A BETTER WAY TO SAVE SANTA CRUZ ISLAND?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ The National Park Service is preparing an
environmental document on the complete eradication of wild pigs
from Santa Cruz Island, and it just opened its ``scoping'' phase in
the process where it looks for public input into the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork will address alternative methods for the removal
of pigs and the control of fennel, a non-native plant on the
largest and most diverse land mass in the Channel Islands National
Park. The NPS, which owns about 10 percent of the island, and the
Nature Conservancy of California, which owns the remainder, believe
the non-native species introduced to the island during the past 200
years ``have wreaked havoc on the island ecosystem.'' This is true
on all of the offshore islands and most are implementing or have
completed projects to remove wild pig, goat and sheep to allow
native vegetation to return.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a problem with the idea of restoring the native
habitat to protect the island's 54 native species, including the 15
that are listed as threatened or endangered, but I do have a
problem with the costs involved in wild-pig removal and the belief
that the last two centuries of human history are a meaningless part
of the island's heritage that should be cast aside.
</P>
<P>
   It will apparently cost more than $10 million to completely
remove pigs from Santa Cruz. Ten million dollars! Many _ if not
most _ of the pigs removed would not be used _ meaning they would
be shot and left to rot.
</P>
<P>
   The NPS also has been overzealous in its rush to get rid of
hunting on the island, with well-documented harassment issues and
the eventual forced removal of the last hunting operation.
Ironically, it is aggressive sport-hunting that could help keep
wild pigs in check _ or even eliminate them in critical areas _ and
hunting could actually make the Park Service money to help fund the
restoration of the habitat. From people familiar with Santa Cruz
and hunting, it has been estimated that $100,000 a year or more
could be made from a hunting program on the island.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, makes too much sense for the park service. They
want a big budget from Congress to spend on pet projects _ the
public be damned and excluded. The NPS refuses to see hunting as a
cost-effective management tool or a legitimate recreational
activity.
</P>
<P>
   This is what should happen:
</P>
<P>
   The park service should allow hunting on the island, collect
fees from shooters and use the money to fund fencing projects to
protect the most damaged environments. Within target areas,
wild-pig numbers could be eliminated or severely reduced by
aggressive sport-hunting, allowing the native vegetation to return.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the park will never get rid of fennel, it should not get
rid of wild pigs. But the pigs can and should have their numbers
controlled by recreational hunting.
</P>
<P>
   This not only makes economic sense because the hunter's funding
would support restoration, but it keeps the century-old tradition
of hunting on Santa Cruz Islands alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Public comments on the issue must be received by Nov. 30 and
should be sent to: Channel Island National Park, Primary
Restoration Plan/Environmental Impact Statement Public Scoping,
1901 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura, Calif. 93001.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill to provide health insurance to hundreds of
thousands of disabled people, which had passed with overwhelming
bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, became snarled
Wednesday in a tangle of partisan disagreements, raising doubts
about whether it would become law before Congress adjourns for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar disputes delayed action on a separate bill to increase
Medicare payments to most hospitals, nursing homes and other health
care providers. This bill, intended to undo some of the budget cuts
adopted in 1997, would make a profound change in national health
policy, reducing huge disparities in what Medicare pays to train
doctors in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would slash Medicare payments to many teaching
hospitals in New York, while increasing payments to teaching
hospitals in California and Texas, among other states.
</P>
<P>
   Different versions of the bill to provide health insurance for
disabled workers sailed through the Senate, 99-0, and the House,
412-9, earlier this year. But negotiations have bogged down on the
question of how to pay the comparatively modest cost, less than $1
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Wednesday complained that Republicans would offset
the cost by cutting housing and other programs for people with low
and moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse on these bills reflected the testy, cantankerous
atmosphere on Capitol Hill as the House and the Senate negotiated
with each other, and with President Clinton, in an effort to finish
their work and adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the health insurance legislation said it would be
the most important step to help the disabled since passage of the
Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   People with disabilities have strongly supported the bill, which
would allow them to keep Medicaid and Medicare coverage after they
return to work. Under current law, they often lose such coverage if
they earn a significant amount of money. The current law thus
discourages many disabled people from working or trying to work.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is known as the Work Incentives Improvement Act,
because it is meant to help people on the disability rolls go back
to work. Advocates for the disabled and Democratic senators,
including Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Minority Leader
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said they might oppose the bill if
Republicans financed it by cutting other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot support any legislation that would advance the lives
of people with disabilities on the backs of poor and middle-class
Americans,'' said Pat Wright, a lawyer at the Disability Rights
Education and Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said ``it would be unconscionable'' to help the disabled
by cutting assistance for low-income home buyers, as some
Republicans proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that President Clinton was free to suggest
other ways of covering the cost, but that he had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to restore money to Medicare has been ardently sought
by almost every type of health care provider in the United States.
The industry has deluged Congress with post cards, lobbyists and
advertisements asserting that the 1997 cuts have harmed the quality
of care for many patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In negotiations between the Senate and the House, two powerful
New Yorkers _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Democrat on
the Finance Committee, and Rep. Charles Rangel, the senior Democrat
on the Ways and Means Committee _ tried to protect the Medicare
payments that New York hospitals receive for training doctors.
Hospitals like Beth Israel in Manhattan and Montefiore in the Bronx
get three or four times as much for each trainee as hospitals in
Los Angeles and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the House on Friday would move toward a
standard national payment for all teaching hospitals. Medicare now
pays a different amount for each hospital, based on its historic
costs. Under the House bill, payments would be based on a national
average, adjusted only for regional differences in wages. Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif., said this was a ``more rational and equitable''
method of reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is colored by the politics surrounding Hillary Rodham
Clinton's expected run for the Senate. Republicans said they did
not want to be too generous to New York hospitals because they
feared that Mrs. Clinton might get political credit for securing
such largess.
</P>
<P>
   Much as she might like to fight for New York hospitals, Mrs.
Clinton cannot openly do so on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers of both
parties said she would alienate Republicans if she tried to
intervene. So Moynihan and Rangel have led the fight, with support
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he believed that
``the Republicans want to embarrass Mrs. Clinton by getting the
White House to go along with legislation that would be devastating
to hospitals in New York.''

LAWMAKERS LAUNCH PUSH FOR YEAR 2000 MEDICARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Tenn., Neb.) (rk) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Medicare reform dead for this year, lawmakers
have begun a push to make certain the health insurance program for
the elderly moves to the top of the national agenda in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators introduced a broad Medicare
overhaul Tuesday that they hope becomes a blueprint for legislative
changes in 2000. The senators, led by John Breaux, D-La., said
their initiative marked the first time a comprehensive Medicare
reform proposal had been put into technical legislative language
since the program's inception in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``While medicine has changed, it is clear that Medicare has
not,'' Breaux said. ``It is still frozen in the 1960s and does not
serve the Medicare beneficiaries as well as it should or as well as
it can.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, House Democrats rallied with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, pledging to make an all-out push next year
to expand Medicare to offer coverage for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't stop until we break down the walls of resistance and
succeed in bringing up a prescription drug plan for a debate in the
next session next year,'' said Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt
of Missouri. ``Democrats are going to win this very fundamental
battle for the quality of life for America's seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and many lawmakers hoped to strike a
deal this year on Medicare changes that would extend the solvency
of the program serving almost 40 million retirees past 2015 while
providing drug coverage and making the health program similar to
those now offered in the private market.
</P>
<P>
   But political and policy differences dashed those hopes earlier
this year when a special bipartisan commission headed by Breaux was
unable to agree on an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux was joined by Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., in introducing the proposal, which builds on the
commission's work. Modeled on the health insurance program now
serving 10 million federal employees, it would seek to slow
Medicare spending by encouraging health care companies to compete
for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, a surgeon who served on the Medicare commission with
Breaux and Kerrey, said the proposal would ``replace the rigid, the
antiquated, the inflexible Medicare system that we have today with
a choice of plans.''
</P>
<P>
   To build support for their plan, the lawmakers dropped some
contested elements of the commission proposal, making a
prescription drug option available to all beneficiaries and
providing full benefits at no cost to poor beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan also sets a $2,000 cap on annual out-of-pocket costs
for beneficiaries. The program would be overseen by a new Medicare
board appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they saw their proposal as a starting point
and hoped that presidential candidates and other legislative
leaders would begin fleshing out their own proposals for Medicare
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are going to think this is too much and others will think
it's not enough,'' conceded Breaux. ``We suggest it is about
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and some politicians have suggested that reform would
be more difficult to achieve in an election year because both
parties would harden their positions in an effort to gain political
advantage on an important issue with older voters.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he thought a resolution was still possible next year
but that in any event the new proposal marked ``the beginning,
hopefully, of the end of this debate we have been going through
every single year.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was looking ahead to 2000, Congress is not quite done
with Medicare for this year. Senate and House negotiators continue
to try and reach an agreement on easing what health care providers
say is a financial burden resulting from Medicare payment changes
two years ago.

 &HT;    GORE TELLS STAFF AT NEW HQ THINGS ARE LOOKING UP
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Vice President Al Gore paid a visit to his new
campaign headquarters Wednesday and credited the scores of
volunteers and staff who relocated to Tennessee for revitalizing
his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit, his first since the highly publicized abandonment
of the campaign's high-rent offices on Washington's K Street, was
arranged largely for the benefit of CBS's ``60 Minutes'' program,
which is preparing a report on the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore delayed his remarks to the campaign workers in
order to stage a ``strategy meeting'' with campaign advisers Tony
Coelho, Donna Brazile and Carter Eskew for ``60 Minutes''
correspondent Leslie Stahl and her camera crew.
</P>
<P>
   Gore emerged from the session with the camera crew in tow and
spent about spent 10 minutes talking with dozens of campaign
workers in the largest room at the headquarters, known
affectionately as ``the Pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said ``things have been shifting'' over the past few months
in his battle with former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey for the
Democratic presidential nomination. And one reason for the change,
he said, is ``your energy is connecting with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore kidded his campaign workers about having ``gained a few
extra pounds,'' a reference to the steady flow of cakes, pies,
fruit and other snacks that volunteers regularly bring to the
campaign headquarters, a former physical rehabilitation center near
a railroad crossing west of downtown Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Such deliveries ``never happened on K Street,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The sweets, most of them Southern delicacies such as ``chess
pie,''
</P>
<P>
   add to the informal atmosphere of the new headquarters in spite
of the red, white and blue bunting, the ubiquitous photos of Gore
and his wife, Tipper, and ``Gore 2000'' posters.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Gore arrived at tquarters, he was greeted by
his campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, wearing jeans and cowboy boots.
``Hi, Al,'' Coelho said to the vice president of the United States.
``Hi, Tony,'' the vice president of the United States responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change of address is complete,'' campaign manager Donna
Brazile informed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some hallways are cluttered with computers and other
office equipment waiting to be installed, and incongruous old signs
such as ``Treatment Room'' and ``hydro-therapy'' are still to be
seen. But computers are humming in most offices, especially in the
campaign war room, dubbed the ``Gore Room,'' where six staff
members spend their days researching Bradley's record in the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Tennessee, Gore's home state, allowed Coelho and
Brazile to trim the top-heavy campaign of highly paid advisers and
staff members in a politically polite way. And those who relocated
to Nashville took a pay cut _ even Brazile, who chopped her own
salary from $120,000 to $95,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the campaign workers and volunteers said the move to
Tennessee has brought them closer to together, physically as well
as emotionally. The new headquarters, a ``7''-shaped building, is
one story high, adding cohesion that was missing on K Street.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the staff are non-Tennesseans, too, and not knowing
anyone in town, they have banded together after work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like a family,'' said Jennifer Housell, a New
Jersey native who works in the campaign's field operations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, last Saturday night, the 57-year-old Coelho, a Wall
Street deal-maker and former congressman, took the staff out for a
night of dancing, cowboy boots and all.

 &HT;    Helping the World War II orphans
 &HT;    By Ben Sutherly
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH TWP., Ohio _ While on a troop ship in the Pacific
Ocean in December 1944, 22-year-old Pfc. Garner Mott mentioned in a
letter to his uncle and aunt that he had received a photograph of
the son he had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Nickey is 5 months old today,'' he wrote. ``Jeannie sent
me a swell picture of her and Nickey today. It just about brought
tears in my eyes. It was so wonderful, they both looked like they
could talk in the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five months later, Mott was killed by mortar fire on
Okinawa. (May 7, 1945)
</P>
<P>
   His infant son, Nick, now a 55-year-old Vietnam veteran, was
among the estimated 183,000 American children left fatherless by
World War II, which claimed 406,000 American lives.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Mott's mother, Jean Brown, 76, of St. Paris, remarried, and
Nick said he was blessed with a good family life. Still, he said,
he always wanted to know his father. Now, 54 years after Garner
Mott's death, his son has found a measure of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nick and his wife, Darlene, became active in the American World
War II Orphans Network.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1991 by Ann Bennett Mix, whose father was killed in
Italy, AWON has helped put to rest unresolved grief and loss
harbored by many sons and daughters of slain or missing soldiers
for more than half a century. AWON locates and registers those left
fatherless by the war and serves as a resource, directing sons and
daughters to military and government records, and to veterans who
knew their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Mix, who serves as AWON's executive director, said the
organization currently has about 500 active members and has located
over 3,000 children who lost their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the network's success in helping people locate
companions of their slain or missing fathers, the Motts began
searching for veterans who knew Nick's father. Through a series of
e-mails, Garner Mott's former platoon leader, Robert ``Bucky''
Pearson, learned of Nick Mott and left a message on Mott's
answering machine in May. Less than three months later, the Motts
met Pearson at a reunion of the 1st Marine Division in
Philadelphia. At the meeting, Mott learned his father was
well-respected by other Marines, and that ``he loved me and thought
about me a lot.'' The experience, Mott said, was healing and gave
him a sense of closure about his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made his dad come alive to us,'' said Darlene Mott. ``Words
can't express how we feel.''
</P>
<P>
   AWON members also communicate with each other online,
encouraging those curious about their long-dead fathers to begin
searching for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orphans are hesitant to search for (information about)
their fathers because of their fear of rejection once they find
someone who knew them, or because they might offend the person by
bringing up bad memories of the war,'' Darlene Mott said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, many veterans welcome hearing from children
of their fallen or missing companions. ``It brings closure for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when Garner Mott would have celebrated his 77th
birthday, Nick and Darlene Mott received a letter from Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought full closure for me as it was what I had hoped
could be,'' Pearson wrote of the Philadelphia reunion. ``It all
came about through your search for anyone who might have known your
Dad in K Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. How great it all was
I I felt that Garner was with me _ with us in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meeting will stay with me forever, and it now seems that
it was something that had to be. I am at peace and it feels so
good. Thank you Nick J. Mott.''
</P>
<P>
   Many AWON members, including the Motts, are empty-nesters who,
after raising their families, have more time to learn who their
fathers were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in our 50s, and everyone's trying to find out the
connection with their fathers,'' Nick Mott said.

<P>
   Many children left fatherless by World War II also are realizing
that time is running out to locate veterans who may have known
their dads. Department of Veterans Affairs spokesman Steve
Westerfeld said America's World War II veterans are currently dying
at a rate of about 1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   AWON's growth coincides with a number of veteran-related
developments. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _The introduction of Ohio House Bill 116, which would require
school districts to devote at least one hour on Veteran's Day for
observance of the day's significance. The measure would also
require the adoption of a policy regarding recitation of the Pledge
of Allegiance as part of the school's program. Denver Combs,
service officer for the Montgomery County Veterans' Service Center,
said the bill was ``long overdue.'' Combs said he fielded a call
Wednesday from a teacher desiring clarification of the significance
of Veterans Day. The teacher had confused Veterans Day with
Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   _A memorial designed to honor World War II veterans, to be
located on the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington
Monument in Washington, D.C. Groundbreaking is currently slated for
Veterans Day 2000 on the 7-acre site. Donors can help AWON meet its
goal to become a ``major contributor'' (minimum $10,000 donation)
by marking the organization's code number (GR090) on their
donation. The group hopes such exposure will help them reach
additional members. More information is available at
www.wwiimemorial.com
</P>
<P>
   _The repeal of a 1990 law in June that permanently terminated
eligibility for dependency and indemnity compensation for spouses
of deceased veterans who remarried. Spouses of deceased veterans
may now receive survivor benefits upon termination of a subsequent
marriage.

1950 KOREA ATTACK REMEMBERED AS SURVIVORS AND U.S. VETERANS JOIN IN
PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In a solemn encounter, three U.S. Army veterans and
four South Korean civilians who stood at opposite ends of a chaotic
incident half a century ago, met here Wednesday to pray in a
service of remembrance of that event, which the Koreans described
as a massacre by American forces.
</P>
<P>
   The service, held at a downtown church under the auspices of the
National Council of Churches, was the first meeting on American
soil between former soldiers and Korean survivors of the incident
in July 1950, the first month of the Korean War, in which as many
as 400 civilians were reportedly killed when they were strafed by
military planes and later machine-gunned by soldiers at a railway
bridge near a village called No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Although survivors and their families have demanded recognition
of the events at No Gun Ri for many years, the incident there was
not widely publicized in the United States until six weeks ago,
when the Associated Press published an account quoting survivors
and former soldiers of the 7th U.S. Calvary who said many civilians
had been killed there.
</P>
<P>
   The service, at the Old Stone Presbyterian Church, showed that
the wounds of violence inflicted 49 years ago remain vivid in the
minds of those who were there and deeply painful, too. The
survivors who came here said they wanted an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers, who emphasized they spoke only for
themselves, said they wanted to acknowledge the survivors' ordeal,
but asked for understanding of the circumstances in which the
incident occurred, with their units newly arrived from Japan,
undermanned and fearful after having been told by their commanders
that North Korean fighters had disguised themselves as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a translator, Chung Eun Yong, 76, who said his
son and daughter were killed and his wife was wounded in the
incident, said the shooting took place over about 60 hours, on July
26-29, 1950. ``We believe God will forgive the veterans and the
U.S. government when they repent their sins committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Chung spoke, one of the veterans present, Maj.
Robert ``Snuffy'' Gray, 75, who is retired, rose to speak briefly
for the three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one enjoys war at all,'' Gray said. ``Unfortunately, the
people who seem to suffer the most in a war zone are the civilians,
the people who should be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We very badly need an understanding,'' said Gray, a master
sergeant with the 7th Calvary's 2nd Battalion, which was stationed
some distance to the west of the railroad bridge. ``We need a
joining of ways, to see if we can put things behind us, to see if
human beings can live side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the veterans said they felt sympathy for the
Koreans, but said they would not apologize for what they regarded
as a terrible incident of war, during which they as soldiers were
facing attacks from North Korean troops, suffered breakdowns in
communications equipment and were always under their commanders'
orders. ``It was a very confusing, chaotic mess,'' said 1st Lt.
Edward Daily, 68, who is retired. Referring to the incident, he
added, ``It's a very tragic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, who was a corporal in 1950, said he saw civilians taking
refuge under two long, high arches that formed part of the railway
bridge on July 26, 1950. Shortly before dusk that day, he said, he
heard three or four shots and saw ``a muzzle flash'' from the area
where the civilians were gathered. At that point, he said, American
soldiers received an order to fire on the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   He said the shooting lasted about 20 minutes, stopped, then
resumed again for 10 more. Later that evening, he said, he was
ordered to take up a position about a mile and a half away from the
bridge. (In its account, the Associated Press reported that the
veterans it interviewed disagreed about whether shots had been
fired from among the Koreans.)
</P>
<P>
   Daily said he had traveled to South Korea last week and met for
several hours with five people who had survived the incident at the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   One of those present at the service Wednesday was Andrew Young,
a former American representative to the United Nations, who will be
installed on Thursday as the new president of the National Council
of Churches, an organization that represents 35 Protestant and
Eastern Orthodox denominations that is celebrating its 50th
anniversary in meetings here this week. Afterwards, Young, who is
an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, said, ``There
is always, in any conflict, a lot of unresolved guilt and anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without trying to cast blame, I think the church's mission is
to promote healing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's service originated in a request Daily made in a
letter to the Rev. Joan B. Campbell, general-secretary of the
National Council of Churches, for an event of remembrance.
Officials of the council said their organization, acting on a
request from its counterpart among the churches of South Korea, had
been trying to get the government to look into the incident for
months.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the veterans and the Koreans met privately
for an hour. Later in the afternoon, they emerged together for a
news conference in the Old Stone Church's office building. In that
event, two of the Koreans, Yang Hae Sook, 60, and Keum Cho Ja, 60,
described in detail their experiences at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they went to the railroad bridge after the groups they
were with had come under attack from an airplane they described as
an American bomber. Ms. Yang said she lost her left eye in an
explosion and survived under the bridge, once the shooting began,
by crawling under the bodies of the dead. Ms. Keum said she had
tried to flee from the bridge after the shooting started, but
suffered a stomach wound and was eventually taken to a hospital by
an American medic.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview conducted through a translator afterwards,
Chung said he was satisfied with the meeting and discussions with
the three veterans. Asked from whom the survivors wanted an apology
for the incident, he replied, ``Ultimately, the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had no statement on Wednesday's meeting, but did
say that five survivors of the incident will meet with Pentagon
officials on Friday morning in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As for the status of the investigation into the incident, an
Army official said, ``Our goal is to be done by June of next
year.'' More time might be necessary, however, because ``the bottom
line is we want to do this right,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigation includes four different phases: preparation,
research and interviews, review and analysis, and finally the
writing and release of the final report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the first phase right now,'' the official said. ``We
are training the ones who will be doing the interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, the Army inspector general, traveled
to Korea on Oct. 28 and 29 to ``meet with the Korean contingent
that's doing a parallel review,'' the official said, adding, ``He
met with six survivors and went to the site.''

MEET AN ODD FILMMAKER IN `AMERICAN MOVIE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 12 or later. Fact box at bottom) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even making bad movies requires a certain minimum level of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie,'' a funny-sad documentary from one of the
bleaker districts that make up more of the nation's heartland than
some would like to admit, suggests that any fool with a camera can
get the job done. The price paid may be astronomical, but hey, a
dream's a dream, no matter how under-equipped you are to pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   The film charts the progress (in a very loose interpretation of
the word) of Mark Borchardt, a passionate, would-be auteur who
lives in little Menominee Falls, Wis. A father of three in his
early 30s whose only means of support is still a paper route (he'll
later make ends almost meet by cleaning up a cemetery), Borchardt
has been making amateur horror movies since puberty.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows him through a two-year effort to complete a
short thriller called ``Coven'' (pronounced with a long o, to mark
it as a personal film), of which Borchardt hopes to sell enough
videos to finance his feature-length ambitions. But with nothing
but debts, a burned-out musician buddy (the deadpan hilarious Mike
Schank) to rely on for a crew and, shall we say, inspiration of the
slow-build variety, that proves a mighty task indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Director Chris Smith, whose fictional feature ``American Job''
charted similarly dire survival struggles in the minimum-wage
Midwest, met Borchardt in a University of Wisconsin editing room
and soon realized he had struck gold. An obsessive type with a
self-defeating, irresponsible streak, Borchardt is the kind of born
loser who will never admit defeat. His zeal to film doesn't come
from artistic urgency so much as from a desire not to be an average
working stiff, and the poverty, drinking binges and unrepairable
relationships that go hand-in-hand with that attitude barely make
an impact on him, let alone dissuade him from his chosen path.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees this as kind of inspirational _ which, being a
talented, struggling filmmaker, he would. Less-biased eyes will
view Borchardt's stubborn single-mindedness with more pity than
admiration (although, ironically, the buzz around ``American
Movie'' is raising Borchardt's profile _ and questionable hopes _
in small indie-film circles). We do see some ``Coven'' footage at
the end, and it's crude but not without a certain vulgar energy, so
who knows? Still, you wish the guy had some community college
training to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   The behaviorally fascinating, slightly overlong ``American
Movie's'' best moments are between Mark and his 82-year-old Uncle
Bill, who has since passed away. Bill's a skeptical old coot who
has some money and lives alone in a trailer park. Mark, of course,
is always trying to cadge production funds from the dry, frail
octogenarian, but his genuine affection for the guy is
unmistakable. Indeed, if his nephew wasn't so bent on getting his
movie made, ``producer'' Bill would probably be completely isolated
in his final years.
</P>
<P>
   This way, he has a regular source of companionship and care. And
all that glamour, too. &QL;

LONG BEACH STATE'S COACHING GEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old Gold Mine gym on the Long Beach State campus, where
the glory days of 49er basketball under Jerry Tarkanian and Lute
Olson were staged, Brian Gimmillaro is busily giving instructions
during a practice break.
</P>
<P>
   He is showing one of the stars of his volleyball team, Anja
Grabovac, the proper technique on a particular maneuver, as the
rest of the women on the 49ers watch intently.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmillaro and his top assistant, Debbie Green, are always
teaching and prodding and inspiring during these grueling
three-hour afternoon workouts that prepare the 49ers for upcoming
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular occasion, the 49ers are holding a scrimmage,
with three departed members from last season's NCAA championship
team, Misty May, Jessica Alvarado and Benishe Dillard,
participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came back for a little workout,'' says Gimmillaro,
who once again has his team on a brisk roll after its weekend sweep
of Cal Poly and Santa Barbara. ``It's nice to see them because just
their presence is helpful to the other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Maxson calls him Harry Houdini, and, indeed, Brian
Gimmillaro is once again performing his special brand of coaching
magic as he has the 49ers, supposedly in a rebuilding mode, in a
position to win another Big West title.
</P>
<P>
   If his team can beat Nevada tonight in Reno and UOP Saturday
night at The Pyramid, then the six-ranked 49ers will wind up on top
of the Western Division standings in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   When a team loses a two-time Player of the Year in May and two
extraordinary performers in Dillard and Alvarado, you would expect
it to struggle dramatically the next season.
</P>
<P>
   And the 49ers did for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Why, they actually lost two matches in September at Hawaii and
UOP.
</P>
<P>
   But since being blitzed in three games by the Tigers on Sept.
28, Gimmillaro's athletes have won 13 matches in a row, including
that emotional triumph Saturday evening before the biggest crowd
ever to witness a volleyball event in Santa Barbara (2,462).
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it a point to tell Brian the other day what a
tremendous job of coaching he's doing this season,'' says the Long
Beach State athletic director, Bill Shumard, an interested
spectator at the 49ers' Tuesday practice.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a recording.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gimmillaro does exceptional work every year.
</P>
<P>
   He has built Long Beach State into one of the perennial powers
of women volleyball during his 15 seasons at the school, during
which he's won three national titles on the way to posting a 416-95
record.
</P>
<P>
   He has established himself as one of the top coaches in
collegiate athletics, and the success of Gimmillaro's 49ers has
been reflected at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   His teams not only draw well on the road Cal Poly also had its
largest volleyball audience ever for the 49ers but also at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our women's volleyball team for the first time will gross more
than $100,000 for their Pyramid games this season,'' says Shumard
proudly. ``The first year at the Pyramid the total was $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 49ers got off to their cool start, Gimmillaro
reluctantly decided that his freshman setter, Brittany Hochevar,
needed more seasoning and replaced her in the starting lineup with
the 5-7 freshman Keri Nishimoto, who's attending school on an
academic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Nishimoto began collecting assists in bushels, Cheryl
Weaver began inspiring comparisons to Danielle Scott, Grabovac,
Veronica Walls, Kristy Kiefulff and Brandy Barratt began giving the
team the senior leadership it needed, and the 49ers began
dominating opponents like they did a year ago when they wound up
with a 36-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're developing very well as a team,'' says Gimmillaro. ``But
time is a big factor. If there is enough time for us to develop to
the level we need to, then I think we will be as good as any team
in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now 5 p.m., and the 49ers' practice has come to a finish.
The players gather up the volleyballs, and then surround Gimmillaro
and listen in rapt attention to a brief speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I like most about this team?'' says Gimmillaro
rhetorically a few moments later in the 49ers' training room. ``The
players are listening to what we coaches are saying, and they're
all trying to improve themselves individually. They really want to
learn and get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimmillaro says he was disappointed earlier in the season with
the deportment of his veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while for our seniors to understand their importance
to the team,'' he says. ``They just weren't being assertive enough,
and giving us the leadership on the court that a young team needs.
But now they are doing that, and you can see how we've become a
more cohesive team.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Cheryl Weaver has become the best middle blocker in
the nation, and says her teammate, Tayyiba Haneef just might be the
second best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any team has a better set of frontcourt hitters
than we do in Cheryl, Tayyiba, Veronica, Anja and Brandy,'' says
Gimmillaro.
</P>
<P>
   His prized freshman recruit, Brittany Hochevar, has been hobbled
by a stress fracture in her foot that she suffered after losing her
job to Nishimoto, but Gimmillaro still is Hochevar's passionate
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brittany one day will become as good a setter as Misty May was
for us,'' Gimmillaro still insists.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Brian Gimmillaro is a master psychologist, and you
know his words are calculated to boost the sagging spirits of
Hockhevar.
</P>
<P>
   But you listen carefully to what Brian Gimmillaro says, and
aren't cynical about his assessments.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a remarkable man whose loyalty to this
community has become legendary because of his annual custom of
turning down lucrative job offers from more established
universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're one of the handful of people who went to see the
recent ``Breakfast of Champions,'' don't worry: ``Galapagos'' is
not another attempt to turn a Kurt Vonnegut Jr. book into a film,
though the author did write a book by that name several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Galapagos'' is an IMAX 3D picture sponsored by the
Smithsonian Institution, IMAX and America Online. The film looks at
some of the unusual land and sea animals that inhabit the islands
off the coast of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Though visually stunning in its presentation of some rare sights
(especially scenes of the underwater creatures surrounding the
island), the film is ultimately a bit dry and stilted. It's
probably most suitable for avid Discovery Channel viewers and those
with children between the ages of 9 and 14 who are interested in
science.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens promisingly, showcasing the IMAX 3D format with
shots of the islands' rugged terrain and unusual wildlife. We're
introduced to Dr. Carole Baldwin, a Smithsonian Institution marine
biologist whose exploration of the islands with a small crew in tow
is the focal point of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As with recent IMAX-format movies such as ``Everest,'' the
balance between straight nature documentary and character-driven
drama is often precarious. We see Baldwin gazing at the sea as she
talks about her dream of following in Darwin's footsteps; we hear
her talking about her excitement at her first deep-sea dive in a
submersible, a sort of underwater helicopter in which she and
another researcher explore the seabed more than 3,000 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   There's some remarkable footage here _ the problem is the script
(narrated by Kenneth Branagh) keeps telling us this stuff is
remarkable, rather than letting the camera demonstrate. The average
viewer doesn't have the contextual knowledge to grasp the
uniqueness or possible importance of some of the discoveries made
in the film. For example, our curiosity is piqued when Baldwin
comes across a fish with ``footlike'' fins. But we're never told if
this is a known species, or if those ``feet'' are actually evidence
of evolution in progress.
</P>
<P>
   If one watches ``Galapagos'' purely for the images, though, it
shouldn't disappoint. Shots of huge schools of fish are so
otherworldly-looking as to appear computer-generated; some of the
sea creatures in particular are unusually beautiful. Co-director Al
Giddings, who oversaw the film's underwater photography, has worked
on such films as ``Titanic,'' ``The Deep'' and ``The Abyss,'' and
his talent for capturing striking underwater images is evident.
</P>
<P>
   It's above water that the film runs aground with its lack of
scale and context. Large-format filmmakers are still trying to
figure out what note to strike as screens are increasingly built in
commercial venues. ``Galapagos'' continues the trek toward finding
a middle ground between education and entertainment, but it doesn't
quite get there. &QL;

BUSH BACKS GOP LEGISLATION ON MINIMUM WAGE, OPPOSES TEACHING

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Siding with congressional Republicans, Gov.
George W. Bush said Wednesday he backs their legislation to raise
the minimum wage and opposes President Clinton's effort to hire
100,000 teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential front-runner also said Congress
should take a lesson from Texas and write two-year federal budgets
instead of having a yearly battle over spending. The Clinton
administration proposed such a change in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush declined to take a position on Republican efforts to
institute a 1 percent across-the-board federal budget cut. He said
only that he is happy the plan does not raid Social Security funds
to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bush in recent weeks has angered Republican congressional
leaders by objecting to their plan to delay tax credit payments to
low-income families as one that would ``balance the budget on the
backs of the poor.'' He also perplexed the Republican leadership,
many of whom endorsed his candidacy, when he said the GOP too often
``confuses the need (for) limited government with a disdain of
government itself.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he praised the Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stood their ground on protecting Social Security. In
terms of education proposals, I applaud what they've done to ensure
flexibility for the states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told a news conference that if he were president, he would
sign a $1-an-hour minimum wage increase that passed the Senate on
Tuesday. President Clinton has threatened to veto the legislation
because it includes $18.4 billion in tax cuts that he called
``special interest tax breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the legislation is ``not my first choice'' because he
would have preferred a provision that allowed individual states to
opt out to ``help areas of high unemployment.'' The bill contains
no such state option.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said he favored a Republican plan on education
spending. Budget negotiations are hung up over President Clinton's
insistence that $1.4 billion in education money be designated for
his seven-year program aimed at reducing class sizes in
kindergarten through third grade by hiring 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the best public policy when it comes to education is
giving states the maximum flexibility,'' Bush said. ``Hiring
teachers _ that's a state's role. Oftentimes the programs coming
out of the federal government hire teachers for one year and then
require local people pick up the tab in following years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes the federal government would be more
constructive if Congress started writing two-year budgets to avoid
an annual battle over spending and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a lot of Americans who are concerned about the
constant budget hassles that dominate the Thanksgiving season,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget process has a tendency to lock Washington down on
an annual basis,'' Bush said. ``I think it makes sense for Congress
to have biennial budgets to avoid the annual gridlock that
dominates the news and the political landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has seen the ``merit'' of writing two-year budgets
while serving as governor of Texas, where the Legislature only
meets 140 days every two years. Bush said Congress could use the
years when budgets are not on the table to conduct ``sunset''
reviews of federal programs to see if they are worth keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has talked to several congressional leaders who
have expressed a positive interest in adopting biennial budgeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reform that needs to be done by Congress,'' Bush said.

 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential candidates often have made appeals to
veterans. But Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose singular biography
includes his five and a half years as a prisoner of war, is making
a full-scale effort to mobilize them.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when fewer presidential candidates and fewer voters
have ever served in combat, his campaign is making a tactical
effort to turn veterans into a powerful political force, most
particularly in the early primary states of New Hampshire and South
Carolina. Both states have high proportions of veterans and are
crucial to McCain's hopes of toppling the presumed Republican
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans seem to be drawn to McCain on their own, like
those from World War II who turn up at his book signings for his
family memoir, with pictures of themselves as young men in uniform.
``It has been terribly moving to me,'' McCain said recently,
describing such encounters. ``The old guys come and stand and
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   His campaign is seeking to capitalize on this pull McCain has on
veterans, working to build an organization in every town in New
Hampshire and each county in South Carolina. The McCain camp has
also created its own Internet Web page for veterans and military
personnel called the ``Patriots Network.'' Volunteers who were
McCain's classmates at the Naval Academy in Annapolis are building
a veterans' e-mail list to advise them of McCain's appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And in perhaps the most visible demonstration of the effort, 20
veterans from across the country, including four former prisoners
of war and a Medal of Honor winner, are converging on New Hampshire
on Thursday, Veterans Day. They and McCain will split up on three
campaign buses and travel to memorial services, parades and
veterans' events organized by the campaign all across the nation's
first primary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that New Hampshire, South Carolina, Washington
and Virginia have large numbers of families with ties to the
military,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political director, ``it was
a logical place to begin building a base for John McCain.'' He said
South Carolina, with about 450,000 veterans and active-duty
military personnel, has the largest number of veterans per capita
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, McCain seems to be running against the tide of
time. As the World War II generation ages and dies, veterans are no
longer the vast part of the population they once were but a more
distinct subgroup. It is more common than not these days that
presidential candidates never served in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the current crop of candidates, only McCain and Vice
President Al Gore served in Vietnam. And the numbers of veterans in
Congress have been diminishing. A recent paper written by William
T. Bianco for a project on civilian and military relations found
that in 1995, the proportion of veterans in Congress had dropped to
25.7 percent, the lowest level since 1931. In contrast, 72.2
percent of the members of Congress were veterans in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   As a bloc, political analysts say, veterans tend to be mostly
men, older, more Republican and more conservative than the public
at large. ``While as a general election strategy, relying on
veterans is probably not viable, as a primary election strategy,
particularly on the Republican side, it could have some real
power,'' said Paul Gronke, an assistant professor of political
science at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is far from the only candidate seeking to appeal to
veterans. Bush, the presumed Republican front-runner, has packed
this week's campaign schedule with events relating to Veterans Day,
in South Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan and Ohio. In an
appearance in New Hampshire on Wednesday, he announced that he had
formed his own New Hampshire veterans ``leadership team.''
</P>
<P>
   And while saying of McCain that ``one of the strengths of his
candidacy is his service to America,'' Bush said he was not
conceding the veterans' vote to his rival. ``I'm going to keep
trying. I'm after the vote. He and I just have an honest
disagreement. He thinks he ought to be the Republican nominee, and
I think I ought to be the Republican nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start of the campaign, McCain and his aides
started examining the voting patterns of veterans. Weaver said the
McCain campaign found that veterans had not voted as an
overwhelming bloc since 1980, when they helped elect Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling in 1992 showed that 41 percent of veterans voted
for President Clinton, despite his opposition to the Vietnam War
and changing answers about his draft record. At the time, President
George Bush won 37 percent of the veterans' vote and Ross Perot 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Weaver said, veterans voted in larger numbers for
Clinton in 1996 than for Bob Dole, even though Dole emphasized his
service in World War II, which left him grievously wounded. ``That
surprised us at first,'' Weaver said, ``then we realized the Dole
campaign made no effort for veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his own appeal, McCain has sent out direct mail to
veterans in New Hampshire saying that as president he would
increase financing for veterans' health programs andion
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire Clinton administration has been AWOL _ absent
without leadership _ on veterans issues,'' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain regularly criticizes Congress for spending millions on
pork barrel projects while 12,000 military families receive food
stamps. And more generally, he projects himself as an expert on
foreign policy and military affairs, in contrast to Bush, who has
mixed up names of countries and recently could not name the leaders
of Pakistan, India and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But the veterans drawn to him seem most impressed by his
personal history. ``He's one of us,'' said Lyn Dimery, 61, the
South Carolina senior vice commander for the Veterans of Foreign
Wars who served 22 years in the Air Force. ``He's been there. He's
done that. I think it would be good for veterans, good for
everyone.'' Dimery said that his organization did not endorse
candidates but that he personally was organizing veterans in the
state for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gamboa, who was McCain's roommate at Annapolis and who has
been organizing McCain's ``patriots'' network, said the e-mail list
has reached nearly 4,000 veterans and is growing daily. He started
the database in April by entering McCain's graduating class from
Annapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, veterans are writing in unbidden, and he read
aloud an e-mail message saying, ``As a Korean War veteran and a
person who believes in a much stronger and more morally governed
U.S.A., I would like to do whatever I can to help Senator McCain to
the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent talk of McCain's temper might also be having
unintended effects in firing up veterans on McCain's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it has caused a low-level buzz in the Senate,
particularly after Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said on
Fox News Sunday, under questioning about McCain, ``I'm passionate,
but you don't have to get mad, you don't have to blow a gasket. You
don't have to use profanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott added that he had never experienced such an outburst from
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is a McCain supporter, said he
thought some of the talk of temper from Republicans was ``a
not-so-subtle effort to make a point that McCain's service to his
country, five and a half years in a prisoner of war camp, may mean
he is not stable enough to be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, who is also one of the Senate's six Vietnam combat
veterans, said he found the suggestion offensive and that, ``If it
starts to drift further in that area, I can assure you that the
Vietnam veterans in the Senate would become very active.''

ARBITRATOR RULES RAYTHEON DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An arbitrator has ruled that Raytheon Co. discriminated against
several women involved in a program to dismantle old nuclear
bombers and cruise missiles in the former Soviet Union, refusing to
promote the employees and firing some.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has denied the allegations in a filing it made to a
local office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in
Washington, where the women also filed complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But in a strongly worded finding issued last month against the
Lexington, Mass. defense contractor, an officer of the New
York-based American Arbitration Association wrote that the women
``have met their burden of proof and persuasion in showing that
Respondent (Raytheon), more probably than not, discriminated
against them because of their sex.'' She wrote further that a
challenge of the women's qualifications by Raytheon ``is mere
pretext.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator awarded interim damages and fees to the women
totaling about $870,000. Raytheon has not yet paid the amount,
while the women are seeking a federal court order to force Raytheon
to pay immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the ongoing litigation, Raytheon spokesman Bob Valentine
said he couldn't comment on the matter or discuss the company's
challenge of the award. In a filing submitted to the US District
Court in Washington, Raytheon argues that the court lacks
jurisdiction in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also declined to address the arbitrator's decision
that Raytheon ``engaged in sanctionable conduct'' by failing to
produce certain documents in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The women said they were pleased by the decision. One of the
group, Edith Brown, said that in her experience at Raytheon,
``These retired military men come in and take these positions, and
what they do is take care of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the group, Theresa Alcorn, said: ``You still
have an old-boys network operating, and I think it's representative
of how the (defense) industry as a whole operates.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn now attends law school at George Mason University; Brown
works as a buyer for the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   In her findings, the arbitrator declined to impose punitive
damages against the company, noting that ``there is no evidence
presented to show that Respondent acted without good faith'' in its
employment practices.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Alcorn brought the case with a third woman, Joy Lyles,
who remains employed at Raytheon. The three were among 12 women who
worked in a procurement office in Virginia for a Pentagon project
to dismantle old Soviet strategic weapons such as Bear and
Blackjack bomber aircraft, and certain air-launched cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998 the Pentagon awarded Raytheon a contract
extension worth up to $81 million that would transfer much of the
logistical support for the dismantling work from Virginia to
Moscow. The three women expressed an interest in applying for the
new jobs, which would have increased their salaries from $40,000 to
around $100,000, said Brown and Alcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who joined a company in 1996 and 1997 that was later
purchased, were qualified for some of the new jobs, the arbitrator
found. Nevertheless, none of them were offered transfers and
instead were sent layoff notices in September 1998, along with 10
of the other women working in the office. Meanwhile, all nine men
in the office were either given jobs in Moscow or transferred, the
arbitrator found.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the women were given adequate notice of the positions
being created in Moscow, the arbitrator wrote, or proper
opportunities to apply for the roles.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon declined to release its filings to the arbitrator.
Officials at the Washington office of the EEOC weren't available
for comment late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of Raytheon's filings to the EEOC was provided by Lars
Liebeler, a lawyer for the women. In the filing, Raytheon asks that
the charges be dismissed, and states that ``a business judgment was
made that only the most professionally experienced persons would be
transferred overseas so that the customer's requirements would be
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions made regarding the status of each of the
employees were based upon sound competitive business judgment,''
Raytheon wrote. ``Higher-level jobs were transferred, lower-level
jobs were eliminated without gender playing a role.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was heard before an arbitrator under the terms of the
employees' contracts with Raytheon, which precluded them from suing
the company directly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government approved a further withdrawal
in the West Bank on Wednesday, moving to carry out another part of
its latest accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout, scheduled for next week, will hand over another 5
percent of the West Bank to full or partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians will gain full control of some rural areas near
the northern West Bank city of Jenin, and partial control of a zone
in the Judean Desert that has been designated a nature reserve to
limit Palestinian construction.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet vote was 17-1 with one abstention. Construction
Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the pro-settlement National Religious
Party, opposed the handover of more territory, while Interior
Minister Natan Sharansky abstained.
</P>
<P>
   After an additional pullout scheduled for early next year, the
Palestinians will have full or partial control of 40 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on a final peace treaty are scheduled to resume on
Thursday in the West Bank town of Ramallah, with the aim of
reaching a framework agreement on a permanent peace by February.

ARMS MARKET FORCES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel's recent sale of AWACS technology to China shows how
unpolitical the international arms bazaar can be and how peculiar
to US domestic politics is America's ambivalence about Chinese
power and the intentions of the regime in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   AWACS technology _ AWACS stands for airborne warning and control
system _ is a crucial addition to China's aerial warfare
capability. At present the Chinese Air Force is woefully backward.
</P>
<P>
   The AWACS equipment, which Israel has installed in a Russian
transport plane, the Ilyushin-76, will enable the Chinese Air Force
to obtain a radar picture of missiles and planes entering China's
airspace at low altitude. In the words of Jane's Defense Weekly,
Israel's sale of AWACS gear ``is very significant for the Chinese
Army, as it will allow a better control of the airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms the principal effect will be to diminish the
considerable superiority that Taiwan's Air Force has enjoyed over
its mainland counterpart. By improving Beijing's ability to control
and defend its airspace, AWACS technology may enhance the
mainland's ability to conduct offensive operations against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The first Russian transport plane outfitted with Israeli AWACS
technology will be delivered before the end of this year, and three
more are to be delivered at some later date, when Beijing is better
able to pay for them. The cost is $250 million per plane.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Beijing's inability or unwillingness to spend the money
required for a high-tech modernization of its military remains the
best guarantee against a projection of mainland China's power
across the Taiwan Straits or elsewhere in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no US technology in the AWACS Israel is selling
to China and since Israel never joined the post-Tiananmen embargo
on military sales to Beijing, there was no barrier but the seller's
self-interest against the sale. At the least, Israel ought to
receive assurances that Beijing will not resume its sales of
missile technology or materiel to Iran.

<P>
   Natalie Portman acts very well, and Susan Sarandon acts up, and
then up to higher registers, in ``Anywhere but Here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a forgettable mother-daughter movie based on one of the
more memorable novels about the subject. The film doesn't exactly
betray Mona Simpson's searing, fictional memoir of growing up under
the control of an unstable woman, but it sure softens up the story
to the point of near-insignificance.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the book makes you want to throttle the mother for her
irresponsible self-absorption and, at times, to also scold the girl
narrator for her whiny impatience with a deeply imperfect but needy
and committed parent. In other words, strong emotional involvement
is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is designed to make you just wish it will all end in
warm, forgiving hugs. While this is all the producers doubtlessly
figured their mature female target audience wants, the actual
effect leaves you not caring whether the hug happens, or one of
them tries to run the other over with a Humvee.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe the latter would be more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens worrisomely with Sarandon singing along to pop
tunes while she drives an old Mercedes through the Utah desert. But
that's a false alarm; things never get ``Stepmom'' bad here, just
frustratingly uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon is Adele August, a flamboyant type fleeing the boredom
of small-town Wisconsin for Beverly Hills _ or, at least, the
Beverly Hills school district _ with Portman's 14-year-old Ann in
tow. She has pipe dreams of Ann _ no, scratch that, her stage name
is Heather _ becoming an actress. Ann dreams of not doing that,
finding her long-gone father and leading an organized life.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of years, Adele loses jobs, flees crummy
apartments in the dead of night and wears unflatteringly tight
capri pants. She also seems to realize how badly she's messed up
whenever the electricity is turned off or the wealthy parents of
Ann's friends invite her to parties, where she'd actually be
exposed to the life she'd like to imagine is within her grasp.
Usually, though, she just works overtime to mortify Ann.
</P>
<P>
   As is too often the case these days, Sarandon plays every scene
FOR ALL IT'S WORTH, overwhelming multiple opportunities for
behavioral honesty with bravura technique. She gives equal
emotional weight to just about every situation, which is a big
reason why nothing in the film really leaves an impression.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason could be that director Wayne Wang did not enjoy
total control. He made the best mother-daughter movie of the
decade, ``The Joy Luck Club,'' from a source novel that was
certainly no stronger nor more observant than Simpson's. But that
film was permitted to show its characters at their ugliest, which
was often at their most compelling. ``Anywhere but Here'' is too
concerned about the audience not liking the kooky lady.
</P>
<P>
   Portman, though, overcomes the imaginative timidity she was
given to work with. The young actress rarely hits a false note as
she tries, much like the character she's playing, to make emotional
sense of an irrational situation. The girl's anger, desperation for
normalcy and infuriatingly unseverable connection to her nut-job
mom come out in clear and subtle gestures. What's more, Portman
charts Ann's coming of age with a matter-of-fact verity that puts
most straight-out teen movies to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Portman single-handedly saves ``Anywhere but Here'' from
pointlessness. But even she can't give this calculatedly
homogenized product a real point of view.

   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
Wednesday said they signed a five-year, $32 million research
alliance in the emerging field of predictive medicine in oncology.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the agreement is the first of its kind
involving the nascent field of pharmacogenomics, combining
pharmaceutical research with knowledge of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional cancer treatments, in which physicians
prescribe available drugs, predictive medicine is aimed at
identifying certain genes or proteins that can help predict a
cancer patient's responses to a specific medical treatment and
assist in developing new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The research program calls for Millennium Predictive Medicine
Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary of Millennium, to receive $32
million in research funding and in licensing and annual fees from
Bristol-Myers Squibb, plus additional funds upon completion of
certain milestones.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers will market any new drugs from the alliance and
pay Millennium royalties based on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that in colon cancer, for example, one of the most
effective drugs works well on only 30 percent of the patients who
take it,'' said Kenneth Conway, president of Millennium Predictive
Medicine. ``What is needed is to find drugs that will work as
effectively on the other 70 percent of colon cancer patients, some
of whom may be harmed by existing medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's work in genomics will be used along with
computerized databases of biological information to identify and
validate oncology clinical markers _ the genes or proteins. The
combination of these markers, along with Millennium's genomic
technology and Bristol-Myers' experience with oncology treatments,
such as taxol, are expected to lead to new therapies tailored to
individual patients and better use of existing drugs, according to
Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said the joint effort is also expected to yield new
diagnostic tests which would be marketed by other companies to be
chosen by Millennium, of Cambridge, Mass., and Bristol-Myers.

THE MEANING OF ARMISTICE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress, at the urging of a veterans group in 1954, changed
Nov. 11 from Armistice Day to Veterans Day. The original
significance of the day deserves remembrance: The Armistice in 1918
spared Americans the full horror of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The United States entered the war in 1917 but could do little
sustained fighting for 16 months. General John Pershing had major
plans for the American Expeditionary Force he commanded. ``It is
estimated that the foregoing project will place in France by May
30, 1919, an American army of 3 million men,'' he said in June
1918. Pershing proposed an offensive against the formidable German
defenses protecting the city of Metz.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies had to undergo a costly learning experience in
the trenches. The French sustained 300,000 killed or wounded in the
Battle of the Frontiers in 1914. The British suffered 419,000
casualties in the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   While not ready for his 1919 operation, Pershing assembled
enough men for an independent offensive in September 1918. The US
Army, said British Commander Douglas Haig, ``is not yet organized;
it is ill-equipped, half-trained, with insufficient supply
services. Experienced officers and NCOs are lacking.'' Pershing
lost 117,000 men killed or wounded in the Meuse-Argonne.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies' pounding cracked German morale, and the
Armistice followed. The United States suffered 46,000 battle
deaths: 695,000 fewer than Britain and 1,336,000 fewer than France.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing wanted to fight on until the Germans surrendered
unconditionally, a view seconded by some soldiers on the steamer
Mauritania, 12 hours out of New York, who reacted with
disappointment when told the war had ended.
</P>
<P>
   They and millions of others went back to peacetime life in the
United States. Among them were Dwight Eisenhower and Omar Bradley,
who never served in combat but became generals with greater
successes than Pershing's. Almost all those soldiers are dead now,
but the lives they enjoyed after 1918 and all their descendants are
American legacies of the Nov. 11 Armistice.

PROSECUTORS SAY SUSPECT DROVE TRUCK IN JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Shawn Berry may not be as big a racist as his
two co-defendants, but he was the one who drove the truck as a
disabled black man was dragged to his death in the East Texas woods
last year, prosecutors said Wednesday, the first day of testimony
in Berry's capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're satisfied that it's his hand on the steering wheel,
weaving down the road, and his foot on the pedal, I don't think you
have any option but to find him guilty,'' Jasper County District
Attorney Guy James Gray told an all-white jury in his 20-minute
opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he was living with them and their beliefs rubbed off on
him,'' he said. ``Maybe he was just a thrill-seeker. Maybe he
wanted to play with a rattlesnake and see what happened.``
</P>
<P>
   But Berry's attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, countered that
it wasn't logical to think that Berry, a 24-year-old movie theater
manager, was the kind of person who could commit such a horrific,
racist crime. And he said prosecutors were trying to ``weave a tale
of guilt by association'' just because Berry was friends with
co-defendant Bill King and briefly lived with him and the third
white defendant, Russell Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew they talked the racist talk, but there was no reason
for Shawn to believe they were violent people,'' he told the
seven-woman, five-man jury.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said Berry tried to stop King, 25, and Brewer, 32, as
they beat and stripped James Byrd Jr. and chained him by the ankles
to the back of Berry's truck in the early morning hours of June 7,
1998. Berry backed off, he said, after King threatened him with the
same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was scared,'' Hawthorn said. ``He was so afraid that he wet
his pants.``
</P>
<P>
   Berry also was scared when he lied to police investigating
Byrd's killing, Hawthorn said, explaining why seven statements his
client signed after his arrest conflict with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did lie,'' he said. ``But he did it to keep himself from
being prosecuted and he did it to avoid retaliation by Bill King
and Russell Brewer.``
</P>
<P>
   King, an ex-convict and who had gone to high school with Berry
in Jasper, and Brewer, of Sulphur Springs, were tried separately
earlier this year. Both were convicted and sentenced to death by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn had launched a last-minute attempt to get Berry's case
moved out of Jasper County, but State District Judge Joe Bob Golden
ruled against him Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Berry would either join his co-defendants on death
row or begin serving a life sentence, which would mean at least 40
years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have conceded that unlike King and Brewer, who met
in prison, became Klansmen and blackened their bodies with racist
tattoos, Berry did not have a reputation as a racist. But they said
physical evidence in the case will show he may have been the most
active participant in the crime, and probably was driving the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's the driver of that truck, then he's the one in control
out there,'' Gray said later outside the courtroom. ``He's not
afraid of these other guys.``
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the previous trials showed that Berry's boot, shirt
and jeans are stained with the victim's blood and his pickup and
logging chain were used to drag Byrd. DNA evidence also placed
Berry at the crime scene as his genetic blueprint was found on a
beer bottle and cigarette butt found along a rural logging road
east of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven witnesses testified for the prosecution Wednesday. But
before court recessed for lunch, Berry's defense lawyer had
seriously deflated the impact of two of the prosecution's strongest
elements.
</P>
<P>
   While cross-examining Jasper investigator Curtis Frame, Hawthorn
stole his opponents' thunder by introducing the 24-foot chain and
by playing a fuzzy copy of the prosecution's 11-minute silent video
showing the three-mile trail of Byrd's gruesome death.
</P>
<P>
   In the trials of King and Brewer, prosecutors had dramatically
pulled the logging chain across the courtroom, allowing it to fall
loudly onto the floor, driving some of Byrd's family members from
the courtroom in tears. The drama was repeated when they showed the
video to a hushed courtroom. It shows numerous dragging marks,
police notations of where Byrd's body parts were found and a
concrete culvert that Byrd's body slammed into, decapitating him.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston, who is helping local
prosecutors, said the defense tactic didn't surprise him, and he
downplayed the damage it may have done to the state's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a little away from the flair,'' he said, ``but it
doesn't take away from the substance.``
</P>
<P>
   Gray later called it a ``pretty good move,'' but said
prosecutors didn't intend to rattle the chain as they did before
anyway. They will, however, show the video at the end of their
presentation, he said, because their copy of the tape is clearer
and jurors may understand it better once they've heard other
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Wednesday, CBS news producer Mary Mapes' fight to stay
out of jail for contempt of court ended when the television network
published on its Internet site the entire transcript of Dan
Rather's three-hour interview with Berry. Tapes of the interview,
18 minutes of which was aired on ``60 Minutes II'' in late
September, were demanded by prosecutors, who want to compare them
with conflicting statements Berry gave police shortly after his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Once the transcript was turned over, prosecutors dropped their
threat to have Mapes jailed and withdrew their subpoena for Rather
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he had not yet had a chance to read the transcript,
but he said Berry's TV interview was the first solid evidence that
prosecutors had showing that King was wearing sandals at the crime
scene. Although Byrd's blood was found on the footwear of all three
defendants, he said, King and Berry wear similar sizes and could
have been wearing each other's shoes the night of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Berry is on record as saying King was wearing sandals,
prosecutors plan to introduce sandal prints that were found only on
the passenger side of the truck, lending support to their theory
that it was Berry, not King, who was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn called that ``a red herring.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The sandal prints probably were not where they say they were
anyway,'' he said outside the courthouse. ``They don't identify the
location of those sandal prints in the previous trials ... They
have no idea where those sandal prints were.``
</P>
<P>
   If they were on the passenger side, he added, it proves nothing
because King could have walked around to that side of the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Even without that evidence, though, Berry's statements to
police, which were read in court Wednesday, could be difficult to
reconcile if Berry takes the stand as expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Berry's first statement, signed the night after Byrd's
dismembered corpse was found outside a rural black cemetery on Huff
Creek Road, Berry said King drove his truck into the woods and that
Berry ran away when he realized what the other two had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he changed his statement to say that he drove
the truck and that he didn't run, but stood there and watched as
King and Brewer beat the 49-year-old Byrd and chained him to the
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   In one statement, he said he didn't know anything about the
chain. Later, he admitted helping King wash it at a local car wash,
and he led investigators to the chain, which had been stashed in
the woods behind a friend's trailer home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying is lying,'' Gray said later. ``He's gonna get up there
and tell the jury basically the version he gave on 60 Minutes, and
the jury, knowing he has lied numerous times in the past in this
case, will take that into consideration.``

UPS SHARES SKYROCKET IN THEIR FIRST DAY ON THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been in business for 92 years and delivers
more than 12 million packages each business day, but until
Wednesday nobody really knew what United Parcel Service was worth.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investors said the Atlanta-based company is worth
almost twice as much as General Motors, more than three times as
much as Merrill Lynch and nearly six times as much as Federal
Express, which, with the exception of the U.S. Postal Service is
its biggest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The market also sent a ringing, late 1990s message to the
125,000 shareholders of what up to now has been a privately held
company. Most of these shareholders are current or retired UPS
employees, and they are now poised to cash in on the decision to go
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm going to have to get a broker,'' said Miquel
Cartagena, 35, a driver in Manhattan who has been a UPS employee
for the past 13 years. ``I'm looking forward to wheeling and
dealing down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest initial public stock offering ever, late Tuesday
UPS priced 109.4 million of its Class B shares, 10 percent of the
company, at $50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the stock was extremely heavy, and Wall Street
veterans expected the shares would do very well when secondary
trading commenced on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But given the size of UPS _ it made $1.74 billion last year on
revenues of nearly $25 billion _ many on Wall Street did not expect
UPS stock to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, though, UPSs shares had jumped 36 percent
from its initial offering price, to $68.25 a share. In less than 24
hours, the public had increased UPSs market capitalization by some
$20 billion, to more than $81 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's glittering record and its prospects of burgeoning
e-commerce opportunities were undoubtedly big selling points with
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last blue chip of the century,'' said Benn
Konsynski, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business
School and an advisor to UPS. ``The market is recognizing them as
more than just a transportation company. They are also an
extraordinary player in the field of e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the holders of much of the paper wealth created in the
last few years by the Internet, the average UPS stockholder almost
certainly never dropped out of Harvard or graduated from Stanford
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many UPS shareholders _ some 66,000 _ work on an hourly
basis for the company. Since 1995, these drivers, loaders and
handlers, who make a starting wage of between $8.50 and $9.50 an
hour, have been eligible to buy UPSs voting Class A shares.
</P>
<P>
   Another 40,000 are managers, who at one point in their careers
wore the company's signature brown uniform. Even James P. Kelly,
the chairman, began his career 35 years ago with UPS as a package
car driver in the company's Metro Jersey District. In all, UPS has
more than 300,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Teamsters union, which has many of the
company's 205,000 unionized employees as members, pointed out that
much of the lucre derived from Wednesday's stock sale will be
realized by managers, who have been eligible to buy stock since
1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research says the average Teamster owns less than 100
shares of stock,'' said Brett Caldwell, a Teamster spokesman in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for our members, but it's not making them
millionaires,'' he added. ``The real wealth of the IPO is going to
go the managers, who have been able to buy stock for many years.''

<P>
   To be sure, the gains are skewed. But on a purely statistical
basis, the ``average'' gain realized by each UPS shareholder from
Aug. 19, when the Class A shares were last priced at $25.50 a
share, through Wednesday's close at $68.25, was more than $370,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if their holdings aren't big enough to retire on, those who
wear brown collars and do own stock were obviously happy; those who
have chosen not to buy shares were not.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Stocks, 56, who works in the Atlanta area, has worked for
the company for nearly 29 years, many as a tractor-trailer driver.
He said he has been buying as much stock as he could afford since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable,'' he said, ``we're excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bercy Vaugly, by contrast, was troubled.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year old, who has been driving a UPS truck for the last
five years, lamented in the cab of his brown UPS truck on West
Houston Street in Manhattan Wednesday morning. ``It's definitely
one of the biggest mistakes in my life,'' he said of his decision
not to buy UPS shares.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the judgments at the end of the first day of trading
in UPS stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the public stock offering, UPS, which is
awash in cash, will use the $5.47 billion it raised late Tuesday to
buy back just under 10 percent of the Class A shares from the
employees, managers, retirees, foundations and families who are
heirs of the late James Casey, who founded the company back in
1907.
</P>
<P>
   The Class B shares sold Wednesday carry one vote per share. In
order to preserve the control of existing shareholders, Morgan
Stanley, the lead underwriter on the offering, gave the Class A
shares 10 votes for every one that the Class B shares have.
</P>
<P>
   The stock buyback will not take place for at least a month. And
management has made it plain it intends to keep offering Class A
shares to its employees in the future. Going forward, however,
their value will be determined by the public market.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, UPS has created a currency _ its
publicly-traded stock _ that can be used to help it expand through
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Kelly said that in the
recent past ``one or two'' potential deals fell through because the
companies UPS was looking to acquire wanted stock, not cash.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to identify what kinds of companies UPS might be
interested in acquiring. But he gave a strong indication it is
looking beyond the boundaries of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our worldwide express business is doing wonderfully,'' he
said, ``but we want to expand our global presence.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS had revenues of $24.8 billion last year. Of that, some $3.2
billion, were generated outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, when it announced its plans to go public, the company
targeted three areas for future growth: international, e-commerce
and logistics management, a delivery consulting business that is
currently growing at a 40 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   Already a major presence on the Internet, UPS has plans to get
even bigger. Last Christmas the company delivered about 55 percent
of the goods consumers bought through the Internet. For years the
company has been investing more than $1 billion a year in
information technology, and it has amassed what some say is one of
the world's largest data bases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to facing stern competition from Federal Express and
various postal services around the world, UPS will now be
confronted with the challenge of maintaining its distinctive _ some
call it secretive and tight-fisted _ corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought harder about that than any one topic,'' before the
UPS board voted to go public in July, Kelly said. ``We have a great
culture at UPS, a manager-owned and now an employee-owned
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a public company ``will be a change,'' he added, ``but we
think we can manage the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though 99 percent of the voting rights in UPS will remain
in the Class A shares owned by its employees and managers, ``you
cannot be a little bit public,'' Konsynski, the professor from
Emory said. ``Being public impacts people's attention, regardless
of where the voting stock rests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS is used to making long-term plays and investments. As a
public company, it gets harder to make those long-term investments
without putting at risk near-term performance.''

EVIL, MINI-ME COMES TO DVD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: For use Friday, Nov. 12 or later.) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When film historians look back on 1999, they will find a number
of movies that will rank among the best of the decade _ ``American
Beauty,'' ``Three Kings,'' ``Being John Malkovich,'' the upcoming
``Magnolia,'' to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me'' will not be one of
them. But the blockbuster Mike Myers comedy, which comes out on VHS
and DVD Tuesday, does contain one brilliant idea and a lot of
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mini-me, you complete me,'' Dr. Evil (Myers) coos to his
diminutive clone, played by Verne J. Troyer. It's such a funny line
that a lot of people are still repeating it. But it's not going too
far out on a limb to say Mini-me is the walking manifestation of
man's ego and self-love, and Myers makes the most of it comically.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Evil adores his clone because it makes all his vanities and
vices cute, and is easier to deal with than his less-than-perfect
son, Scott (Seth Green). ``You're not quite evil enough,'' he tells
Scott. ``You're semi-evil. You're quasi-evil. You're the margarine
of evil. You're the Diet Coke of evil, just one calorie, not evil
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Evil isn't the first father to be disappointed in his
offspring or not know how to deal with him or her. And Myers find
the most therapeutic _ and public _ of places to show this.
``Shagged Me'' begins with a visit to ``The Jerry Springer Show,''
where the doctor and Scott get to air their dirty/evil laundry.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Shagged Me'' is not as inspired, with the comic
invention ranging from the gross _ anything to do with Fat Bastard
(also Myers) _ to the silly _ Austin's sexual innuendoes (``Let's
hop on the good foot and do the bad thing!'') _ to inside jokes
(``You know what's remarkable? That England looks in no way like
Southern California''). But though some of the jokes miss and the
plot gets waylaid, ``Shagged Me'' is fun and funny enough to make
you hope there's an ``Austin Powers III.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those with DVD players, the ``Shagged Me'' disc is
filled with all kinds of treats, including 20 minutes of deleted
scenes; Comedy Cs ``The Dr. Evil Story'' (a spoof of those
A&AMP;E biographies); a behind-the-scenes documentary; a feature-length
audio commentary by Myers, co-writer Mike McCullers and director
Jay Roach; material filmed exclusively for the DVD by Myers; and
music videos related to the film from Madonna and Lenny Kravitz.
For those of you with DVD-ROM on your computers, there are even
more extras. The DVD is listed at $24.98 and the VHS at $22.98, but
you should be able to find it for 30 percent to 40 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked: There are three recently released films
you should check out if you haven't already _ ``Election'' (priced
for rental on VHS; $29.99 on DVD), ``Pushing Tin'' (priced for
rental on VHS; $34.98 on DVD) and ``Notting Hill'' (priced for
rental on VHS; $29.98 on DVD).
</P>
<P>
   All three are highly entertaining and feature strong
performances. ``Election,'' a clever satire that revolves around an
overachieving student's quest for the school presidency, heads
toward its inevitable conclusion in surprising ways, keeping its
edge while not going over it. As the aggressive, manipulative Tracy
Flick, Reese Witherspoon shows why as an actress she'll be around
long after most of her contemporaries will be trivia questions.
</P>
<P>
   John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are air-traffic controllers
playing a game of cat-and-mouse both professionally and personally
in ``Pushing Tin'' (directed by Mike Newell), another edgy movie
with black humor. The movie opens with the zinger, ``You land a
million planes safely, then you have one little midair and you
never hear the end of it.'' Cusack and Thornton are superb, as are
Cate Blanchett and Angelina Jolie as their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant together _ need we say more about
``Notting Hill''? Written by Richard Curtis (``Four Weddings and a
Funeral''), ``Notting'' has a similarly intelligent, lightly
romantic tone. ``Notting,'' which was directed by Roger Michell,
wasn't as successful as ``Weddings,'' which was directed by Newell.
It succumbs a bit too much to sentimentality, but it isn't
offensive and has its charms, especially for the romantically
inclined.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``Do behave.''

BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG FOUND TO CURB RISKS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A drug that has been marketed for eight years to combat high
blood pressure turns out to substantially lower the risk of heart
attack, stroke, bypass surgery, and diabetes and its complications
in those who have heart disease, scientists reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that at least 10 million Americans and
their doctors may want to add the drug, ramipril, to standard heart
therapies and that it could save tens of thousands of lives each
year at a cost of about 85 cents a day, said the study's chief
author, Dr. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton,
Ontario, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the Canadian government and by the
drug company Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City, Mo., which
manufactures ramipril as Altace. But scientists who were not
involved in it said they were excited by the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings will have a major effect on how physicians treat
patients who have known coronary artery disease or are at high risk
for it,'' said Dr. Robert Bonow, chief of cardiology at
Northwestern University in Chicago and chairman of the scientific
session at a conference of the American Heart Association in
Atlanta. ``It's a landmark study.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted among individuals with heart or blood
vessel disease but without heart failure, Yusuf said in reporting
the findings Wednesday at the AHA meeting in Atlanta. Participants
also had at least one risk factor for heart disease or strokes,
like high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels or cigarette
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 individuals who took ramipril once a day for
four years, the study found that 70 would avoid a total of 150
serious problems, including heart attacks, strokes, bypass surgery
and death. Ramipril's benefits were ``at least as large'' as other
drugs like aspirin, beta-blockers and those that lower lipids, said
Yusuf's team, adding that in the study, ramipril had been taken in
conjunction with those other drugs, not as a substitute for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, ramipril reduced the risk of death, heart attacks,
strokes and other problems about 20 to 25 percent beyond those
achieved by the standard drug therapies. Those are ``major-league
reductions,'' said Bonow.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are to be published in the New England Journal of
Medicine on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Ramipril belongs to a class of drugs, ACE inhibitors, that relax
blood vessels by blocking a protein known as angiotensin-converting
enzyme. ACE inhibitors are thought to slow the progression of both
heart failure and atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of heart
attacks. But more research is needed to better understand the
mechanism, Yusuf said.
</P>
<P>
   Yusuf said doctors should now consider prescribing ramipril for
those who take aspirin to prevent heart attacks and for diabetics.
A clearer picture of which other patients should receive an ACE
inhibitor will come as experts discuss the findings at future
medical meetings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not immediately clear whether the findings about ramipril
will hold for the 10 other ACE inhibitors on the market. That point
was made Wednesday at the same meeting, in an unrelated study from
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Department of
Veterans' Affairs about a different class of drugs, beta-blockers.
While some beta-blockers are known to reduce death from heart
disease, scientists found that bucindolol, a beta-blocker drug,
surprisingly did not. Federal officials said they did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   Bonow said ``the data seem very clear for ramipril but we do not
know now whether they convert to other ACE inhibitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramipril has been marketed in the United States since 1991 for
high blood pressure and chronic heart failure. Yusuf said that five
years ago he had performed a statistical review of previous studies
involving 9,000 patients that showed that ACE inhibitor drugs could
reduce the risk of a heart attack by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Food and Drug Administration and others did not
accept the finding, Yusuf said he undertook the new study. It was
carried out in 129 medical centers in the United States, Canada,
Mexico and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women at least 55 years old enrolled in the study from
December 1993 to June 1995 and were intended to be studied for five
years. Participants received either ramipril or a placebo, or dummy
pill, as a scientific control. But the study was stopped ahead of
schedule last March because a safety monitoring committee found a
clear benefit for ramipril in a preliminary review.
</P>
<P>
   Those eligible for the study had a history of angina, coronary
artery disease, stroke, diabetes or a painful leg condition called
claudication; they also needed at least one other risk factor for
circulatory disease, like high blood pressure, increased
cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
cigarette smoking. More than 10,000 patients enrolled in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The marked drop in the number of participants who developed
diabetes and complications from diabetes was considered a
significant benefit because diabetics are at increased risk of
dying from heart attacks and strokes than nondiabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Ramipril also reduced the rates of the following compared with
those receiving placebo: death from any cause (10.4 percent versus
12.2); death from cardiovascular causes (6.1 percent versus 8.1);
heart attack (9.9 percent versus 12.2); stroke (3.4 percent versus
4.9); bypass surgery and angioplasty (16.0 percent versus 18.6
percent); and heart failure (7.4 percent versus 9.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The benefits began to appear within a year of starting ramipril
and continued. Statistical analysis suggested that ``longer-term
treatment may yield even better results,'' Yusuf said.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent cough, dizziness and low blood pressure were the
most common reasons for stopping ramipril.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time within recent months that a remarkable new
use was found for an older drug. In July, researchers reported that
a 40-year-old blood-pressure drug, spironolactone, could save
thousands of lives among people with heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the drug's potential worldwide, Yusuf said that if
50 percent of people in developed countries and 25 percent of
people in developing countries with heart and blood vessel disease
and adult onset diabetes took ramipril, at least 500,000 deaths,
300,000 nonfatal heart attacks and 200,000 strokes would be
prevented each year.  &QL;

ISRAELI ARMS SALE TO CHINA AIR FORCE IS OPPOSED BY U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israel's sale of a sophisticated, $250 million
airborne radar system to China has raised serious concerns at the
Pentagon, and the Clinton administration has quietly urged Israeli
officials to cancel delivery of additional radar planes and to curb
other weapons sales to the Chinese military, administration and
defense officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long had a close, secretive military relationship
with China that, according to arms experts, has resulted in
billions of dollars of weapons sales in recent years and raised a
variety of concerns in the United States. But senior Pentagon
officials fear that the advanced radar system, in particular, will
enhance China's ability to extend its military power beyond its
borders and threaten Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant capability,'' a senior official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity, ``and it will improve
significantly China's ability to conduct operations in and around
the Taiwan Strait. That obviously is our major security interest in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Elta, a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft Industries,
recently mounted the radar system on a Russian-made cargo plane
destined for China's Air Force, completing the first part of a
complex deal that has been several years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Elta designed the system, known as the Phalcon, for the Israeli
Air Force, using a Boeing 707 as a platform. China is reportedly
interested in buying four to eight more of the systems and placing
them aboard Russian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the radar system, as well as other Israeli arms
deals with China, have put a strain on the Clinton administration's
relationship with one of the United States' closest allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government has assured administration officials that
the sale does not involve U.S. technology, although a Pentagon
official said that, given the amount of arms the United States
shares with Israel, it was difficult to separate U.S. military
technology from Israel's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the very close relationship that we have, there is
always the danger that some of this technology could pass from
Israel to China,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have repeatedly raised the issue with
the Israelis, as Defense Secretary William Cohen did on his trip to
Israel last month, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon delegation led by Jacques Gansler, the under
secretary for defense acquisition and technology, arrived in Israel
Wednesday for a previously arranged visit, and although the sale is
not explicitly part of Gansler's agenda, it is very likely to come
up.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, Cohen also expressed objections to Israel's
reported plans to sell Popeye missiles to India, particularly at a
time of tensions between India and Pakistan, the officials said.
The Popeye missile was jointly developed by the United States and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no treaty prohibiting conventional arms transfers to
China, and our laws don't prohibit transfers when they do not
involve American technology,'' the State Department's spokesman,
James Rubin, said in the administration's only public statement on
the issue Wednesday. ``But it is true that Israeli arms transfers
are an active subject of our dialogue with Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of the sale to China has provoked sharp reactions on
Capitol Hill, both from staunch opponents of China, as well as arms
control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.,, the chairman of the House's Select
Committee on Intelligence, said Wednesday the sale underscored the
fact that China's military is ``extremely acquisitive'' and raised
questions about the possibility of ``American parentage'' of some
of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had already sought further clarification from the
administration, but left little doubt about what he viewed as
China's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the point of a long-range radar surveillance?'' he
said. ``It has to do with an offense that extends their border or
certainly their area of hegemony.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the
House's Committee on International Relations, said it was ``bad
policy'' for Israel to sell advanced weaponry to China,
particularly since China has a record of selling weapons to nations
opposed to the United States and Israel, including Iran. He met
Wednesday with Israel's ambassador to the United States, Zalman
Shoval, but he declined to discuss their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The political sensitivity of the Israeli sale has been
heightened by a series of confrontations the United States has had
with China over its arms programs, including the illegal transfer
of sophisticated computer technology to China's military and
accusations that China stole American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, China bought weapons from many Western
suppliers, including American allies like Britain, France and
Italy, as well as from the United States, which sold China
Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union after
Chinese troops killed pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989 largely dried up those sales, though
France and Italy have shown an eagerness to resume arms sales to
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1990s, however, China has embarked on a major program
to modernize its military and looked elsewhere for sellers. By far,
its biggest arms supplier has been Russia, which has sold China MiG
fighter jets, surface warships and submarines, and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Israel is China's second largest supplier. A recent report by
Kenneth W. Allen and Eric A. McVadon of The Henry L. Stimson
Center, a research organization here in Washington, said Israel has
provided China with a range of weapons, including electronic
components for tanks, communications and optical equipment,
aircraft and missiles, during a relationship that began at least
two decades ago. Full diplomatic ties were not established until
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both China and Israel appear to gain military and political
benefits from the arms and technology transfer relationship,'' they
wrote in the report. ``Besides seeking money from China, some
Israeli officials claim the sale of military technology to China
will secure Beijing's agreement not to sell specific weapons to
Israel's enemies in the Middle East.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Phalcon radar system is part of a complicated
arrangement that began with Israel and Russia competing to sell
China an aircraft equipped with an early warning radar system. In
1997, the former Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, went
to Moscow and reached an agreement with Russia to develop the
aircraft jointly, with Russia supplying the aircraft itself and
Israel adding the radar system.
</P>
<P>
   Israel does not disclose many details of its arms sales to
China. A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy, Mark Regev, declined to
discuss the radar sale Wednesday. But he said that when Israel
considers any sale, ``There is a very elaborate system whereby
national security issues are taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian aircraft arrived in Israel on Oct. 25. According to
U.S. intelligence reports, the work is expected to be completed by
the end of this year, and after testing in Israel the radar system
could be delivered to China next spring.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the sale troubling to Pentagon officials is that the
radar system is comparable to and might exceed the abilities of the
U.S. early warning radar planes, called AWACs, a recent
intelligence report concluded, according to a senior military
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The system will allow Chinese commanders to collect intelligence
and direct aircraft from a distance of 250 miles. Access to
sophisticated electronic and information-gathering equipment has
long been one of the weaknesses of China's military, though one it
appears bent on addressing, according to arms experts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has provided advanced weaponry to Taiwan,
which China regards as a renegade province, including fighter jets.
Last July, the administration notified Congress that it intended to
sell Taiwan sophisticated early warning radar aircraft, including
E-2T Hawkeyes, and other radar systems, but not the more
sophisticated AWACs.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide who follows arms sales closely said that
the Phalcon system also offered the Chinese a chance to develop
abilities to monitor actions on the ground, something the United
States has only recently mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a 100-percent supporter of Israel and be mad as
hell about its growing commerce with China,'' the aide said,
speaking on condition of anonymity, ``because the arms being sold
to China will be used to kill Americans in the event of war on the
Taiwan Straits.''

CABS OF DRIVERS WHO REFUSE MINORITY PASSENGERS TO BE SEIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced an undercover
sting operation Wednesday intended to take away the cabs of drivers
who refuse to pick up minority passengers. His decision came less
than a week after the actor Danny Glover complained that several
New York taxi drivers refused to pick him up because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, also aimed at cabbies who refuse to take
passengers es they want to go, usually minority
neighborhoods, is to begin Friday at 7 a.m. with 150 police
officers and taxi inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are perfectly entitled to do this,'' Giuliani said at a
news conference. ``I know we're going to get the same howls and
screams and yells that we got when we did this with drunk
drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the mayor announced that the police would seize the
cars of people arrested on charges of driving while drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani described the crackdown on taxi drivers as a toughening
of two existing but only nominally successful undercover efforts,
both called Operation Refusal, one run by the Police Department,
the other by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Both have issued
summonses against the drivers, but neither has taken away any cabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do,'' the mayor said, ``is intensify it
dramatically in order to make the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Several black officials praised the mayor's decision, including
State Sen. David A. Paterson, a Harlem resident who has said he has
been forced out of cabs more than 100 times because his destination
was Harlem, Wednesday complimented the mayor's decision as ``very
proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glover's lawyer, Randolph M. Scott-McLaughlin, immediately
criticized it as the ``wrong approach'' and a ``Band-Aid'' on a
longstanding problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the police to demonize the drivers is not the approach
that Danny Glover wishes to take,'' said Scott-McLaughlin, the
director of the Pace Law School Social Justice Center. Glover, a
star of the ``Lethal Weapon'' series, ``Beloved,'' and other films,
was in Senegal Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Scott-McLaughlin said the taxi commission should instead
increase its diversity training for drivers, many of them recent
immigrants who, taxi officials say, have distorted images of
America and attitudes rooted in the social stratification of their
native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the new operation, police officers and taxi inspectors will
work undercover in multiracial groups of three. As a supervisor
observes, a black officer and a white officer standing near each
other will attempt to hail a cab. If the black person is passed up
in favor of the white person, something blacks say happens all the
time, the driver will be issued a summons on the spot suspending
his hack license.
</P>
<P>
   The police will then take the cab to the nearest police station,
where it is to be picked up by either the taxi owner or another
licensed driver.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended driver is then to have a hearing before an
administrative law judge within five days. Allan Fromberg, the
commission's spokesman, said Wednesday that a driver with a clean
record would probably get the license back immediately, but would
still have to face a separate hearing at the taxi commission on the
charge of refusing to pick up a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi commission's penalty for a first offense is $200 to
$350. A third offense calls for a mandatory revocation of a hack
license. ``The drivers clearly know that refusal is against the
law,'' said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the taxi commissioner. ``And
this is the Giuliani administration's attempt to ratchet that up so
people understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said the enhanced Operation Refusal,
as the new joint effort is called, would not seize cars in the same
way that the Police Department takes vehicles from drunken drivers.
Under that program, cars are only returned after an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply taking the car for safe-keeping,'' Ms.
McGrath-McKechnie said, adding that the owner would be notified
immediately so that the taxi could get back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson asked why it took Glover to get the mayor to act,
particularly when even former Mayor David N. Dinkins has complained
that he was refused a ride because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's who it happened to, or the political
climate,'' Paterson said. ``I hear he might be interested in a
Senate race.'' Giuliani is expected to announce his candidacy for
the U.S. Senate next year against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure, we should have done this earlier,'' Giuliani said
at his news conference. ``Probably we should have done it three
years ago, five years ago, but also it should have been done seven
years ago, and eight years ago, and ten years ago, and 12 years
ago, and 15 years ago. So, you can keep using that excuse forever.
This is a good time to do it. It got a great deal of attention
because it involved a person of great notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Under taxi commission rules, drivers may not refuse passengers
based on race, religion or their destinations within the city. But
the rules allow drivers to refuse passengers who are ``disorderly
or intoxicated,'' who have an animal ``not properly secured'' in a
kennel case, or who smoke in the cab. &QL;

FLIGHT DATA RECORDER INDICATES FLIGHT 900 BEGAN `CONTROLLED
DESCENT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first unusual event in the flight of Egyptair
990 on Oct. 31 was the plane's autopilot disconnecting and then,
about eight seconds later, what appeared to be ``a controlled
descent'' that was smooth and straight, investigators at the
National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said such a descent would be very unlikely
unless the pilots were still flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, the chairman of the safety board, gave only a
brief description of preliminary information from the flight data
recorder, the one ``black box'' that the Navy has retrieved so far
from the crash site, about 60 miles from Nantucket. However, the
information did not solve the mystery of why the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board badly wants to recover the cockpit voice
recorder, which could have information such as the pilots talking
to each other about the plane's problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the new information appeared to rule out two possibilities:
a malfunctioning autopilot throwing the plane into a dive, or
thrust reversers deploying by accident.
</P>
<P>
   A thrust reverser, used to help a plane brake after landing,
deployed in flight in 1991, causing the only crash of a Boeing 767
for mechanical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said that the sketchy information released so
far painted a picture compatible with an emergency descent,
although there is no way yet to judge why the crew would initiate
one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons could range from a variety of mechanical problems to an
explosion on board that could breach the plane's skin and cause a
loss of air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight data recorder and radar data combined show that
even if the plane had some severe mechanical problem, it was still
under control at the beginning of its dive, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the data show an uneventful flight, with the
plane cruising levelly at 33,000 feet. ``The first event we note is
the autopilot disconnecting,'' Hallsaid in a briefing here, flanked
by officials of the Egyptian government and the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are not sure yet whether someone in the cockpit
flipped off the autopilot, which can be used to maintain altitude,
heading and speed, or whether the autopilot disconnected itself in
response to some problem on the plane that left it unable to follow
instructions. Manual disconnection of the autopilot, however, is an
early step in an emergency descent.

BUSH PROPOSES CHANGE IN FLORIDA'S RACE-BASED COLLEGE ADMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, in a move that could head off
a possible statewide vote on whether to ban affirmative action, has
offered his own plan to change race-based college admissions and
stop minority set-asides in state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Some here in Florida trumpet the plan as a fair and sound
solution to an often divisive issue, but others view it as the
latest attack on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   And some see the plan as a compromise motivated by politics
during a presidential race in which Bush's brother is the
front-runner for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan for college admissions, which must be approved by
the state university system's Board of Regents, the top fifth of
the graduating class at each high school in Florida _ whether in
minority communities or in predominantly white ones _ would be
assured admission to a state university.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have similar programs. California has a 4 percent
program, and Texas admits the top 10 percent. Other states are
considering such programs as a fairer way to diversify their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   As news of Bush's plan spread Wednesday, officials from several
other states called to ask about the plan, said Lucia Ross, his
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the letting of state contracts, an aspect of the plan that
has not generated the same emotional response, Bush's plan
eliminates racial set-asides. But it would not require local
governments like Miami and Miami-Dade County, where
multimillion-dollar companies headed by minority members have
historically landed contracts under current municipal guidelines,
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of that phase of the plan must be approved by the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   If all phases of Bush's plan win acceptance, it could derail a
statewide vote to end all affirmative action that is being pushed
by Ward Connerly, a black conservative businessman who has already
led successful campaigns to ban racial set-asides in California and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a significant step,'' said Kevin Nguyen, a spokesman for
the American Civil Rights Coalition, which Connerly heads. Nguyen
went on to praise Bush for trying to create a system that rewards
merit.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the coalition is not calling off its push for a
blanket end to affirmative action, though members will look deeper
into the Bush plan to see if it accomplishes enough of their
proposed reforms, Nguyen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be treated differently because of the way you
look,'' said Nguyen, whose organization has collected enough
signatures for the state's attorney general, Bob Butterworth, to
consider its request for a place on the ballot in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some here in Florida, including black political leaders opposed
to the plan, accused Bush of playing politics with his initiative,
using it as a way to head off disruption in the national Republican
Party as his brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, campaigns for
that party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have been concerned that Connerly's
initiative, if placed on the ballot in this politically important
state, could lead to a broader divisiveness within the party and
hurt George W. Bush's chances in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush dismissed that, saying he was merely keeping a campaign
promise he made years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's universities, experts on affirmative action said
his plan was a common-sense compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible it could turn out to be a positive plan,
especially since we're in an environment where there is opposition
to affirmative action as it is presently structured,'' said Kenneth
Nunn, associate dean and law professor at the University of
Florida. ``The program has promise. Whether it lives up to that
promise remains to be seen.''

</P>
<P>
   Under the educational section of Bush's plan, which requires
approval from the state Board of Regents, state universities would
no longer have to meet quotas _ whether stated or not _ but would
still achieve diversity because the pool of applicants would come
from the best graduates from each the state's high schools.
</P>
<P>
   A black or Hispanic student from Miami, where tests scores are
among the state's lowest, Ms. Ross said, could gain admission to a
state school by finishing in the top 20 percent of his or her own
school.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the plan said it blunted charges of cultural bias
by reducing the importance of scores on standardized test _ long
held to be unfair to minorities _ and giving a poor white student
from the Florida Panhandle the same chance at college admission as
minority students, preventing so-called reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many generations do we have to go through with quotas?''
said James Corey, a professor of political science at the
University of Miami, who supports Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents is expected to consider Bush's plan next
week. But University Chancellor Adam Herbert has already endorsed
it and is expected to push for its approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes us where Florida should be in becoming truly color
blind,'' said Keith Goldschmidt, the board's director of public
information.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the plan would increase the number of black students
in state universities, not decrease them as other alternatives to
affirmative action would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to eliminate these legally suspect
practices, that never fully achieved their purpose to begin with,''
said Bush, referring to both the educational and bid-letting
aspects of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   But some black political leaders in Florida oppose the plan,
saying it is just a cleverly disguised way of doing away with
proven laws that forced the state to create opportunities for the
people who had been held back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it all,'' said Les Miller, the Democratic Leader
in the Florida House of Representatives. ``I wouldn't be an elected
official if it wasn't for affirmative action. I don't even think I
would have gotten into college if it wasn't for affirmative
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, of Tampa, echoed other black leaders in calling it a
plan born of politics that would sacrifice some students who do
their best but cannot squeeze into the top 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to the student who is busting his behind for a
2.8 grade point average and has an afternoon job, and has to take
care of his family, all at the same time?'' Miller asked. ``What do
we say to that kid? Are we just going to say you're not the cream
of the crop, so forget about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Around the state, university officials were cautious about the
plan. Statistically, the old affirmative action laws, in place
since 1978, improved diversity in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious here,'' said David Colburn, provost of the
University of Florida. ``We don't want to lose any of the momentum
we've had in diversifying the student body, and I don't think
either the governor or the chancellor wants to do that. We've had a
system in place since the late 1970s that has worked well for us,
and now there's a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   State universities consider race, sometimes to the exclusion of
other factors, in offering admissions.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Florida, the student population is 9.2
percent Hispanic and 6 percent black in a state that is 13.6
percent Hispanic and 13.4 percent black, said Colburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hearing is that we have the opportunity to improve
the diversity of the student body,'' he said. ``But that remains to
be seen. Check with me next fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the old system admitted students who did not meet
``basic admissions criteria,'' and he said that sub-par graduation
rates bore that out.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Jones, a black Democratic state senator from Miami,
supports the plan because, he said, it gives students a chance to
break their own cycle of poverty through hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has proposed a very logical goal,'' he said of
Bush's plan.

MUHAMMAD TO RETURN TO LA FOR BURIAL OF WIFE, BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There is no grieving period built into the
National Football League schedule, as the Indianapolis Colts are
discovering. Steve Muhammad is not a presence in their locker room.
Without being callous, the Colts are trying not to let him become a
distraction in their locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a reserve defensive back and special-teams player, was
scheduled to fly home Wednesday to Los Angeles, where on Saturday
he will bury his wife, Nichole, and the couple's stillborn baby,
apparent victims of a freakish one-car accident last week. As much
as they might want to, the Colts will not be present to offer
solace. They have an unbreakable commitment _ a game at the
Meadowlands against the New York Giants Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the professional part,'' said defensive tackle Tony
McCoy. ``Our condolences and prayers go out to him and his kids.
But whether you feel like doing it or not, you've got to go out and
do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   That job has become complicated by some seamy offshoots _
especially the revelation Monday, less than 24 hours after
Nichole's death, that her husband had been arrested and charged
with three counts of misdemeanor battery following an alleged
domestic dispute over finances at their West Side apartment Oct.
28.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, a preliminary coroner's report indicated that
Nichole's death had resulted from excessive bleeding, some 7 1/2
hours after she delivered the stillborn baby Sunday, stemming from
chest and abdoimnal injuries she suffered last Thursday. Early that
morning, the SUV she was driving while five months pregnant had
struck a small post, thrusting her into the steering wheel because
she wasn't wearing a seat belt and the impact was insufficient to
activate her air bag.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports to the contrary, Steve Muhammad has not been
officially exonerated and won't be until the final autopsy is
released, which takes 6-8 weeks. But all signs point to his
innocence, according to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Major Mike Turk said that on Tuesday, Marion County Sheriff's
Office detectives went to the Muhammads' apartment and questioned
Nichole's sister, Nichelle Garrett, who had accompained her to
Methodist Hospital Friday when Nichole said she could not detect a
fetal heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before that, Nichole retained attorney Greg
Garrison to begin legal separation proceedings against Steve, from
whom she had been estranged since he was released on $30,000 bond
in the wake of the alleged attack on his wife and her 6-year-old
son from a previous relationship, Eric, who had reportedly come to
her defense.
</P>
<P>
   Turk said detectives ``didn't find anything that would lead us
to believe that there is anything to this other what we've told
(the media). (Garrett) basically corroborated that there was an
accident and that she knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He termed the chances of abuse by Muhammad being a factor in his
wife's death ``very remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief deputy coroner Frances Kelly said ``detectives are
investigating that issue'' of possible further domestic violence
before Nichole entered the hospital. ``But as of now,'' said Kelly,
``there is nothing to substantiate any contact other than verbal
since the (alleged physical) abuse. We're waiting for the final
autopsy to verify the preliminary report. Only if it showed
something different'' would the coroner's office continue the
probe, ``and we don't anticipate that being the case. As of now,
there's no plausible explanation other than the steering wheel''
causing the fatality.
</P>
<P>
   But that would not end Steve Muhammad's legal problems. Marion
County Prosecutor's Office spokeswoman Beverly Phillips emphasized
that her department's investigation is ongoing into the battery
charges, for which Muhammad faces a Dec. 21 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Colts officials were speaking Wednesday after
maintaining a staunch ``no comment'' policy regarding Muhammad.
Vice president of public relations Craig Kelley vehemently denied
Garrison's claim that one of his staffers had informed the Colts of
Muhammad's arrest four days after it occurred _ specifically, when
Nichole Muhammad first contacted the lawyer about the possibility
of filing for legal separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in our football operations was contacted by Mr.
Garrison's office,'' said Kelley, who also denied Nichole
Muhammad's charge, relayed by her counsel, that her husband had
been fined $10,000 by the team. Garrison said Tuesday he was
uncertain of the veracity of the allegation, and Kelley said
Wednesday, ``There was no $10,000 fine.'' Efforts to reach Garrison
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Muhammad's teammates were trying not to let their
concern override the demands of doing their job. Doing it well _
and enhancing their surprise contender status in the AFC East _ may
be cathartic for their stricken teammate, according to practice
squad offensive tackle Paul Snellings: ``As much as we hate what
happened, in a way, it may help him for us to win, keep the season
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other Colts declined to comment on the issue; among the
14 players approached, none said he was aware of any domestic
problems with the Muhammads.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no minimizing the sense of mourning and the
dichotomy it creates. Wide receiver Isaac Jones believes the team
showed its solidarity when ``a lot of guys went to see Steve at the
hospital'' soon after coach Jim Mora announced the deaths following
the Colts' 25-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday. ``I
think it helped that he knew everybody was with him, everybody
cared for him,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Mora told the Indianapolis media that Muhammad can set his own
timetable for returning, that he is under no pressure from the
team.

LEARNING CO. EXECUTIVES EXIT ABRUPTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Educational software maker Learning Co. is in the market for a
new chairman and president. The two men who occupied these posts
abruptly left Wednesday, less than a month after parent Mattel Inc.
blamed slow sales at its Cambridge, Mass. unit for disappointing
third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   Replacements have not been chosen for chairman Michael Perik and
president Kevin O'Leary. Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth refused to
reveal the exact reason for their departures, and said the company
planned to hire only one person to replace the two men. ``We plan
to have one person to lead the company,'' said Bozarth. ``We
haven't decided what the title will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel acquired Learning Co. in May for $3.6 billion. Learning
Co. is the leading maker of educational software, including the
Carmen Sandiego line. It also sells the popular computer games Myst
and Riven. Mattel hoped the Learning Co. acquisition would
strengthen its existing software product line.
</P>
<P>
   But so far it hasn't worked that way. Mattel's third-quarter net
income fell to $135.3 million, down from $233.8 million the year
before, and Mattel CEO Jill Barad predicted that annual earnings
would be between 70 and 80 cents a share this year, compared to
$1.20 last year, and far below previous estimates of 95 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason, Barad said, was poor performance at Learning
Co., which had been expected to show a $50 million profit, but
actually turned in a $105 million loss. This loss was mainly blamed
on the failure of an expected licensing agreement between Learning
Co. and an unidentified firm, and on disruptions caused by an
overhaul of Learning Co.'s distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel officials issued an earnings warning in October. At the
time, Bozarth said Mattel headquarters staff had been kept in the
dark about problems at Learning Co. until the third quarter was
nearly over. Bozarth said Mattel would launch ``a complete
organizational review'' to find out how this could have happened.
But he wouldn't say whether the departures of Perik and O'Leary are
a result of this review.
</P>
<P>
   Those moving up include Cindy Hudson, former executive vice
president of the home software division of Learning Co. Hudson will
now serve as senior vice president of productivity and learning
products. Amy Boylan, a product development executive for Mattel
Media will become senior vice president of entertainment products
and Francesca Luzuriaga, former executive vice president of
worldwide business planning for Mattel Inc. will become chief
operating officer of Mattel Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders have questioned the wisdom of Mattel's decision to
acquire Learning Co. The Center for Financial Research and Analysis
in Rockville, Md. has reported that Learning Co. was experiencing
slow sales and an increase in accounts receivable _ money not yet
received from customers.
</P>
<P>
   And before the acquisition, the Mattel board and the company's
investment banker, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., thought it might be
necessary to reprice the deal after Learning Co. restated its
financial results, reducing the net income attributed to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel stock rose 1/8 to 13 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    Irene-damaged grapefuit crop will mean higher prices
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government lowered its forecast for this year's grapefruit
crop by 8 percent Wednesday, adjusting the numbers to account for
fruit damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Irene.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects Florida groves to
produce 46 million 85-pound boxes of grapefruit this season, down
from last month's forecast of 50 million boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment is more good news for grapefruit growers, who
have seen prices for juice fruit rise 20 percent since the storm
swept through Oct. 15-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outstanding,'' said Chuck Walsey, general manager
of Indian Trail Groves near Loxahatchee. ``It's about time the
grower started getting some returns on juice fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's prediction of a tighter crop is expected to nudge
juice prices even higher and boost prices for fresh grapefruit,
which inexplicably have dropped slightly since the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit mystified, to tell you the truth,'' said Nat
Roberts, general manager of Callery-Judge Grove, which has 4,000
acres west of Royal Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the USDA's Florida Agricultural Statistics Service
sent a special team to survey grapefruit groves, whose large, heavy
fruit is easily blown from trees.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will wait until its Dec. 10 review of the initial
USDA crop estimate _ released Oct. 8 _ to issue any revisions to
the orange crop forecast.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County, which is home to 47,000 of the state's 121,000
acres of grapefruit groves, is the state's largest grapefruit
grower. Indian River County is No. 2 with 32,000 acres; Martin and
Palm Beach counties have 4,000 acres and 2,000 acres, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm went right through that area,'' said Bob Terry,
agricultural statistics administrator for the Florida Agricultural
Statistics Service. ``That's why it had such a large effect on the
state's total production.''

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced an undercover sting
operation Wednesday intended to take away the cabs of drivers who
refuse to pick up minority passengers. His decision came less than
a week after the actor Danny Glover complained that several New
York taxi drivers refused to pick him up because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, also aimed at cabbies who refuse to take
passengers to places they want to go, usually minority
neighborhoods, is to begin Friday at 7 a.m. with 150 police
officers and taxi inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are perfectly entitled to do this,'' Giuliani said at a
news conference. ``I know we're going to get the same howls and
screams and yells that we got when we did this with drunk
drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the mayor announced that the police would seize the
cars of people arrested on charges of driving while drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani described the crackdown on taxi drivers as a toughening
of two existing but only nominally successful undercover efforts,
both called Operation Refusal, one run by the Police Department,
the other by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Both have issued
summonses against the drivers, but neither has taken away any cabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do,'' the mayor said, ``is intensify it
dramatically in order to make the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Several black officials praised the mayor's decision, including
State Sen. David A. Paterson, a Harlem resident who has said he has
been forced out of cabs more than 100 times because his destination
was Harlem, Wednesday complimented the mayor's decision as ``very
proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glover's lawyer, Randolph M. Scott-McLaughlin, immediately
criticized it as rong approach'' and a ``Band-Aid'' on a
longstanding problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the police to demonize the drivers is not the approach
that Danny Glover wishes to take,'' said Scott-McLaughlin, the
director of the Pace Law School Social Justice Center. Glover, a
star of the ``Lethal Weapon'' series, ``Beloved,'' and other films,
was in Senegal Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Scott-McLaughlin said the taxi commission should instead
increase its diversity training for drivers, many of them recent
immigrants who, taxi officials say, have distorted images of
America and attitudes rooted in the social stratification of their
native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the new operation, police officers and taxi inspectors will
work undercover in multiracial groups of three. As a supervisor
observes, a black officer and a white officer standing near each
other will attempt to hail a cab. If the black person is passed up
in favor of the white person, something blacks say happens all the
time, the driver will be issued a summons on the spot suspending
his hack license.
</P>
<P>
   The police will then take the cab to the nearest police station,
where it is to be picked up by either the taxi owner or another
licensed driver.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended driver is then to have a hearing before an
administrative law judge within five days. Allan Fromberg, the
commission's spokesman, said Wednesday that a driver with a clean
record would probably get the license back immediately, but would
still have to face a separate hearing at the taxi commission on the
charge of refusing to pick up a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi commission's penalty for a first offense is $200 to
$350. A third offense calls for a mandatory revocation of a hack
license. ``The drivers clearly know that refusal is against the
law,'' said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the taxi commissioner. ``And
this is the Giuliani administration's attempt to ratchet that up so
people understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said the enhanced Operation Refusal,
as the new joint effort is called, would not seize cars in the same
way that the Police Department takes vehicles from drunken drivers.
Under that program, cars are only returned after an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply taking the car for safe-keeping,'' Ms.
McGrath-McKechnie said, adding that the owner would be notified
immediately so that the taxi could get back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson asked why it took Glover to get the mayor to act,
particularly when even former Mayor David N. Dinkins has complained
that he was refused a ride because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's who it happened to, or the political
climate,'' Paterson said. ``I hear he might be interested in a
Senate race.'' Giuliani is expected to announce his candidacy for
the U.S. Senate next year against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure, we should have done this earlier,'' Giuliani said
at his news conference. ``Probably we should have done it three
years ago, five years ago, but also it should have been done seven
years ago, and eight years ago, and ten years ago, and 12 years
ago, and 15 years ago. So, you can keep using that excuse forever.
This is a good time to do it. It got a great deal of attention
because it involved a person of great notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Under taxi commission rules, drivers may not refuse passengers
based on race, religion or their destinations within the city. But
the rules allow drivers to refuse passengers who are ``disorderly
or intoxicated,'' who have an animal ``not properly secured'' in a
kennel case, or who smoke in the cab. &QL;

DOW OFF 19.58, NASDAQ AT NEW HIGH, IN MIXED SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks resumed a mostly upward course Wednesday as
enthusiasm for technology issues overcame some early nervousness
about the government's latest figures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index, its streak of seven straight records
broken Tuesday, scaled a new peak Wednesday, gaining 30.92 points,
or nearly 1 percent, to 3,155.96.
</P>
<P>
   A surprisingly strong profit report from Cisco Systems set the
tone, analysts said, helping to lift three initial offerings of
Internet companies to huge gains. United Parcel Service, the
biggest initial offering ever, also moved to a handsome premium.
Cisco rose 5\, to 79 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum still rules,'' said Byron Wien, chief U.S. strategist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The technology stocks are
dominant, but a lot of other things are not participating.''
</P>
<P>
   More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was almost exactly balanced
between winners and losers. The index advanced 8.18 points, or 0.6
percent, to 1,373.46.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average _
which rebounded from an 81-point decline to finish with a loss of
19.58 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,597.74 _ 18 stocks fell while
11 rose and one was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks climbed for the
11th consecutive session, gaining 2.44 points, or 0.55 percent, to
448.72.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's report that core producer prices rose 0.3
percent in October, more than expected, weighed on stocks and
contributed to a modest upturn in long-term interest rates,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's impact, however, was diminished because much of the
increase was in motor vehicles, an area of statistical difficulty
because of varying introduction dates of new models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really change the basic balance of the evidence''
for the Federal Reserve when its policy committee meets Tuesday,
said Richard Hoey, chief economist at Dreyfus Corp. Whether the Fed
decides to raise short-term interest rates to slow the economy
remains, he said, ``a very close call.''
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Calvin Schnure of Chase Securities and until
recently a Fed staff economist, called the inflation data ``not
friendly'' but not a big negative, either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors swarmed to the day's new issues, bidding up
shares of Expedia, the online travel agent owned by Microsoft, to
53{ from 14 after trading as high as 65~. Next Level
Communications, a maker of software for telephone companies that is
majority-owned by General Instrument, soared to 51 from 20 after
trading as high as 66. And iBasis, which operates a network for
international phone calls, surged to 40\ from 16. All three
companies are currently losing money.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest initial offering on record, United Parcel jumped
to 68[ from 50, with 80.8 million shares changing hands, nearly
twice as many as the day's second-most-active issue, Charter
Communications, up 2\, at 25.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, paced by 2-point gains for Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products, were one of the strongest nontechnology
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,644 issues fell while 1,420
rose and 118 hit new 52-week lows compared with 71 new highs.
Volume swelled to 984.8 million shares.

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, PART II? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ To be drawn to the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship at the Thomas &AMP;
Mack Arena on Saturday night, boxing fans must have a short memory
and deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters and the fighters are saying forget that the first
bout was a stinker in terms of ring performances, forget that the
controversial draw resolved nothing in the heavyweight division and
plunk down $49.95 for the pay-per-view on TVKO Saturday night to
see it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be no reason not to,'' Holyfield said when asked
whether he would spend money to watch this fight based on his
performance in the first fight. ``My reputation speaks for itself.
I'm like the stock market, I go up and down. But I've had less dips
than most fighters. This might be one of my greatest fights ever.''
</P>
<P>
   What might sound like a tip on the latest Internet stock has
considerable weight coming from Holyfield (36-3-1), whose
reputation as a warrior was established in a brutal rematch with
Riddick Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere surrounding this fight is much different than it
was around the first fight. The sport was on an upswing before the
March 13 date. Oscar De La Hoya, Ike Quartey, Felix Trinidad and
Pernell Whitaker had put on a thrilling pair of welterweight
matches and De La Hoya and Trinidad were on course for a
much-anticipated championship showdown. Holyfield-Lewis was the
first major heavyweight bout at Madison Square Garden in more than
two decades. Tickets had been sold out for months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sport is staggering again, given its first low blow by
the controversial draw between Holyfield and Lewis. The much-hyped
De La Hoya-Trinidad bout was a farce. Mike Tyson was involved in
another debacle, hitting Orlin Norris after the bell and prompting
a no-contest when Norris couldn't continue after he injured his
knee when he fell. And last week Robert W. Lee, president of the
International Boxing Federation, and three other officials of the
organization were indicted on federal conspiracy and racketeering
charges in an alleged scheme to rig rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter Don King said ``irrespective and irregardless of
the ills of boxing,'' the Holyfield-Lewis fight should stand on its
own merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be hype that sells this fight,'' King said.
``The fight will sell the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   King and others involved in promoting the fight believe the two
fighters will feel compelled to come out throwing punches to make
up for their horrendous performances from the last fight. But
there's no guarantee that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1-1) contradicted himself Wednesday afternoon, at
first saying he did not feel the need to be foolhardy and ditch the
conservative approach that he used in the first fight, and later
saying he was going to come out in the first round and attack
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   King has been crisscrossing the country hyping the fight, but
the news conference at the Las Vegas Hilton Wednesday afternoon was
low-key for a Don King production. It lasted less than an hour. The
only drama was a coin toss between Holyfield and Lewis to determine
who would be introduced first and who would enter the ring first on
fight night. Holyfield won the toss and will enter second.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the two fighters did their best to put some heat to the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already feel like I'm the undisputed champion,'' Holyfield
said. ``I just have to pick up my belt on Saturday night. No
offense to Lennox, but ain't nothing wrong with being second
best.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Compaq to offer $499 PC
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. Wednesday announced a stripped-down,
Internet-driven PC for corporate customers that will sell for $499.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the slender new PC, Compaq said its new iPaq is
the first of a family of PC and hand-held devices designed to keep
users conveniently connected to the Internet. It also carries a
burden of helping rebuild the company's corporate business, where
it has given up ground to Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make up 10-15 percent of our volume next year,''
predicted Mike Winkler, senior vice president of Compaq's
commercial PC group. The group accounts for nearly one-third of
Compaq's business, but suffered a 12 percent drop in sales in the
third quarter and lost $169 million.
</P>
<P>
   The iPaq will be built-to-order whether customers buy it through
one of Compaq's traditional resellers or over the Internet from the
Houston-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq expects to be the first computer maker to ship a PC built
primarily for Internet usage when iPaq rolls off the assembly line
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard Co., in a move that Compaq officials said was an
attempt to upstage Wednesday's announcement, said Monday it will
ship test versions of its ePC next spring, with commercial
production to follow by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has teased the industry with glimpses of a Web-PC prototype
since September. The company says it will formally announce the
machine, code-named Webster, late this month. Round Rock-based Dell
hasn't said when the machine would be shipped to customers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also expects to offer a Internet-based PC early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is wide agreement that businesses and large
corporate customers will welcome simplified computers built
specifically for the Internet, no one is certain about how big the
market will be. It's not expected to displace the PC as the central
computing device.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 20 years of increasing power on the desktop, I doubt
very much that users are going to consent to losing power,'' said
Bill Milton, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate customers have complained for years about
vendors' practice of pushing regular upgrades once they have
settled on a certain model that may take a year or more to install
throughout far-flung offices.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq promises its iPac will have a 12-month life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Both Compaq and HP's products will run Pentium III processors
and either Windows 2000 or NT, making them fully functional PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't be expanded or upgraded. Moreover, they will come
standard with USB, or universal serial bus, ports for peripherals,
a further industry move toward relegating so-called ``legacy''
connections like PCI and ISA expansion slots to obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants that legacy stuff,'' said David Wu of ABM Amro, a
securities firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Floppy-disk drives, another standard feature since the early
1980s, also will be missing.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer Inc.'s iMac was the first computer to ditch the
floppy drive and to promote USB as the standard peripheral port.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Compaq announced an Internet-based partnership
with Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., American Express and other to
help businesses handle administrative tasks and solve technical
problems.

NO FATAL MECHANICAL PROBLEMS FOUND IN AIRLINER CRASH, PRELIMINARY
ANALYSIS SHOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A preliminary analysis of the flight data recorder
from EgyptAir Flight 990 found no fatal mechanical problems aboard
the aircraft, at least until perhaps five or 10 seconds before its
final plunge into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 217 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said
Wednesday that the recorder, recovered a day earlier from the ocean
floor off Massachusetts, indicates that the flight was uneventful
until the autopilot disengaged and the Boeing 767 began a
controlled descent.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing from the recorder so far indicates that a thrust
reverser was erroneously deployed or that the aircraft reached
supersonic speed as some experts had speculated, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, data recorded from the final ``five
or 10 seconds'' of the flight was still being analyzed. He declined
to disclose what the preliminary examination turned up about the
aircraft's final moments.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder _ one of two so-called black boxes aboard the
aircraft _ captures information from on-board systems that govern
155 separate functions, including airspeed, altitude, descent or
climb rate, and electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy deep-sea probe recovered the data recorder early Tuesday
in about 250 feet of water where the ocean floor was littered with
wreckage from the Cairo-bound aircraft that plunged from the sky
less than 40 minutes after take-off from New York early Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, whose team of investigators examined the data recorder
overnight, said the information indicates the aircraft appeared to
be cruising normally at 33,000 feet a half-hour after take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first event we note is the autopilot disconnecting. About
eight seconds later, the airplane begins what appears to be a
controlled descent,'' Hall said. A controlled descent normally
means the flight crew has command of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data recovered so far indicates the airplane descending to
about 19,000 feet. We are still in the process of recovering data
from the remaining five to 10 seconds'' of the tape, he said,
declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the analysis was preliminary, Hall said
information from the data recorder appears to confirm what was
detected by radar centers along the East Coast as Flight 990 began
its plummet.
</P>
<P>
   The radar facilities reported to investigators that after the
aircraft had descended to less than 17,000 feet, it suddenly pulled
up to about 24,000 feet before plunging again and apparently
breaking up at an altitude of about 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of thrust-reverser deployment in the data
we have,'' Hall said, referring to engine equipment that is used to
help slow an airplane after landing. One of the Boeing 767's
reversers was out of service at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the initial drop to 19,000 feet, Hall said, ``the
aircraft does not appear to have reached supersonic speed.''
</P>
<P>
   A cockpit voice recorder, still encased in the Flight 990
wreckage, could shed more light on the possible cause of the crash,
Hall said. Navy efforts to recover the second recorder about 60
miles off Nantucket, Mass., were hampered Wednesday by heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said an international committee was being organized to
review data from the recorders. The team includes investigators
from the NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration, Egyptian
authorities, Boeing, and Pratt and Whitney, the company that made
the aircraft's two engines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a deactivation pin in a thrust reverser on a Lauda Air
AG Boeing 767 jet failed mid-flight, causing an accidental
deployment of the reverser before the plane crashed in Thailand,
killing 223 people.

 WASHINGTON: emergency descent.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   About eight seconds after the autopilot disconnection, he said,
``the airplane begins what appears to be a controlled descent.'' In
cruise flight at authorized altitude, the plane would ordinarily
not change altitude without asking permission from air traffic
controllers, something that the crew did not do.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder quit capturing data late in the dive
but not at the end, when investigators say the plane pitched back
up, climbed more than a mile and a half, and then plunged again.
The last six or seven seconds of data has not yet been read from
the tape, according to people involved in the investigation,
because the tape itself, which resembles what is used in a standard
tape recorder, is contaminated by metals it picked up from the
spindles and the recording heads while it was under water. However,
the investigators are confident that they can eventually decipher
the data.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing by Hall seemed only to emphasize the need to
retrieve the other ``black box,'' the cockpit voice recorder, which
experts said could capture the sound of an explosion or mechanical
failure, or a discussion among people in the cockpit about the
reason for the descent. While it began as a controlled descent,
radar data indicates it later became faster than what the airplane
is designed for. Investigators said on Wednesday, however, that
they think it did not become supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash scene, the Navy has pulled back one ship and plans
to withdraw three more, including the Grapple, which is the support
ship for one of the robotic submarines, because seas are expected
to be too rough on Thursday for them to work. Instead, search
officials plan to re-supply them on Thursday and send then back out
in time to work on Friday, when smoother seas are predicted. A
commercial vessel, the Carolyn Choueains on site with
another robot submarine, and will work ``as long as weather
conditions permit,'' Hall said.

 &HT;    Home Depot wood policy has Canada worried
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forestry officials from British Columbia are trying to work out
an understanding with Home Depot that would protect the Canadian
province's lumber industry.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows Home Depot's recent decision to phase out
products made from endangered wood by 2002. The policy ended the
company's battle with environmentalists concerned about the sale of
``old growth'' wood.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is the largest wood retailer in the world and a key
customer of Canadian lumber companies. British Columbia, which
produces half of Canada's lumber, fears its economy could be
adversely affected by the retailer's new policy because much of its
woodland is considered endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of misinformation out there, and our main
problem is going to be communication,'' said David Zirnhelt,
British Columbia's minister of forests who was in Atlanta on
Wednesday. ``We think our government should have a chance to
critique this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said it welcomes input from public and private groups
in working out concerns about its new policy.
</P>
<P>
   In visits to Washington and then to Atlanta, Zirnhelt and his
colleagues met with Home Depot and forestry advisers to discuss the
issue. One main point of contention is Home Depot's definition of
endangered forests and where they are located.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer is relying on research from the World Resources
Institute, a nonprofit environmental group in Washington. The
institute's initial projections virtually blacklisted British
Columbia forests, said Larry Pedersen, assistant deputy minister of
British Columbia forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the map work that they showed us was clearly not an
accurate depiction,'' Pedersen said. The institute has agreed to
work with the British Columbian government to come up with a more
accurate map, Pedersen said. But that issue, coupled with the lack
of an international standard for certification, has Zirnhelt
worried that Canadian companies won't be able to meet Home Depot's
two-year deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry is currently working on a set of certification
standards that meet Home Depot's policy, but they won't be ready
for at least one year. The certification process itself, which
involves ensuring lumber is responsibly harvested, typically takes
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Zirnhelt said he wants Home Depot to consider using alternative
guidelines. Home Depot, however, said it's too early to say whether
it will modify its policy. Suzanne Apple, vice president of
community affairs, said the company is working closely with vendors
to help them meet the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is that they show improvement over time,'' Apple
said. ``We don't expect them to flip a switch to be in
compliance.''

MARKET PLACE: FORD PREPARING FOR DIVESTITURE OF ITS PARTS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(lh) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. recently overcame its most contentious
union negotiations in decades by finessing an agreement over the
future of workers at its giant auto parts unit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that pact is about to be put to the test. Ford Motor is on
the verge of formally announcing the divestiture of the unit,
Visteon Automotive Systems, and on Friday it plans to name Ford's
longtime labor czar, Peter J. Pestillo, as the new company's
chairman and chief executive, according to a Ford executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's current plan is to divest itself of Visteon all at once,
most likely by the middle of next year, the company executive said.
The divestiture could take the form of a spinoff to Ford
shareholders or of an initial public offering of the entire unit,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Pestillo, 61, is expected to help Visteon's
prospects. The current president and chief executive of the unit,
Craig H. Muhlhauser, is virtually unknown to Wall Street, auto
analysts noted. Muhlauser will retain the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford has deliberately kept a low profile because of union
issues,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Lehman
Brothers. ``But when they do go public, they are, I'm sure, aware
that they need a strong message and a strong leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, in the course of the knock-down, drag-out talks with
the United Automobile Workers union, Ford signaled its intention to
make Visteon independent. The talks were eventually resolved with
an agreement to safeguard workers in the event of a divestiture.
The unusual arrangement requires Ford to keep Visteon's 23,500
unionized workers on its payroll even if Visteon becomes an
independent company and to issue paychecks and pensions for those
current Visteon workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Visteon have not yet agreed on how the process would
work _ whether Visteon would reimburse Ford for its blue-collar
payroll expenses, or whether Ford might simply receive lower-priced
auto parts because it footed the bill for much of the labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo, currently Ford's vice chairman and chief of staff, is
particularly close to William C. Ford, a great-grandson of Henry
Ford and president of Ford Motor. And Pestillo is considered a
master at labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has had the best labor relations in the industry for two
decades. Unlike General Motors and the former Chrysler, Ford has
managed to downsize the company's work force without costly
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo would retain his titles at Ford until just before a
Visteon spinoff or public offering, and would retire from his Ford
posts at that point, the Ford executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo refused to comment on the matter, as did Jim Cain, a
Ford spokesman. Denise C. Bither, a Visteon spokeswoman, would say
only that ``we are looking at a number of options that would give
Visteon a greater level of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ford pursues a public offering, it will be huge. Visteon had
$17.8 billion in revenue last year, and it has 77,000 employees
worldwide. (United Parcel Service, with $24.8 billion in 1998
revenue, raised $5.47 billion on Tuesday in the biggest initial
public offering in history.)
</P>
<P>
   Pestillo's approach to labor relations has been studied by
companies in a wide range on industries and praised by Wall Street,
which is better known for favoring union-busting. After a strike
shut down GM last year, costing it $2 billion, for example, Wall
Street analysts publicly campaigned for GM to hire Pestillo away
from Ford, by offering any amount of money to win him.
</P>
<P>
   As Visteon's leader, Pestillo will need smooth relations to calm
workers' concerns about parting from Ford. The issue is extremely
emotional, and volatile, for Visteon workers, some of whom remain
unhappy with Ford's plans to spin off their company, despite the
terms of the latest labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   By spinning off Visteon, Ford would be following in the path of
General Motors, which spun off its Delphi Automotive Systems auto
parts unit in May. The logic behind the deals was that the
divestitures would allow automakers to focus on their core
businesses while allowing the auto parts units to flourish by
selling parts to Toyota, Honda, DaimlerChrysler and other auto
companies, not just to their parent companies.
</P>
<P>
   As Ford prepares to divest itself of Visteon, GM is quietly
preparing to spin off another unit, Hughes Electronics. The move is
much anticipated by Wall Street because of the relatively high
valuation of Hughes, which trades as a tracking stock, and the
relatively low valuation of GM More than half the value of GM
stock, which closed on Wednesday at $70.9375, up $1.6875, is
attributable to its Hughes subsidiary, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning off Hughes would be ``like a 55-percent-off sale, so it
is a big win for shareholders,'' said David Bradley, an auto
analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

pedigree, that draws surrporters to Bush is a common characteristic
among voters who turned up to see the Texas governor at events in
South Carolina on Tuesday and today. It was also a theme reflected
in a new New York Times poll, which suggested that Bush's support
was less firmly tethered to any specific knowledge about his
positions on issues than the support for other prominent
presidential candidates in both parties was. (Stephen Crowley/New

around the entry door, has a short life span because the doors are

weatherstripping until it no longer forms an effective seal.

VICK HAS HOKIES NO. 1 IN HIGHLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most 14-year-olds aspiring to be college football stars,
Michael Vick thought ``big time'' meant Florida State, Penn State
or Notre Dame. So one afternoon, sunk into his couch and racing
through television channels with the remote control, he barely
paused when he came across the maroon-and-white uniforms of a team
called the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is Virginia Tech?'' he remembers thinking of the in-state
team he should have recognized as a native of Newport News. ``Then
I kept flicking through the channels. I didn't think of them as a
top-notch program.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he does. And largely because of him, the rest of the college
football world is slowly catching on. Vick is the freshman
quarterback of an undefeated team that is threatening to bring the
national championship trophy to Blacksburg, Va. On Saturday, the
Hokies, ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press news media poll, No. 4
in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll and No. 4 by the New York Times
computer, will take on Miami at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies were very good long before Vick came along: they have
61 victories against 19 losses since 1993 and have been to six
straight bowl games. But stingy defense and blocked kicks (they
have 63 of them in the '90s) are hardly the stuff of highlight
reels. It's Vick who has taken Virginia Tech to the top of the
sports telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener against James Madison, the 6-foot-1-inch,
212-pound Vick leaped over a defender and into the end zone with a
near-perfect flip. At Rutgers on Oct. 9, he was 11 of 12 for 248
yards and 4 touchdowns, and ran for 68 yards and another score _
all in one half. Against visiting Syracuse one week later, he
commanded a devastating 62-0 shutout.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, last Saturday, Vick drove the Hokies 58 yards in
the final minute to set up Shayne Graham's 44-yard field goal to
beat West Virginia, 22-20, at Morgantown. The march began at the
Hokies' 15-yard line with these words from Vick to his offensive
teammates: ``These guys can't stop us. Let's take the ball
downfield. If you want it, let's go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the signature play of the drive, Vick took advantage of the
fear his quick-draw left arm inspires, as well as of his field
savvy and sprinter's speed. He drifted to the sideline, appeared
ready to accept a short gain, then motored upfield 26 yards to the
Mountaineers' 36-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this kid is the furthest along of any freshman
quarterback that I've seen in this league,'' said West Virginia
Coach Don Nehlen, who for the previous four years marveled at the
former Syracuse star Donovan McNabb. ``It's amazing for me to say
this. I think he's got a better release. A quicker release, and it
seems to be more accurate. That's kind of scary when you think
McNabb's in the pros.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Orangemen worked hard to bring Vick to Syracuse to
take over for McNabb. But Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer labored
to bring him to Blacksburg. As it happened, Vick at age 14 wasn't
as much of a big-time prospect as he thought and spent his high
school years overshadowed by another Virginia quarterback, Ronald
Curry, who now plays for North Carolina. So, eventually, the
question ``Who is Virginia Tech?'' became ``Who is Michael Vick?''
He decided that he didn't want to be the next Donovan McNabb and
committed to Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a name for myself and not play in someone's
shadow,'' Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Beamer redshirted Vick so he could learn the offense
from the senior starter Al Clark. Vick spent countless hours in the
film room and stayed by Clark's side on road trips. He not only
learned patience, but also the kind of preparation that makes him
seem older than a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just game-plan myself to death,'' he said. ``I don't want to
be frustrated and not know not what's going on out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick also received a lesson in humility from the Hokies'
all-America defensive end Corey Moore. During his first practice as
a freshman, Vick dropped back only to have Moore in front of him
before he could even plant his feet to pass. It was a memorable
introduction. ``This game isn't easy,'' he remembered Moore telling
him. Vick added: ``Looking in his eyes kind of scared me. That's
when I started to take the game more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick started the season slowly _ his acrobatics at home against
James Madison cost him a sprained ankle and he missed the next game
against Alabama-Birmingham. He returned for Clemson, but threw
three interceptions in the Hokies' 20-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't tossed one since, however, and is the nation's No.
3-rated quarterback in passing efficiency behind the Heisman
contenders Joe Hamilton of Georgia Tech and Chad Pennington of
Marshall. Vick has thrown for 1,228 yards and 7 touchdowns, has run
for 5 more and has averaged 4.76 yards a carry. ``Our offense has
gotten better, quicker because of him,'' Beamer said. ``The only
thing he needs is experience. He's getting better and maturing each
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies are so in awe of Vick's talent and leadership that
Moore, his onetime intimidator, tells any reporter within earshot
that the freshman should win Heisman Trophy this season. Vick
doesn't think so _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a compliment, and maybe somewhere down the road,'' he
said. ``I'm so young and have too much to learn about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Vick is focused on a Miami team the Hokies have
beaten four consecutive years. He confessed that he and his
teammates were irritated that the Bowl Championship Series ranking
has Tennessee _ with one loss (7-1) _ in the No. 2 slot, with 8-0
Virginia Tech No. 3. That means that if the season ended today, the
Volunteers would play Florida State for the national title in the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Assked them at age 14, the questions remain: Who is
Virginia Tech? Is it a top-notch program? ``We can't really worry
about that,'' he said. ``All we can do is win and see what happens
at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, one thing seems certain: As long as Vick
remains in college, Virginia Tech's maroon-and-white uniforms are
certain to stop channel surfers.

among voters who turned up to see the Texas governor at events in

in a new New York Times poll, which suggested that Bush's support
was less firmly tethered to any specific knowledge about his
positions on issues than the support for other prominent
presidential candidates in both parties was. (Stephen Crowley/New

1960s, the O-Matic revolution was at its peak; the Food Glamorizer
paring knife was an accessory to the Veg-O-Matic of 1963. Taking
his sales pitch to television in 1958, Ronald M. Popeil
revolutionized his family's business. Four decades on, he can still

pungent overlay of sideshow, cook-out, carny and revival meeting.
Tabletop gadget demonstrations there were the forerunner of the

People wait to greet Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday during his
campaign stop. Inability to pinpoint anything, beyond family
pedigree, that draws surrporters to Bush is a common characteristic
among voters who turned up to see the Texas governor at events in
South Carolina on Tuesday and today. It was also a theme reflected
in a new New York Times poll, which suggested that Bush's support
was less firmly tethered to any specific knowledge about his
positions on issues than the support for other prominent
presidential candidates in both parties was. (Stephen Crowley/New

-- Weatherstripping is designed to close the gaps around the
perimeter of doors and windows so the warm interior air cannot
escape to the outside. Weatherstripping around doors, particularly
around the entry door, has a short life span because the doors are
used every day. Opening and closing a door wears the
weatherstripping until it no longer forms an effective seal.

Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, advocates legislation to give consumers more

1970s brought America the Egg Scrambler, which purportedly mixed
eggs in the shell and was one of the Popeils' more dubious
inventions. The phrase ``as seen on TV'' entered the language
during this period. (David W. Dunlap/New York Times Photo)

1960s, the O-Matic revolution was at its peak; the Food Glamorizer
paring knife was an accessory to the Veg-O-Matic of 1963. Taking
his sales pitch to television in 1958, Ronald M. Popeil
revolutionized his family's business. Four decades on, he can still
be seen in infomercials. (David W. Dunlap/New York Times Photo)

the Toastette. The Popeils' household gadgets - and the commercials
that sold millions of them - are becoming the stuff of civic lore.

in plastic. The Popeils' empire was born a half century ago in a
gritty pushcart market southwest of the Chicago Loop, with a
pungent overlay of sideshow, cook-out, carny and revival meeting.

People wait to greet Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday during his
campaign stop. Inability to pinpoint anything, beyond family
pedigree, that draws surrporters to Bush is a common characteristic
among voters who turned up to see the Texas governor at events in
South Carolina on Tuesday and today. It was also a theme reflected
in a new New York Times poll, which suggested that Bush's support
was less firmly tethered to any specific knowledge about his
positions on issues than the support for other prominent
presidential candidates in both parties was. (Stephen Crowley/New

-- Weatherstripping is designed to close the gaps around the
perimeter of doors and windows so the warm interior air cannot
escape to the outside. Weatherstripping around doors, particularly
around the entry door, has a short life span because the doors are
used every day. Opening and closing a door wears the
weatherstripping until it no longer forms an effective seal.

GOP CANDIDATES BATTLE FOR VETERANS' VOTES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ As the nation prepares to honor its warriors,
the leading Republican presidential candidates are battling for
veterans' votes in this key primary state.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush, who made a quick
stop Wednesday to speak to a military group, is hoping to fend off
a spirited challenge by former war hero John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush still leads in the polls here, McCain has been
inching up partly because of support from veterans and others who
admire his military record. McCain's Navy plane was shot down over
North Vietnam and he spent five years as a prisoner of war in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush joined the Texas Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Veterans Day, Bush hoped to convince those who
served in the military that he was on their side.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush announced his Veterans for Bush Leadership
Team, a group of 15 New Hampshire veterans led by a recipient who
received the Distinguished Flying Cross. On Thursday, the Bush
campaign touted the endorsement of Dwight Lorenz, a retired
lieutenant colonel and former McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, state GOP activist and Bush supporter, questioned the
ability of veterans' groups to mobilize support. He said many
retired veterans spend the winter in warmer climates and may not be
so easy to round up for the Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke at a dinner sponsored by the Granite
State chapter of the Association of the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner attended by about 400 soldiers and veterans and
their families Bush spoke about the need to strengthen the nation's
military as he did earlier this week in South Carolina and said he
supported increasing health benefits for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush helped give four Soldier of the Year awards to four New
Hamsphire men.
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Chris Ager said Bush was invited because the board of
directors wanted someone ``who would be the most interesting
speaker that the membership would like to hear from.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that McCain addressed the group two years ago. Ager
also said Bush's National Guard service would not hurt him with a
crowd that included many former Guardsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't give the National Guard the respect it deserves.
It is part of the military,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Bush admitted that McCain's experience as a prisoner of
war was a ``compelling story'' that made him a formidable rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it's going to be hard. I understand that. He's a
strong veteran,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will also be making the rounds of veterans' events
Thursday in the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Chevalier, former state commander of the state Veterans of
Foreign Wars and a McCain supporter, said that there is no
comparison between the two men's military credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain was a war hero. Bush was in the National Guard. He
never left the state,'' Chevalier said.
</P>
<P>
   Chevalier said McCain has aggressively wooed the state's
estimated 130,000 veterans by speaking frequently about issues of
interest to them, such as military pay. He noted that McCain was
the only presidential candidate who accepted an invitation to speak
at a state VFW convention last June.
</P>
<P>
   The VFW will not endorse a presidential candidate, but it will
run phone banks and other get-out-the-vote efforts, said VFW state
adjutant Dana Hussey.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's interest in veterans, he said, was a ``little too late.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also stressed his military background in television
commercials playing in the state that highlight his Vietnam
experience and include footage of him as a POW and later walking
through Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial caused a minor flap when military officials said
that McCain had not sought permission to film in the military
cemetery and that Army regulations prohibit using the cemetery for
partisan purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinksy said the campaign will continue
to air the commercials. McCain, his aides say, was there visiting
the graves of his father and grandfather, both admirals, and that
the camera crew captured the routine visit.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 campaign is the first in which all presidential
candidates were shaped by the 1960s and the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore is also running ads
that note his service in Vietnam, where he was an army journalist,
but Gore has also talked about his opposition to the war and the
alienation he felt when he returned to the States, a common feeling
among Vietnam veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Vietnam War was a far less clear-cut mission than
World War II, military service is no longer a requirement for
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton survived attacks for avoiding service in
Vietnam. And a number of other presidential candidates were not
involved in active duty abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic contender Bill Bradley served in the Air Force
Reserves in 1967 and 1968. Republican contender and magazine
publisher Steve Forbes served in the New Jersey National Guard for
about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Republican conservative Gary Bauer received student deferments
and did not serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson, a Vietnam
veteran, said he didn't think that military service would be an
issue in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is going to be very important,'' he said.
``There are so many Americans who have not served in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush went to Concord, the state capital, to
make official what everyone has assumed for months _ that he is a
candidate for president. After registering with the secretary of
state, Bush addressed supporters in front of the capitol building,
telling them there was ``a lot of hard work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been criticized for not spending enough time in
the state, has scheduled another day of campaigning later this
month.

   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ In five months of investigation and
exhumation of the dead in Kosovo, war crimes investigators have
found 2,108 bodies in grave sites throughout the province, the
chief prosecutor announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While there are several hundred more reported sites to be
examined in the spring, the number of the dead found so far seems
significantly lower than the estimate of 10,000 ethnic Albanians
killed by the Serbs, issued by Western officials, or the suggestion
by American and allied officials during the war that up to 100,000
were being killed.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the U.N. Security Council in New York, also
released here, the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Carla Del Ponte, said that the
bodies had been found in 195 sites before work stopped for the
winter, and that there were a total of 529 sites reported to
investigators so far.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Del Ponte cautioned that the number of dead was an interim
figure, and noted that ``we have discovered evidence of tampering
with graves,'' particularly at well-publicized suspected massacre
sites like Izbica, where investigators found no bodies after the
Serbian forces left Kosovo, but freshly turned earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also a significant number of sites where the precise
number of bodies cannot be counted,'' she said, adding that in some
places bodies had been burned and other steps taken to hide the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But a long investigation of the Trepca mine, where Albanians
said many bodies were brought for incineration, turned up no
evidence of any crime. Similarly, at Ljubenic, near Pec, a widely
publicized grave site said to hold 350 bodies only held five.
</P>
<P>
   A draft report by the State Department noted that an average of
only 17 bodies were found at examined sites, but says: ``We would
expect the total number of Kosovar Albanian deaths to be over
8,000'' once all the graves are inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior Western officials here say that the investigators
did look at the most serious sites first. While it is unlikely that
a firm and final death toll will ever be known, they suggested that
a figure of between 5,000 and 7,000 would be more likely. Some
suggested that 5,000 would be more logical, given what has been
found to date, and noting the simple difficulty of killing large
numbers of people and disposing of them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But officials also cautioned that some of the dead are fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army or may have died ordinary deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Del Ponte and her aides also noted that the tribunal's main
job is not to take a census of the dead, but to prepare legal
material to seek or extend indictments for war crimes against those
most responsible for the abuses of the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have in our possession invaluable documentation of what
happened to many people in many places in Kosovo,'' Mrs. Del Ponte
said. ``There is no substitute for this kind of accurate
information because it is evidence that eventually will stand up in
a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Moore, the tribunal spokeswoman here, said: ``A prosecutor
is not a statistician. The job is to gather evidence for
prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore noted that of the indictments on war crimes charges
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four other top
Yugoslav and Serbian officials, two charges cover the killings of
Albanians, but two also cover their forced expulsion, deportation
and persecution.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 Albanians were forced from their homes and out
of Kosovo, while many more thousands were living rough in the hills
inside the province. Albanian human rights groups note that several
thousand Albanians are reported missing, and it is unclear how many
of them may still be in Serbian jails _ nearly 2,000 according to
the International Committee of the Red Cross _ or abroad or dead
but undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Blerim Shala, the editor of the Albanian weekly Zeri and a
member of the Kosovo Transitional Council here, said that a
respected Albanian human rights group, the Kosovo Board for the
Protection of Human Rights, estimates that 7,000 Albanians were
killed during the war. Another 2,500 were killed in the previous
year, beginning March 1998, when the conflict between the Serbs and
the Kosovo Liberation Army intensified. Another 3,000 or so are
believed to be missing, Shala said.
</P>
<P>
   Daan Everts, the director of the mission in Kosovo for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that
morally the final number is not especially relevant, and noted that
those who were killed and abused were the subject of all the powers
of an organized state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many people are still in the ground,'' he
said. ``And whether the number is smaller or larger doesn't take
away from the massive and organized violation of human rights by a
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy chief prosecutor, told
reporters at the United Nations that motive and method were more
important legally than the number of victims in proving genocide.
``It's really not a numbers game to determine whether genocide has
been committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   During the war, however, estimated death figures were very high.
On April 19, the State Department said that up to 500,000 Kosovar
Albanians were missing and feared dead. On May 16, Defense
Secretary William Cohen said that up to 100,000 Albanian men in
Kosovo had vanished and might have been killed. ``We've now seen
about 100,000 military-aged men missing,'' Cohen told CBS. ``They
may have been murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, a British foreign office minister, Geoff Hoon, said:
``According to the reports we have gathered, mostly from the
refugees, it appears that around 10,000 people have been killed in
more than 100 massacres.'' On Aug. 2, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N.
chief administrator in Kosovo, said 11,000 ethnic Albanians were
killed, and said his figure came from the tribunal, which denied
providing it.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish forensic team's experience has been typical. According
to the newspaper El Pais, the team was told to prepare for at least
2,000 autopsies. But it found 187 bodies, usually buried in
individual graves.
</P>
<P>
   The El Pais report has led some to revise their expectations of
the death toll, which Ms. Del Ponte's report sought to clarify
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Responding in the Security Council to the report, Russia's
deputy representative, Gennadi Gatilov, said that the tribunal
should also investigate crimes committed by Albanians against
Serbs. ``Otherwise, there will be grounds for accusing the tribunal
of double standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Pristina, the NATO-led peacekeeping troops issued
murder statistics since June 12, when NATO took control of the
province. Of the 379 people killed, 135 were Serbs, a
disproportionate number given that only about 5 percent of the
province's current population is believed to be Serbian. Of the
rest, 145 were ethnic Albanians, while 99 are of unknown or other
ethnicity, said Maj. Ole Irgens, a spokesman for the force.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report about to be released by the International
Crisis Group, the number of killings now in Kosovo is comparable to
the levels reported before the NATO intervention, when the Serbs
were struggling to defeat the Kosovo Liberation Army. The figure is
roughly 30 people killed a week in a province with a current
estimated population of 1.4 million.

CLINTON SHORTENS TRIP TO GREECE AND MAY DROP IN ON KOSOVO, INVITED
OR NOT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton may add a brief stop in Kosovo to
his coming trip through southern Europe to highlight the importance
of the peacekeeping mission there and to address the tensions
between Serbs and Albanians, administration officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stopover would also be a new slap at President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, since under the agreement that brought an
end to the NATO bombing, Kosovo is administered by the United
Nations but formally remains part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Yugoslav mission to the United Nations in New
York said she had heard nothing about the president's plans but
expected official notification from Washington. ``Kosovo is not an
independent state that anybody can just jump in,'' the official
said, declining to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   But that appeared to be what the president intended to do.
``He's going into a U.N.-controlled and patrolled area,'' a State
Department official said of the president's plans. ``The authority
in Kosovo is in the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides involved in planning the trip say the president will very
likely visit the U.S. military base in south-central Kosovo known
as Camp Bondsteel, a 775-acre site surrounded by barbed wire,
concrete barriers and guard towers.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said there remain security concerns about visiting the
province, which just months ago was being pelted by NATO bombs and
where incidents of inter-ethnic violence continue. White House
aides said it was premature to announce the trip officially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is the overarching sensitivity,'' said a Pentagon
official. ``I can only imagine how the Secret Service may be
reacting to this little jaunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the visit would include a face-to-face meeting
between Serbs and Albanians during which Clinton will urge them to
put violence and hatred aside.
</P>
<P>
   The president will most likely call for more financial support
from foreign governments for reconstruction in Kosovo, officials
said. ``I think it's an important trip to show the American
commitment to the progress in Kosovo,'' an administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the government of Milosevic is
expected to object to the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But international law experts said the agreement that ended the
war left some ambiguity about Kosovo's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that there is still Serbian sovereignty over
Kosovo,'' said Allan Gerson, a former counsel to the U.S. mission
to the United Nations and now a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations. ``In a formal way, that's true. But it's in
contradiction with other provisions that call for an economically
and politically self-sufficient entity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech outlining his foreign policy goals on Monday,
Clinton said there was no future for Milosevic, a leader the
president called ``the last living relic'' of the Communist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we and our allies stood up to ethnic cleansing in
Bosnia and Kosovo, the century is not ending on a note of despair
with the knowledge that innocent men, women and children on the
doorstep of NATO can be expelled and killed simply because of their
ethnic heritage and the way they worship their God,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
said Clinton's visit might encourage more countries to contribute
financially to the peacekeeping effort. ``He'll be able to see
firsthand what the international community as a whole is dealing
with there and the depth of the problems, which have to do
primarily with money,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule of Clinton's coming trip has already been juggled
because of safety fears. The White House announced Wednesday that
Clinton would delay and shorten his state visit to Greece, which
was to begin on Monday, because of the prospect of violent
anti-American protests there.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said the delay
came at the request of the Greek government. But administration
officials have been concerned about recent demonstrations and acts
of violence in Greece that have been directed against Americans.
Anti-American protests occur regularly in Athens but the
American-led attacks on Yugoslavia intensified the anger of many
Greeks toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without going into detail on security, we always take security
concerns into account,'' Lockhart said. ``I think there's a full
and rich tradition of protests in Greece, particularly this time of
year. I think the Greek government believed that we would have a
more productive visit if it was later in the trip and we agreed.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NHL OFFERS A WORLD BEAT ON SKATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The collision knocked the helmet off Scott Gomez's head, but it
could not remove the smile from his face. It was initiated by Ulf
Samuelsson, Philadelphia's veteran ruffian from Sweden. As he
checked the Devil rookie Tuesday night, Samuelsson's stick gave
Gomez a big welt over his left eye. While Gomez replaced his
headgear and cleared his thought process, experienced teammates
gave him sympathetic pats on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a little stunned,'' Gomez said. The next time he
skated near Samuelsson, Gomez slashed him. ``I gave him a whack,''
Gomez said. ``Dumb penalty. He's good at his job. The vets warned
me about him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Gomez was clear-eyed and in good spirits. The
Devils won by 2-1 to tie the Flyers for the Atlantic Division lead.
Gomez, a 19-year-old playmaking forward, leads his team with 15
points and is a candidate for rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am having the time of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Hispanic player in the history of the National
Hockey League, Gomez, who grew up in Alaska, is another piece of
hockey's growing mosaic. It was once a sport of, for and by
Canadians, and usually Canadians of a certain kind. But now, no
other major North American team sport boasts more diversity than
hockey; this makes the NHL intriguing to more fans, yet potentially
explosive for its participants.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, most people equate diversity with race.
The league has only 13 players of color, but it is the most in its
history. While Mike Grier of Edmonton was born in Detroit and
raised in Boston, most of the players of color are not simply
black. Boston's Anson Carter, born in Canada, describes himself as
``Caribbean and colored.'' The Rangers' Jason Doig is from
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   But more diverse than race in hockey is nationality. Of the
NHL's 661 players, 372 are from Canada. The United States is second
with 106, followed by the Czech Republic with 50, Russia with 47,
Sweden with 37, Finland with 22, Slovakia with 10 and other nations
with 17.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the Canadians, a player from suburban Toronto is
different from someone from rural Quebec or a Native Canadian from
the Western provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is not always harmonious. In recent seasons, three NHL
players have been suspended for using racial slurs in games. To
combat this, Commissioner Gary Bettman this season assigned a
consultant to lecture all 28 teams and show a video about words
that are unacceptable. Gomez said he sometimes heard slurs like
these in youth leagues, but has not as a professional. When
Samuelsson clobbered him on Tuesday night, there was no sense of
bias; Samuelsson is a equal opportunity bully with enemies from all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches, in an effort to promote harmony, have encouraged
their players to speak only English in the locker room. Reporters
learn quickly not to refer to a Slovak as a Czech and that not
everyone from the former Soviet Union is a Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who speaks only a little Spanish, will probably speak
English this week when interviewed by two Hispanic television crews
and one Spanish-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   His father was born in California to migrant workers from
Mexico; his mother is from Colombia. Gomez gets fan mail from
Spanish-speaking fans and says ``there's a lot of Latino base'' in
the metropolitan area. Yet he seems lukewarm about trailblazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an American,'' he often says, and that he is, having grown
up in Anchorage, a cold place located between the hockey hotbeds of
Canada and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   His ambivalence is understandable. Even in a multicultural
milieu, the pressure on a rookie is to fit in and to conform to
those around him.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Hudson are more pieces of the mosaic. In addition to
Doig, the Rangers have Manny Malhotra, who, like Gomez, was drafted
on the first round in 1998. Malhotra has dark skin, causing some
people to guess wrong about his nationality. His father is from
India and his mother is French-Canadian, from Quebec. Although
Malhotra was chosen ahead of Gomez and joined the major league a
year earlier, he is struggling for ice time and points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I will continue to work hard and win the ice
time,'' Malhotra said. ``I like to be challenged. I put pressure on
myself and I look at pressure as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the background, the biggest pressure on a player is to
perform. This represents progress for sports as a meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Ken Daneyko rave about Gomez: ``You know what's great
about him? He's old school.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he's new school.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PFASTATT, France _ Last year, the Beyer family, which owns a
small jam and fruit preserves plant here near the Swiss border,
made a proposal to their 18 employees: Would they like a 35-hour
workweek and continue to be paid for working 39 hours?
</P>
<P>
   To no one's great surprise, the employees said yes. ``An hour
more for yourself is an hour more,'' said Christiane Grimm, whose
job includes slapping labels on jars, sorting through crates of
fruit and watching over bubbling vats of jam. ``There's lots you
can do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Beyers ended up happy, too. The company, one
of thousands of French enterprises that have reorganized their
businesses because of a 16-month-old law creating one of the
shortest work weeks in the world, believes that it is far better
off than before.
</P>
<P>
   In the reshuffle, Philippe Beyer split his 18 employees into two
teams and staggered their shifts. His factory here in the Alsace
region now operates 12 hours a day, up from 8. And it produces 30
percent more than it did last year with only two extra employees.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of 39 hours of pay for 35 hours of work was a
campaign plank that helped catapult Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's
leftist coalition to power in the 1997 parliamentary elections. And
it remains the glue that keeps Socialists, Communists and Greens
together. It was aimed at creating as many as 1 million jobs in a
country that has struggled with a double-digit rate of unemployment
for years.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts think that this bold experiment _ which
business leaders had warned would cripple France's economy _ is not
going to be a cure-all for the nearly 3 million unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it could accomplish something the leftist governing
coalition never aimed for: a kind of housecleaning in the French
workplace that will tear the cobwebs from French industry and lead
to a more productive and flexible work force, as it did at Beyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely,'' said
Emanuel Ferry, an economist at Banque National de Paris, who is
studying the policy. ``But it seems to be having a backdoor effect.
It is providing a very good opportunity to renovate the workplace.
And it is introducing these elements _ productivity, flexibility _
quietly without triggering social unrest. So even if the direct
goal of job creation is not achieved, it may still not necessarily
be a bad thing for the economy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That may be, but there is hardly a policy that has caused as
much furor in France as the 35-hour week. While labor was an early
advocate of the idea, many unions have recently demonstrated
against it, fearing that the way it is being carried out will
freeze salary levels and reverse hard-fought gains in employee
rights. Businesses have protested, too. In October, some 30,000
industrialists and executives gathered at a Paris conference center
to wave placards and chant slogans deploring the policy. They say
it will cost too much and destroy France's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Average citizens also seem to be losing their appetite for it.
Surveys show that the idea was very popular when first proposed,
but resistance grew the more the French considered it. A recent
poll found that less than 10 percent of France's citizens now
believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks. Most
people suspect that one way or another, they will be
inconvenienced. Either way, it is a subject almost sure to start a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel very strongly about it,'' Beyer said. ``In this
country we are a little retrograde, we live the way we lived 30
years ago, and this is forcing change and so people are uneasy with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is little proof that the 35-hour week has created
many jobs. Labor Ministry officials said in Parliament recently
that the plan had created or saved 120,000 jobs. But one legislator
called the figures ``thin air,'' and most economists say a more
realistic number would probably be half that. Opponents also point
out that the government has been subsidizing the transition with
business tax cuts and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   France's economy grew at a healthy rate of 3.2 percent in 1998,
and is expected to do nearly as well this year. The unemployment
rate has dropped to 11.1 in August from a high of 12.6 percent in
June 1997. But few see much connection between the new jobs and the
35-hour policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 35 hours was a political decision,'' a Finance Ministry
official said, ``but it may become a really positive thing. Nothing
was moving before. Now suddenly everyone has to go back and look at
the way we have been doing business. People are talking and
thinking and being creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of carrying out this complicated law, passed in June
1998, is still in its early stages. This month, Parliament passed a
tangle of more than 100 amendments spelling out exactly how and
when the policy should be instituted. One rule: All companies with
20 employees or more must operate with a 35-work week by the year
2002. So far, only a little more than 1 percent of eligible French
employers have formally made plans for the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly. Some
businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit. Others, including
service industries, are likely to have a much harder time.
</P>
<P>
   George Jallerat, who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant
in Chartres, says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees'
hours, pay them the same wages and not lose money. ``In the end, we
will have to raise prices,'' he said. ``There is no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect
themselves. Dr. Thierry Sandre employs 19 people in his medical lab
on the outskirts of Paris. He says he will do all that he can to
avoid hiring a 20th person and bring the 35-hour workweek into his
business.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not trust the government to leave him alone. So he
has not raised the pay of any of his employees in two years, as a
way of saving money for the day he has to give them a 35-hour
workweek for 39 hours of pay. He says he is not alone.

 PFASTATT: not alone.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the 35-hour workweek was being debated, government
officials began trying to enforce the 39-hour limit, even among
managers. Agents prowled garages to see what time people were
actually leaving. Thousands of fines were issued, and in one case,
the director of a electronics factory owned by Thomson-RCM was
hauled into court for working too hard and allowing his engineers
and other managers to put in an average of 46 hours a week. In
June, he was hit with an $18,000 fine. The action prompted some
businesses to install time clocks even for managers and made the
government the butt of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those
who were already planning to expand their businesses. For instance,
the Packard Bell computer factory in the western town of Angers
went to the 35-hour week this year precisely because it wanted to
increase production by 30 percent. To do that, it needed to
reorganize its 1,200 employees into more teams and more shifts.
Offering a 35-hour week was a way of opening negotiations with its
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Luc Bayel, the director of human resources, said the plan
had worked out even better than anyone expected. ``We have far less
absenteeism,'' Bayel said. ``And we are seeing a better product.
People have to stand to do the job, and standing for eight hours is
hard. Now they stand for only seven and we are seeing a 5 percent
reduction in problem computers. We are very happy with the
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies
because it did not want to follow government rules. But others like
Beyer also saw in the new law a way of getting government aid to
pay for expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Beyer, for instance, the government aid package will pay
nearly 90 percent of the salary for the two employees he added this
year. Next year, it will pay about 70 percent and 50 percent the
year after that. But Beyer, who took over the business from his
father two years ago, wanted to expand anyway. He says he might
have gone ahead with his plans anyhow, but the law gave him a push.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Beyer's factory, Didier Thuet, who owns a small
heating installation business, adopted the 35-hour week for just
the same reason. ``It was an opportunity to try something,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thuet's business is seasonal. There is little work at all from
March to May. So he offered his employees a shorter workweek during
those months in exchange for a longer one during peak business
periods. They also got an additional six to eight days off. All six
of the employees agreed to a salary freeze until the year was over
and the company could see how much money it made.
</P>
<P>
   But both Thuet and Beyer have their doubts about whether the law
will work everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the
new jobs. At Beyer, Sarah Charro, who at 26 had a series of
temporary jobs, was hired because of the reorganization, but she
has little good to say about it. She says the atmosphere in the
factory is tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel in some ways like we went backward,'' Ms. Charro said.
``We are working only 35 hours, but they are trying to push a lot
into those hours _ push, push, push. We are all stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thuet's new employee, Christoffe Foulon, says the 35-hour week
is great if he does not lose any money. But in truth, he would
rather work more and earn more. He says few of his friends seem to
envy him. Instead, he says, most give him a hard time. ``They treat
me like I'm lazy,'' he said.

BANK ONE AGAIN WARNS ABOUT PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Citing continuing weakness in its huge credit card
division, Bank One Corp. issued its second profit warning in three
months Wednesday, saying that fourth-quarter earnings forecasts
would have to be reduced by as much as 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One, which is the nation's fourth-largest bank holding
corporation, offered few details about the problems. But it issued
a statement late in the day saying the problems were almost
entirely related to First USA, its credit card and consumer lending
unit, which ranks second only to the credit card division of
Citigroup. First USA's portfolio has managed loans of about $70
billion and more than 64 million credit card holders.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bank One, which is based in Chicago, said the
First USA unit accounted for about a third of the bank's earnings
in the first half of the year and that continuing softness and
attrition in a highly competitive credit card business was having a
larger than expected impact on the company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bank One _ which have plummeted 50 percent in the last
six months _ dropped $4.375, or 11 percent Wednesday, to $34.625,
before trading was halted on the New York Stock Exchange pending
news from the company. In after-hours trading, shares fell to
$32.50.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One officials say that the company's merger integration
remains on track, but that they now expect full-year earnings to be
about $3.45 to $3.55 a share, down from projections of $3.60 to
$3.65, which were given in late August. Just a few months ago,
analysts had been expecting $3.92 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said Wednesday's warning was just the
latest in a series of earnings disappointments that have hit the
bank this year. The bank become one of the nation's largest after
acquiring First USA Inc. and First Chicago NDB Corp. in the last
few years. Bank One is also the world's largest issuer of Visa
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In August, however, Bank One issued its first profit warning,
citing problems in its credit card unit, a situation that analysts
said was partly because of poor customer service, high penalty fees
and growing attrition rates.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the head of First USA was replaced by William
P. Boardman, who had been scheduled to meet with investors on Nov.
15 to discuss the earnings outlook for the year 2000 for the credit
card division.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the company said that after a review of the
credit card unit it had decided to postpone the meeting until at
least early January. Wall Street analysts said Wednesday that they
were disappointed by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things looked like they were going swimmingly until last
August,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein. ``In October they said they would give us a 2000 outlook
in November, and now they tell us things look worse. The company's
found the problems are more serious than they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a recorded message Wednesday night, John B. McCoy,
the chairman and chief executive of Bank One, said the company had
been reviewing the credit card operations and preparing to inform
investors this month, but soon determined that more time was needed
for study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've simply underestimated the time it's going to take to
complete our work,'' McCoy said, noting that part of the review led
to the downward revision in this year's earnings forecast. ``I know
these developments further disappoint our investors. However, we
believe the additional time we take with the strategic review will
make a later update more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the credit card divisions at other companies are
doing much better, several analysts said they were preparing
sizable downgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really disappointing,'' said Mandle at Sanford C.
Bernstein. ``I think you're going to see that earnings estimates
are going to come down for the year 2000, too.''

MONEY LAUNDERING BILLS OFFERED IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JEFF GERTH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, as well as some
senators, presented legislation on Wednesday to make it illegal for
American banks to handle the proceeds of official corruption
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals were offered as a Senate committee completed
hearings into how Citibank Private Bank handled hundreds of
millions of dollars in questionable deposits from foreign leaders
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, regulators and a former private
banker described how the use of offshore havens by American private
banks shielded wealthy clients and impeded federal examiners' work
in gauging a bank's financial soundness.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who initiated the inquiry, told the
regulators, ``You are stymied in getting information.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin introduced a Money Laundering Abatement Act that would bar
American banks from handling accounts for foreign entities unless
records were maintained in the United States that showed the
identities of the account owners.
</P>
<P>
   A former private banker convicted of money laundering, Antonio
Giraldi, described how private bankers helped clients hide their
wealth by setting up shell corporations in safe havens, countries
like the Cayman Islands with strict secrecy laws and few if any
taxes, and keeping the records of the true corporation owners
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would also expand the list of foreign
crimes that fall under the money-laundering statute. Presently,
American financial institutions are barred from handling the
proceeds from a narrow group of offenses committed abroad,
including drug trafficking, kidnapping and bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said his bill would include as underlying offenses
``corruption or fraud by or against a foreign government under the
government's laws or the laws of the country in which the conduct
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, submitted by the Treasury and Justice
Departments, would expand the list of foreign crimes that serve as
a basis for laundering prosecutions to include fraud, official
bribery, misappropriation of public funds, arms trafficking and
crimes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals follow disclosure that hundreds of millions of
dollars in possibly corrupt money wound up in banks like Citibank
and the Bank of New York after having left Africa, Mexico and
Russia under questionable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, officials from the Federal Reserve and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency testified that their
examiners were not allowed to look at American bank operations in
some foreign jurisdictions and that gaining access to customer
records for those countries could be difficult if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A primary obstacle to our supervision of offshore private
banking activities by U.S. banking organizations, not only with
regard to beneficial ownership information, but with regard to the
safety and soundness of the operations, is our inability to conduct
on-site examinations in many offshore jurisdictions,'' said Richard
A. Small, assistant director of the Federal Reserve division of
banking supervision and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairwoman, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the
secrecy made ``it virtually impossible to conduct a thorough
examination.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators told the committee that Citibank had improved its
policies and that long-needed efforts were under way to improve
cooperation among international bank supervisors on secrecy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the records uncovered by the committee show that the culture
of secrecy is strongly imbued in the minds of some private bankers.
Private banking is a growing and highly profitable niche of the
banking business that provides extra care to wealthy customers.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in Citibank stems from how it secretly moved $80
million to $100 million for Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of the
former Mexican president. The Senate committee subpoenaed Citibank
for transcripts of conversations among its private bankers on March
1, 1995, the day after Salinas had been arrested for murder. He has
been convicted and is in prison in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In one conversation, the head of Citibank Private Bank, Hubertus
Rukavina, asked whether Salinas' money could be moved from trust
accounts in London to Switzerland, which has strict secrecy laws,
according to the transcript. ``Now, the thing is whether that,
whether those, whether those accounts shouldn't be brought to
Switzerland,'' Rukavina said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Derrell Kinley had a good enough feeling
about George W. Bush not only to show up for his speech at the
civic center in nearby Anderson on Tuesday night but also to stick
around another hour just to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kinley, a manager for a trucking company, was asked why
he found Bush so appealing, he responded with a prolonged silence,
then caromed through a series of broken sentences before
acknowledging he had no detailed reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because of his father,'' Kinley finally said. ``I
associate George Sr. with Ronald Reagan, who I liked a lot. I
associate George W. Bush with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it?''
But, he added, ``that's the way it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kinley's political syllogism was peculiar, his
inability to pinpoint anything beyond family pedigree that drew him
to the Texas governor was a strikingly common characteristic among
voters attending Bush campaign events in South Carolina on Tuesday
and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a theme reflected in the latest New York Times/CBS
News poll, issued this week. That survey, of 1,162 adults,
suggested that the support for Bush, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, was less firmly tethered to
people's knowledge about his positions than was the support for
other prominent presidential candidates, of either party.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the poll, whose margin of sampling error was plus
or minus three percentage points, showed that 86 percent of voters
who favored Sen. John McCain, Bush's chief Republican rival, could
cite a specific reason. But only 61 percent of voters who favored
Bush could do so. This suggests a possibility that some of Bush's
supporters could change their minds as the primaries draw nearer.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the voters with whom Bush crossed paths were
for the most part Republicans engaged enough in the political
process to know about, and attend, one or another of his events.
Even so, many responded to questions about the source of their
affinity for him with lengthy pauses and blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, people who said they had decided to vote for him
struggled to identify a single proposal he had made, dwelling
instead on his family tie or his demeanor, which they pronounced
folksy and upbeat. Never mind that he had given his stump speech
and talked about issues during five previous visits to South
Carolina, or that he had delivered one of his five major policy
addresses in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Britt, a retiree who greeted Bush at Jimmy's restaurant
in Easley on Tuesday morning, confidently told a reporter that she
liked the policies the candidate was advocating. Asked to name one
of them, Ms. Britt conceded: ``I'm going to be hard pressed to tell
you. I can't elaborate much on it. I get a good feeling. Frankly, I
liked his father a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Two tables away, Michelle Mauldin, an insurance agent, sang the
same tune. ``Don't ask me what draws me to him,'' she said. ``I was
terribly fond of his parents, so he has a real place in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The refrain recurred in Pickens and Seneca and Clemson and
Anderson and Greenville, and it provided an arresting glimpse at
the relatively scant degree of attention voters are paying to the
presidential race at this early stage, almost a full year before
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   That climate favors anyone, like Bush, with ready-made name
recognition. But Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster not working for
any presidential candidate, said this did not mean Bush's support
was built on sand. He said voters' initial reactions to a candidate
often reflected a diffuse but accurate impression that he had a
political temperament close to their own.
</P>
<P>
   That judgment is made partly on the basis of the candidate's
party affiliation, Ayres said, but partly on the basis of slogans,
sound bites and more detailed information that voters have soaked
up, even if they cannot articulate those influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet most of them could not tell you a specific position that
Pat Buchanan has taken, but I bet they could tell you that George
W. Bush is closer to where they are philosophically than Buchanan
is,'' Ayres said. ``Voters pick up a general sense, in ways we
don't fully understand, of who's for them and who's against them.
And that's not insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the extent to which Bush is benefiting from voters'
affectionate memories of his father _ a curiosity, given President
Bush's estrangement from voters toward the end of his one term in
the Oval Office. Only 29 percent of voters viewed President Bush
favorably in October 1992; 49 percent did not. Yet he looms large
and benevolent over the political fortunes of his son.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll conducted two weeks ago showed that when voters
were asked to say the first thing that came to their minds at the
mention of George W. Bush, 38 percent said he was the son of a
former president. Six percent identified him as a former president
himself, while only 5 percent identified him as the governor of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those results were very much in keeping with the sentiments
expressed by people like Wanda Owens, a retiree who heard Bush
speak at a hotel in downtown Greenville on Wednesday morning. Ms.
Owens cited two reasons for supporting Bush, the primary one being
her assumption that he had received lessons in leadership at his
father's knee.
</P>
<P>
   The other one?
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine,'' she said, ``goes to the same church that
he does.''

 _ SF CHRON   S.F.'s Protozoa Draws on Animation for Leap to the Web 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; It must be my enigmatic smile.
<P>
   Some Web animation wags at San Francisco's Protozoa dressed me
up like the Mona Lisa and put me online at www.dotcomix.com. They
also put me into the costume of Sister Randy, their bad-taste
cigarette-smoking art critic nun.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of an effort to show how easy and edgy Web
animation can be.
</P>
<P>
   Which in turn is part of Protozoa's effort to make that
animation a viable business model.
</P>
<P>
   From its offices in Multimedia Gulch, in a Mariposa Street
building that once housed a mayonnaise factory, Protozoa hopes its
new comic properties can catapult to fame on the World Wide Web _
and then make the leap to television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is where the money is, if you're in the right place
in the food chain, controlling the property,'' said Protozoa chief
executive Damon Danielson.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Randy is one of the first of Protozoa's original
creations. So far, the company has been teaming up with the owners
of other more well-known cartoon stars as a way of driving traffic
to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It's animating characters from Doonesbury and the Fusco Brothers
comic strips, as well as the editorial cartoons of Tom Tomorrow's
``This Modern World.'' It also has invented cartoon characters to
bring public radio's ``Dr. Science'' and Internet movie reviewer
Mr. Cranky to life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Protozoa also  &LR; has some particularly bad-taste
renditions of President Clinton and Microsoft's Bill Gates. The
Clinton cartoons were originally commissioned by MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Protozoa was formed six years ago by alumni of San Francisco's
late, great Colossal Pictures. Its founders initially thought they
would create cartoons for games and television. Then the Web came
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about the Web is it's so democratic and
fast,'' said Brad deGraf, Protozoa's chairman and one of the
founders. ``If you develop content for television, that's a good
way to go broke. On the Web, you can get to the audience
immediately and directly, instead of two years of development hell
and 20 layers of proposals that end either with `No' or with you
not owning the property.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ally McBeal's ``dancing baby'' started out as an
e-mail animation.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Protozoa owns Sister Randy. She _ or he? _
is a transvestite takeoff of PBS's popular art critic nun, Sister
Wendy. But Sister Randy is quite a bit ruder.
</P>
<P>
   Standup comedian Gerri Lawlor, who already was doing an
impression of Sister Wendy in her act, does the voice. Protozoa's
Dan Hanna came up with the idea, and the scripts are written by his
colleague Bucky Sinister. Sinister is well known in some San
Francisco circles as author of ``King of the Roadkills'' and the
guy who ran open-mike nights at the Chameleon nightclub, which he
calls ``the hockey match of all poetry readings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinister has pink hair, a colorful tattoo up his arm, wears
Marilyn Manson T-shirts and speaks with an Arkansas drawl. He's
reading a Sister Wendy book so that he can effectively parody her.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he wrote a small script for me, and then helped
outfit me in a ``motion-capture'' suit. Sensors on the suit worked
like a virtual puppet: When I moved on the stage, Sister Randy
moved on screen.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not that good at it, but you can see my act on Protozoa's
DotComix Web site.
</P>
<P>
   What the experience really demonstrated, however, was how easy
it is to make an episode of Sister Randy, or any cartoon, now that
animation doesn't have to be drawn cel by cel like in Walt Disney's
day, but can be captured from a real person moving around on a
stage.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no art critic, but I don't think Sister Randy is ready for
prime time. But in the niche-marketing world of the Web, I won't be
surprised if Protozoa scores a cartoon hit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KNIGHT RIDDER, DOT COM: &QL; 
Newspapers have struggled with how to manage their Web presence: Do
they use it to promote the profitable print product, or do they
push the future-oriented Web sites at the expense of their
old-media franchises?
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder, the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher,
just landed squarely on the side of the Web by establishing
KnightRidder.com, a separate division of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our online leaders have reported to the publisher'' of
their respective newspapers, said Tony Ridder, the chief executive
of San Jose's Knight Ridder. ``Once we complete this restructuring,
they'll report to the head of KnightRidder.com. They'll be free to
compete with the newspapers,'' for news or for advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bold statement for a company that, as Ridder points
out, had $30 million in Internet revenue and $3.3 billion in
overall revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper publishers rightfully think, how does this
Internet affect my newspaper business?'' Ridder said. ``My feeling
is, you can't have a successful business if you're worried about
protecting the core business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to have a successful Internet business and
compete with all these other players _ Yahoo and America Online and
CarPoint and Monster.com _ the people we compete against don't
worry about protecting a newspaper business. To effectively compete
against those people, we need to do it with both hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridder said the company could decide to keep KnightRidder.com as
a separate division under the guidance of Dan Finnigan, or spin it
off as its own company, or issue a tracking stock, much like
Ziff-Davis did with ZDNetwant to be able to operate like all
these other Internet companies,'' Ridder said. ``In the Internet
world, speed is terribly important.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NEW NEW MEDIA: &QL; 
It seems only appropriate that a magazine named New Media should
use, well, new media.
</P>
<P>
   That would explain the little tagline at the top of last month's
mag: ``Our last paper issue ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of printing and shipping the magazine to 215,000
nonpaying subscribers _ the magazine was free _ San Mateo's New
Media has migrated to a Web-only publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The topic of new media was being redefined by the Internet,''
said Richard Landry, editor in chief and chairman and chief
executive of parent company HyperMedia Communications. ``In
addition, there was a shift of advertising revenue out of
traditional print media and into the Internet. And, if we wanted to
serve as a company that could serve people on the cutting edge, we
could communicate in a more direct way on the Internet, and our
financial growth was going to be on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't yet started posting much in the way of original
content, but plans to by today. Thurs Nov 11 &LR;  But don't bother
clicking to www.newmedia.com if you've only got a 28.8 modem or a
browser older than version 4.0 _ Landry said the site will practice
the rich media techniques that the magazine preaches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A BETTER CHRONICLE? &QL; 
Hard to believe that one could improve on perfection _ ahem _ but
some people think that if The Chronicle actually merges with its
neighbor, the Examiner, as proposed, the result could be a great
national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Journalism at San Francisco State University
evidently thinks so and is sponsoring a daylong seminar on ``The
New S.F. Chronicle: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts?'' on
Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Knuth Hall on the San Francisco
State campus, 1600 Holloway Ave. The public is invited and
admission is free. For more information, call (415) 338-3313, Ext.
3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The event will feature a number of pundits discussing what will
happen when Hearst Corp. takes over The Chronicle, but missing from
the fray will be executives from either entity: They were invited,
but declined to attend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Vi Nguyen and her staff at Aid to Children Without Parents faced a
bigger communications challenge than your average nonprofit
organization. The group's headquarters are in San Jose, but many of
the documents on which its staff there depends _ case files on the
children it hopes to help _ are generated at its branch office in

<P>
   Now the group has a solution that's as global as the problem:

   ``It's very fast and very convenient _ those are the two things

   It's also scot-free.

StoragePoint.com. Another called NetDrive will start up soon, and
still others are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, inviting users to store files on the Internet is not a
new idea. But most previous sites have been aimed at specific
applications, such as calendaring or digital photos.
</P>
<P>
   The new crop is designed to function like the user's own hard
drive, holding anything from MP3 music and Web bookmarks to a
resume or a business plan.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of storage space they offer at no charge _ typically
20 or 25 megabytes _ is hardly a complete backup solution in an era
when drives hundreds of times larger than that are commonplace. But
they do offer an easy way to make an extra, off-site copy of
important files.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, because the Web sites promise regular professional
backup of their servers, they're likely to be more reliable than
the floppies, Zip drives and other relatively primitive backup
solutions on which most home users depend _ if they back up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Web-based storage also can provide a solution for the millions
of Americans who take work home from the office. Instead of carting
floppies or Zip disks back and forth, they can post current files
to their online storage space from the office PC, then tap in again
from home.
</P>
<P>
   This approach even works across computer platforms because the
storage sites are accessible from Windows, Mac and Unix machines.
That gives them particular appeal to owners of Apple's latest
models, which don't include floppy drives as standard equipment.
One such site even calls itself iMacFloppy, though it actually
works with Windows as well as Mac client machines.
</P>
<P>
   The competing free-storage sites are scrambling to develop
features that will make data sharing even easier. I-drive, for
example, offers a free utility called Sync, which automatically can
copy data back and forth to ensure that selected files and folders
are kept up to date.
</P>
<P>
   And both X:drive and StoragePoint have developed software that
puts users' Web-storage space right into Windows, looking just like
an extra hard drive inside their PC. (This feature, like I-drive's
Sync utility, now works only on Windows.) Moving files between Web
and local drives becomes a simple matter of either dragging and
dropping or using the standard Windows Open and Save dialogs rather
than the relatively cumbersome procedure of surfing to the Web site
and going through a file-selection dialog.
</P>
<P>
   That's what sold Eric Brown, a software engineer at the Medical
University of South Carolina in Charleston, S.C., on X:drive. He
uses it to make sure he always has access to the source code and
software components on which he's working.
</P>
<P>
   ``My source code is my life, and without it, I'm lost,'' he
wrote in an e-mail message. ``With X:drive, I don't have to fuss
with zipping my source code up and carrying around a floppy disk
with me wherever I go.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown originally tried FreeDrive, he said, but found its
file-transfer procedure ``slow and unreliable.'' With his X:drive
mounted right on the Windows desktop, those problems disappeared.
``(With X:drive) I have never had a problem getting to my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Web storage also provides an appealing way to transfer big
documents for users who rely on service bureaus for color printing,
high-volume reproduction or other forms of document processing they
can't handle in-house. Just last week, X:drive announced a deal
with Kinko's that eventually will give the copy service's customers
access to personal X:drive space from any computer in more than 970
Kinko's locations.
</P>
<P>
   I-drive, meanwhile, is focusing much of its marketing on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it's doing so by working directly with technology
administrators at major campuses. Both the University of California
at Berkeley and Stanford University, among others, are planning
pilot projects that will provide I-drive accounts for students and
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students here are always working on projects together, and the
only way we have for them to share materials now is e-mail,'' said
Jerry Smith, director of workstation support services at the UC
Berkeley campus. ``That's not good for our e-mail system.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he and his team had surveyed a number of Web-storage
sites, but only I-drive offered all the features they wanted:
cross-platform access, file sharing with access controls and the
option of publishing a Web page from the site. (X:drive and most
competing sites don't support Web publishing.)
</P>
<P>
   For Stanford, I-drive has created a private domain integrated
into the school's existing user-authentication system, so users
don't even have to remember another account name and password,
according to Sandra Senti, director of the distributed computing
group there.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford already has a campuswide file system where each student
is entitled to a minimum of 50 megabytes of storage. But to get to
it, PC and Mac users must have special client software installed or
go through a gateway. To share their files with others, they ``have
to understand Unix access control lists,'' Senti said. ``I-drive
makes it much easier for those that aren't interested in learning
that much about Unix. This is particularly attractive outside the
engineering disciplines,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   I-drive also is moving to recruit student customers directly,
partly by seeking to ride the wave of interest in MP3-format
digital music on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company announced a deal that makes it the
``exclusive Internet file-storage provider to MP3.com,'' the
leading source for the hot new music format. Buttons on MP3.com's
pages will give users the option of ``sideloading'' music files
directly to their I-drive partition. (Rival X:drive is offering
similar technology, which it calls ``Skip the Download,'' free to
other Web sites but hasn't yet landed any fish as big as MP3.com.)
</P>
<P>
   I-drive's MP3-focused strategy seems to be succeeding in
bringing new users to the site, at least judging by the case of
Youssef Daniel, a librarian at McLennan Community College in Waco,
Texas. He tried out the service after noticing its button at
MP3.com, and now he uses it every day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome at syncing files,'' he said, and he likes another
Windows utility that I-drive provides, called Filo, which lets
users copy whole Web pages to their I-drive spaces with a single
mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel even moved his personal Web site to I-drive, mainly
because it is free of ads. He said he got tired of the banner ads
that cluttered his pages at Tripod, where his site previously was
hosted. Now he's recommending I-drive to students with whom he
works at the library.
</P>
<P>
   Although slick software and aggressive alliance building has
attracted attention to X:drive and I-drive, they face a strong new
competitor in Driveway, an offshoot of Atrieva, one of the pioneers
in Web storage. Driveway went live just last month, and within a
week, its parent company said it had more than 1 million users.
</P>
<P>
   That impressive feat came about in part because Atrieva simply
transferred to Driveway the membership rolls of its previous free
site, Internet FileZone, but the company says it's adding new users
at a rate of 10,000 per day. Atrieva also has its share of
alliances, including one with Netscape's NetCenter portal, and it
recently launched an affiliate program that lets smaller sites
offer free storage to their visitors. The company also is planning
to launch a major advertising campaign for Driveway this month.
</P>
<P>
   A crowded field isn't the only challenge these sites face. It
remains to be seen whether users _ especially those who still
depend on dial-up modems to get online _ will find online storage
reliable and speedy enough to use regularly. Some also might
question whether it's secure enough for important files _ all of
the sites password-protect each user's personal space, but only
StoragePoint encrypts the files stored there.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of increasing publicity about the abuse of
personal data for marketing purposes, the free-storage sites also
might face questions regarding what they do with information about
their users.
</P>
<P>
   Driveway's user agreement, for example, says it may collect,
among other things, ``navigation information such as Web sites
visited and links followed (by its users). We also may share this
information in the aggregate with advertisers and other third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The business models of all the major free-storage sites depend
largely on partnerships with other sites, most of them in
e-commerce. Such partners are likely to want to mine the data that
storage sites collect about their customers' Internet usage and
conceivably even about the files they store. They could make some
privacy-conscious users queasy about relying on Web drives, even if
the storage sites adhere to their promises to release data only in
aggregate form.

 _ SF CHRON  
 BofA, Wells Fargo Raise ATM Stakes  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a pointed warning to San Francisco about ATM surcharges,
California's two biggest banks announced they would stop letting
noncustomers use their cash machines in Santa Monica when a law
barring the fees takes effect there today.
<P>
   Bank of America said it will take similar action in San
Francisco next month, when the city's voter-approved surcharge ban
is set to begin, unless the law is blocked in court. Wells Fargo
said it hasn't yet decided what it will do if the San Francisco ban
takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   The moves represent an escalation in the increasingly bitter
dispute between consumer groups and city officials on one side and
banks on the other over the practice of charging a fee for ATM cash
withdrawals to people who keep their accounts at other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business should be expected to provide free service to
noncustomers,'' said Gene Taylor, the top retail banking official
in the West for North Carolina's Bank of America, in a statement
announcing the bank's decision to cut ATM access to noncustomers
unless it can collect a surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, San Francisco and Santa Monica officials
described the banks as sore losers unwilling to accept the will of
voters or their elected representatives. ``Here are these enormous
institutions behaving like an 8-year-old boy who says, `If I can't
win, I'll take my marbles and go home,''' said San Francisco City
Attorney Louise Renne.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Golinger, consumer program director of California Public
Interest Research Group, co-sponsor of San Francisco's ballot
measure banning ATM surcharges, called the cutoff ``a desperate act
by fee-addicted bankers attempting to scare off ATM laws in other
cities.``
</P>
<P>
   At issue is one of two fees that consumers usually pay when they
use a cash machine not belonging to the bank, thrift or credit
union where they keep their money.
</P>
<P>
   The first fee is what financial institutions charge their own
customers for using an outside ATM, typically $2 in California. The
second fee is the ATM surcharge, the fee that the outside ATM owner
charges noncustomers who use their machines, typically $1.50 in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Only that second fee, the ATM surcharge, is banned under the San
Francisco and Santa Monica laws.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco voters approved Proposition F banning ATM
surcharges by a 2-to-1 margin on November 2. Santa Monica's City
Council enacted a similar measure October 12.
</P>
<P>
   The two cities are the first in the country to ban ATM
surcharges by referendum or legislation. State officials in Iowa
and Connecticut have barred the fees through administrative action,
and the Pentagon has proposed banning surcharges in installations
under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   BofA, Wells Fargo and the California Bankers Association filed
suit to overturn the two laws in a San Francisco federal court last
week, the day after the election. in the city. &LR;   &LR; District Judge
Vaughn Walker has scheduled a hearing on Monday on the bank's
request for an order halting the surcharge bans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the San Francisco and Santa Monica bans have prompted
officials in cities from New York to San Diego to consider similar
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Moves by banks to prevent noncustomers from using their cash
machines could run afoul of rules set by the big ATM switching
networks _ such as the Star System and Visa's Plus and MasterCard's
Cirrus networks _ which connect machines owned by different
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Star System rules let banks remove a small fraction of their
ATMs from the network, a Star spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of cash machines in Santa Monica are presumably
well within that limit. But any widespread moves by BofA and Wells
Fargo to deny noncustomers access to ATMs would violate network
rules, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some serious implications,'' said Jeffrey Cheung,
executive vice president of California Bank &AMP; Trust, a unit of
Utah's Zions Bancorporation.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo consulted with network officials before cutting
noncustomers off in Santa Monica, spokesman Lance Berg said. ``This
decision does not violate the network rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of their statewide networks of thousands of cash machines, only
the 21 BofA ATMs and 12 Wells Fargo ATMs in Santa Monica are
cutting off access to noncustomers today.
</P>
<P>
   ATM surcharges are big income producers for the two banks. The
188 BofA ATMs and 174 Wells Fargo machines in San Francisco
generate about $5.5 million in yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Wells Fargo has said it takes in about $50 million
annually in surcharges. BofA won't say what revenue it &LR;  gets  &LR; it
makes from ATM surcharges, but if the bank's usage rates are
comparable to Wells Fargo's, the figure is probably between $125
million and $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   At a San Francisco news conference yesterday, BofA officials
downplayed the revenue issue and stressed the principles of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly about this issue,'' said former
California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, now an executive in BofA's
private bank, which provides banking services to rich people. &LR;   &LR; the
wealthy. ``Is it fair for consumers to demand products and services
for free?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups accuse banks of double-charging noncustomers,
since they already get a portion of the fee consumers pay their own
financial institutions for using an outside ATM. These so-called
interchange fees charged by the ATM owner to the customer's bank
are typically 50 cents for each withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   BofA officials declined to answer questions about other income
in addition to surcharges the bank gets when noncustomers use its
ATMs, such as interchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim that ATM service is being given away for free is
nonsense,'' said Santa Monica Deputy City Attorney Adam Radinsky.
``The banks are already well compensated for every ATM
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathleen Shilkret said the surcharge
bans are unfair because machines not owned by financial
institutions _ including many of those installed in supermarkets,
convenience stores, gas stations and casinos _ will still be
allowed to levy surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns against ATM surcharges ``are deliberate moves by
consumer groups to upset people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of small and midsize banks were torn by the BofA and
Wells Fargo moves.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, many small banks also levy ATM surcharges, and
officials support the right of the big banks to impose fees. At the
same time, they fear that customers will move to the big banks if
they can no longer use their ATM cards widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a positive for our customers,`` said Steven
Barlow, executive vice president of Mechanics Bank in Richmond.
``It means fewer machines and less convenience for them.

 BILL GATES GETS OVATION FROM TRUE BELIEVERS  &HT;     By David Lazarus  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bellevue, Wash _ The fire alarm went off as 3,000 Microsoft Corp.
shareholders gathered at a convention center here yesterday to
learn whether their investments might crash and burn.
<P>
   Their concerns, of course, stemmed from a judge's ruling last
week that the company is a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that if there is a problem, you will hear about it,''
Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold told the crowd. ``None of you
are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   It ended up being a false alarm. But as it turned out, calming
words from Herbold and other Microsoft executives were just what
the shareholders had come to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's top brass put on a brave face for the benefit of
investors at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Although
they indicated they are open to a settlement of the antitrust case,
they said the company will budge only so far in talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   And despite uncertainty about the future, holders of Microsoft
stock are standing squarely behind the company that has made many
of them rich. The prevailing sentiment was that Microsoft shouldn't
back down in its brawl with government antitrust authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders gave Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief
executive, a standing ovation when he entered the hall. Gates
appeared pleased, and more than a little relieved, to find himself
surrounded again by true believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to go a long way to address the court's
concerns,'' he said. ``But we must maintain our ability to listen
to customers and add new features to our products.''
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders applauded this stand.
</P>
<P>
   Gates repeated that he was disappointed by U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ``findings of fact'' that Microsoft
used its clout in the computer industry to crush competition. But
he stuck to his insistence that the company has done nothing wrong,
let alone illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that the American legal system, at the end of
the day, will recognize that Microsoft's innovations and behavior
were completely fair and brought tremendous benefits to millions of
consumers,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders applauded that as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among more than two dozen shareholders interviewed before the
meeting, not one saw Microsoft's current legal difficulties as a
reason to sell their stock. If anything, most view this as a prime
buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want to break up the company,'' said Diane
Mankey, a Seattle homemaker. ``But I think Microsoft will prevail.
Microsoft is interested in new ideas, and they shouldn't be held
back from developing those ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Microsoft to fight the government,'' said Victor Lee, a
Kirkland, Wash., meat cutter. ``I think they can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   All shareholders interviewed were unfazed by the possibility
that the company could be broken up into several entities. Most
welcomed it, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they break it up, it's a best-case scenario,'' observed
Diane Rodgers, who drove up from Portland, Ore., for the
early-morning event. ``Then I'll have stock in three companies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the question-and-answer part of the meeting, one shareholder
got up and expressed his feelings of ``disappointment and
humiliation'' about how Microsoft has handled the antitrust case to
date. He received only a smattering of polite applause from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit a lot at the company and talk about how we got into
this situation,'' Gates replied. ``Microsoft is a very
self-critical company. But I'd say that in what we've done, how
we've conducted this case, I'm quite proud of the work that's been
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd clapped its agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gates told of his high hopes for Windows 2000, the
soon-to-be-released version of the world's most ubiquitous computer
operating system, and said a key feature will be a ``customizable
personal Web.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the Internet, and Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser, will remain a core element of the company's business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a thing that changes for us,'' said Microsoft
President Steve Ballmer. ``The key to our ongoing health is the
notion of empowering people _ any time, any place.''
</P>
<P>
   This no doubt came as good news to the youngest shareholders in
the room: 11-year-old Tanner Sterling and his 8-year-old brother,
Corbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mom and dad gave us some money and let us buy any stock we
wanted,'' Tanner said. ``We decided on Microsoft. It's a very
trustworthy stock.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that the antitrust case made him nervous, and that
he'd been rethinking his investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should sell,'' his younger brother said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tanner is staying the course. He shook his head, and then
ran off to the piles of muffins and cakes served up by his favorite
company.

<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ He got a prolonged standing ovation on the way
to the podium, and he was mobbed by autograph seekers on the way
out.
</P>
<P>
   But in between Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, fielded some
questions from his shareholders at the company's annual meeting
Wednesday that he might not have faced a week ago, questions about
whether his legal team had failed him and whether the company might
even be broken up in the wake of its antitrust fight with the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In the main, the 44-year-old co-founder of the company was
speaking to a friendly audience, composed of about 2,500
shareholders, and he reiterated his stance that Microsoft's
``innovations and behavior were completely fair and brought
tremendous benefits to millions of consumers.'' The meeting came
five days after a federal judge issued a harsh denunciation of the
company in the antitrust case, saying it had abused its monopoly
power to bully and thwart the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But during a question-and-answer session with the shareholders,
Gates did hear from one man who urged the company to ``try your
damnedest to see that this here suit is settled out of court.'' And
another man spoke of ``the feelings of disappointment at best that
I have and humiliation at worst that I have at how the case against
Microsoft was handled by our counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   With the company's general counsel and chief legal strategist,
William H. Neukom, seated on the dais with Gates, the shareholder
asked the chairman whether he might hire a new legal team so that
``we are not outrun and outmaneuvered by the government,'' putting
such a sarcastic emphasis on the word ``government'' that several
in the audience laughed or applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates launched into a defense of the company's legal
approach and, by implication, of Neukom, who sat silently through
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty important in a case like this not to look in a
very superficial way for someone to blame,'' said Gates. ``When the
government decides they're going to block innovation, your own
government decides they're going to take you to court and say you
should not make those kinds of advances, it's not going to be a
pleasant experience. It's not going to be something that anyone
should have to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said: ``The way we've put forth the story through our
internal and external counsel about why our work is good for the
economy, good for consumers, I'm quite proud of what's been done
there. I'm really quite supportive of what's been done there. We're
going to continue to tell that story.'' His remarks drew applause
from the audience, and many shareholders said afterwards that they
were fully behind Gates and his defense of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they should fight this,'' said Don Benusa, a retired
papermaker from Everett, Wash., who described himself as a ``small
shareholder'' of the company. ``Just because the company's a huge
success, the government comes after them. I don't like government
poking its nose into business.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Microsoft stockholders said they remained very high on
Gates, but agreed with the man who stood to criticize the company's
legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled at the whole way the case has been mishandled,''
said Leonard Samuels, who owns a small printing business in
Woodland Hills, Calif., and said he owns 4,200 shares of Microsoft
stock. ``They've made a mess of it. It should never have gotten to
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings, while not a final
verdict, have already had a financial impact. Shares in Microsoft,
the world's most highly valued company, fell for the third day
Wednesday, to $87.0625, down $1.75 for the day and almost 5 percent
below Friday's close. Still, even with the case pending, the
company has continued to enrich its investors, with its stock
rising more than 60 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's meeting, Gates and other company officials for
the most part maintained a calm and often smiling demeanor, even
when a loud fire alarm went off for a few moments in the convention
hall here. (A security official quickly cut in over the
loudspeakers to announce that it was a false alarm.) But the
company chairman did show a small flash of pique when he offered an
acerbic characterization of the government's case against his
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this lawsuit,'' he said, ``a software developer would
end up having to focus on questions like, is there anyone else
doing something similar? If so, we can't improve this product in
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is our innovation going to force competitors to work harder?''
he continued. ``If so, we can't improve the product in that way.
Someone might file a lawsuit! Are we providing any features at too
low of a price? Are they too good? Then someone might complain. The
net effect would be a chilling impact on innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, his pledge not to compromise with the government on the
company's ``freedom to innovate'' was met with widespread cheers
from the audience at the Meydenbauer Center here in Bellevue, just
a few miles from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gates and other company officials pledged not to
agree to any settlement that would force the giant software maker
to ``unbundle'' its Internet browser from its Windows operating
system, which currently powers the vast majority of computers
across the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to go a long way to address the government's
concerns,'' said Gates. ``But if we can't get Internet support, we
can't add any new features. No company should accept these kinds of
limitations on their ability to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``One of the most defensible things we've ever
done is to support the Internet in our operating system. We cannot
back off on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A question from another shareholder about whether the company
was making any contingency plans for a break-up, along the lines of
what was done in 1984 to AT&AMP;T Corp., was parried by Microsoft's
chief operating officer, Bob Herbold. He said company officials
firmly believed there was no justification for such an extreme
step.

PRAYER

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In a solemn encounter, three U.S. Army veterans and
four South Korean civilians who stood at opposite ends of a chaotic
incident half a century ago, met here Wednesday to pray in a
service of remembrance of that event, which the Koreans described
as a massacre by American forces.
</P>
<P>
   The service, held at a downtown church under the auspices of the
National Council of Churches, was the first meeting on American
soil between former soldiers and Korean survivors of the incident
in July 1950, the first month of the Korean War, in which as many
as 400 civilians were reportedly killed when they were strafed by
military planes and later machine-gunned by soldiers at a railway
bridge near a village called No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Although survivors and their families have demanded recognition
of the events at No Gun Ri for many years, the incident there was
not widely publicized in the United States until six weeks ago,
when the Associated Press published an account quoting survivors
and former soldiers of the 7th U.S. Cavalry who said many civilians
had been killed there.
</P>
<P>
   The service, at the Old Stone Presbyterian Church, showed that
the wounds of violence inflicted 49 years ago remain vivid in the
minds of those who were there and deeply painful, too. The
survivors who came here said they wanted an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The three soldiers, who emphasized they spoke only for
themselves, said they wanted to acknowledge the survivors' ordeal,
but asked for understanding of the circumstances in which the
incident occurred, with their units newly arrived from Japan,
undermanned and fearful after having been told by their commanders
that North Korean fighters had disguised themselves as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a translator, Chung Eun Yong, 76, who said his
son and daughter were killed and his wife was wounded in the
incident, said the shooting took place over about 60 hours, on July
26-29, 1950. ``We believe God will forgive the veterans and the
U.S. government when they repent their sins committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Chung spoke, one of the veterans present, Maj.
Robert ``Snuffy'' Gray, 75, who is retired, rose to speak briefly
for the three men.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one enjoys war at all,'' Gray said. ``Unfortunately, the
people who seem to suffer the most in a war zone are the civilians,
the people who should be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We very badly need an understanding,'' said Gray, a master
sergeant with the 7th Cavalry's 2nd Battalion, which was stationed
some distance to the west of the railroad bridge. ``We need a
joining of ways, to see if we can put things behind us, to see if
human beings can live side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the veterans said they felt sympathy for the
Koreans, but said they would not apologize for what they regarded
as a terrible incident of war, during which they as soldiers were
facing attacks from North Korean troops, suffered breakdowns in
communications equipment and were always under their commanders'
orders. ``It was a very confusing, chaotic mess,'' said 1st Lt.
Edward Daily, 68, who is retired. Referring to the incident, he
added, ``It's a very tragic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily, who was a corporal in 1950, said he saw civilians taking
refuge under two long, high arches that formed part of the railway
bridge on July 26, 1950. Shortly before dusk that day, he said, he
heard three or four shots and saw ``a muzzle flash'' from the area
where the civilians were gathered. At that point, he said, American
soldiers received an order to fire on the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   He said the shooting lasted about 20 minutes, stopped, then
resumed again for 10 more. Later that evening, he said, he was
ordered to take up a position about a mile and a half away from the
bridge. (In its account, the Associated Press reported that the
veterans it interviewed disagreed about whether shots had been
fired from among the Koreans.)
</P>
<P>
   Daily said he had traveled to South Korea last week and met for
several hours with five people who had survived the incident at the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   One of those present at the service Wednesday was Andrew Young,
a former American representative to the United Nations, who will be
installed on Thursday as the new president of the National Council
of Churches, an organization that represents 35 Protestant and
Eastern Orthodox denominations that is celebrating its 50th
anniversary in meetings here this week. Afterwards, Young, who is
an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, said, ``There
is always, in any conflict, a lot of unresolved guilt and anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without trying to cast blame, I think the church's mission is
to promote healing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's service originated in a request Daily made in a
letter to the Rev. Joan B. Campbell, general-secretary of the
National Council of Churches, for an event of remembrance.
Officials of the council said their organization, acting on a
request from its counterpart among the churches of South Korea, had
been trying to get the government to look into the incident for
months.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the veterans and the Koreans met privately
for an hour. Later in the afternoon, they emerged together for a
news conference in the Old Stone Church's office building. In that
event, two of the Koreans, Yang Hae Sook, 60, and Keum Cho Ja, 60,
described in detail their experiences at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they went to the railroad bridge after the groups they
were with had come under attack from an airplane they described as
an American bomber. Ms. Yang said she lost her left eye in an
explosion and survived under the bridge, once the shooting began,
by crawling under the bodies of the dead. Ms. Keum said she had
tried to flee from the bridge after the shooting started, but
suffered a stomach wound and was eventually taken to a hospital by
an American medic.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview conducted through a translator afterwards,
Chung said he was satisfied with the meeting and discussions with
the three veterans. Asked from whom the survivors wanted an apology
for the incident, he replied, ``Ultimately, the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had no statement on Wednesday's meeting, but did
say that five survivors of the incident will meet with Pentagon
officials on Friday morning in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As for the status of the investigation into the incident, an
Army official said, ``Our goal is to be done by June of next
year.'' More time might be necessary, however, because ``the bottom
line is we want to do this right,'' the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The investigation includes four different phases: preparation,
research and interviews, review and analysis, and finally the
writing and release of the final report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the first phase right now,'' the official said. ``We
are training the ones who will be doing the interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, the Army inspector general, traveled
to Korea on Oct. 28 and 29 to ``meet with the Korean contingent
that's doing a parallel review,'' the official said, adding, ``He
met with six survivors and went to the site.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ In five months of investigation and
exhumation of the dead in Kosovo, war crimes investigators have
found 2,108 bodies in grave sites throughout the province, the
chief prosecutor announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While there are several hundred more reported sites to be
examined in the spring, the number of the dead found so far seems
significantly lower than the estimate of 10,000 ethnic Albanians
killed by the Serbs, issued by Western officials, or the suggestion
by American and allied officials during the war that up to 100,000
were being killed.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the U.N. Security Council in New York, also
released here, the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Carla Del Ponte, said that the
bodies had been found in 195 sites before work stopped for the
winter, and that there were a total of 529 sites reported to
investigators so far.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Del Ponte cautioned that the number of dead was an interim
figure, and noted that ``we have discovered evidence of tampering
with graves,'' particularly at well-publicized suspected massacre
sites like Izbica, where investigators found no bodies after the
Serbian forces left Kosovo, but freshly turned earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also a significant number of sites where the precise
number of bodies cannot be counted,'' she said, adding that in some
places bodies had been burned and other steps taken to hide the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But a long investigation of the Trepca mine, where Albanians
said many bodies were brought for incineration, turned up no
evidence of any crime. Similarly, at Ljubenic, near Pec, a widely
publicized grave site said to hold 350 bodies only held five.
</P>
<P>
   A draft report by the State Department noted that an average of
only 17 bodies were found at examined sites, but says: ``We would
expect the total number of Kosovar Albanian deaths to be over
8,000'' once all the graves are inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior Western officials here say that the investigators
did look at the most serious sites first. While it is unlikely that
a firm and final death toll will ever be known, they suggested that
a figure of between 5,000 and 7,000 would be more likely. Some
suggested that 5,000 would be more logical, given what has been
found to date, and noting the simple difficulty of killing large
numbers of people and disposing of them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But officials also cautioned that some of the dead are fighters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army or may have died ordinary deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Del Ponte and her aides also noted that the tribunal's main
job is not to take a census of the dead, but to prepare legal
material to seek or extend indictments for war crimes against those
most responsible for the abuses of the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have in our possession invaluable documentation of what
happened to many people in many places in Kosovo,'' Mrs. Del Ponte
said. ``There is no substitute for this kind of accurate
information because it is evidence that eventually will stand up in
a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Moore, the tribunal spokeswoman here, said: ``A prosecutor
is not a statistician. The job is to gather evidence for
prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore noted that of the indictments on war crimes charges
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four other top
Yugoslav and Serbian officials, two charges cover the killings of
Albanians, but two also cover their forced expulsion, deportation
and persecution.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 Albanians were forced from their homes and out
of Kosovo, while many more thousands were living rough in the hills
inside the province. Albanian human rights groups note that several
thousand Albanians are reported missing, and it is unclear how many
of them may still be in Serbian jails _ nearly 2,000 according to
the International Committee of the Red Cross _ or abroad or dead
but undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Blerim Shala, the editor of the Albanian weekly Zeri and a
member of the Kosovo Transitional Council here, said that a
respected Albanian human rights group, the Kosovo Board for the
Protection of Human Rights, estimates that 7,000 Albanians were
killed during the war. Another 2,500 were killed in the previous
year, beginning March 1998, when the conflict between the Serbs and
the Kosovo Liberation Army intensified. Another 3,000 or so are
believed to be missing, Shala said.
</P>
<P>
   Daan Everts, the director of the mission in Kosovo for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that
morally the final number is not especially relevant, and noted that
those who were killed and abused were the subject of all the powers
of an organized state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how many people are still in the ground,'' he
said. ``And whether the number is smaller or larger doesn't take
away from the massive and organized violation of human rights by a
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy chief prosecutor, told
reporters at the United Nations that motive and method were more
important legally than the number of victims in proving genocide.
``It's really not a numbers game to determine whether genocide has
been committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the war, however, estimated death figures were very high.
On April 19, the State Department said that up to 500,000 Kosovar
Albanians were missing and feared dead. On May 16, Defense
Secretary William Cohen said that up to 100,000 Albanian men in
Kosovo had vanished and might have been killed. ``We've now seen
about 100,000 military-aged men missing,'' Cohen told CBS. ``They
may have been murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 17, a British foreign office minister, Geoff Hoon, said:
``According to the reports we have gathered, mostly from the
refugees, it appears that around 10,000 people have been killed in
more than 100 massacres.'' On Aug. 2, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N.
chief administrator in Kosovo, said 11,000 ethnic Albanians were
killed, and said his figure came from the tribunal, which denied
providing it.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish forensic team's experience has been typical. According
to the newspaper El Pais, the team was told to prepare for at least
2,000 autopsies. But it found 187 bodies, usually buried in
individual graves.
</P>
<P>
   The El Pais report has led some to revise their expectations of
the death toll, which Ms. Del Ponte's report sought to clarify
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Responding in the Security Council to the report, Russia's
deputy representative, Gennadi Gatilov, said that the tribunal
should also investigate crimes committed by Albanians against
Serbs. ``Otherwise, there will be grounds for accusing the tribunal
of double standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Pristina, the NATO-led peacekeeping troops issued
murder statistics since June 12, when NATO took control of the
province. Of the 379 people killed, 135 were Serbs, a
disproportionate number given that only about 5 percent of the
province's current population is believed to be Serbian. Of the
rest, 145 were ethnic Albanians, while 99 are of unknown or other
ethnicity, said Maj. Ole Irgens, a spokesman for the force.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report about to be released by the International
Crisis Group, the number of killings now in Kosovo is comparable to
the levels reported before the NATO intervention, when the Serbs
were struggling to defeat the Kosovo Liberation Army. The figure is
roughly 30 people killed a week in a province with a current
estimated population of 1.4 million.

FLIGHT 990 BEGAN `CONTROLLED DESCENT,' ACCORDING TO DATA RECORDER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs to correct spelling of `EgyptAir' in lede graf and to change
headline; story is now complete in one take.) (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first unusual event in the flight of EgyptAir
990 on Oct. 31 was the plane's autopilot disconnecting and then,
about eight seconds later, what appeared to be ``a controlled
descent'' that was smooth and straight, investigators at the
National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said such a descent would be very unlikely
unless the pilots were still flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Hall, the chairman of the safety board, gave only a
brief description of preliminary information from the flight data
recorder, the one ``black box'' that the Navy has retrieved so far
from the crash site, about 60 miles from Nantucket. However, the
information did not solve the mystery of why the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board badly wants to recover the cockpit voice
recorder, which could have information such as the pilots talking
to each other about the plane's problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the new information appeared to rule out two possibilities:
a malfunctioning autopilot throwing the plane into a dive, or
thrust reversers deploying by accident.
</P>
<P>
   A thrust reverser, used to help a plane brake after landing,
deployed in flight in 1991, causing the only crash of a Boeing 767
for mechanical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts said that the sketchy information released so
far painted a picture compatible with an emergency descent,
although there is no way yet to judge why the crew would initiate
one.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons could range from a variety of mechanical problems to an
explosion on board that could breach the plane's skin and cause a
loss of air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But the flight data recorder and radar data combined show that
even if the plane had some severe mechanical problem, it was still
under control at the beginning of its dive, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said that the data show an uneventful flight, with the
plane cruising levelly at 33,000 feet. ``The first event we note is
the autopilot disconnecting,'' Hallsaid in a briefing here, flanked
by officials of the Egyptian government and the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are not sure yet whether someone in the cockpit
flipped off the autopilot, which can be used to maintain altitude,
heading and speed, or whether the autopilot disconnected itself in
response to some problem on the plane that left it unable to follow
instructions. Manual disconnection of the autopilot, however, is an
early step in an emergency descent.
</P>
<P>
   About eight seconds after the autopilot disconnection, he said,
``the airplane begins what appears to be a controlled descent.'' In
cruise flight at authorized altitude, the plane would ordinarily
not change altitude without asking permission from air traffic
controllers, something that the crew did not do.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder quit capturing data late in the dive
but not at the end, when investigators say the plane pitched back
up, climbed more than a mile and a half, and then plunged again.
The last six or seven seconds of data has not yet been read from
the tape, according to people involved in the investigation,
because the tape itself, which resembles what is used in a standard
tape recorder, is contaminated by metals it picked up from the
spindles and the recording heads while it was under water. However,
the investigators are confident that they can eventually decipher
the data.
</P>
<P>
   The briefing by Hall seemed only to emphasize the need to
retrieve the other ``black box,'' the cockpit voice recorder, which
experts said could capture the sound of an explosion or mechanical
failure, or a discussion among people in the cockpit about the
reason for the descent. While it began as a controlled descent,
radar data indicates it later became faster than what the airplane
is designed for. Investigators said on Wednesday, however, that
they think it did not become supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash scene, the Navy has pulled back one ship and plans
to withdraw three more, including the Grapple, which is the support
ship for one of the robotic submarines, because seas are expected
to be too rough on Thursday for them to work. Instead, search
officials plan to re-supply them on Thursday and send then back out
in time to work on Friday, when smoother seas are predicted. A
commercial vessel, the Carolyn Chouest, remains on site with
another robot submarine, and will work ``as long as weather
conditions permit,'' Hall said.

   LIWANG, China _ Two years ago, Ma Xiuhua's family finally gave
up on the parched fields of their poor mountain village and moved
to this town to try their hand at buying and selling vegetables.
Tired of fighting years of drought, they said goodbye to the small
mud-brick house _ home to Ms. Ma, her husband, their two children
and her in-laws _ and set out to find an in-town apartment to rent.
</P>
<P>
   But with a combined income of $13 a month, the family could not
afford the new apartment blocks that line the road in this sleepy
rural township in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest
China, a sign of the bit of prosperity that has crept into even
China's most impoverished regions. So they pay $4 a month instead
for a more modest dwelling a little down the road: one room, no
view, poor light, no ventilation. It is, in fact, a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our village, there was no water and nothing to eat _ we had
to go down the mountain,'' said Ms. Ma, a shy 22-year-old, wearing
the white cap of the Muslim Hui minority. ``This is what we could
afford. We are very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as urban Chinese aspire to high-rise condos with
dishwashers and microwaves, cave-dwelling remains common in many
rural areas of northwest China, where the yellow loess soil is well
suited to digging caves. Though hardly the abode of choice,
cave-dwelling is a Chinese tradition dating back to the Neolithic
age, said Professor Shou Xing of Beijing University's Sociology and
Anthropology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   And even in modern times, caves have had their moments of glory:
during the 1934-35 Long March, Mao Tse-tung and his fellow
Communists hid in caves to avoid detection by Nationalist troops.
And so it is with a touch of pride that Ma Kuanca, Ms. Ma's
gray-bearded father-in-law, explains that the Mas' rental cave
dates back to at least revolutionary days _ although he concedes
that there is no evidence that Mao or anyone else famous ever slept
there.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Ma family, the bottom line is that a cave is the
best they can do, and they have tried to make this irregular
15-by-30-foot hole dug into a mountainside into a comfortable home,
papering curved earthen walls with old newspapers, hanging framed
family photos and buying a second-hand television set ``for the
young people'' to pass long winter nights. Their landlord has
rigged up electricity and a light bulb and affixed to the opening
in the mountainside a sturdy front door of wood.
</P>
<P>
   The front part of the cave has a small cooking stove, the
television and a small table. The back, set off by a cabinet and
hanging quilt, contains a bed where the extended family sleeps.
There is no toilet or running water, and the Mas, like the two
other families living in this row of caves, just beside a major
provincial highway, fetch water from a collecting pool, a quarter
mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no exact statistics about how many Chinese
people live in caves, many villages in northwest China's poorer
areas still have at least some residents who are cave dwellers,
although few are renters. In general, as these cave-dwellers
prosper a bit, they tend to move, or build houses. In farming
areas, the abandoned cave often serves as a barn for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have money; it was cheap,'' said Li Xia, the
matriarch of a family in the tiny mountain village of Kaicheng,
standing in front of the cave that she and her husband dug by hand
decades ago. It is a small dank structure with a wood and paper
door. For many years, subsistence farming provided the only
livelihood for families like the Lis, and the dusty brown soil of
southern Ningxia was rarely up to that task.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since the Chinese government started allowing people to
move around the country in search of transient work two decades
ago, a bit more cash has started to flow into this still
desperately poor region. Two sons of Ms. Li now work as coal miners
in distant provinces and bring money home. And about five years ago
the family built the two-room house just across a patch of dirt
from the cave, where Ms. Li lives with her daughters-in-law and
grandchildren. ``When we got money to build a house, we did _ it's
more sanitary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But among scholars and older rural Chinese, there remains a
certain nostalgia, even fondness, for the caves. Though stuffy and
damp, they provide good protection, a cocoon against the extreme
temperatures of this remote region.
</P>
<P>
   ``People moving out of caves is inevitable in the urbanization
process,'' said Shou. ``But that doesn't mean that caves are
backward. Also, they are a kind of folk culture and have great
historical value.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in this desolate area, where wood and other
construction materials are scarce, it is often debatable whether
the new houses are more than an aesthetic improvement over the
primitive caves they replace. Most houses are tenuous one- or
two-room structures, made of packed earth with mud and thatch
roofs, supported by a few wooden beams.
</P>
<P>
   Along the dirt road that wraps around the hillside in Kaicheng,
Ma Beili recently abandoned just such a house to return to his
former cave when rain soaked a support beam of the roof and rot set
in. A wizened 50-year-old farmer with an old straw hat and broad
grin, Ma (a common surname among the Hui Muslims) now pesters
visitors to check out his home: a tiny hole in the hillside with a
blanket for a door.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it is not much: farm tools, some bags of grain and a hard
narrow platform made of dried mud that is Ma's bed. Several
chickens, a mule and a large ox crowd a tiny dirt front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool in the summer, warm in the winter,'' said Ma, pointing to
the cave. ``Even when the house was still in good repair, in the
winter I would come to sleep here.''

 McKEON IS NAMED MANAGER OF THE YEAR  
(jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ Almost unappreciated in his own domain,
Jack McKeon was honored for his and his team's unexpected
performance this year by being named National League manager of the
year Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of 32 members of the Baseball Writers Association of
America gave the Cincinnati manager 17 first-place votes and a
total of 115 points, enough to make a second-place finisher of
Bobby Cox of Atlanta. Cox, whose Braves won their eighth
consecutive division championship despite some key injuries,
received 10 votes for first and 98 points overall.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker of Houston was third with 4 and 48, Buck Showalter
of Arizona was fourth with 1 and 17 and Bobby Valentine of the Mets
was fifth with 10 points based on 2 votes for second place and 4
for third.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, playing with the major leagues' 11th-lowest payroll,
were perhaps the biggest surprise of 1999. They won 96 games and
missed the playoffs only because of a loss to the Mets in a
one-game playoff for the National League wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the team's strong season, McKeon was unable to secure
the contract extension he wanted. He asked for two years; the Reds
offered one. He initially asked for $2.2 million for the two years;
they offered only a token raise to $550,000. He was paid $450,000
in salary this year and $50,000 in bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Reds' treatment of him, McKeon, the oldest active
manager in the majors at 68, accepted the offer. Asked about it
Wednesday, he chose not to return to what had been a sore point.
``Our negotiations are over,'' he said in a conference call. ``I'm
just happy to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have never explained why they didn't give McKeon the
second year, but speculation has been rampant that they want to
make Ken Griffey Sr., now one of their coaches, their manager.

MUHAMMAD'S PLACE IS SECURE, MORA SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indianapolis Colts' Coach Jim Mora said Wednesday that he would
not be reluctant to bring back the rookie defensive back Steve
Muhammad, whose pregnant wife, Nichole, died last Sunday, several
days after Muhammad was charged with domestic battery.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with New York area reporters, Mora was
asked if the events of the last week would make it difficult for
him to welcome Muhammad back to the team's roster. ``No, not at
all,'' Mora answered.
</P>
<P>
   Mora added that Muhammad has been granted an unlimited leave
from the Colts and will not play Sunday against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sympathetic to Steve Muhammad and his family and
saddened by his loss,'' Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Muhammad died Sunday of internal bleeding caused by
complications from childbirth, a coroner's report said. An autopsy
revealed that the premature labor was induced by injuries
apparently suffered in an automobile accident last Thursday, not
from minor injuries suffered in the Oct. 28 domestic battery
incident in which Muhammad was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Muhammad's infant daughter was delivered stillborn,
hours before her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy,'' Peyton Manning said. ``At this
point, we're going to respect Steve's privacy and what's going on
and him dealing with the loss of his wife. The funeral is this
week. Our prayers are with him as he recovers from the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I think it's important for us, as players,
to focus on the job at hand. We've got to prepare for the football
game.''

MOEING CONFIRMS UNAUTHORIZED FUEL TANK REPAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's string of airplane production problems
continue as the company confirmed Wednesday that mechanics have
made unauthorized fuel tank repairs to certain commercial
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly line workers in Everett, speaking on the condition that
their names not be used, said mechanics are making repairs on
Boeing 747, 767 and 777 fuel tank systems and failing to log their
work as required by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are removing and replacing fuel tank tubing in the
wings,'' one worker said. ``The danger is these guys are going in
after the cell (fuel tank) has been completed and not logging their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing spokeswoman Debbie Nomaguchi said ``we have no
evidence of a chronic problem,'' adding that there have only been a
few ``isolated cases'' of unauthorized work.
</P>
<P>
   She said all of the airplanes affected have been reinspected.
</P>
<P>
   She could not confirm whether work is not being logged, but she
acknowledged there have been a few cases in which mechanics had
re-entered a fuel tank after it was supposed to have been sealed
off after final inspection.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two cases, inspection putty was either missing or
not properly applied to fuel tank doors, Nomaguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   After fuel tanks are inspected, Boeing mechanics are required to
place putty across the door to show that the work has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a flight safety issue, it's just not following proper
procedures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing now requires that mechanics take classes and sign
statements that they understand federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nomaguchi said the ``integral fuel-tank integrity'' classes were
initiated last month partly because of the inspection putty
discovery and to standardize production procedures for the 747, 767
and 777 commercial jet models, which are assembled in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nomaguchi confirmed reports that debris is still
being discovered in airplanes after they have rolled off the
assembly line. The latest problems were reported in Thursday's
editions of The Herald, a newspaper in the hometown of Boeing's
biggest plant, Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with foreign objects being left in airplanes is not
a new one at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost every plane that goes to the flight line we get a
kitchen-sized garbage bag back full of FOD (foreign object debris,
such as rags, rivet guns and other tools,'' one worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Post-Intelligencer reported on several
instances in which airline mechanics reported finding flashlights
and tools that had been rattling around inside sealed areas of
Boeing airplanes, built in Everett, that had been delivered to the
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomaguchi said the number of customer reports of debris
being found in airplanes has ``significantly'' dropped over the
last several years.

JUDGING THE RETURN OF RICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He is two jobs removed from the school he vowed to
never leave. The love affair with UCLA that was supposed to last a
lifetime ended badly.
</P>
<P>
   We could be talking about Jim Harrick or Rick Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were rebuffed by their Bruin bosses in ways that
pierced their egos: Harrick, 61, was fired as the men's head
basketball before the 1996 season; Neuheisel, 38, was overlooked
for the offensive coordinator's job when it opened after the 1993
football season.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick continues to hold an industrial-sized grudge. He refuses
to talk to his successor, Steve Lavin; the father figure has
effectively disowned the son.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time after he was passed over for Bob Toledo,
Neuheisel wanted nothing to do with Terry Donahue, his college
coach and mentor, whom he had assumed he was being groomed to
succeed. It wasn't until after Donahue abruptly retired from UCLA
late in 1995 that the two men made amends.
</P>
<P>
   They ran into each other, quite literally, at the Dallas
airport, when Neuheisel finished using a pay phone and spun around
in the direction of his gate.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been Harrick and Lavin who bumped into each other like
that, the ensuing contact would have made Diana Ross' recent
tempest with a female security guard at London's Heathrow airport
seem as civilized as afternoon tea.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuheisel, the first-year coach at Washington, and Donahue
are nothing if not well-mannered. So they politely chatted like two
neighbors in their front yards, then arranged to meet for breakfast
in Orange County two days later to finish their fence-mending.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick and Lavin ought to try it some time. It's amazing what a
little whitewashing can do to spruce up one's reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a chance to put that stuff behind me,'' said
Neuheisel, who will return to the Rose Bowl on Saturday for the
first time since leaving the UCLA football program. ``It's neat to
be able to rekindle that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel is so good at putting out fires, it's a small wonder
the car he's leasing at Washington isn't red and shiny and equipped
with a siren, ladders and hoses, with a dalmatian riding shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   When life gives Neuheisel ashes, he has a way of using them to
help grow a garden. His bitter departure from UCLA became mulch for
his first head-coaching job, at Colorado, after spending one season
there as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, after compiling an overall record of 33-14,
Neuheisel bolted Boulder for Washington. That was in January.
</P>
<P>
   The fine print on his million-dollar contract hadn't even been
formalized when Neuheisel committed two NCAA recruiting violations.
That had a lot of locals wondering if Neuheisel was adequately
equipped to till the tradition-rich Washington program.
</P>
<P>
   Popular opinion in the Pacific Northwest held that this was
going to be a fallow year for Husky football, anyway, so Neuheisel
was given a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Seattle went sleepless when Washington opened the
season with losses to Air Force and BYU. As long as the Huskies
could extend to 22 their league-leading streak of consecutive
seasons without a losing record, Washington fans figured it would
be cause for contentment.
</P>
<P>
   That would explain why everyone in Seattle is feeling a little
keyed up these days even before their first cups of cappuccino.
Neuheisel has taken a team that was slotted to finish in the bottom
half in the league and brought it to the brink of its first
outright Pacific-10 championship in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel made a marvelous move in the fall when he added the
option to the offense and stuck with it even after it produced
spotty fireworks in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   It might not have taken a genius to figure out the option was a
perfect fit for junior quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo's startling
athleticism. But it took guts to continue making over the offense
in Tuiasosopo's image after there was no payoff in the first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's new players battled the ones he left behind in
Boulder in Week 3 and won by seven points despite being decided
underdogs. That was a cathartic win for Neuheisel and a catalyst
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel deserves credit for selling his new players on his
system and winning them over with his exuberant _ some of his older
colleagues might say, sophomoric _ coaching tactics. Think Anthony
Robbins meets Adam Sandler and you've got the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But all the motivational messages one man can bring wouldn't
amount to a thing if there was no one like Tuiasosopo to make sure
they got delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo has led the team on the field and off it. When a
defensive lineman walked out of a team meeting in a snit,
Tuiasosopo called him out and brought him back into the fold. Then
there's the matter of his severely bruised butt muscle, which was
horrible to look at but has hampered Tuiasosopo's breakneck style
not one bit.
</P>
<P>
   It's foot soldiers like that who give generals their stars.
</P>
<P>
   The people in his profession who call Neuheisel things like
``Boy Wonder'' aren't being mean, just maybe a little transparent.
In a profession that places a premium on dues-paying, Neuheisel _
the third-youngest head football coach in Division I and a
non-practicing lawyer _ is seen as something of a dilettante.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame people can't see Neuheisel's maturity for his
boyish face.
</P>
<P>
   He sure sounded all grown up when he said that knowing what he
knows now about being a head coach, he wouldn't have hired himself
over Toledo for that offensive coordinator's position, either.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, Neuheisel says there's no doubt about it:
Donahue made the right call.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I felt I was ready. I was chomping at the bit like
most guys,'' Neuheisel said. ``So when (Toledo) was given the job,
it was hard for me to understand. But when you're the head coach,
you can't always make the popular decision. You're stuck at times
having to make a gut call. When you just look at the two resumes
(his and Toledo's), you can see that Terry made the decision that
was in the best interest of his program.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew it would wind up being in the best interest of
Washington's program, too? &QL;

TEEN-AGER TO SPEND LIFE IN PRISON FOR SHOOTINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seventeen-year-old Kip Kinkel was sentenced to spend
the rest of his life in prison Wednesday, shortly after the Oregon
teen-ager read an apology for the shooting rampage he went on last
year that left his parents and two fellow high school students dead
and nearly two dozen people injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely loved my parents and had no reason to kill
them,'' Kinkel, who was 15 at the time of the May 1998 shooting,
told a courtroom in Eugene, Ore., Wednesday morning. ``I had no
reason to dislike or try to kill anyone at Thurston. I am truly
sorry for all of this.'' Still reading from a small sheet of white
paper, he added, ``These events have pulled me to a state of
deterioration and self-loathing that I didn't know existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's sentence, which totals more than 111 years in prison
without the possibility of parole, came after several emotional
days of testimony, including ones in which injured victims or
relatives of the dead spoke of the continuing pain and nightmares
caused by the attack and pleaded that Kinkel be locked up for life.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the defense, which plans to appeal Wednesday's
sentence, a Portland psychiatrist said last week that Kinkel never
would have turned violent had his mental illness been recognized
earlier and treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three years, he was fighting off an illness and no one
knew it,'' said Dr. William Sack, a specialist in child and
adolescent psychiatry at Oregon Health Sciences University. ``I
think if he could have been under treatment with appropriate
medication and appropriate follow-up, I do not think he would have
gone on to commit these acts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Jack Mattison, in his ruling Wednesday, said the
testimony had left him convinced that a jury would have found
Kinkel guilty of several counts of aggravated murder and would have
wanted him to spend his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mattison said Wednesday morning that the sentence ``needed to
account for each of the wounded, who rightly call themselves
survivors, and for Kinkel to know there was a price to be paid for
each person hit by his bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mortimer, the lead prosecutor in the case, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that the incident was a ``horrible,
horrible event'' that had ``torn this community in many ways that
can't be described.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all along been asking for a sentence where he would die
in prison,'' Mortimer said. ``And that was the ruling from the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the sentence, which can be commuted only by
the governor, Kinkel is not entitled to parole.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Kinkel confessed to killing his parents, Bill and
Faith Kinkel, as well as 16-year-old Ben Walker and Mikael
Nickolauson, 17, both students at Thurston High School in
Springfield, Ore., on May 21, 1998. He also confessed to wounding
22 students, shooting at three others, and attacking a detective
after his arrest. He used a semiautomatic rifle in the school
cafeteria, spraying the room with about 50 rounds in a minute and a
half before some students managed to wrestle him to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some clues to Kinkel's state of mind emerged during the
sentencing hearing. He was said to have told doctors that since the
age of 12 he had heard voices ordering him to kill, and his journal
contained passages telling of his self-loathing and fantasizing
that he might blow up his school or ``walk into a pep rally with
guns.'' But even the killer himself said he could not explain what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gone back in my mind hundreds of times and changed one
detail, one small event, so this never would have happened,'' he
said at Wednesday's hearings. ``I wish I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thurston High killings were part of a wave of killings in
schools by students in the last two years. It followed similar
shootings in Pearl, Miss., West Paducah, Ky., and Jonesboro, Ark.,
and preceded by a year the killing of 12 students and a teacher at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Victims and family members had little sympathy for Kinkel's
descriptions of illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe as anyone else does in karma, it's going to
come back to you,'' Laura Woodward, whose son, Kyle, suffers
continuing complications from three gunshot wounds inflicted by
Kinkel, said in court on Friday. ``'For you to be tortured and
troubled as we are is to me the final justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have my son,'' she continued, ``but I am also left with a
spirit of fear because of what you have done to us. We all have
nightmares, jump at loud sounds, have a lot of paranoia that none
of us had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Ryker, a Thurston student who helped tackle Kinkel to the
floor, said: ``I hope he lives with the mental images of what he
has done to us for the rest of his life. I've been rushed into an
adult world that wasn't really planned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kinkel's 22-year-old sister, Kristin, had used the
sentencing hearing to plead with the judge for a more lenient
sentence. ``What keeps me believing in him and loving him is the
fact that he is a good person that came from a good home,'' she
said to the judge, reading from her statement and breaking into
tears. ``I feel silly writing that, because it seems so
contradictory, looking at what actually took place. However, it's
the truth, and it keeps me alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkel's lawyer, Mark Sabitt, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday that he was ``profoundly disappointed'' in the judge's
decision. ``He's a sick kid, but he's not a throwaway,'' Sabitt
said. ``He deserves some hope for the future.''

BCS HAS 'EM BUMMED IN BLACKSBURG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They added five more computer rankings to cut down
on controversies in the Bowl Championship Series, but that hasn't
soothed the bruised egos in Blacksburg, Va., this week.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, which has no right to quibble after its
embarrassing victory over West Virginia, was chagrined to see
Tennessee leapfrog it into No.2 in the latest rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tech goes 11-0 and they don't get into the Sugar Bowl, it
will probably show the BCS isn't all it's cracked up to be,'' said
Mike O'Neill, sports editor of Tech's student newspaper, Collegiate
Times. ``The students are worried about it. But after the close
call against West Virginia, people are more worried about Tech
winning their last three games (Miami, Temple and Boston
College).''
</P>
<P>
   The locals are convinced that Tennessee will be hurt in strength
of schedule by this week's game with Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   But Hokies coach Frank Beamer has been true to his word all
season: He'll play all the games and let the computers and polls
sort everything else out. Perhaps that's why he didn't rip the
entire BCS system when he discovered his second-ranked Hokies had
been passed by the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along you play your games and the two best teams
will play at the end,'' Beamer said, playing the temporary role of
gracious loser.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer might not be so humble in three weeks, because the Hokies
could keep losing ground based on their own strength of schedule.
Unlike Tennessee, they don't have a conference championship game to
provide that final push at the end.
</P>
<P>
   And Virginia Tech might be lucky just to win its remaining games
against Miami, Temple and Boston College. The Hokies have beaten
Miami the last four years but lost to Boston College (20-14 in
1996) and Temple (28-24 in 1998) during that same span.
</P>
<P>
   Mad coach: After losing 37-0 to Oklahoma, Missouri coach Larry
Smith showed up for a brief (18 seconds) postgame interview session
with blood oozing from his right hand. He apparently had hit
something after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen this tailback? On Saturday morning, the Lawrence
(Kan.) Journal World published a photo of Kansas tailback David
Winbush superimposed on a milk carton. The implication, of course,
was that Winbush has been missing most of the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas' first nine games, he'd rushed for 370 yards, compared
to his 974 total yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   After rushing for 111 yards against Baylor, Winbush said,
``Yeah, I'm off the milk carton now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a happy family: The frustration over its worst offensive
performance in 35 years and perhaps missing a bowl bid for the
first time since 1988 has Ohio State fighting off-field problems in
tandem with the obvious on-field concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Cooper suspended linebacker Tim Cheatwood from
practice and Saturday's game against Illinois for his actions
during and after a 23-7 loss Saturday at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Cheatwood had to be restrained by teammates after shouting and
throwing his helmet on the sidelines. OSU players and
administrators confirmed those details and said Cheatwood also had
to be restrained in the locker room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second quarter, wide receiver Ken-Yon Rambo shoved
co-captain Matt Keller's arm away when Keller ran 30 yards
downfield to console Rambo after he dropped a certain touchdown
pass.
</P>
<P>
   No thrill in Rose Bowl: The cold reality of Penn State's plummet
from No.2 in the national rankings and the BCS standings is perhaps
best summarized by this statement from offensive tackle John Blick
in the aftermath of the Nittany Lions' 24-23 loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win our next two (games), we can end up in the Rose
Bowl,'' Blick said. ``I never thought that would sound so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   First time for everything: Penn State's last-play loss to
Minnesota was the first in coach Joe Paterno's 34-year career as a
head coach and first at Penn State since Cal scored on a Hail Mary
pass on the final play of a 21-17 victory over the Lions on Oct.
10, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   That was the season before Paterno took over in State College.
</P>
<P>
   New bowl: The Mobile Bowl, which can choose any bowl-eligible
WAC team after the league champion, looks to have its sights set on
TCU. The Alabama-based game prefers to match up its Conference USA
representative with a WAC team from the Central Time Zone. Of those
teams, TCU and Rice are the clear favorites and the Frogs, by
winning their final three games, should secure the bid.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if they'll have more fun there than they did in El Paso? &QL;

SURPRISE, LATE FALL MEANS UPLAND GAME-BIRDS OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spend much time listening to hunters who target
upland game birds and you'll quickly find that September and
October are the months when their juices really flow. Season
openers for dove, quail and chukar _ it's all they can talk about.
</P>
<P>
   When mid-November rolls around, their steam has largely
dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is a phenomenon in hunting circles known as
the second season. It applies to dove: The early season runs Sept.
1-15; once the birds have a chance to recover, another opportunity
will open to hunters Saturday and run through Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In the larger scheme of things, however, this time of the year
is a second chance for a larger array of hunters, because Saturday
also marks the season opener for pheasant and the fall opener for
wild turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this general-hunting tripleheader _ ``a hunting grand
slam,'' said Department of Fish and Game associate biologist Jim
Davis of Big Bear Lake _ is largely lost on much of the hunting
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an underappreciated time, without a doubt,'' said avid
bird hunter Andy McCormick, spokesman for Turner's Outdoorsmen at
its Chino headquarters. ``In a sense, it's a forgotten season.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons being:
</P>
<P>
   _The Sept. 1 early dove opener is the country's single most
popular hunting date on the calendar; the fizzle is long gone now
and it is hard to get shooters motivated again.
</P>
<P>
   _Unlike in the spring turkey-hunting season when the birds are
mating, they don't respond well to calls _ the bread-and-butter
technique of gobbler shooters.
</P>
<P>
   _Pheasants are far from abundant in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   For recreationists like McCormick, the fewer the hunters the
better; there will be just that many more birds for them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like McCormick, many hunters are willing to share the
secrets of fall dove, turkey and pheasant hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of guys have not made the effort to experience
this second season and, once they do, they won't forget it and
they'll go again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the second season opener for dove was probably one
of the best I've ever experienced. And I expect it to be just as
good, especially if you travel to the Blythe area (of eastern
Riverside County). Dove like the warmer weather, definitely, and
we're having an Indian Summer. Plus, you can also quail, goose and
duck hunt out by the (Colorado) River (a veritable mecca for upland
game birds).''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, another nicety of the ``second chance'' in the
southeastern part of the state is that there are overlapping
hunting seasons. ``More of a cornucopia available to you,''
McCormick explained.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, if you managed to pick up a deer tag before they sold out
for the D12 hunt zone of eastern San Bernardino, Riverside and
Imperial counties, you could even bring home some venison with
those dove breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Late-fall upland bird hunting is largely a
try-it-you-might-like-it proposition. For those who try it, Davis
offers his best advice: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dove
</P>
<P>
   With many of the grain fields they subsisted on in late summer
and early fall having been harvested, the birds are much more
dispersed seeking natural forage. Subsequently, those up for a
challenge enjoy the second season because they must scout different
areas. The good thing is, birds usually are always around.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is that watering holes remain great places
to ambush birds in early morning and late afternoon. Problem is,
the season has been unseasonably warm and dry. Look in the
foothills now _ any open field with natural or man-made bodies of
water. &QL; 
Turkey
</P>
<P>
   With their sensitive ears and sharp peepers, ``They are the
masters of alluding the hunter in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they don't call well, hunters often must track the birds
deeper into the backcountry, meaning only the more hardy need apply
here. Once they are found, the trick tactic is to break apart the
flock _ physically run into the gathering to disperse them _ then
wait for the fowl to reassemble.
</P>
<P>
   This season gobblers are of average abundance in the San
Bernardino Mountains, where the largest Southland concentrations
are found.
</P>
<P>
   On the range's northern slopes, look in places other than the
traditional hot spots _ Crab Flats, Deer Mountain, Upper Deep Creek
_ since the 65,000-acre Willow Fire in July burned out many birds
and may have killed some. Hunters should concentrate on the public
lands _ San Bernardino National Forest _ on the west, north and
east side of Lake Arrowhead. In the upper Santa Ana River area,
check out Manzanita, Converse and Barton flats and the east side of
Jenks Lake. Search for oak woodland and mixed conifer with open
patches of ground and key on riparian corridors with springs and
seeps in nearby canyons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pheasant
</P>
<P>
   While the dry Southland is a tough environment for pheasants,
good numbers of birds _ outside of hunting clubs or staged hunts _
can be found in the San Jacinto Wildlife Area of Riverside County,
(909) 654-0580, and the Wister Unit of Imperial County's Imperial
Wildlife Area, (760) 359-0577.
</P>
<P>
   These birds often provide the most excitement because they are
so gaudy _ the jackpot of fall that harkens notions of classic
scenes of flushing pheasant in the cornfields of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: ``Most pheasants on the ground haven't been
hunted in a year, so they're more apt to be found since they aren't
as wary. Of course, that lasts only till opening day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the hunt
</P>
<P>
   Dates of the general-hunting season for upland game birds,
followed by daily bag limits and makeup, possession limits and any
other restrictions that might apply. All regulations are statewide,
except where noted.
</P>
<P>
   Pheasant: Saturday through Dec. 12; two males per day for the
first two days, three males per day after the second day;
possession limit _ double the daily bag.
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkey: Saturday through Nov. 28 (second season); one bird
of either sex; one per season; no fall hunting in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   Dove: Saturday through Dec. 27 (second season); 10 birds of one
species or a mixed bag; double the daily bag.
</P>
<P>
   Band-tailed pigeon: Dec. 18-26 (Southern California only); two
birds per day and in possession.
</P>
<P>
   American crow: Dec. 4 to April 5; 24 birds per day and in
possession.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Fish and Game's upland game bird regulation
handbook is available wherever hunting licenses are sold. Hunter
information: DFG, (562) 590-5132.

BOEING CONFIRMS UNAUTHORIZED FUEL TANK REPAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's string of airplane production problems
continue as the company confirmed Wednesday that mechanics have
made unauthorized fuel tank repairs to certain commercial
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly line workers in Everett, speaking on the condition that
their names not be used, said mechanics are making repairs on
Boeing 747, 767 and 777 fuel tank systems and failing to log their
work as required by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are removing and replacing fuel tank tubing in the
wings,'' one worker said. ``The danger is these guys are going in
after the cell (fuel tank) has been completed and not logging their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing spokeswoman Debbie Nomaguchi said ``we have no
evidence of a chronic problem,'' adding that there have only been a
few ``isolated cases'' of unauthorized work.
</P>
<P>
   She said all of the airplanes affected have been reinspected.
</P>
<P>
   She could not confirm whether work is not being logged, but she
acknowledged there have been a few cases in which mechanics had
re-entered a fuel tank after it was supposed to have been sealed
off after final inspection.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two cases, inspection putty was either missing or
not properly applied to fuel tank doors, Nomaguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   After fuel tanks are inspected, Boeing mechanics are required to
place putty across the door to show that the work has been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a flight safety issue, it's just not following proper
procedures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing now requires that mechanics take classes and sign
statements that they understand federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nomaguchi said the ``integral fuel-tank integrity'' classes were
initiated last month partly because of the inspection putty
discovery and to standardize production procedures for the 747, 767
and 777 commercial jet models, which are assembled in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nomaguchi confirmed reports that debris is still
being discovered in airplanes after they have rolled off the
assembly line. The latest problems were reported in Thursday's
editions of The Herald, a newspaper in the hometown of Boeing's
biggest plant, Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with foreign objects being left in airplanes is not
a new one at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost every plane that goes to the flight line we get a
kitchen-sized garbage bag back full of FOD (foreign object debris,
such as rags, rivet guns and other tools,'' one worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Post-Intelligencer reported on several
instances in which airline mechanics reported finding flashlights
and tools that had been rattling around inside sealed areas of
Boeing airplanes, built in Everett, that had been delivered to the
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomaguchi said the number of customer reports of debris
being found in airplanes has ``significantly'' dropped over the
last several years.

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE NEAR A DEAL ON SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in Congress said Wednesday night
that they were closer to striking a budget deal with the White
House, despite differences over education, the environment,
abortion and $926 million in back dues that the United States owes
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, no serious disputes over money remained. The
Republicans have agreed to roughly $3.2 billion in White House
requests for new spending for a variety of programs, a senior
Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert said an agreement on the budget could be
reached rapidly. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, showed little confidence in a quick deal. He said the
Senate would schedule no votes until Wednesday, the day that the
newest stop-gap resolution keeping the government open without a
real budget expires.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress pushing to leave for the year, the day began with
Hastert's returning a telephone call from President Clinton, who
left a message for him Tuesday night, asking to talk about the
budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker asked the president to give a little in the talks.
His aides said Hastert told the president that ``it's time for your
side to break loose'' and compromise on the intractable policy
issues that have stalled the spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The two discussed the issues dividing them, laying out their
differences and voicing a desire to reach agreement, especially on
the teachers issue. ``Both sides suggested that an agreement could
and should be reached,'' a senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert then rallied his Republican troops at a closed meeting
in the Capitol, calling on them to hang together, stay in town and
vote on the still-unwritten bills.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to break for a Veterans Day weekend, return next
week and then quickly end this session, every day of which brings a
new Democratic attack accusing them of failing to agree to measures
for gun control, health care and overhauling campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats stepped up the pressure with a new television
advertisement. The 30-second ad shows a slow panorama of a
graveyard as an announcer intones, ``Congressional Republicans are
killing initiatives for working families and sending them to their
legislative graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican rank and file were restless before the meeting
with Hastert. ``I want to get out of here,'' Hastert said,
according to his staff and several Republican members at the
meeting. ``You want to get out of here. But we're not going to cut
a bad deal to get out of here.'' The members applauded him,
according to those present.
</P>
<P>
   So the Republicans went to work with their Democratic
counterparts in Congress and the White House budget director, Jack
Lew, trying to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   The differences included White House requests for more money and
rewritten policies in four unresolved major spending bills _ a $314
billion measure for labor, health and education programs, a $39
billion bill for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments, and a
$15 billion measure for the Interior Department and another $15
billion bill for foreign aid. A fifth bill, now complete, contains
$429 million for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to put the pieces of a grand deal together
all day,'' said Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee. The appropriations committees
control the 13 spending bills in the budget, five of which are
still unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   The budget talks have been tense, participants said, sometimes
confrontational, sometimes congenial. ``Like an average marriage,
it has its ups and down,'' a key participant said. The cordial
Young, the crusty Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and the calm but
contentious Lew have been talking for nearly 100 hours since Sunday
afternoon. Arguments have broken out, but the talks have never
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   Three major policy issues remain, beyond the question of how to
pay for the new spending the Republicans have agreed to with the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a deal on the U.N., we don't have a deal on
teachers and we don't have a deal on the environmental riders,''
the senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. dues will not be paid until a separate dispute is
solved. Republicans want no federal money to flow to international
organizations that lobby for changes in abortion laws overseas, and
have chained the two issues together.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority whip, Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the two
sides were ``very close'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A deal on the teachers issue was close, too, a senior White
House aide said. Clinton sought $1.4 billion to hire new teachers
to reduce class sizes in public schools; the Republicans had
offered $1.2 billion for school districts to spend mostly as they
please. In a compromise, the two sides agreed to spend $1.3
billion, to allow up to 20 percent of the money to go to train
teachers, and to monitor the progress of the program closely, the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental riders, or amendments, are legislative favors
for the oil, gas, mining, ranching and timber industries that
Republican senators favor and environmentalists oppose. They remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pieces of a grand deal'' that Young described included
agreements on an additional $1.45 billion for labor, health, and
education; $640 million more for the Commerce, Justice and State
Department bill; $384 million more for the Interior Department and
$800 million for foreign operations, said Young's committee staff
director, James Dyer, and a White House budget official.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have agreed to back most of the money Clinton
wanted for hiring 50,000 local police officers and for peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo, the White House said. But neither side has
agreed on how to pay for the new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert ordered members to return at noon on Friday and to be
ready to pass the spending bills that night. The chamber rumbled
with muted groans as the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, made
the announcement Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Between the $3.2 billion agreed to by the Republicans and
additional spending they have added to the bills, Congress and the
White House will need at least $6 in spending cuts to make the
budget balance and keep it from dipping into the Social Security
surplus. The Republicans will face a rank-and-file rebellion if the
spending bills touch the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans plan to try to pass all the bills at once, in an
omnibus package. The bills still have not been rewritten to reflect
the negotiations that have passed between the White House and
Congress, and among Republicans and Democrats in conferences. Each
may contain new potential pitfalls added in closed-door conferences
that could threaten their passage when the House takes them up, and
the Senate takes them up, no earlier than Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My optimism of this morning has been tempered,'' Lott said
Wednesday night.

   LOS ANGELES _ Q -- How do you deal with a manager who sounds
friendly and interested in the employees' ideas, but underneath
this facade insists that everything be done her way? She uses all
sorts of fancy management language, and she talks about employee
empowerment, but it's nothing more than talk. G.H.
</P>
<P>
   A -- In the political arena, this type of leader is referred to
as a benevolent dictator. Under her leadership, you are free to do
whatever you want, as long as you do whatever she wants.
</P>
<P>
   She may have considerable ability to absorb managerial concepts
and then verbalize them, such as her talk about employee
empowerment, but she does not realize the value that is associated
with applying this type of principle. The only empowerment that
truly interests her is her own.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees appreciate the structure, predictability and
security that is associated with her style of management. There is
minimal risk-taking, decision-making and change. Of course, this
also means that there tends to be minimal opportunity for
creativity, individuality and personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   If these latter factors are important to you, the reality is
that you are not likely to find them under this manager. However,
you should still try to discuss your ideas with her, and be sure
that you provide compelling and factual support for your
suggestions. It is possible that she may open the door to your
input. At the same time, if this door is permanently locked,
perhaps it is time for you to be thinking about a different door at
this company.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- One of the people in our group went to a prestigious
college and constantly brings it up. No matter what kind of project
we are working on, sooner or later, he relates it to something
about his college. We are all college grads, and we're not
impressed with him or his college. We've tried to get the message
across, but he doesn't get it. How do we deal with him? B.T.
</P>
<P>
   A -- He may be deservedly proud of his college classes, but his
behavior shows no class at all. Rather, it points to a good deal of
insecurity. If he were confident and comfortable with his career
progress and accomplishments, he would have far less need to keep
bringing up his prestigious college days.
</P>
<P>
   This means there is a real possibility that his collegiate
stories will diminish as he experiences some major success in his
current position. Unfortunately, his fixation with his college days
may prevent him from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He probably does not realize that recent studies are showing
that success after college depends more on the individual than on
the college the individual attended. The fact is, the college may
help a person get that first job, but then something called
performance tends to predominate.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you have already told him that his college-speak
is not appreciated, so perhaps the next step is to try to help him
be more successful in the job. If your discussions with him focus
more on present and future projects, objectives and performance,
perhaps he will be less likely to focus on the past.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- During a job interview a few days ago, the interviewer took
several phone calls and his secretary came in three or four times.
I thought this was rude and inconsiderate, and I think the
interruptions prevented me from doing well. What is your take on
interruptions in job interviews? T.K. &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 3,3!tag!A!off! It sounds as though you just went
through an amateur interview, and if you are seeking a professional
company, this type of treatment may be giving you some real insight
into the way this company operates.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there can be interruptions during a job interview if
there is a bona fide emergency. However, the phone calls and
intermittent secretarial visits you described did not appear to
have any sense of urgency, or for that matter, any sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, job interviews should be private and free of
interruptions. In fact, interruptions create real problems for the
interviewers as well as for the interviewees. Interruptions can
cause interviewers to get distracted, miss key points, omit
necessary follow-up questions, and generally obtain an inaccurate
picture of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the interviewee, interruptions break their train of
thought, prevent them from providing full information, generate
feelings of frustration, and raise questions about the company
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In today's tight labor market, one important factor that
determines an applicant's interest in a company is the way in which
he or she is treated during the interview process. Companies that
allow countless interruptions during job interviews are also
allowing countless applicants to slip away.

CLINTON CITES HARLEY-DAVIDSON IN PUSHING HIS TRADE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YORK, Pa. _ President Clinton on Wednesday saluted a
much-exported American icon, the Harley-Davidson motorcycle, in an
effort to prepare the political ground for two high-stakes trade
negotiations that are already touching off raucous debate in
Washington and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton donned a leather Harley-Davidson jacket at the
company's factory in York and mused about the possibility of
becoming a biker at the end of his presidency, half of his economic
team was in Beijing in a last-ditch effort to strike a deal with
China that could vastly open the market for American producers.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton said nothing about the tense talks,
Harley-Davidson was a fitting backdrop: It has had huge sales
success in Japan, home ground for its arch-rival Honda, but it
remains barred from the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   In a small meeting with workers here, and then a campaign-style
speech in front of the factory's 2,700 workers, Clinton spent much
of the day trying to build support for America's position at the
round of global trade negotiations that start in Seattle at the end
of November.
</P>
<P>
   Already the administration is reeling from criticism that it has
mismanaged the agenda, and that the streets will be dominated by
environmentalists, economic nationalists and union members who all
have their complaints about the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want y'all to watch Seattle when it rolls around,'' he said
of the talks, which start Nov. 30 and will probably take years to
complete. ``I'll have more demonstrators against me than I've had
in the whole seven years I've been president. I'm kind of looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be the only one who is. Clinton's aides fear that the
global talks that they proposed are now out of hand. The United
States wants to focus on agriculture and issues like keeping the
Internet free of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to labor and environmental groups, the United States
has also proposed setting up a ``working group on trade and labor''
within the WTO and to conduct an environmental review of the impact
of trade talks. But that is not likely to satisfy opponents who
fear that the trade group now has the power to override national
environmental safety laws, or labor groups that want worldwide
standards on minimum wages and employment conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations oppose many of those proposals. Meanwhile,
Japan and Europe want to use the talks to attack U.S. anti-dumping
laws, which they say are used as a U.S. trade barrier to keep out
foreign steel and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton went into none of that detail in his visit
Wednesday. Instead, he offered a series of arguments about why
trade helps American workers and consumers, and he cited
Harley-Davidson, which exports 66,000 cycles a year. ``In spite of
all those numbers,'' Clinton said, ``there's more debate on whether
trade is good for us now than there was in 1992.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's critics on trade policy say that events like
Wednesday's are too late, and that the president _ fearful of
alienating Democrats and his traditional supporters _ has been too
timid on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true we are in worse trouble on trade now than we were in
'92,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who has often sided with
Clinton on trade issues. ``But I put a lot of blame for this at the
feet of the president himself. Since NAFTA and the GATT agreement,
there has been no leadership on this from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response has mixed new arguments and old. He has made
the case that few politicians dare to utter: That rising imports
are a sign of the health of the U.S. economy, and help keep
inflation low and competition keen. But his conversation Wednesday
with workers about the administration's effort to eliminate trade
barriers could have taken place in the 1980s _ he even used the
example of a Japanese restriction on imported skis that hurt
American ski manufacturers. In fact, that problem was largely
solved before he took office.

SEATTLE AND GRIFFEY SUITORS FAR APART
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ The pursuit of Ken Griffey Jr., one of the
most attractive players ever available in baseball's trade mart,
seems likely to continue until one side, the Seattle Mariners, or
the other, the teams they're talking to, blinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have established a steep price for Griffey, who has
said he wants to play closer to his Orlando, Fla., home, and no one
has rushed forward with an offer to meet that price. The New York
Mets and the Cincinnati Reds have been the teams most active in
talks with the Mariners. The St. Louis Cardinals and the Houston
Astros have also registered their interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, who had been the early favorite, have shown
no ostensible interest in trying to acquire Griffey. Neither have
the Cleveland Indians or the New York Yankees, unless they are
operating in super silence.
</P>
<P>
   But an executive of another club said he suspected that the
Yankees, and perhaps the Braves, too, were involved. ``I will never
discount the Yankees,'' he said, ``in anything that involves a
major player.''
</P>
<P>
   No deal appeared imminent Wednesday, and none is likely to occur
unless the Mariners decide to reduce the price for Griffey or one
of the other teams decide to meet the higher price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some good discussions,'' Pat Gillick, the Mariners'
general manager, said Wednesday at the general managers' meetings.
``This is quite a player. Here's a fellow closing in on 400 home
runs, 30 years old, 11 years in the big leagues, plays a skill
position, center field. He's quite a player so I think the price
should be high.''
</P>
<P>
   The price teams are willing to pay in players is affected by
Griffey's contractual status. He has only one year left on his
contract and can be a free agent after next season. If a team
trades for him, then fails to sign him, it will lose him after
having already lost the players it traded for him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Toronto Blue Jays did with Shawn Green and the Los
Angeles Dodgers, Gillick said the Mariners will not allow anyone to
talk to Griffey and negotiate a contract before a trade is
completed. Gillick acknowledged that his stance could prompt teams
to offer less of a deal but accepted that potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday morning, the Mariners apparently had not told
the Mets what they wanted for Griffey. The Mets, however, figured
that Seattle would ask for a package that would include Roger
Cedeno, the heir apparent to Rickey Henderson as the Mets' leadoff
hitter, and Octavio Dotel, the highly regarded young pitcher
everyone has asked the Mets about this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, said the Reds
couldn't give the Mariners what they wanted and remain competitive.
But the idea of acquiring Griffey still intrigued him. Bowden
wasn't even concerned about taking the risk of having Griffey for
only a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, we would take him for one year,'' Bowden said.
``We'll see what he does to our season-ticket base, our fans, our
merchandising, our revenue. We'll see how our team does. His
father's on our coaching staff, his agent is two miles from the
stadium, he went to Moeller High School, we're going to have a
short right field porch at our new stadium. There are a lot of
positive things there.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bowden added, the Reds aren't willing ``to give up our
future for him,'' adding, ``If we don't have him a year from now,
we don't want to be stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals enter the Griffey chase with experience on that
subject. They traded for Mark McGwire in 1997 guaranteed only to
have him for two months and wound up signing him to a contract that
could keep him in St. Louis through the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we need to at least pursue,'' Walt Jocketty,
the Cardinals' general manager, said. ``We may be way out of our
league trying to get him, what it may cost us playerwise and money,
but people thought we were crazy when we talked about McGwire.
Having those two guys in the same lineup together would be awesome.
We could sellout our park before opening day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, said he has
expressed interest to the Mariners but added: ``It's not my top
priority. I think it's a long shot at best for a club like ours.''

HUSKIES QB MAKING HIS MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Neuheisel, who knows just a little bit about what it takes
to play quarterback in college, looked at Marques Tuiasosopo a
couple of years ago and saw a safety or linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   At the same juncture, Manu Tuiasosopo, whose knowledge of the
quarterback position came from lining up on the other side of the
football at St. Anthony High, UCLA and in the NFL, looked at his
eldest son and saw a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, who was the head coach at Colorado when the younger
Tuiasosopo graduated from Woodinville (Wash.) High in 1997, didn't
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruited him at Colorado to be a defensive player because
his high school ran an option offense,'' said Neuheisel, the UCLA
quarterback on the 1983 Rose Bowl champions. ``His father, who's an
old Bruin, and I worked football camps with him. I wanted to be
real honest with him, so I said `I think Marques is going to be a
defensive player.' He said, `That's fine, but I disagree' and I'm
glad he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington ended up beating out UCLA for the younger Tuiasosopo,
which became an especially nice turn of events Neuheisel when he
moved from Boulder to Seattle in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's anybody in the country who's more
difficult to defend,'' said Arizona coach Dick Tomey, ``because
he's got the kind of throwing arm that can be a threat and yet
they're running the option. (It's) a devastating combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey said that after the 6-foot-2, 215-pound junior passed for
208 yards and two touchdowns as the Huskies continued their run for
the Rose Bowl with a 33-25 victory on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That performance came seven days after Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham saw Tuiasosopo complete 19 passes in 32 attempts for 302
yards and rush 22 times for 207 yards with two touchdowns in a
35-30 Washington victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we don't see as much option and see the quarterback
we faced because I thought he was darn, darn good,'' Willingham
said after Tuiasosopo became the first player in NCAA history to
pass for 300 yards and run for 200 yards in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is Bob Toledo and the UCLA Bruins, who host Washington
on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at the Rose Bowl. A Washington win
clinches a tie for the Pac-10 title and almost assures a return
trip to Pasadena on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds a way to make plays and is a warrior,'' said Toledo.
``We've all seen how beat up and banged up he is and he still goes
in to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo has played the past two with a deep bruise of the
left hip and buttock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had guys playing with sprained ankles and broken
bones,'' Tuiasosopo said. ``It was the worst bruise I've ever had,
but it was still just a bruise. I thought, `Man, there's no way I
cannot play'.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred on the opening series of the Stanford game
when he was knocked on his rear by Cardinal linebacker Sharkus
Steen and Tuiasosopo hasn't been without a nasty purple-and-black
bruise since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean he could hardly walk at halftime (against Stanford),''
Washington receiver Dane Looker said. ``It was just one of the
greatest performances I've ever been a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel walked into the locker room after the Stanford game
and handed the game ball to his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood up,'' Neuheisel said, ``told the team how much he
appreciated them, how honored he was to play with the guys in that
room and them promptly gave the ball to the offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt why he was voted captain by his teammates despite
entering the year with three starts in two seasons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly our players have a great deal of admiration for
Marques well before he played through pain,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo threw for 270 yards and two touchdowns after taking
for an injured Brock Huard in the third game of the 1997 season and
later that year, became the first true freshman to start at
quarterback in school history. He started two games as a sophomore
and has flourished in in first season as a full-time starter. He
leads the Pac-10 in total offense (271.2 yards per game), is fifth
in passing (133.2 ypg) and 11th in rushing (53.2).
</P>
<P>
   Considering the bloodlines, his success shouldn't be much of a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a four-year starter on the defensive line and
three-time all-conference selection at UCLA and an eight-year
veteran in the NFL with Seattle and San Francisco. Several of his
cousins and uncles played collegiately and in the NFL, including
Jesse Sapolu, who won four Super Bowl titles with San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has been said about the bloodlines on my father's
side,'' said Tuiasosopo, whose parents, Manu and Tina, were high
school sweethearts at St. Anthony. ``On my mom's side there are
also some athletes. Her uncle (St. Anthony legend Johnny Olszewski)
was an All-American running back at Cal. The bloodlines on both
sides are pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-year starter in football, basketball and baseball at
Woodinville, Marques was a Press-Telegram Best in the West
selection in football, and played in the Area Code baseball games
at Blair Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a blast,'' Tuiasosopo said. ``I love the guys I'm
playing with. I'm doing what I've always dreamed of (which is)
playing quarterback at this level.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Whoops. Vice President Al Gore had a good
laugh Tuesday making fun of Gov. George W. Bush's unfamiliarity
with various world leaders. But it turns out that Gore was not
totally up to the minute himself on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was making fun of Bush's failure in a pop quiz to identify
the leaders of four world hot spots. In an appearance Tuesday on
the radio program ``Imus in the Morning,'' Gore, in deadpan
seriousness, dropped the names of leaders from some very obscure
places.
</P>
<P>
   One of the places was Moldova. Gore said he had just been
talking ``with Ion Sturza, the prime minister of Moldova,'' adding,
``we're old friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But just a few hours before the airing of the Imus show, the
Moldovan Parliament voted to oust Sturza. (He remains in office
until a new government takes over.)
</P>
<P>
   Was Gore sorry to see him go? By way of non-explanation, Chris
Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said: ``As Al Gore noted when he
criticized Governor Bush, countries should work within their
constitutional process, and we stand firmly on the principle that
military coups are bad things that should not be condoned in any
way, shape or form.''

TWO STRONG NIGHTS FOR PICASSO AT AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Picasso's ``Seated Woman in a Garden,'' a 1938
portrait of the artist's mistress Dora Maar, sold for $49.5 million
Wednesday at Sotheby's here.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait was part of a 20th-century art collection from the
estate of Eleanore and Daniel Saidenberg, the Manhattan gallery
owners who represented Picasso in the United States from 1955 until
the artist's death in 1973. The sale ended too late for most prices
to be included in this edition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the grandest depictions of Maar, whom Picasso frequently
painted, the work was finished in a single day, Dec. 10, 1938. This
densely painted work shows Maar regally seated on a thronelike
chair surrounded by naively painted spring flowers, with a variety
of stripes on both on the chair and Maar's clothing. The painting,
which measures 51 inches by 38 inches, was expected to sell for $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only two big spenders to push the price of an artwork
to stratospheric levels, but at Christie's sale of 20th-century art
in New York on Tuesday night, three determined telephone bidders
declared war for another Picasso, the 1932 ``Nude on a Black
Armchair.'' The winner paid $45.1 million, nicely above Christie's
high estimate of $40 million. So tense was the bidding that the
salesroom burst into applause when the winner was finally declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 53 works offered Tuesday night, 38 found buyers. The sale
totaled $99.9 million, well above Christie's low estimate of $89.2
million. It exceeded Christie's auction of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist art on Monday night by more than $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nude on a Black Armchair,'' a portrait of the artist's
previous mistress Marie-Therese Walter asleep with her arms
stretched over her head, was one of 12 works being sold from the
estate of Madeleine Haas Russell, one of San Francisco's most
important philanthropists. Mrs. Russell, who died in April at 84,
was a great-grandniece of Levi Strauss, and the Picasso was the
jewel in her collection.
</P>
<P>
   Also painted in just one day _ March 9, 1932 _ it is the first
in a series of portraits of Walter that the artist made that year
while he was living in Boisgeloup, outside Paris. At 65 by 53
inches, the painting is the largest of these works, and the most
sensual. Over the last four years, Christie's has sold two other
Picasso portraits of Walter painted the same year. ``The Mirror''
was sold in 1995 for $20 million, and ``The Dream,'' from the
estate of the New York collectors Victor and Sally Ganz, fetched
$48.4 million in 1997, more than Tuesday's painting.
</P>
<P>
   The minute ``Nude on a Black Armchair'' sold, speculation about
the buyer began. Many said Stephen Wynn, the casino owner who has
founded a mini-museum at Bellagio in Las Vegas, was the buyer.
Others weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Tuesday evening had its ups and downs. For certain
works, prices exceeded all expectations; for others, the salesroom
went dead and there wasn't a bid in sight. ``The market is
selective,'' said Abigail Asher, a partner in Guggenheim Asher, an
art advisory business. ``People were willing to stretch for good
things, but they weren't touching things of lesser quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's cleverly began the sale with the Russell property.
Estate property is generally appealing because it has been off the
market for a long time. Another high flier was Giovanni Segantini's
``Springtime in the Alps,'' a large oil, 47 by 90{ inches.
Paintings by the Italian artist rarely come on the market. This
1897 landscape was commissioned by Mrs. Russell's father, Jacob
Stern, the year it was painted. It has been hanging at the
California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco since
1928, and many experts said before the sale that it was a shame it
hadn't been given to a museum. ``It was the last one of that scale
and quality in private hands,'' said Franck Giraud, director of
19th- and 20th-century art for Christie's worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Two telephone bidders tried to buy the Segantini, which ended up
selling for $9.5 million, far above its $6 million high estimate.
After the sale, it was announced that Martin Zimet, the Manhattan
dealer who runs French &AMP; Company, was the buyer _ for himself, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other works from the Russell estate brought astonishing prices.
A Matisse sculpture, ``Reclining Nude I (Dawn),'' conceived in 1907
and cast in 1912, was expected to fetch $2 million to $3 million;
it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $9.2 million, a
record for a sculpture by the artist. Like Picasso's $45.1 million
portrait of Walter, it depicts a woman resting with her arm over
her head.
</P>
<P>
   Another sculpture from the Russell estate matched the artist's
record. Henry Moore's ``Two-Piece Reclining Figure: Points,'' a
1969 abstract sculpture, was estimated at $2 million to $3 million;
it sold for $4 million to Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan dealer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Russell estate property, the sale went through some
rocky patches. Cy Twombly's ``Untitled,'' one of the artist's
famous blackboard series from 1971, failed to sell. This
118-by-184{-inch sprawl of white scribbles on a gray background was
being sold by Shigeki Kameyama, the Japanese dealer and collector
who sold Picasso's ``Mirror'' at Christie's for $20 million four
years ago. On Tuesday night, the Twombly was estimated at $5
million to $7 million, but Christopher Burge, chairman of
Christie's in America and the evening's auctioneer, could not milk
a bid out of the audience. He finally gave up at $4.5 million.
Kameyama had paid $5.5 million for it at Sotheby's in New York in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Another failure was a Matisse painting, ``Woman With the Green
Umbrella.'' Again nobody would touch the Nice-period painting.
Bidding started at $2 million and ended at $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were lots that went so far above their estimates that
even the experts seemed baffled. , Robert Rauschenberg's
``Untitled'' (1954), one of the artist's earliest examples of his
Combine series, was estimated at $180,000 to $250,000. It sold to
Barney Ebsworth, a St. Louis collector, for $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   As dealers were leaving the sale, many said they were confused
about the evening's results. ``It was too bad the estimate on the
Twombly was so greedy,'' said Charles Cowles, the SoHo dealer.
``But the market is sure strong for good pictures.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While you were no doubt sleeping Sunday night, Zoe
Koplowitz, 51, was in the streets for her 12th New York City
Marathon, in which, as usual, she finished last.
</P>
<P>
   She started her race at 6 a.m. Sunday on the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge, with the purple crutches that match her purple eye shadow
and wearing rhinestone earrings. She ended 30 hours, 52 minutes and
15 seconds later in Central Park, with a fist held high and a
warrior whoop.
</P>
<P>
   The crutches are because of the multiple sclerosis; Ms.
Koplowitz also has diabetes. This year Ms. Koplowitz fell two weeks
before the race, separating her shoulder and cracking a rib, so
that in addition to the numbness in her hands and the muscle
tremors in her legs as the race wears on, her shoulder was in pain.
</P>
<P>
   We could ask the old question: Why do this? But a question
concerning style first:
</P>
<P>
   Why, Ms. Koplowitz, do you wear purple eye shadow?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a power color,'' she says, batting her pale blue eyes
playfully in the Midtown offices of the Achilles Track Club.
</P>
<P>
   The rhinestone earrings?
</P>
<P>
   Laughter, from a funny woman who likes to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known for my trashy earrings,'' Ms. Koplowitz says.
``People always ask if they weigh me down. I say: `Yes, I would
have won without them. It was a choice between the fashion
statement and the $50,000 prize.' The other question I always get
is, `Why do you do a race every year you can't win?' The bottom
line is I do win.''
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, a number of wheelchair athletes filed a suit
against the marathon's organizers, claiming that some practices,
including having disabled athletes move to the side to permit
faster runners to pass, were discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koplowitz, a supervisor at an employment agency who spends
much time on the road as an inspirational speaker and who sounds,
much of the time, like an inspirational speaker (``I feel like I'm
a human Post-it note _ I remind people anything is possible'') was
not part of that suit.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is a personal mission. What Ms. Koplowitz likes talking
about is her race: the firefighters and police officers and shop
owners who look for her every year; the Guardian Angels who join
her as escort at nightfall (years back, there was a drug dealer who
pulled a gun); the letters, many of which come from other people
who have taken a nasty punch from life, which she and her team
carry over the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my opportunity to get my personal agenda in,'' Ms.
Koplowitz says. ``To show people I don't have anything that they
don't have. I don't wear a supercape; I don't go into a phone booth
and change into superhero to do a marathon. I am who you are and
that's the whole point.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Ms. Koplowitz about who she is, a most ordinary question
about her childhood in Astoria, Queens, and her high-spirited
conversation will come to a dead stop. She cannot discuss her
childhood, Ms. Koplowitz says finally. She described it once, in
the book she wrote a few years ago, and it caused her family enough
pain.
</P>
<P>
   She does, however, open a copy of the book, ``The Winning
Spirit: Life Lessons Learned in Last Place,'' which she has brought
to the interview, pointing to a paragraph:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really did know my mother, but I was intimate with her
twin demons: alcohol and drugs.'' Later: ``Life included moments of
violence and irrationality so profound that, even 40 years after
the fact, their memory can catapult me back into that primal state
of childhood terror and hopelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoe Koplowitz, whose given name is Lindsay, is the oldest
daughter of an electrician. She leaves home at 18 and puts herself
through almost four years of college, leaving because of the
difficulty of working full time.
</P>
<P>
   In her early 20s, searching for a community which ``does some
good in the world,'' Ms. Koplowitz gives up her apartment and job
to join a religious community called the Foundation Faith of God,
which preaches faith healing. Following the practice of the
community, Ms. Koplowitz takes a new first name, Zoe.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Ms. Koplowitz grows clumsy and begins limping. The
diagnosis is muscular sclerosis. She is frozen out of the community
_ the members are all healthy young people, Ms. Koplowitz says with
some amusement, and having a member walking around with a cane
while they preach healing is not great public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koplowitz gets work as an office manager, finds a man with
whom to share her life, follows the medical advice common 25 years
ago regarding M.S.: have a low-stress life, do not tire yourself
physically.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, living her cautious physical life, Ms.
Koplowitz chokes on a vitamin pill and almost dies. Regaining
consciousness, she decides a quiet life guarantees nothing _ death
can come at any time. She decides on running the marathon because
she wants a long-term goal and something that is ``completely
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The last may also explain why she crossed the finish line,
Monday, in a jacket studded with rhinestones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is meant to be lived in color. I'm going to have a good
time and if I pass you by, you're going to remember me.''

   Talks over France's refusal to lift its ban on British beef
appeared at a standstill as officials said safety issues over mad
cow disease had not been addressed. The European Union gave France
until Thursday to lift the ban, but officials said they would
refuse to comply until Britain made safety changes. Prime Minister
Tony Blair said if the ban stood, ``We shall take them to court.''

   Former Sen. George Mitchell's mission to end the stalemate over

   About 20 Kurdish fighters have broken from the mainstream of

   The Schering pharmaceutical company said it would consider

Schering has declined to contribute because it did not recruit

A SLOW START FOR BRADLEY, WHO RECOVERS TO WIN A FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Delivering the same stump speech over and over,
presidential candidates sometimes develop a clipped delivery,
omitting important words. The problem proved particularly acute
Wednesday for former Senator Bill Bradley, who was known for a
terse, almost telegraphic style of speech even before he began
campaigning for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you take any drugs?'' Bradley asked about 50
senior citizens Wednesday at a federally subsidized apartment
complex a few blocks from an area with a reputation for narcotics
trafficking, although it has recently improved.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley meant prescription drugs and had asked his question
after talking about Medicare. Only five or six hands went up as his
audience looked mystified.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pressed on, saying that drugs ``cost too much money,''
then clarified his remarks a little by adding, ``One of the things
I constantly see is people choosing between eating and paying for
drugs, or taking care of their child or paying for prescription
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience remained puzzled. ``I thought he was
talking about dope addicts,'' said John Curry, 93, a retired auto
worker.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Bradley's effort to woo senior citizens went better,
and several said they planned to vote for him. Asked whether he
thought the age of eligibility for Medicare should be raised,
Bradley said he opposed any such move, and added, for the first
time, that he would not advocate raising the age of eligibility for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   His aides confirmed that Bradley meant that he would oppose any
further increase in the ages for Social Security eligibility beyond
the gradual increase already mandated.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Bradley had only said that he favored reviewing all
options for preserving the solvency of Social Security. These
options include raising taxes, reducing benefits, raising the age
of eligibility or trying to improve the returns from the system's
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley won over one guest with his answer to her question.
Shirley West, 60, a resident of the Arcadia Apartments building,
asked Bradley, a former basketball star with the New York Knicks,
whether he could still dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied that while he could still play basketball, he
could not dunk and was barely able to do so even when he played
professional basketball. Ms. West was delighted and said she would
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like nobody that dunks,'' she said. ``I like a team
player.''

PRESIDENT'S SEAL IS NOT FOR SALE, A TOWN LEARNS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ It was the most successful fund-raiser that a
college scholarship group here had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   But having the first family as local homeowners apparently only
carries so much clout. So the White House has ordered the Horace
Greeley Educational Fund to stop selling T-shirts with the
presidential seal and the words ``Secret Service, Chappaqua Bureau,
Presidential Detail.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, the presidential seal is protected by government
statute, and unauthorized use is a crime punishable by up to six
months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea wasn't even original,'' said Wendy S. Nolan, a real
estate broker. ``I got a shirt exactly like it in Block Island. It
had a presidential seal, and it said `Men in Block,' because the
president had just been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard the president was moving in, we thought, oh we
should do a shirt for Chappaqua,'' she said. ``I'm a supporter of
the schools, so I thought we could do it for the scholarship
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 11 dozen shirts sold out, at $15 apiece, at Chappaqua
Community Day in September. The fund, which raises money for
scholarships for local high school seniors, ordered another 36
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation had raised $2,625 and had visions of thousands
more, when the letter came from the White House on Tuesday. It
turned out that a reporter had called the White House in September
to see whether there were any objections to the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   There was Executive Order 11649, a two-page directive that
outlines the proper uses for the seal and the possible penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we always try to do whatever we can to benefit
education,'' said Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House
counsel's office. ``But there isn't an exception for a charitable
use of a seal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Bernstein, the president of the Horace Greeley
Educational Fund, called the counsel's office Wednesday and asked
whether his group could please just sell the shirts that they had
on hand, which cost $1,920 to produce. ``They said absolutely
not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing wrong with giving them away, Kennedy said.
Considering that Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to make
education a central issue in her presumed campaign for Senate,
Bernstein thinks the fund may still recoup the investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Hillary can make up the difference,'' he said.

IRS REWARDS EMPLOYEES WHO BLEW WHISTLE  
(DW)

(ATTN: Texas)  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is paying money, and in some cases
giving promotions, to employees who testified about abuses of
taxpayers during 1997 and 1998 Senate Finance Committee hearings
that led to a major overhaul of the tax agency.
</P>
<P>
   The actions mean that the Finance Committee will not hold
another round of hearings into the operations of the tax agency,
the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pyrek, an IRS spokesman, said, ``We have been working hard
with the committee to ensure that the rights of the IRS employees
who testified before the committee are protected.'' He said the
agency expected ``closure soon,'' but he declined to say how much
money was being paid to the 11 known whistle-blowers or to any
other tax workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the IRS workers testified behind a screen in 1997 to
protect their identity, saying they feared retaliation for
disclosing abuses of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   That day IRS executives ordered a check of every one of the
agency's 98,000 employees, even going to homes to eyeball those who
had called in sick, in an effort to identify the whistle-blowers,
Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., and an aide, Bill Nixon, wrote in
their book ``The Power to De'
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, who became tax commissioner in late 1997,
promised Roth soon after his appointment that he would protect any
whistle-blower from retaliation as part of his effort to create a
new culture of open communication.
</P>
<P>
   Last April 15, as millions of Americans were filing their tax
returns, IRS officials in Houston moved to fire Jennifer Long, the
first IRS auditor to testify openly before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   After Roth complained, Rossotti intervened to halt the firing,
removing the Houston office's top official and sending one of his
top executives to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Long could not be reached Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Senate Finance Committee hired Bruce Strauss, a
former IRS district manager, to investigate complaints by the
whistle-blowers about continuing harassment. Roth said he was
planning a new round of hearings, a move that Rossotti wanted to
avoid because he wants to focus on remaking the tax agency's
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss concluded his work this week, said Ginny Flynn, the
senator's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied that the whistle-blowers are being treated
appropriately,'' she said, adding that there were no plans for more
hearings.

   INCREASE IN SHARES OF UPS PUSHES VALUE TO $81 BILLION

   In the biggest initial stock offering ever, investors drove up
the price of United Parcel Service to $68.25 a share from an
opening price of $50. In less than 24 hours, the public increased
the company's market value to more than $81 billion, almost twice
as much as General Motors and nearly six times as much as Federal
Express.

   `CYBERSQUATTING' MEASURE REVIVED
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to fend off a threatened veto of a controversial bill to
outlaw speculating in Internet addresses, or ``cybersquatting,''
congressional leaders have attached it to a satellite-television
bill that has already been passed by the House and is awaiting a
vote in the Senate. The revival of the legislation marks a key
victory for the Motion Picture Association of America, led by Jack
Valenti, and other groups that have sought to protect trademarks
online.

   STOCKS MIXED ON INFLATION REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Stocks resumed a mostly upward course as enthusiasm for
technology issues overcame some early market nervousness about a

ADVERTISING: TIRED OF BEING VILLAIN, PHILIP MORRIS WORKS ON IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A giant marketer is seeking to ingratiate itself with consumers
at a time when its principal product is being excoriated more
relentlessly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos., the nation's No. 3 advertiser, which spends
more than $2 billion a year, is undertaking an extensive, expensive
multimedia campaign meant to help burnish its corporate image. The
primary goal is to counter the critics who object to the company's
tobacco operations, which under the names Philip Morris U.S.A. and
Philip Morris International produce best-selling cigarette brands
like Benson &AMP; Hedges, Chesterfield, L&AMP;M, Marlboro, Parliament and
Virginia Slims.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for paeans to puffing or entreaties to ``Come to
where the flavor is'' in the television commercials, posters and
Web pages that make up the campaign, which has a budget estimated
at $100 million. Indeed, smoking is not mentioned except in
discussing efforts to limit cigarette sales to minors and
statements on the company's Web site at www.philipmorris.com that
smoking ``causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema'' and other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the campaign is focused on the charitable, philanthropic
and social activism of Philip Morris divisions, particularly those
like Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing that sell nontobacco products.
The topics range from feeding the hungry and fighting domestic
violence to helping victims of natural disasters and volunteer
teaching. Many actors in the TV spots, all which include the words
``Based on a true story'' on screen, appear to be playing
blue-collar or lower-income Americans, who make up a high
percentage of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the advertising tries to do is talk about the fact we are
more than a tobacco company and what we do to give back to our
communities,'' said Steven Parrish, senior vice president for
corporate affairs at Philip Morris in New York. He is overseeing
the campaign, which carries the theme ``Working to make a
difference. The people of Philip Morris''; the ads are being
created by Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Leo Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues involving our tobacco business are creating a
negative image of the company,'' Parrish said. ``When people get a
factual exposure to what the company is, what the company does,
their perceptions begin to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is emblematic of a change of heart _ if not lungs _
among tobacco companies as they end years of silence or defensive
maneuvers in response to castigation from opponents of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saying `No comment' in effect,'' Parrish said, ``and
`No comment' turned out to be a powerful comment in the minds of a
lot of people, letting us be defined by what others were saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The new tack plays to the public with low-key assertions of
corporate beneficence and largess, presenting emotional rather than
rational pitches infused with warmth, bonhomie and even occasional
humor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the television, poster and Internet elements of
the Philip Morris campaign, the image-enhancement bids include
appeals from the Lorillard unit of Loews Corp., some carrying the
theme ``New rules, new commitment''; a new magazine named CML The
Camel Quarterly, custom-published for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
unit of the RJR Holdings Corporation by Wink Media, part of the
Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., and a fanciful telephone
recording featuring a deliberately perfervid announcer who
declares: ``We, the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, are in
love with you. We're a giant corporation and you make us feel like
a little kitten.'' Brown &AMP; Williamson is owned by British American
Tobacco PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe now more than ever that the more we openly and
honestly discuss our company and what we're doing, people will have
a better understanding of the facts and make up their own minds,''
Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know people will be skeptical, questioning our motives,''
he added, ``but we wanted to be as upfront and straightforward as
we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Parrish was accurate in predicting the
skepticism the campaign would generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't fool anybody,'' said Martyn Straw, president of
Interbrand Corp. in New York, a corporate and brand identity
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public could say, `If you really want to help people, the
best thing you can do is stop selling cigarettes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``there's a difference between doing something and telling
people you're doing something,'' Straw said. He offered a
potentially more effective strategy: ``Undertake the activities
quietly and then do public relations at the local level, letting
the media pick up the story themselves.'' Interbrand is owned by
the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris is ``working really, really hard to buy
respectability,'' said Bill Novelli, president at the National
Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, an advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important for employee morale,'' he added, particularly
``among the Kraft and Miller Brewing people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see if the company can climb up from
the pariah status it now has,'' Novelli said. ``I don't think this
will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Garrison, chief executive at the American Lung Association
in New York, offered another reason for the ads, which he dismissed
as ``a smoke screen to fool the American people into thinking
Philip Morris is a good corporate citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying desperately to improve their image in this
country because of future litigation facing them,'' Garrison said.
``They're thinking about future juries.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising critic Bob Garfield, who writes for the trade
publication Advertising Age, delivered a trenchant attack on the
campaign in October. He summarized the gist of the ads this way: ``
`Never mind that we've killed more people than Hitler. Don't forget
all the good works we've done with our fine Miller Lite and Kraft
Velveeta cheese-like product.'''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris executives are sensitive to perceptions that the
campaign is minimizing or playing down the company's tobacco
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anyone to feel we are walking away from or
hiding from our tobacco business,'' Parrish said. ``We're
prohibited from advertising any tobacco brands, but youth smoking
is something we wanted to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   One commercial in the campaign is centered on a program,
encouraging retailers to demand identification from cigarette
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   That initiative is separate from another campaign, also with a
budget of $100 million, aimed at dissuading children from smoking.
Those ads are by Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York. &QL;

DATA RECORDER INFO DEEPENS CRASH MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was ``uneventful''
until the plane's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds before the
jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to drop down toward the
Atlantic Ocean, crash investigators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether the autopilot disconnected by itself
or was turned off by the crew of the Cairo-bound jet that was some
40 minutes out of New York's Kennedy Airport at the time.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall,
releasing the first tidbits of information that his investigators
have gleaned from examining one of the jet's two black boxes, said
the Boeing 767 made what appears to be a ``controlled descent''
from 33,000 feet down to 19,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder stopped shortly afterward and the final
five to 10 seconds of information on its tape are still being
analyzed, Hall told a news conference at the safety board's
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   All aboard the jet died when it crashed into the Atlantic less
than two minutes after the autopilot disconnected..
</P>
<P>
   Although the information made public so far raises still more
questions about what could have gone wrong on Flight 990, Hall did
say investigators do not believe the jet's thrust reversers
deployed in flight.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thrust reversers on the twin-engine 767, which are
used to slow a jet after landing, had been deactivated because of a
problem before the jet left Cairo for New York, and there has been
speculation that perhaps a thrust reverser deployed during flight.
</P>
<P>
   That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in
Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed in flight. The
Lauda Air crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data
we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is expected to release more information from
the flight data recorder over the coming days. The Navy is still
trying to recover the second black box _ the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit
during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even
more important than the flight data recorder in helping
investigators determine the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   A former 767 pilot told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last
night the jet may have experienced an in-flight electrical or
computer problem, based on the limited amount of information made
public so far by the safety board.
</P>
<P>
   The autopilot on a 767 would disconnect from flying the airplane
if there there were a problem with the cockpit computers or the
plane's electrical system, said Dan Gellert of Sequim, a former
pilot with Eastern Airlines who later trained 767 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   A light would flash and an alarm would sound to let the crew
know immediately that the autopilot was off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 has a modern ``glass cockpit,'' and information about
the plane, including its altitude and attitude (or angle of
flight), are displayed on screens in front of the crew. An
electrical or computer problem would cause those screens to go
blank, or could even result in erroneous flight data to be
displayed, Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, believing they were still in level flight, could
have put the big jet into a dive, he theorized.
</P>
<P>
   An electrical problem would also explain why the plane's
transponder stopped working, he said. The transponder sends out an
electronic signal that tells air traffic controllers the plane's
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the only information about what happened to
EgyptAir Flight 990 had come from an analysis of radar data by the
NTSB and the Air Force. Safety board investigators said last week
the radar analysis showed the jet, flying at 33,000 feet, suddenly
entered a steep but straight dive down to 16,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, air traffic controllers lost contact with the
plane's transponder. But Air Force radar continued to plot the
plane's course and altitude down to 16,000 feet. The jet climbed
back to 24,000 feet before making a rapid descent to 10,000 feet.
At that point, radar showed multiple targets, indicating the plane
broke up before it hit the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The transponder operates on a separate electrical buss, or
pathway, from the plane's computers and autopilot, Gellert said.
That would explain why it kept working longer, assuming an
electrical problem caused the autopilot to disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Based on preliminary analysis, investigators had said last week
that early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the
speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet.
But Hall said Wednesday the flight data recorder indicates the
plane did not reach such speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the 767 did dive much faster than it would have in an
emergency. Based on the radar analysis, the jet took 40 second to
reach 16,700 feet, which would have meant it was going down at more
than 24,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure
and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Gellert said pilots are trained to bank a commercial jetliner
about 30 degree before making an emergency descent. That is to keep
the passengers from flying out of their seats in a steep dive.
Centrifugal force during the turn presses passengers into their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said the radar data shows the plane did not
turn in its initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the pilot nor co-pilot of EgyptAir Flight 990 radioed
any kind of distress call to air traffic controllers. Their last
contact with controllers a few minutes before the plane began its
descent did not indicate any problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gellert said an electrical problem could have knocked out
communications, or the crew might have been preoccupied trying to
regain control of their airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Hall did not comment Wednesday on how the airplane behaved after
the brief climb shown by radar data, or in its final plunge to the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   That subsequent climb is consistent with a loss of the
computers, Gellert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the way you realize you are diving, then you
try and recover,'' he said. ``Perhaps the crew overcorrected. Now
they are zooming back up, putting the plane on its tail. Then they
lose control again and head down and start shedding parts.''

GOLDMAN LIFTS BAN ON STOCK SALES FOR CHARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what may become an early holiday gift to schools,
hospitals and other nonprofit groups, Goldman Sachs Group, the
investment bank that became a public company earlier this year, has
lifted some restrictions on its stock to allow partners to donate
as much as $500 million to charity.
</P>
<P>
   When the firm went public in May, it barred top-level employees
from selling shares for three years. But to ease charitable giving,
the firm has loosened the restrictions to allow charities to sell
shares donated by 350 current and former partners. The firm said
Wednesday that it had registered the possible sale of shares valued
at up to $500 million with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's public offering raised $3.7 billion and gave partners
in the previously private firm a paper windfall on their ownership
stakes. Partners do not have to pay taxes on their shares until
selling them, meaning that they do not necessarily face a giant tax
bill this year. But with a big chunk of their net worth tied up in
stock, many partners had pushed for the right to donate shares to
charity to offset taxes, Goldman officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the public offering, the former partners have sought to
direct a portion of the stock they received to educational and
other charitable institutions,'' the chairman and chief executive,
Henry M. Paulson Jr., said in a statement. ``This transaction will
exactly accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm loosened restrictions on 7 million shares, valued at
$500 million, held by partners. If all of those shares were donated
to charities and the charities sold them, the number of shares
circulating on the stock market would increase by about 10 percent,
to 76 million, according to the SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Goldman closed Wednesday at $71.9375, up 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said the $500
million figure was an estimate of potential partner giving. Each of
the firm's partners will decide whether, how much and to what
nonprofit organizations to make gifts.
</P>
<P>
   After its initial stock offering, Goldman also set up a
charitable foundation financed with $200 million of Goldman stock.
The foundation is still in the development stage.

FBI FEARED PRISONER WOULD HAVE INCREASED INFLUENCE WITH ARABS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A newly declassified court document shows the FBI
argued against freeing an Egyptian man who has been jailed for more
than three years on secret evidence because it would improve his
credibility among Arabs and people ``would be more inclined to
listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Nasser K. Ahmed, has been detained since April 1996
while the government has tried to build a case that he had links to
terrorist organizations. In an July 30 opinion, an immigration
judge rejected the FBI's contention that Ahmed was a threat to
national security and ordered his release.
</P>
<P>
   In a response included in a classified appendix to the opinion
that was released Wednesday, the bureau argued that Ahmed should
continue to be detained not only because of the secret evidence
against him but also because agents believed he would, if freed,
become even more influential among Arabs because of his lengthy
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``His prominence in the community will increase if he is
released,'' an unnamed FBI agent who gave secret testimony against
Ahmed told the judge. ``He would be more well known, lending to his
credibility in the community, both inside the United States and
outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American groups and civil libertarians have sharply
criticized the use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings
and have held up Ahmed's lengthy detention as an example of the
unfairness of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case, a Palestinian native, Hany Kiareldeen, who
was also being held on secret evidence accusing him of terrorism,
was released from a New Jersey jail last month after being detained
for 19 months while the authorities tried to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did was wrong,'' said Ahmed, 39, speaking by phone
from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where
he remains while the government appeals his release. Ahmed said the
revelation that the FBI opposed his release, fearing in part that
his influence would grow because of his imprisonment, did not
surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it was I'm a terrorist threat,'' he said.
``That doesn't exist anymore. So now it's, `He's going to be
credible, and he's going to be a risk.' They know from Day 1 that
I'm innocent of any allegation that they claim.''
</P>
<P>
   In the July 30 opinion in Ahmed's case, the immigration judge,
Donn Livingston, criticized the use of secret evidence by the
government. The judge could not reveal the evidence or his analysis
of it until the 16-page addendum was partly declassified a few days
ago by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ahmed's lawyers, Louis M. Bograd, a staff lawyer with the
American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said the document
showed ``just how lame and weak'' the secret evidence was and how
prejudicial it had been for Ahmed's case.
</P>
<P>
   Russell A. Bergeron Jr., a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the agency did not discuss
``particulars of cases still pending before the court.'' He said it
would also be inappropriate to comment on evidence developed by the
FBI. A bureau spokesman, Joseph A. Valiquette, had no comment. The
document was not completely declassified, so it was not possible to
see the full extent of the government's secret evidence and the
judge's analysis of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the declassified part, however, Livingston says that much of
the secret evidence was difficult to evaluate because it was
``double or triple hearsay.'' He also questions the reliability of
some government sources and cites the description of one source as
``a friendly foreign intelligence service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A very real concern of this court,'' the judge said, is
whether Egypt was the source of secret evidence against Ahmed, who
had worked as an aide to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a strong critic
of the Egyptian government, during Abdel Rahman's 1995 trial in the
plot to blow up landmarks in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston cited ``the very real danger that the Egyptian
government may seek to silence Sheik Rahman by persecuting'' Ahmed,
who has been seeking political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected other evidence suggesting Ahmed was linked to
terrorist activities and said his links to Abdel Rahman were not
evidence that he was a threat to national security.

SIZING UP HOLYFIELD'S PLACE IN HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ This could be the end of a remarkable era.
</P>
<P>
   If Evander Holyfield loses to Lennox Lewis in their rematch here
Saturday, as most believe he will, it could be the last we see of
him in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   He turns 37 on the 19th of this month, not an age when a fighter
_ particularly one as wealthy as Holyfield _ begins to rebuild his
career.
</P>
<P>
   So, assuming for a moment this is goodbye, we ask: What will he
have left us? Where does he rank among the greatest heavyweight
champions of all time?
</P>
<P>
   He certainly will be admired. No one has brought more courage
and determination into the ring. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   And it's clear that he was (begin ital)the(end ital) heavyweight
of the 1990s, a decade in which he has held at least one major
world title for a total of about 5{ years. Everyone else pales.
</P>
<P>
   The debatable question is where he rates among the division's
greatest champions.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate arguments for placing him among the very
best, arguments for listing him among a second echelon of champions
and more than one reasonable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ARGUMENTS FOR GREATNESS
</P>
<P>
   His resume is impressive. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _He and Muhammad Ali are the only three-time heavyweight world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   _He has defeated (begin ital)eight(end ital) current or former
heavyweight champions, one more than Ali.
</P>
<P>
   _He exacted revenge against both heavyweights who beat him,
Riddick Bowe and Michael Moorer, although Bowe also won a third
bout between them.
</P>
<P>
   _He met and defeated every significant heavyweight of his era,
the exception being Lewis, with whom he drew in March.
</P>
<P>
   _He won the cruiserweight title against rugged Dwight Qawi in
only his 12th professional fight.
</P>
<P>
   _He has been knocked out only once, in the eighth round of his
third bout with Bowe more because he was exhausted than hurt. He
has one of the best chins in history.
</P>
<P>
   _He's 36-3-1, with 25 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   Not too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these accomplishments, Holyfield must be seen as one of
the division's (begin ital)better(end ital) heavyweights ever.
</P>
<P>
   However, the numbers don't fully capture his essence: He's also
boxing's great warrior, for which he will likely be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a rock-hard body chiseled by fanatical training
and empowering faith in God, he has fought with breathtaking fury
and fearlessness from the day he turned professional in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He has had more than his fair share of wars _ wars that might've
broken a lesser fighter _ but has never failed to come back for
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a (begin ital)fighter(end ital),'' said Don Turner, his
trainer. ``He's a (begin ital)real(end ital) fighter. He's got the
skills and the will it takes to make a real champion.''
</P>
<P>
   That determination and unwavering belief in himself _ along with
a fine boxing mind _ has allowed him to do some remarkable things.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatically, he was thought to be a ``shot fighter'' after
his first fight with Bowe and a terrible performance against Bobby
Czyz only to outpoint Bowe in the rematch and stun the world by
knocking out Mike Tyson in the 11th round subsequent to the Czyz
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Few gave him a realistic chance to win either time. In fact, he
was a 25-1 underdog at one point against Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the critics are at it again: He's about a 2-1
underdog for Saturday's bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a can-do fighter,'' boxing historian Bert Sugar said.
``He's been counted out so many times. He's been called a
cruiserweight in heavyweight trappings. He can't punch. He can't
beat Tyson, he can't beat Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Everyone says he can't. And then guess what? He can.''
</P>
<P>
   ARGUMENTS AGAINST GREATNESS
</P>
<P>
   If, as Sugar says, greatness is based on whom you rub up
against, Holyfield is at a disadvantage when it comes to his place
in history.
</P>
<P>
   He (begin ital)has(end ital) beaten the best of his era.
However, how good was his era?
</P>
<P>
   He beat Buster Douglas, a great fighter only on the night he
knocked out Tyson to win the title in 1990. He beat George Foreman
and Larry Holmes, but both were well past their primes.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Moorer, a very good, but unspectacular fighter. He beat
Bowe, who seemed destined for greatness but burned out quickly. And
he twice beat Tyson, another fighter who was grossly overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali had (Joe) Frazier, (Ken) Norton, Foreman. Holyfield's
opponents have been good, not great,'' Sugar said.
</P>
<P>
   The God that gives him his strength also deprived him of
exceptional physical tools.
</P>
<P>
   The ``blown-up cruiserweight'' label might be an exaggeration,
but it's not far off the mark. He's 6-foot-2 but doesn't have a
large frame. He's never weighed more than 218 pounds, small by
today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   This might explain why he has had a particularly tough time
against tall, thick opponents like Lewis and Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't have the ability to knock out a decent
heavyweight with one punch, which Sugar believes fans pay to see a
great heavyweight champion do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an overachiever,'' said boxing historian Steve Farhood.
``He's deficient in some ways physically. He does more than
compensate with intangibles, though.''
</P>
<P>
   CONCLUSION
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield would've been a difficult opponent for any heavyweight
in history.
</P>
<P>
   He's has better boxing skills than many realize and is an
extremely smart fighter. He beat Tyson as much with his brains as
he did with his fists.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with his heart and resiliency, has lifted him to
the pinnacle of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   When he's gone, we'll miss him and his approach to the sport.
He's an outstanding role model for any athlete. And his standing
among critics and boxing fans probably will improve with time.
</P>
<P>
   However, one thing is missing and probably will be even if he
somehow beats Lewis: magic.
</P>
<P>
   Ali was Ali. Rocky Marciano never lost. Joe Louis reigned over
the division for an astounding 11 years and 25 successful defenses.
Jack Dempsey might've been the most savage heavyweight ever. And
many of those who saw Jack Johnson fight say he was the best.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Holyfield doesn't fit into that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at the next level,'' Farhood said. ``(Larry) Holmes,
Frazier, (Jim) Jeffries, (Ezzard) Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad company.

IN ISRAEL, HILLARY CLINTON TALKS YOUTH, NOT POLITICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ It looked like an expertly managed election
campaign. Hillary Rodham Clinton swept through Israel Wednesday,
shaking hands, embracing children and posing cooperatively for the
mob of photographers who dogged her every step.
</P>
<P>
   As she arrived for her final speaking engagement Wednesday, an
auditorium packed with political heavyweights greeted her with a
standing ovation, while outside a few placard-toting supporters of
New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, were quietly hustled away
by security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day she steadfastly refused to utter a partisan
political word, and declined to speak to the press at all. ``Most
young people who find themselves in despair don't know that they
have anything worthwhile to give to anyone else,'' she said, in
remarks typical of a day focused on the problems of adolescent
violence and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her aides insist she is here not as a political
candidate, but as the first lady of the United States. Her four-day
Middle East tour has all the customary top-level trappings: high
security, White House advance teams, full-tilt American Embassy
mobilization and an itinerary dominated by meetings with the wives
of foreign leaders, but including erious policy incursions into
child development and women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday she met with emotionally troubled adolescents who are
counseled in a program headed by Nava Barak, the Israeli prime
minister's wife. On Thursday, she will present an AIDS grant to a
West Bank maternal health program in a ceremony whose hostess will
be Suha Arafat, the wife of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
On a visit on Friday and Saturday to Jordan, she will share podiums
with Queen Rania, the wife of King Abdullah, and Queen Noor, the
widow of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all first lady business,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip's continually adjusted agenda was almost
universally seen here as an attempt to court New York voters and
burnish her foreign policy credentials. Criticized by some Jewish
leaders for not including Jewish holy sites in an early itinerary,
she is now planning to stop Friday at the Western Wall in the Old
City of Jerusalem. Palestinians, who once thought Mrs. Clinton was
going to circumvent their territory, were assuaged by the
last-minute addition of a visit to Ramallah and Mrs. Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's concern is the election in New York,'' Faisal
Husseini, a Palestinian leader in East Jerusalem, remarked to the
local press before her arrival Wednesday. ``We respect that she has
a personal agenda in coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli teenagers she sat and talked with seemed similarly
unbothered by hints of offshore politicking. ``I don't care if she
does it to get votes, as long as it helps the program,'' said Ohad
Bikovsky, an 18-year-old graduate of the counseling project headed
by Mrs. Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, though, the echoes of Mrs. Clinton's expected Senate
race in New York have reverberated along the fault lines of Israeli
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ehud Olmert of Jerusalem, who is vying for the leadership
of the opposition Likud Party, met with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
in New York City on Monday and criticized Mrs. Clinton for what he
said was her original apparent intention to avoid the Old City.
Like many conservative Israelis, Olmert is distrustful of Mrs.
Clinton for her never-disavowed statement of support for an
eventual Palestinian state, and even more for her warm relations
with the Labor Party leadership here, first through the Rabin
family and now with the Baraks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make it clear that I was not happy with the
plan,'' said Olmert, reached by telephone Wednesday. ``As Mrs.
Clinton has recently volunteered her opinion that Jerusalem should
be Israel's undivided capital, it would have been inconsistent not
to visit East Jerusalem. To avoid East Jerusalem is to make a
political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani can expect an invitation to visit Jerusalem as the
city's guest early in 2000, Olmert said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The costs of Mrs. Clinton's trip, which have not yet been
calculated, are being picked up by the White House, the State
Department and the Department of Defense, which provided the plane
for her 20-person entourage.
</P>
<P>
   This was the last planned solo foreign excursion for Mrs.
Clinton as first lady, her aides said. But it is her first such
trip since she formed an exploratory campaign committee last
summer, and the first stop was Israel, always an issue in any New
York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides said she had originally accepted
invitations to visit Israel and Jordan last spring, but postponed
the trip because of the mourning for King Hussein in February and
March and the Israeli elections and coalition negotiations of May
and June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is something that we couldn't really control,'' Ms.
Berry said. ``She made a promise, and she felt that she had to
fulfill that promise.''

REPUBLICANS FOR BROWN; HAYDEN TAKES A BREATHER; A KENNEDY SAYS NO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   REPUBLICAN VOTERS CRINGE AT CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   Last week's mayoral election in San Francisco left Republicans
in a political quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody won a clean majority, so a runoff has been scheduled for
Dec. 14 between the top finishers, Mayor Willie Brown, who got 40
percent of the vote, and Tom Ammiano, the president of the Board of
Supervisors, who got 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are not identified by party in San Francisco's
mayoral contests. But, of course, party identification is always a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a Republican voter to do, knowing full well that the
only ballot choice is between two unabashedly liberal Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote Brown,'' the local Republican Central Committee
recommended this week, all but choking on the words.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Harold Hoogasian, put it this way: ``Willie Brown is
certainly the quintessential liberal. But Tom Ammiano, for all
intents and purposes, is a Marxist.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Don Casper, added, ``You deal with the
world as you find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The runoff could be close, meaning that if Brown and Ammiano
closely split the Democratic and independent vote (85 percent of
the total vote), the remaining vote _ by Republicans _ could
produce the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was an all-powerful political figure in the years when he
was speaker of the California Assembly _ in part because he
carefully courted Republican votes. But he has struggled to find
his political footing as a first-term mayor and at times has not
seemed his usual voluble, unsinkable self.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, on the other hand, is on a political roll, given that
he jumped into the mayor's race in its last few weeks, as a
write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republican endorsement of Brown is a political blow
to the Ammiano cause, even if Ammiano never really expected to get
many Republican votes. Furthermore, Ammiano has another, possibly
more serious, problem.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is a leader of San Francisco's large gay population,
he does not have the gay vote locked up. Brown has always been a
strong advocate of gay rights and has worked hard to expand those
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some gay leaders say, Brown and Ammiano may split
the gay vote.
</P>
<P>
   `JADED' OLD FIREBRAND WILL TAKE A BREATHER
</P>
<P>
   Another of California's voluble, seemingly unsinkable liberals,
Tom Hayden, is withdrawing from the political fray.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, who started out in the 1960s as an up-the-establishment
firebrand, then married and divorced Jane Fonda, then was elected
state senator from one of Los Angeles' toniest and most sedate
neighborhoods, says it is time to take a rest and think about a
``transition.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tells it in a letter recently mailed to his Democratic
supporters, he is nearing 60, and after 40 years of ``activism,''
17 of them legislating in Sacramento, some of his optimism has
faded into ``jaded realism.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he was appalled by his party's support for the bombing
of Serbia and by its failure to push through campaign finance
reforms. For a while last year, he goes on, he had high hopes for
California Democrats because they had finally gained full control
of both the governor's office and the state Legislatures. But then,
he writes, the new governor, Gray Davis, adopted a ``coldhearted
and even irrational'' policy of vetoing many major Democratic
bills, including some aimed at improving schools and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   So he will not run again for a seat in the Legislature (term
limits would have forced him to go after an Assembly seat, which
many political analysts say he could have won). Instead, he says,
he will ponder whether there are ``other ways to combat racism,
poverty, inequality and corruption than by commuting to
Sacramento.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists he is not totally distraught and running away, only
taking a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a retreat from the struggle for justice, but a
transition,'' he writes. ``My heart is full about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A RELUCTANT KENNEDY TURNS BACK ON SUITORS
</P>
<P>
   Given the opportunity, a Kennedy usually jumps into a political
contest.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chris Kennedy, one of Robert F. Kennedy's sons.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic leaders in Illinois have been urging Kennedy, an
executive with the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, to run for the
congressional seat on the affluent North Shore that Rep. John
Edward Porter, a Republican, is giving up. The way those leaders
figure it, while the district leans Republican, its politics are
mostly moderate, so a Democrat named Kennedy just might be able to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they say, if Kennedy jumped in, other Democrats,
especially several state legislators, might stay out, thereby
increasing chances that the party can hold its narrow majority in
the Illinois House.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy sees it, the call to public service is always loud
and strong in his family. But there are other considerations, too,
he said on Tuesday, including the long absences from one's family
that go with a life in politics.
</P>
<P>
   So he rejected the call to run, saying, ``I have come to believe
that the bullet that kills a father wounds his children. There were
a lot of wounded children when I grew up, and extending the
difficulties of a single-parent household to another generation
would violate the promise I made to myself a thousand times when I
was a child.''

   The report on Year 2000 computer readiness issued Wednesday by a

</P>
<P>
   911 SERVICES: Only 50 percent of 911 call centers had computers

</P>
<P>
   LOCAL GOVERNMENT: As of the most recent survey, last spring, 45
percent of small county governments told the National Association
of Counties that they had no plans for dealing with Year 2000
issues.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH CARE: Only 40 percent of health care providers reported
readiness as of August in a private survey, and data were
especially scarce on small providers.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION: One-third of schools were not ready as of this fall,
and 4 percent will enter next year with faulty systems, according
to Department of Education data.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL BUSINESSES: Of those that saw themselves at risk, 28
percent had no plans to prepare for disruptions, according to an

   INTERNATIONAL: Significant failures were expected in Asia and
Eastern Europe, especially in the former Soviet Union. Power might

ABORTION DISCORD HOLDS UP U.N. DUES AND U.S. BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CONGRESS-SPEND)  
(lh) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The white-hot domestic issue of abortion is holding
up a deal to pay nearly $1 billion that the United States owes the
United Nations, which in turn is one of the main sticking points
blocking a budget deal between Congress and the White House.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the Republican-controlled Congress and the Clinton
administration have refused to budge on what both sides consider a
litmus test of their core principles. An unintended consequence is
that the abortion fight is threatening to undermine the wholly
unrelated issue of U.S. global leadership.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives, led by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., are
demanding that the United States cut off financing to international
organizations that promote abortion rights overseas as the price
for paying Washington's back U.N. dues.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the issue of using taxpayer money to fund
abortions,'' said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Armey
of Texas, the House majority leader and chief Republican negotiator
on the issue.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has rejected the unanimous advice of his foreign
policy advisers to accept Smith's terms, and instead has stayed
loyal to an important Democratic constituency, women voters. He has
done so even at the risk of increasing world ridicule and
opprobrium that the lone global superpower was fast emerging as a
global deadbeat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At its core, this is an issue of free speech and providing
health services that affects women's lives,'' said Terri Bartlett,
vice president of public policy for Population Action
International, a research and advocacy group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite carving out these hard-line positions, both the White
House and Republicans on Capitol Hill said the two side were
tantalizingly close to striking a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very close,'' Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
assistant Republican leader, said Wednesday night, adding that
negotiators were ``tweaking'' the language of a compromise whose
terms he refused to discuss.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So much is at stake that neither side dared to declare victory
until a final version is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion provision that Smith wants would write into law an
executive order issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Clinton
reversed the order in 1993, shortly after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred direct financing for abortion since
1973, but the 1984 policy, known familiarly as ``Mexico City''
since Reagan announced it during a U.N. conference there, denied
grants to international family-planning organizations for any
purpose if they promoted abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining control of Congress in 1994, Republicans have
tried to write the provision into law. And since 1997, Smith has
pressured Republican Speakers Newt Gingrich of Georgia and now
Dennis Hastert of Illinois to support him in attaching the abortion
provision to bills that would pay back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The most fervent supporters of this linkage are in the House.
Even Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who staunchly opposes abortion,
disagrees with the House approach, largely because it blocks
reforms at the United Nations that he wants.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate bill sponsored by Helms authorizes $926 million over
three years to pay the U.S. arrears at the United Nations, provided
the United Nations meets certain conditions, including reducing
budgets and the U.S. share of payments.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, many Republicans are cringing from criticism
that their position could cause the United States to lose its
largely symbolic vote in the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Even The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, cautioned
recently that holding the back dues hostage to the abortion
language only fueled Clinton's accusation that Republicans are
isolationist, and called on Smith to ``relent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a year away from a presidential election that may again
put a Republican in the White House,'' said the magazine's
editorial. ``That president will be able to restore the pro-life
Mexico City policy with the stroke of a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the editorial continued, ``By seeming to be too cheap
to pay our U.N. dues, Republicans will have needlessly handed the
Democrats an issue for the 2000 campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hold out compromises. Abortion rights groups say they
would grudgingly accept a provision sponsored by Reps. Jim
Greenwood, R-Pa., and Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y. The measure, which the
House approved in July by a vote of 221-208, would cut U.S.
financing from international organizations that lobby for abortion
rights only in countries where local laws prohibit such lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got problems with it,'' said Susan Cohen, a vice
president for development at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a
research and advocacy group. ``But if that's the price to pay to
get the U.N. dues, we could live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives reject such a compromise as toothless.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility conservatives are discussing is to adopt Smith's
provision, but allow Clinton to issue waivers for international
organizations that provide abortions or lobby for abortion rights.
If Clinton invoked such waivers, however, Congress would penalize
the administration by cutting the amount of grants the United
States awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unacceptable,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday of
the ``double waiver'' idea.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many lawmakers and advocacy groups sensed a deal
was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pressure-cooker point,'' Ms. Bartlett said.

DENVER PAPERS GAIN CIRCULATION, BUT EROSION GOES ON IN MANY OTHER
MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A bitter newspaper war in Denver, with penny-a-day special
offers, generated startling circulation gains in the last six
months. The Denver Rocky Mountain News recorded a 19.3 percent
gain, and its total daily circulation of 396,114 vaulted it ahead
of its arch-rival, The Denver Post, which reported a daily
circulation of 376,549, an increase of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, which cover the six-month period that ended Sept.
30, were released Wednesday by the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
They prompted Linda Sease, the vice president for marketing at The
Rocky Mountain News, to crow that ``new subscribers preferred us
two to one'' over The Post. And the data prompted Post publisher
Gerald E. Grilly to counter that ``they're giving their paper away
to create a costly illusion of circulation growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Grilly and Ms. Sease suggested that the run of news from
Denver, from the shootings at Columbine High School to the grand
jury deliberations on the JonBenet Ramsey slaying in Boulder, had
also helped increase their circulation _ but nothing like the
effect of the aggressive pricing programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver gains came against the backdrop of the continuing,
even slightly accelerated, erosion of newspaper readership over
all. Among the 842 daily and 631 Sunday newspapers reporting, both
daily and Sunday circulation dropped 0.7 percent from the
corresponding six-month period in 1998, according to an analysis of
the Audit Bureau figures by the Newspaper Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The erosion was most visible in midsize and small markets, but
newspapers in two major markets were hit hard. The daily
circulation of The Philadelphia Inquirer fell 7 percent, dipping
below 400,000, to 399,339.
</P>
<P>
   The daily circulation at The Chicago Tribune dropped below
600,000, falling 3.8 percent, to 578,706, and at The Chicago
Sun-Times it dropped 3.3 percent, to 468,170.
</P>
<P>
   The five largest dailies in the country all showed gains in
daily circulation, with The Wall Street Journal up 0.7 a percent,
to 1,752,693; USA Today, up 1.1 percent, to 1,671,539; The New York
Times, up 1.8 percent, to 1,086,293; The Los Angeles Times, up 1
percent, to 1,078,186; and The Washington Post, up 0.5 a percent,
to 763,305.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York metropolitan market, the biggest percentage
gains in daily circulation were reported by The Times and Newsday,
whose circulation rose to 574,941, up 0.4 percent. Daily
circulation was essentially flat at The New York Post _ 438,158 _
and at The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J. _ 407,129.
</P>
<P>
   But circulation at The Daily News of New York dropped by about
20,000 both daily and Sunday _ a drop of 2.9 percent in the daily
data, to 701,831, and a Sunday drop of 2.4 percent, to 790,911.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday decline, however, did little to benefit The News'
tabloid rival; Sunday circulation for The New York Post also
declined about 20,000, or 5.6 percent, to 360,945.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday circulation for The New York Times increased 1.6 percent,
to 1,654,531.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in other major metropolitan areas had mixed results.
The daily circulation of The Houston Chronicle dropped by 1.3
percent, to 542,414, while at The Dallas Morning News, daily
circulation rose eight-tenths of a percent, to about 518,450.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its analysis of the figures, the association, an
industry trade group, released some details of its forthcoming
report on the effect of newspapers' Web sites on the circulation
figures of the printed newspapers. According to the association,
``67 percent of online users who looked at an online newspaper in
the past six months also read a printed daily newspaper, and the
figure jumps to 78 percent on Sunday.''

TV SPORTS: FOX AND NBC ACQUIRE THE RIGHTS TO NASCAR'S RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR's television landscape flip-flopped Wednesday when the
stock car racing organization sold six-year packages of broadcast
and cable rights worth $400 million a year to Fox, NBC and their
cable partners.
</P>
<P>
   The deals eliminate NASCAR's longtime partners, ABC, ESPN, CBS
and TNN, from carrying Winston Cup and Busch Grand National races
starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning increase in fees for NASCAR reflected its ability
to capitalize on being the second-highest-rated sport on television
after the National Football League, and on being a slickly run
league with popular drivers, entrenched sponsors and
extraordinarily loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC signaled its desire to enter the NASCAR business last year
by acquiring the rights to the first Pennzoil 400, which has its
debut Sunday. By snaring the races in the second half of the year,
NBC will make its strongest effort yet to compensate for its loss
last year of NFL rights.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, NBC acquired five years of rights to the Kentucky
Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes starting in 2001. NBC
beat ABC, which has carried the Triple Crown thoroughbred races for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   The deals marked the first time that NASCAR, and not the race
tracks, sold television rights. The existing quilt of contracts pay
about $100 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR also decided to create an easy-to-follow schedule,
splitting its February to November season into two 18-week packages
plus the Daytona 500, which will alternate between Fox and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and its cable units, Fox Sports Net and FX, get the
February-to-June schedule, with NBC and TBS taking the
July-to-November package.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Fox's broadcast offerings will consist mainly of Winston
Cup races, but some will be Busch events.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are a significant blow to ESPN and ESPN2, which
together carried 13 Winston Cup and 13 Busch races. ``We made an
aggressive and appropriate bid, given the package,'' said Chris
LaPlaca, a spokesman for ESPN. ``We're disappointed, but we're
still a lifeline to NASCAR fans online and on our program, `RPM
2Night.'''
</P>
<P>
   ABC will lose five Winston Cup and two Busch races. CBS will
lose four Winston Cup races, including the marquee Daytona 500, and
three Busch races. TNN, which is owned by CBS and was its partner
in the NASCAR talks, carries 18 Winston Cup and Busch events.
</P>
<P>
   With two races left on the Winston Cup circuit this season, CBS
has averaged a 6.4 Nielsen rating and ABC, a 5.3. On the cable
side, ESPN has a 3.2 rating, TNN a 3.0 and TBS a 3.4. Sports
ratings at those levels are rare in this era of fragmented viewing
habits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quick three days of NASCAR negotiations set the stage for
the culmination next week of a new deal for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association men's basketball tournament. CBS, which now
carries the tournament under a seven-year, $1.7 billion contract,
is competing against ABC/ESPN, Fox/Fox Sports Net and ISL Worldwide
for a deal that could exceed $4 billion over 10 years.

CLINIC CHAIN PLANS TO SHED 53 OUTLETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (rk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral Health Systems, the largest operator of
privately run psychiatric hospitals and clinics, said Wednesday
that it planned to sell 53 of the 96 centers it operates.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Behavioral, which is a unit of the Crescent Real Estate
Equities Co., a Fort Worth-based company headed by the billionaire
investor Richard Rainwater, had said that it was losing money at
many of its psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials are continuing to investigate the hospital
chain for patient abuse and Medicaid fraud. Company officials, who
have announced the closing of several Charter Behavioral hospitals
in recent months, have said that those closings are unrelated to
the federal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was a setback for Rainwater, who
invested $400 million in 1997 to purchase a 50 percent stake in
Charter Behavioral from Magellan Health Services Inc. That deal was
structured to provide $50 million annually in rental income from
the psychiatric hospitals to Crescent Real Estate, a real estate
investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that deal, the psychiatric hospital company was also
supposed to pay some $80 million annually in franchise fees to
Magellan, a health care company of which Rainwater is the largest
single shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatric chain soon fell behind on its franchise fee
payments and Magellan Health exercised an option in 1997 to cut the
hospital chain's operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   And for Crescent Real Estate, it said Wednesday that its
third-quarter earnings fell 38 percent, to $57.2 million, or 43
cents a share, from $91.7 million, or 62 cents a share, in the
period a year earlier. The results reflect a $30.8 million charge
to reflect the canceling of booked rent from the Charter hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Crescent Real Estate Equities rose 43.75 cents, to
$16.875. Because of federal tax laws governing real estate
investment trusts, Crescent Real Estate could not operate the
Charter facilities without jeopardizing its favorable tax status.
As a result, Rainwater and his associates created a separate public
company, Crescent Operating Inc. whose shares fell 6.25 cents
Wednesday, to $3.9375.  &QL;

ALLSTATE POISED TO SELL INSURANCE OVER TELEPHONE AND INTERNET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major shift in sales strategy, the Allstate Corp. said
Wednesday it would begin selling auto and homeowners' insurance and
other coverage over the telephone and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, one of the nation's largest insurers, said it was
not abandoning its force of 15,200 agents. But it expected them to
continue selling and to provide service for customers who wanted
personal attention after buying coverage through the new methods.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Allstate's embrace of the new technology _ the first
major insurer with a large sales force to fully do so _ means the
dawning of a new day for the agents.
</P>
<P>
   The company's trend toward converting its agents to independent
contractors _who pay for office expenses and health insurance,
instead of being Allstate employees _ is accelerating; by July,
there will be virtually no agents on staff.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean less job security for the 6,500 agents who are
still in process of changing to independent contractors. But
company executives said that it would also mean opportunities for
higher commissions, more freedom to expand and, for the first time,
the ability for agents who are retiring to sell their book of
clients to another agent rather than simply pass them along without
a farewell profit.
</P>
<P>
   In another jolt to its employees, Allstate, whose shares are
down significantly from a year ago, said Wednesday that it would
cut 4,000 back-office positions, about 10 percent of its
administrative staff, from its payroll by the end of next year as
part of a plan to reduce operating expenses by $600 million
annually. Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate, said
the savings would roughly equal the new expenses of setting up the
telephone and computer operations and promoting them nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate and other major insurers, have been watching the rapid
growth of smaller companies like Geico, a Berkshire Hathaway
subsidiary that sells its policies only over the telephone, and the
Progressive Corp., which uses the phone, the Internet and
independent agents. Traditional insurers have tried to figure out
how to use the new sales approaches without inciting rebellions
among their agents.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate believes it has struck a balance by, for example,
promising to pay local agents a commission of between 2 percent and
3.5 percent for Internet and telephone sales of auto policies to
customers in the agents' territories.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for those commissions _ which compare with
commissions for an auto policy of about 8 percent for staff agents
and 10 percent for independent contractors _ the agents will be
expected to help any client who asks for information or submits a
claim. Customers who give their approval will be referred to local
agents; the agents will receive full commissions on any sales they
develop as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts said, many agents may interpret Allstate's
move to phone and Internet operations as their own company creating
competition for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine a lot of agents will hate this deal,'' said
Brian Sullivan, the editor of Auto Insurance Report, a national
newsletter in Dana Point, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald W. Frank, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that
the company and the agents had come to an inevitable turning point,
with little choice but to follow customer demand. ``If the customer
wants to do business over the Internet, the agent isn't going to
see that business no matter what,'' he said. ``The agents have to
realize they're competing with the Internet whether they like it or
not. ''
</P>
<P>
   One factor that may temper any sense of competition between the
company and its agents is that Allstate plans to offer its
insurance at one price, regardless of how the customer buys it.
Geico boasts it can save clients as much as 15 percent on auto
coverage, partly because it pays no commissions to agents. Many
companies offering policies on the Internet have yet to pass along
to customers the benefit of lower operating expenses. But analysts
say that is likely to become the trend.
</P>
<P>
   What has driven the rapid growth in insurance sales over the
phone and Internet has been convenience and, in many cases, lower
prices. Allstate is betting that customers will value its brand
name and the services of its agents and claims representatives more
than a rock-bottom price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question no one can now answer for sure,'' said Weston
Hicks, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, ``is to what extent
homeowners' and auto insurance are becoming commodities in which
the only thing people care about is price.'' &QL;

BRATZKE RETURNS TO NEW YORK TO FACE FORMER TEAMMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The more Chad Bratzke heard the term,
the more it began to grate on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody labeled me an overachiever,'' said Bratzke, the
former Giant who returns to Giants Stadium Sunday with his new
team, the Indianapolis Colts. ``And it kept going, always there in
every reference to me. It started as a compliment, after awhile it
becomes kind of condescending. Why can't I be called a good player
like everyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't being called an overachiever, it was said of
Bratzke that the best thing he had going for him was playing
defensive end on the other side of the line from the Giants'
Michael Strahan. When Bratzke had 11 sacks last season, it was
often suggested that Bratzke was free to rush the passer because
the opposition had focused so much attention on Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke, speaking in a conference call Wednesday with reporters,
had an answer for that affront, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told people here, `It's not like I was never blocked,'''
Bratzke said. ``Michael is a good player. I'm a good player, too.
We complemented each other. Maybe in the beginning of the season,
he was double-teamed, but by midseason, they had to spread it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke returns to Giants Stadium with seven sacks in the Colts'
eight games, two and a half more than Strahan has. And Bratzke
arrives as a star of an up-and-coming team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be out of the shadow of a lot of players,'' he
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan and Bratzke would have been a tandem worth keeping
together, but the Giants never really had a chance to keep the
proficient bookends of their 1998 defensive line intact. Bratzke
was an unrestricted free agent last winter, attracting $30 million
contract offers. The Giants could not afford to compete in the
Bratzke sweepstakes unless they were willing to forgo their plans
to give Strahan, a free agent-to-be in 2000, a lengthy contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   So the Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, congratulated
Bratzke when he received a $9 million signing bonus and an annual
average salary of $5 million from Indianapolis last February.
Bratzke, in turn, called many of the Giants' coaches and employees,
thanking them for their support in his four years with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was realistic and understood what happened,'' said Bratzke,
who returned to Giants Stadium to visit with his former teammates
during the Colts' bye week in October. ``There's no bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the Giants gave Strahan a $12 million signing
bonus as part of a four-year, $32 million package.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game as a Colt, Bratzke had three sacks. And the
sacks kept coming in bunches _ two against Cincinnati, two more
against Dallas _ until Bratzke was ranked third in the National
Football League, an accomplishment that has not gone unnoticed by
his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Oben, the Giants' left tackle, whose principal assignment
Sunday will be to block Bratzke, said Wednesday: ``I know a lot of
people questioned his sack total, but he's got seven already and
Strahan isn't there. They're not going to give you anything in this
league. If you've got seven sacks, you're a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke and Oben said their familiarity with each other wouldn't
play much of a factor in their matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure he knows me and I know him,'' Bratzke said. ``There's
no advantage to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oben, meanwhile, said facing someone in practice, when players
are rarely going full speed, doesn't tell you much about tendencies
used in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning more about him watching film this week,'' Oben
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oben said that his defensive teammates, notably Strahan and
tackle Keith Hamilton, have reminded him that they don't want to be
embarrassed by Bratzke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things where Keith will yell, `You got
Bratzke this week,''' Oben said. ``And he'll give me a wink. I know
they're counting on me and I know emotionally, it'll mean something
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big week that way. Because everyone knows Chad is a
hard worker and I know he'll come to Giants Stadium wanting to play
his best. He'll bring a lot of intensity and it'll be my job to
match that.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan acknowledged the Giants want to stop Bratzke, and all
his Colts teammates, but he said he thought most of his teammates
were proud that Bratzke was doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad for him,'' Strahan said. ``We miss playing with him
and we miss having him around as a person more.''

THE SPOTLIGHT SHIFTS TO THE RING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A hard wind was whipping around Columbus Circle, the
last remnants of Hurricane Floyd, bending trees, swatting away
umbrellas, splattering buildings with raindrops the size of peanut
M&AMP;M's. Inside the glass-enclosed restaurant Jean Georges, at the
circle's northern perimeter, everything was calm and dry, a cool
yellow light and low murmurs merging with the herbal vapors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the work,'' said Denzel Washington, seated
at one of the prime banquettes in a rectangular recess. ``I worked
as hard on this film as any film I've ever been on. I feel good
knowing I did all I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   That film is ``The Hurricane,'' based on the story of Rubin
(Hurricane) Carter, the middleweight boxer who spent 19 years in
New Jersey prisons for murders he insisted he did not commit, until
a federal judge overturned his conviction and freed him.
</P>
<P>
   The case became a cause celebre briefly in the 1970s, inspiring
numerous protests and a popular Bob Dylan song. The film will be
released by Universal Studios on Dec. 29 in New York and Los
Angeles to qualify for Academy Award consideration.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, ``The Hurricane'' is frequently mentioned on the
short list of films most likely to draw major Oscar nominations, if
not for best picture, then perhaps for Norman Jewison's direction
and almost certainly for Washington's commanding performance. His
name almost always comes up, along with Kevin Spacey in ``American
Beauty,'' Tom Hanks in ``The Green Mile,'' Jim Carrey in ``Man in
the Moon,'' Al Pacino in ``The Insider'' and a few others, when
studio executives, agents and publicists try to figure the odds on
who will win the coming Oscar for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   One top executive _ from a studio that is not releasing ``The
Hurricane'' _ recently paused while making grand Oscar claims for
actors in a couple of his releases, shook his head and said: ``I
don't know. To tell you the truth, I'm starting to get the feeling
that this may really be Denzel's year.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be an active season for Washington. Besides ``The
Hurricane,'' he is starring in a thriller, ``The Bone Collector,''
as a quadriplegic detective tracking a serial killer with the help
of an ambitious rookie (Angelina Jolie). The film opened to mixed
reviews Nov. 5, though Washington's performance drew wide praise,
and it ended up No. 1 at the box office in its first weekend,
earning $17.2 million and beating out such highly lauded
competitors as Michael Mann's tobacco-industry drama, ``The
Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewison, who directed Washington when he played a supporting
role in the 1984 film ``A Soldier's Story,'' said: ``I really,
truly think that he has done the best work of his career in this
film. His concentration, his research, his ability to inhabit every
scene that he's in is really phenomenal. I know, I know. People
think, it's my movie _ what else am I going to say? But I really
believe that this man is working at the top of his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said he was interested in boxing and had once tried,
long before this project, to buy the movie rights to Carter's
prison memoirs. ``I was a fan before, but now I'm hooked,'' he
said. ``To me, it's a mano-a-mano thing, the essence of men. Its
right there in the eyes _ you know, the way you stand, the way you
size something up.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked for months to prepare for the role, going to a Los
Angeles gym (``a little punky place off Sunset'') to spar with some
of the regulars. At first, he took whatever they dished out, but
then he limited the sparring to his body. ``They hit you pretty
hard in the head,'' he said, ``and I don't know, I kind of started
forgetting stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He vividly remembered Jewison's taking him aside early in the
preparations for the film to impress upon him the need to be in
shape. ``He said to me: `Denzel, you're going to be out there in
your shorts. There's nothing I can do with the camera. You just
have to come ready. I'm going to be ready, so you better be ready,
too.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Washington had played a character who was
still alive while he was shooting the film, which he said was
strikingly different from playing, say, Malcolm X. ``For one
thing,'' he said, ``I could get on the phone and call him up in the
middle of a scene and say, `Hey, Rubin, what was this really
like?''' And it was different because he told me if I didn't get
this right, he was going to come and see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is known to be wary of reporters, especially when the
questioning turns to his private life, but over dinner he was
affable and open, eager to talk about his work but showing no sign
of bristling when the conversation turned to his home and family.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Paulette Pearson, a singer and actress, and
their five children are building a house up in the Hollywood Hills,
and he talks happily about his passion for cooking (``I'm only
acting until I can get a good cooking job'') and his burgeoning
interest in fine wines.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family attend Pentecostal West Angeles Church, and he
proudly talked about a trip he and his wife made to South Africa in
January, during which they renewed their wedding vows before
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and met with Nelson Mandela ( Washington
does a killer Mandela impersonation, complete with the halting,
regal delivery that is punctuated with bobs of the head.)
</P>
<P>
   At Jean Georges, the rain was slapping at the floor-to-ceiling
windows, as if the whole building was being run through a car wash.
Washington studied the wine list in the dim light, then waved to
the sommelier. ``I want something nice,'' he said. ``A burgundy, a
nice one, maybe a '93.''
</P>
<P>
   The sommelier rattled off a couple of selections and recommended
one. ``Sounds good,'' Washington said. ``We'll try that.'' No price
was mentioned, nor was it after the meal, when Washington noticed
the sommelier pouring a glass of golden wine at a nearby table,
asked what it was and was told it was a Chateau d'Yquem. ``That
sounds good,'' he said. ``We'll have a couple of glasses of that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are stars you would hardly recognize on the street, so
drastically does the camera alter them and find something
fascinating in their faces. And then there are stars like
Washington, who are even more striking in person, as if they carry
the projector's light around with them. All around the room, fancy
people peeked at him from the corner of their eyes, and when he
walked through the restaurant, he left behind him a kind of domino
effect of gaping.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The interview in late September was so far in advance of the
opening of ``Hurricane'' because Washington was about to head to
Georgia to begin work on ``Remember the Titans,'' about a black
high school football coach. Once he starts working, he does not
like to be distracted by interviews or publicity or anything but
the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very serious-minded actor,'' said Ed Zwick, who
directed Washington's Oscar-winning performance in ``Glory'' and
has worked with him on two other films. ``I wouldn't say his
process is academic, but it's very, very thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not merely a result of research, Zwick said. ``Most
actors, in my experience, when you say `Action!' their blood
pressure goes up; there is some tension, some intensity, some sense
of performance anxiety,'' he said. ``I am convinced that with
Denzel, when you say `Action!' his blood pressure actually goes
down. There is some kind of profound and intense relaxation which
allows him to be so fully in the moment rather than to need to hype
up an emotion. His sense of presence is extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   At his banquette, Washington took great delight in the
accouterments of the table: the crystal, the silver and especially
the odd implements. He peppered the waiter with questions about the
food and whatever else captured his interest.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a delighted grin spreading across his face, he
picked up a strange, glittering contraption attached to a duck leg.
``What is this?'' he asked. ``Why do I need it?'' It looked like a
cross between a piece of Byzantine jewelry and a menacing implement
from a David Cronenberg film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bone holder, sir,'' murmured the waiter, who then
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The smile completely took over Washington's face. He held the
delicate silver piece up in the low candlelight. ``A bone holder!''
he exclaimed, turning it around like a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had decided to stay at the Trump International Hotel
(the restaurant is on its street level) during his visit to New
York partly because it is near Central Park, where he loves to
walk, but also because it is just down the street from the Lincoln
Center campus of Fordham University, where he went to college.
``Right down there,'' he said, pointing out into the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was born 44 years ago in Mount Vernon, N.Y. His
father, Denzel Washington Sr. (the name came from a Dr. Denzel, who
had delivered him), was a preacher; his mother, Lennis, was a
beautician, and the young Denzel, the second of three children,
split his time between the church and the beauty parlor. He
describes his childhood as family-oriented and religious, which
made life all the more difficult when his parents separated when he
was 14.
</P>
<P>
   At Fordham he majored in journalism but gradually segued into
theater. After college, he won a scholarship at the American
Conservatory Theater in San Francisco but left after a year,
restless and eager to work. He had small roles in some television
movies (he and his wife met while shooting `Wilma'' in 1977), and
in 1981 he did his first theatrical film, ``Carbon Copy,'' a
forgettable comedy in which he was the black son George Segal
didn't know he had.
</P>
<P>
   But his career really took off in 1982, when he landed the role
of Dr. Phillip Chandler in the television series ``St. Elsewhere,''
which ran for six seasons on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was in his third season on the series when he won the
plum supporting role in Jewison's ``Soldier's Story.'' It was the
real beginning of his screen career, which has included work with
Sidney Lumet in ``Power'' (1986), Sir Richard Attenborough in ``Cry
Freedom'' (1987), Alan J. Pakula in ``The Pelican Brief'' (1993),
Jonathan Demme in ``Philadelphia'' (1993), and three films each
with Spike Lee (``Mo' Better Blues'' in 1990, ``Malcolm X'' in 1992
and ``He Got Game'' in 1998) and Zwick (``Glory'' in 1989,
``Courage Under Fire'' in 1996 and ``The Siege'' in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   If ``Hurricane'' does result in an Oscar nomination, it will be
Washington's fourth. He was nominated for best actor in ``Malcolm
X'' and for best supporting actor in ``Cry Freedom,'' and won the
supporting award as the bitter slave soldier Trip in ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   He has heard all the Oscar talk about ``Hurricane'' and says he
really does try to shrug it off, at least at this point. ``Look,''
he said. ``it's still very early.'' He's been through it before.
And besides, Washington said, he doesn't quite know how to take
such awards, partly because the craft of acting is still, in many
ways, mysterious to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days, you're just swimming through Jell-O, no matter what
you do,'' he said. ``Other days, you can do no wrong and people ask
you to take credit for it. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   He also tries never to read reviews of his work, he said,
swirling the last of the Sauternes around in the bottom of his wine
glass as a blast of wind thumped the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you're in a movie and you know whether it's good or
not,'' he said. ``Right? I mean, you know. You really do know. So
if you've got one that's not so good, do you really want to read
about it?''
</P>
<P>
   More important to Washington is the way the director feels about
his work, the way his colleagues feel about it and, most important,
the way he feels about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is the best you can,'' he said. ``I put it all
up there on the screen. That's all I can do. This time, though,
mostly I'm worried about Rubin coming to get me.''

`E.R.' IS BACK ON ITS FEET AFTER MAJOR SURGERY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The blood on the floor on the set of ``E.R.''
at Warner Brothers looks perfectly real. The freshly painted
lime-green walls have that hospital look. The nurses' desk is
covered with medical records and stethoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's really changed,'' said Anthony Edwards, whose role
as Dr. Mark Greene on the top-rated drama for the last five years
is even more powerful this season. ``And maybe everything's
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. One of the most successful and enduring series in
television history _ which barely made it to the air in 1994
because NBC executives at the time doubted the viability of a
hospital show _ ``E.R.'' has undergone radical surgery this season
after weakening considerably last year, partly because of the
departure of George Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   The patient has rebounded and maintains high ratings, but the
aging process leads to vulnerability. (Among viewers 18 to 49, the
series has actually declined this year.)
</P>
<P>
   For its creators and stars, who have become extraordinarily
wealthy as a result of the success of ``E.R.,'' the acknowledgment
that the show lost its way last year and had to be mended quickly
has resulted in new cast members and new story lines. ``There was a
feeling last year that the show was fluttery, that a great deal of
attention was paid to the George Clooney character's exit story,''
said Lydia Woodward, one of the executive producers, who runs
``E.R.'' on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it was a really good arc and George was terrific,'' Ms.
Woodward said, speaking with obvious diplomacy, ``it ended up
taking more energy away from some of the other story lines. The
show was less balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wells, an executive producer and the guiding force behind
the show, was blunter. ``We had a down year,'' he said. ``We felt
it needed a little invigorating. With George leaving, we felt it
was time to shake things up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking things up on ``E.R.'' is a virtual mandate from its
studio, Warner Brothers, and its network, NBC. Last year NBC agreed
to pay a record license fee of $13 million an episode for three
seasons, which vastly enriched Warner Brothers Television, Wells,
Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, whose company, Amblin, was
one of the founding producers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time several of the orginal cast members have
extended their contracts for lavish sums. Edwards agreed to three
more years for a package that reaches $35 million, according to
Variety. Eriq La Salle, who plays Dr. Peter Benton, signed on for
three years at $27 million. Noah Wyle has also signed up for a
windfall in the same financial ballpark as La Salle's. (Because of
Clooney's departure to pursue a film career, the importance of
retaining the other stars became especially important for the
studio.)
</P>
<P>
   Julianna Margulies, whose character, Nurse Carol Hathaway, is
pregnant (by Clooney's character) with twins that will be born on
the Thanksgiving night episode, remains a holdout. She said she
would probably leave the show after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think I'm crazy; it's not about money for me,''
said Ms. Margulies. ``I need to move on personally and
professionally. It's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 37, is looking forward to the end of the series, too.
He plans eventually to move to New York with his wife and their two
children. (``It's a city we love, it's easier to be anonymous there
and, no offense to my dry cleaner, I won't have to discuss `E.R.'s'
Nielsen ratings with him.'')
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the departure of Clooney has left a sex-symbol
void in the show that will be filled by Edwards, Wyle and La Salle
_ and a newcomer, Goran Visnjic, who plays Dr. Luka Kovac, a
Croatian survivor of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Visnjic, 27, the son of a Croatian bus driver, has the
heavy-lidded features of a matinee idol and has appeared in films
like ``Welcome to Sarajevo'' and ``The Peacemaker'' (opposite
Clooney).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward, the executive producer, did not deny that the
actor was hired, at least in part, to fill Clooney's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the fact that he was foreign was an asset,'' said Ms.
Woodward. ``I mean, George was unbelievably popular and so was his
character. And the press stories about him leaving were incredibly
boring and a little annoying to everyone who works on the show
because we see the show in much bigger terms, with great actors.
It's never been really about one actor. So given that we knew we
were going to bring in another male actor onto the show, the fact
that he's Croatian kind of helped keep it not right on point.''
</P>
<P>
   In his small trailer off the set, Visnjic seemed as nervous
about his English _ he works with a dialect coach daily _ as about
the notion that he's somehow replacing Clooney. ``I feel like I'm
riding a bicycle on a highway,'' he said about working in English.
``All these guys are so fast and know their job. And these
complicated medical terms!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Visnjic also said he had recently spent at least an hour putting
and taking off surgical gloves. It takes a doctor perhaps two
seconds to slap on the gloves, he says, but an average person takes
15 or 20 seconds. So, during a break, he practiced, with a doctor's
help and 100 pair of gloves, and learned to speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   As for replacing Clooney, Visnjic said, ``I don't want to think
about it, because what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the show further, the producers have brought in two
well-known actors as recurring characters. Alan Alda, the
``M-A-S-H'' veteran, plays a respected doctor on the staff of
County General Hospital who seems uneasy with new medicine. Rebecca
De Mornay plays a socialite who has had an affair with Dr. John
Carter ( Wyle). She learned she had breast cancer and had a
mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a May-December romance,'' said Wyle, 27, who
began on ``E.R.'' as a well-meaning, somewhat innocent medical
student and is now clearly in line to turn up the heat off-duty.
``My character has had some love affairs in the past, but he
doesn't seem to have what it takes to make a relationship go past
seven episodes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Edwards, Wyle said that the longtime cast of actors _ most
of them trained in the theater _ made it almost impossible to coast
along, even five years into the show. ``It's like working with
excellent tennis players who require you to be at the top of your
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Wyle said, the ``E.R.'' actors and creators had
an unwritten rule. ``We'd never let the camera linger on our faces;
we'd never take personal moments,'' he said. ``The idea was never
to create a star but a truly believable three-dimensional
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Edwards said: ``We've had this expression from Day 1,
which is, when you have a really heavy moment, walk away from it. I
don't want to have the audience sit there and watch my character
sob every week. You can see that on other shows. We don't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In shaping the show this season and looking ahead, Ms. Woodward,
the writers and the medical advisers are clearly preparing for the
possible departure of Ms. Margulies and broadening the roles of
longtime cast members. ( Wells is heavily involved with two other
shows, ``The West Wing'' and ``Third Watch.'')
</P>
<P>
   Two actresses, Ming-Na (``The Joy Luck Club''), who appeared on
the first season of ``E.R.,'' and Maura Tierney (``News Radio'').
will be joining the cast as regulars later in the season. Another
actress, Michael Michele (``Homicide''), has already joined the
ensemble as a resident in emergency medicine and pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all those medical emergencies, sex will
proliferate on ``E.R.'' Aside from the Wyle-De Mornay affair, the
Anthony Edwards character is having a romance with Dr. Elizabeth
Corday, played by the British actress Alex Kingston. La Salle,
whose initially hard-edged and humorless Dr. Benton is undergoing a
transformation as he struggles with a deaf son, said with a laugh
that he expected his character to have a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The La Salle character is wrestling with the issue of whether or
not he's the actual father of the boy, as well as the mother's plan
to take the child with her to live in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Martin, 23, an actress who joined the cast last year (and
took a break as a senior majoring in art history at Yale), sat in
her trailer the other afternoon and said that the nervousness of
her character as a fourth-year medical student on ``E.R.'' mirrored
her own fears. ``When I joined the show it was the most intimidated
I've ever been,'' said Ms. Martin. ``It's a train. It's a train
that doesn't stop for anyone. It just goes. And if you can't keep
up, you shouldn't be here. It kind of separates the men from the
boys, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby trailer, Laura Innes, a repertory-trained stage
actress who has, over five years, played one of the more
unpredictable doctors on ``E.R.,'' _ the audience rarely knows
whether to like or dislike Dr. Kerry Weaver, her character _ said
she had repeatedly implored the writers of the show to add new
dimension to Weaver, who walks with a limp and depends on a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've said many, many times is that my character
should in some ways be sexualized and have a personal life,'' said
Ms. Innes. ``Not only for me and my ego and my identity as an
actress, but also as a character with a disability. I mean, people
with disabilities are marginalized sexually all the time. And I
don't just mean sex, I mean romance and intimacy. I'm obviously not
the hot sexy one. But I just want her to have a fuller life.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is confronting a stranger issue. After all these years
on ``E.R.,'' he has found that some audience members really do seem
to believe that actors who play doctors have gone to medical
school. On a recent trip from New York, he recalled, a flight
attendant came up to him and said, ``God, I wish you were here
yesterday because we had a stroke on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards sighed. ``If I have a stroke on a plane,'' he said, ``I
want a real doctor.''

AT LAST, BUILDINGS ARE THE STUFF OF DREAMS 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 14)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By HERBERT MUSCHAMP  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, a pundit observed that the millennium was
shaping up to be a major dud. No one really cared about it, no one
was excited about it, the whole thing was a bore, ho-hum,
zz-zz-zz-zz.
</P>
<P>
   What was this commentator expecting? Mass suicides, perhaps? A
reversal of the earth's poles? But if there's any truth to his
observation, one reason may be that for many of us now the major
events of the day are internal. They are happenings in the life of
the body and the mind.
</P>
<P>
   And if this, and much more than this, is true, then the cause
for celebration came early this year. It arrived on Nov. 4 with the
centennial of the publication of Freud's ``Interpretation of
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, however, is entitled to toot its horn this New
Year's Eve. Compared with other art forms, it has remained
remarkably impervious to the influence of Freudian ideas. For many
people, buildings still represent the world of external reality:
the faces we put on in public, the appeals to science, civility,
God, gravitas, nature, the past, the future and other authorities
outside the self. Subjective states _ dreams, fantasies, memories,
fears and desires _ have been largely contained within the compass
of interior design.
</P>
<P>
   Among younger architects, however, there is growing
determination to break out of this binary inside-outside structure.
And the computer has emerged as a highly effective tool for
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, New Yorkers got a glimpse of pioneering work
at the Presbyterian Church of New York, a building in Sunnyside,
Queens, designed by Greg Lynn, Doug Garofalo and Michael McInturf.
A renovated Art Deco structure, the church only partly demonstrates
the so-called blob-design that has taken shape on the video
monitors of a computer-driven generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the church's twisted stairs, its asymmetrical interior and
the projection of the sanctuary's serrated edge outside the
building envelope bring to mind the deceptively illogical,
discontinuous imagery of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Ocean, a European design collaborative, also evokes
a dreamscape quality. The group's Toolo Sports Arena, an unrealized
Finnish project from 1997, is a fluid, cloudlike structure, with
bleachers and a roof that resemble sheets of gauze floating down a
stream of consciousness. It could be a bullfight stadium designed
by Salvador Dali in free association with Frederick's of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Like the team that designed the church in Queens, Ocean is
composed of architects who live in different cities _ in their
case, Helsinki, Oslo, London and Cologne _ and work together in a
paperless virtual office somewhere in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Their method of working recalls ``The Exquisite Corpse,'' a
Surrealist variation of the children's game in which the players
produce a composite image by drawing on the horizontal segments of
a folded piece of paper. For Ocean, the piece of paper is a bunch
of pixels on the screen of a computer running a program called
Alias Wavefront.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ocean's forms and computerized design techniques are
innovative, their project can claim an important lineage: buildings
that drew directly or indirectly on Surrealism, or were thought to
anticipate Surrealist ideas. For example, Notre Dame du Haut at
Ronchamps, designed by Le Corbusier and regarded by many as this
century's greatest masterwork, ushers the visitor into something
akin to the semihypnotic state that therapists call guided
visualization.
</P>
<P>
   As Charles Jencks showed in ``The Language of Post-Modern
Architecture,'' the exterior evokes a multiplicity of images: a
shell, a dove, a cleric's hat. In its celebrated interior, shafts
of light stream from openings in the wall. The different-sized
windows are scattered in an irregular pattern across the wall. Le
Corbusier insisted that the shapes and patterns were not arbitrary,
but derived from a proportional system based on the Golden Section.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, the claim paralleled the Freudian idea that a
logical structure underlies jokes, slips and other seemingly random
events.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Le Corbusier's earlier admirers, most notably Nikolaus
Pevsner, deplored what they considered his retreat from the
rationalism of his early work into the realm of fantasy and
intuition. In fact, Le Corbusier had shown an early taste for
Surrealism. In 1929, he designed a ``Room With an Open Sky'' for
the top of an apartment building in Paris. With its conventional
living room furniture grouped around a traditional fireplace, the
roofless space resembles a painting by Magritte.
</P>
<P>
   La Ville Radieuse, the 1930 plan in which the architect extended
his rationalist ideas to urban scale, was legendarily hatched in a
moment of Surrealist wit. Asked to contribute to a show on
urbanism, Le Corbusier asked the organizers to define the term.
They informed him that urbanism referred to sculpture, signs,
street furniture and such. ``Fine,'' replied the architect. ``I
will design a great fountain, and behind it I will place a city for
three million people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To analyze the effects of this building is inevitably to analyze
the self. Images arise and melt back into the curving, shimmering
skin, inducing a state of mind in which we lose a clear sense of
distinction between the architecture and ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like other great buildings, Bilbao creates its own history.
Besides casting works like Ronchamps in a new light, Bilbao invites
alternative readings of many projects that preceded it. The Miesian
skyscraper, generally seen as an example of modern architecture at
its most rational, derives from the fantastic visions stimulated by
glass in the minds of German Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the restrained form Mies gave it, glass architecture was
instrumental in realizing the Surrealist ambition to dissolve the
boundaries between interior and exterior space.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, that goal has taken different form in projects
like Rem Koolhaas's proposed Jussieux Library in Paris, Steven
Holl's Kiasma museum in Helsinki, Zaha Hadid's design for
Cincinnati's Museum of Contemporary Art and the ground floor and
garden of Philippe Starck's Delano Hotel in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Idiosyncratic forms, atmospheric lighting, novel arrangements of
furniture, vertiginous elevations, stairs and sloping floors that
extend the street and grounds inside: such devices are as much
psychological as aesthetic provocations. They pull conflict into
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology shifts interaction between inside and
outside to a new plane. Ocean's intercity design process generates
a portable, shared social space that can be reconfigured according
to the needs of a particular project. The design itself makes
possible a mutable organization for different public events.
</P>
<P>
   Their Toolo Open Arena would have been located between a park
north of the center of Helsinki and an existing stadium built for
the 1952 Olympic Games. The arena seats more than 8,000 and is
mainly intended for football. But the building's three sloping,
rippling levels of metal and concrete are also designed to
accommodate smaller gatherings: concerts, plays, fashion shows and
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean's design recalls elements of Finnish topography _ lakes,
streams, forests _ that Alvar Aalto incorporated into the Viipuri
City Library and other works. But it conveys with equal potency
what Manuel Castel calls the space of flows: the fluid, shifting
network of computerized communication.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatic Americans, in particular, may find it easy to dismiss
this as yet another architectural fantasy, a typical example of
professional pie in the sky. Yet the design, which is entirely
feasible with existing technologies, typifies something far more
complex, and even down-to-earth. It offers a poetic view of the
architect's condition, which involves a negotiation between the
interior realm of form and symbol and the world of material
reality. This negotiation between objectivity and subjectivity is
one of the major functions architecture can perform.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture has been called a social art, and in this
psychoanalyzed age it is not rude to say that it can also be a form
of social therapy. Buildings may well continue to reinforce
compliance with outmoded social norms, but it would be madness to
think that this is what art is meant to do.

LESTER BOWIE, 58, INNOVATIVE JAZZ TRUMPETER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ill., N.Y., Mo., )  (lh) 
 By BEN RATLIFF

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trumpeter, band leader and composer Lester Bowie,
an icon of the experimental movement in jazz from the mid-1960s on
who was also known for his comic shows and jazz-based treatments of
pop music, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said his brother Byron.
</P>
<P>
   Best known as a member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Bowie
performed and recorded for more than 30 years. In that group he
developed the two things that would brand him: his knowing, Groucho
Marx-like sense of humor, expressed musically and otherwise, and
his appearance. In most performances, he wore a long white lab
coat, and his narrow face was bracketed by a flat-top haircut and a
sharp goatee. In publicity photos he was rarely seen without a
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   His early working experiences were in rhythm-and-blues bands,
and a slow, expressive blues was his specialty. But the most famous
part of Bowie's trumpet language was timbral effects _ glissandos,
smears, growls, flutters, half-valved winces and other
vocalizations that worked their way into the style of almost every
self-consciously experimental jazz trumpeter who came after him,
including Butch Morris, Dave Douglas, Herb Robertson and Roy
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   His recordings often seemed like prankish arguments that the
only way to understand jazz is to see it both in carnivalesque and
intellectual contexts, to play circus music and modernist post-bop,
pure hit-parade pop and nearly academic composition.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie was born in Frederick, Md. His father was a trumpeter who
turned to high-school teaching after striving for a performance
career in classical music. At age 5 Bowie was playing trumpet in
daily practice with his father, and he played in dance bands as a
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Army at the age of 17 and was stationed in Texas,
where he served as a military policeman. Bowie credited his career
longevity to the four years he spent in the service. After his
discharge he played in bands led by blues and rhythm-and-blues
performers including Albert King, Jackie Wilson, Rufus Thomas and
Joe Tex, and was privately rehearsing more experimental music with
St. Louis musicians like Julius Hemphill and Oliver Lake.
</P>
<P>
   He married a rhythm-and-blues singer, Fontella Bass, and moved
to Chicago in 1965 to become her musical director. During that
period Ms. Bass recorded ``Rescue Me,'' which became a major hit on
radio. The marriage ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago Bowie worked with a big band led by George Hunter and
played in rhythm-and-blues studio sessions, including many for
Chess Records. Tiring of the grind, he followed the advice of a
saxophonist colleague, Delbert Hill, and attended a composers'
workshop led by the pianist Muhal Richard Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those in the workshop, including Roscoe Mitchell, Henry
Threadgill, Joseph Jarman, Anthony Braxton and Jack DeJohnette,
would in the next decade become major figures in the new jazz.
Abrams' workshop bands formed the nucleus of the Association for
the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the nonprofit cooperative
first organized in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell created a band with three other AACM members: Bowie,
the bassist Malachi Favors and the drummer Phillip Wilson. When
Wilson left, the band had trouble finding a replacement. Out of
desperation, its members incorporated small percussion instruments
_ gongs, bells, shakers _ into their group improvisations. This
sound would be one of the staple gestures of the music played by
the Art Ensemble of Chicago, which the Mitchell group became in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   By Bowie's reckoning, the Art Ensemble of Chicago rehearsed
about 300 times a year in Chicago and gave only a handful of
performances because there was almost nowhere to present its music.
So the ensemble traveled to France, where there was curiosity about
American experimental jazz. Members of the ensemble made six albums
in two months and performed hundreds of times in their two years
there. The band played blues and Bach fugues and percussion
interludes and hooting free-improvisation pieces and wore tribalist
face-paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Ensemble's fame followed it back to the United States,
and the group was soon recording for Atlantic Records. By the
mid-'70s the Art Ensemble had an easier time reaching large
audiences. The band soon came to define an esthetic involving
ethnic music, humor, eclecticism and physical intensity that had a
considerable impact.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother Byron, of Frederick, Bowie is
survived by his current wife, Deborah; his father, W. Lester Bowie
Sr., and another brother, Joseph, both of Frederick; six children,
Larry Stevenson of Sardinia, Italy; Ju'lene Coney and Nueka
Mitchell of St. Louis; Sukari Ivester of Chicago; Bahnamous Bowie
of Queens, and Zola Bowie of Brooklyn, and 10 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s Bowie spent two years in Jamaica playing and
teaching trumpet and took a brief trip to Nigeria, where he became
a sideman on three records with the popular bandleader Fela
Anikulapo Kuti.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie started one new band after another, always surrounding
himself with work and often undertaking his own business affairs
without a manager. He led a quintet and a gospel group, From the
Root to the Source. In the early '80s, he formed the New York Hot
Trumpet Quintet, which briefly included Wynton Marsalis. Later
Bowie and Marsalis would often be cited in contrast in debates on
the issue of futurism versus traditionalism in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He assembled a 59-piece band called the Sho Nuff Orchestra for a
concert at Symphony Space in Manhattan. His octet Brass Fantasy,
formed in the mid-'80s, performed versions of pop and funk tunes by
artists like the Platters, Michael Jackson and James Brown, and
recorded for the ECM, DIW and Atlantic record labels. The group's
last album was the 1998 ``Odyssey of Funk and Popular Music, Vol.
1.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Bowie set up the Hip-Hop Feel-Harmonic, an
unrecorded project with rappers and musicians in his Brooklyn
neighborhood of Fort Greene.
</P>
<P>
   His sly sensibility won an appreciative following. An enduring
example was his track ``Jazz Death?'' from a 1968 album by Roscoe
Mitchell's band, ``Congliptious.'' It begins with Bowie
dramatically clearing his throat and asking, ``Is jazz, as we know
it, dead yet?''
</P>
<P>
   The reply is a long trumpet solo punctuated with silences, muted
wah-wah passages, Bowie's own off-horn shrieks and murmured
comments, and finally, six minutes later, a sentence: ``Well, I
guess that all depends on, ah, what you know.''

TRUSTEES VOTE NOT TO RAISE SUNY TUITION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trustees of the State University of New York said Wednesday
that they planned to freeze tuition next year, despite a deficit of
about $77 million at its three teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees at a meeting of the board's finance committee approved
a $1.7 billion budget request Wednesday for the 2000-2001 school
year that held undergraduate tuition flat and called for a $93
million increase in taxpayer support. There is no guarantee,
however, that the governor and the legislature will approve the
request.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which SUNY's full board is expected to approve
later this month, would insulate SUNY's campuses from the deficits
at its three teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, State Comptroller Carl McCall and other state
officials expressed concern that the red ink at the hospitals might
force SUNY to cut campus budgets or raise tuition unless the state
was willing to put up more money, an alternative that state
officials have rejected.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a SUNY spokesman said that the university would not
raise tuition this year but might have to post an increase next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the trustees Wednesday said that they had rejected that
option, and that the hospitals would be expected to cover their
deficits themselves and find ways to close their budget gaps
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the state budget division, SUNY has hired a
consulting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, to develop a turnaround
plan for the hospitals. The firm's report is due in February.
</P>
<P>
   At the finance committee meeting Wednesday, SUNY's chairman,
Thomas F. Egan, said that the university was counting on higher
tuition revenues next year _ about $16.5 million more _ because it
projects higher enrollment, equivalent to about an additional 4,000
full-time students. It currently enrolls more than 350,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so nice to see tuition revenues increase without raising
tuition,'' said Egan, one of the five trustees at the finance
committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The finance committee also approved a final operating budget of
$1.65 billion for the current academic year, a 4 percent increase
over last year, including $52 million for increases in faculty and
staff salaries. That budget, too, is subject to full board
approval, which is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The budget calls for all 34 state operated and statutory
campuses in the SUNY system to receive operating budget increases
over last year.
</P>
<P>
   But for many colleges _ including SUNY Buffalo, the state
colleges at Cornell, four of the five colleges of technology, and
the Old Westbury, Oneonta, Oswego and Fredonia campuses _ those
increases will not be enough to cover the raises mandated in SUNY's
collective bargaining agreement with its faculty and staff.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY Buffalo, for example, will receive $5.4 million more in its
operating budget this year, but it faces $8.4 million in increased
salary costs. The four colleges at Cornell will receive $2.6
million in additional operating funds, but they face additional
salary costs of $4.1 million.

EDITORIAL: THE RAGGED MARCH TO MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, at about the time the Berlin Wall fell, the
government-controlled economies of Eastern and Central Europe began
a long and uncertain trek to market-based economies. They had no
blueprints. Economists had given little thought to creating
capitalism out of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to replace bureaucrats with markets meant that
these countries had to liberalize prices by lifting government
controls. They had to stabilize their economies by controlling
inflation and by keeping government spending in line with tax
revenues. Finally, they had to privatize their industries by
transferring ownership to ordinary citizens. But in what order
should these policies occur, and at what speed? Should these three
pillars of reform start before or after a country had adopted
commercial codes that protect private property and enforce
contracts?
</P>
<P>
   No one knew the answers then. No one knows all the answers now.
But the world has learned some important lessons about reform,
including why it works in some places and not in others.
</P>
<P>
   However remarkable the march of democracy has been across
Eastern and Central Europe, economic progress has been uneven and
often disappointing. When the government planning agencies were
dismantled, the socialized economies imploded. Only a few have
fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's economy is 20 percent larger than it was a decade ago.
The economies of Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary are about
as large today as they were in 1989. But some of the former Soviet
republics continue to shrink, leaving many of their people
desperately poor. Ukraine's output is 60 percent below its 1989
level; Russia's economy has been cut in about half. Incomes in
Kazakhstan and Moldova are falling from already low levels.
</P>
<P>
   These disparities can be traced to a handful of important
factors. Geography is one. Roughly speaking, the closer a country
is to Western Europe, the faster it has grown. Poland, Hungary and
Estonia have done well. Tajikistan and Kazakhstan have not.
Proximity to Western Europe permits a country to sell more exports,
attract more foreign investors and, because of closer political
ties, draw more aid.
</P>
<P>
   But geography is hardly everything. Poland is growing at 4
percent a year, while Ukraine, its neighbor, is shrinking by about
2 percent a year. Obviously other factors _ history and culture _
also matter. The Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, drawing on their
experience with markets before World War II, lost no time creating
small shops and adjusting to new commercial codes of law. But
people in Belarus and Central Asia share no such memories or
skills. The Poles and Hungarians began to decentralize power long
before the wall fell, which led groups like the Solidarity union to
push for reform after Communism ended.
</P>
<P>
   Policies also matter _ a cheery note, since policies are
mutable. Many countries that have adopted textbook versions of
liberalization and stabilization are growing, even if only
modestly. Poland, which adopted shock therapy _ instant price
decontrol and deregulation _ has done the best of all. But
countries like Belarus that have rejected market reforms are
stagnating or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization is a trickier issue. There are no textbook
versions, and the lessons that emerge from Eastern and Central
Europe are murky. Poland privatized small companies quickly, but
took time to place large factories in private hands. Russia and the
Czech Republic tried to instantly privatize large companies by
handing ownership over to citizens through ``voucher'' plans. But
voucher privatization led to fraud, put business enterprises under
the control of incompetent managers and, in Russia, put the
economy's crown jewels in the hands of political insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Countries like Hungary and Estonia that have created safe havens
for foreign and domestic companies are growing. Countries like
Russia that have imposed confiscatory taxes or tolerated organized
crime are fighting to keep their economies afloat. Rudiger
Dornbusch, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, suggests
that it might take 50 years for the former socialist countries to
catch up to the West. If one is sitting in Poland and staring south
toward Hungary, that estimate appears pessimistic. If one stares
eastward, Dornbusch appears wildly optimistic.
