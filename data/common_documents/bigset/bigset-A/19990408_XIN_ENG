<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Election Commission Calls for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Electoral Supervisory
Commission Wednesday urged the government and the opposition
National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) to seek national
compromise, saying it is the only way to break the impasse in
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The commission Chairman Peter Hatendi told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that it was "beyond any doubt" that the two feuding sides
could not proceed without the other and claim to have national
support.
</P>
<P>
The government is insisting on drawing up a new constitution
under the Commission of Inquiry Act while the National
Constitutional Assembly, a grouping of opposition parties and
civic groups, is opposed to the commission being set up by the
president for fear that it would be manipulated.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Assembly has demanded that a legal
framework, binding all parties to stick to the outcome of reforms,
be put in place.
</P>
<P>
"There is mutual mistrust on both sides hence the reluctance to
give in to demands from the other group. The government fears
losing power to the NCA and the NCA fears allowing the government
to produce a constitution that gives all the power to the ruling
party," Hatendi said.
</P>
<P>
"But since both groups seem interested in coming up with a
constitution acceptable to the whole nation and no later than now,
then they should find a middle of the road solution to the
sticking points," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commission also supports the government that a new
constitution be in place before the next general elections early
next year.
</P>
<P>
The NCA has been arguing that constitutional reforms should not
be linked to forthcoming elections as it was a process meant to
provide a permanent framework of Zimbabwe's nationhood.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges SADC to Care More About Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia called on the civil aviation
in Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region on
Wednesday not to compromise safety for the sake of commercial
considerations.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Deputy Minister for Communication and Transport Mann
Muyuni made the appeal while opening the second civil aviation
commercial meeting for SADC Transport and Communications
Commission in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The official called for the establishment of adequate and
reliable infrastructure to support the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although a number of carriers have changed in
line with the liberalization of the industry, this has not changed
the safety of the skies.
</P>
<P>
Muyuni cautioned the commission from cost cutting at the
expense of safety which was of paramount importance, but called
for the standardization of civil aviation to make it competitive.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister revealed that Zambian government was in the
 process of restructuring its civil aviation in order to make it
effective and more responsive to meet the involving challenges of
the civil aviation industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said it is sad to see that passengers at some airports are
still subjected to practices which hinder them to travel freely
such as long queues to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
There was need to find ways and means which should be worked
out to remove blocks to passengers so that they are provided with
quick check in and out, he urged.

<HEADLINE> Moral Education Underlined to Prevent AIDS in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- An advisor to the United Nations
Wednesday urged the Kenyan government to launch a moral education
campaign among children to curb the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
To date prevention focused on the use of condom and education
of awareness is not effective in Africa, said Farzin Davachi,
medical advisor and consultant to the World Health Organization
(WHO), World Bank and Pan American Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The focus should shift to moral education, abstinence before
marriage and faithfulness afterwards, he said, adding that the
Center for Disease Control of the United States have declared
that "the surest way to prevent AIDS is abstinence" after its 15
years of trial and evaluation since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Moral education should concentrate on children since it is
difficult to change an adult's behavior, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of moral education is demonstrated by Uganda,
which is one of the few countries in Africa where AIDS has leveled
 off and may be decreasing, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has fulfilled moral education programs
among children since late 1980s. Moral education and sex
education have been required subjects in primary schools since
then.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan senior officials and media should pay much more
attention and space to the AIDS epidemic, he said.
</P>
<P>
The infection rate of HIV/AIDS in Kenya stands at 10 percent
among the 15-49 age group. More than half of medical beds in
Kenya's hospitals are occupied by people suffering from AIDS and
AIDS-related illness.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, HIV/AIDS has
infected over 34 million people worldwide and two thirds of those
are in sub-Saharan Africa. East African region is the
hardest-hit region in the world.
</P>
<P>
Davachi is visiting Kenya on a mission to sensitize the
country to the dangers of AIDS and help the Kenyan government
reevaluate their AIDS prevention programs.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council will continue its consultations on Iraq Friday which began
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council embarked on the critical discussions this
morning by reviewing reports by three U.N. panels on Iraq which
was set up according to a January 30 note of the Security Council.
The discussions should lead to political decisions on future arms
monitoring in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Council President Alain Dejammet of
France said the Council members expressed their gratitude to the
efforts the panels had made and the work they had done.
</P>
<P>
Dejammet said the Council had just begun its process of forming
new U.N. policy towards Iraq and the Council would continue this
process on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first panel, on disarmament concluded that not all Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled, notably in the
biological field.
</P>
<P>
The second panel, on humanitarian situation, called for the
loosening of the economic sanctions through a series of
recommendations aimed at pumping more money into the underfunded
humanitarian oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The third panel, on prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property, said
that Iraq had not fully complied with requirements.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Demands More Actions Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan parliament has adopted
the report of the select committee on agriculture, animal industry
and fisheries, demanding more actions against corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
The over-100-page long report, which prompted the recent major
cabinet reshuffle by President Yoweri Museveni, was adopted by the
House Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report, together with a number of resolutions, demands
action from the government.
</P>
<P>
One of the key resolutions demands that the government report
back to the House actions taken within three months.
</P>
<P>
The report, which took the committee 90 days to prepare and
three weeks to debate, also demands that all officers of the
Ministry of Agriculture who may have caused financial loss be
interdicted, investigated and dismissed from the civil service if
found guilty.
</P>
<P>
However, a motion seeking to extend the life of the select
committee to enable it investigate the remaining 55 projects in
the same ministry was defeated.
</P>
<P>
In the latest cabinet reshuffle, Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe was removed from the agricultural portfolio. Several
other ministers including Sam Kutesa, who got censured by the
parliament recently, were axed from the new cabinet list.
</P>
<P>
The reactions to the cabinet reshuffle were mixed. While some
commended the president for the bold move, others thought what he
had done is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
There is a loud outcry in the parliament for the officials
suspected of being corrupt, incompetent, to be suspended while
investigations against them are under way.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Flirt With New Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON April 7 (Xinhua) - European stock markets flirted with
new peaks Wednesday as the European Central Bank and the Bank of
England are expected to cut interest rate and a firm opening on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a lightning surge in bank stocks, which accounted for
90 percent of the point gain in the main index, the FTSE 100
advanced 57.9 points to 6473.2.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector as usual was at the forefront of the
rises. Abbey National was the biggest riser gaining 77p followed
by Halifax up 48.5p to 850p.
</P>
<P>
The telecoms sector, which had helped drive the rise, put in
another strong performance after Cable &AMP; Wireless Communication and
Telewest Communications confirmed they were in potential merger
talks.
</P>
<P>
Germany's blue-chip share index held onto most gains, although
dealers warned that thin volumes were exaggerating moves.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telekom was the most actively traded stock with gains
of more than 2 percent before it slipped back a little. The Xetra
Dax closed up 4.98 at 5027.25 points.
</P>
<P>
French retail stocks progressed on the day but the broader
market fell back from a similar advance as uncertainty clouded
hopes for a European rate cut and the Dow gave up some of its
early gains.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 closed up 0.3 percent at 4318.04 in a volume of
1.8bn euros, tracking back from its day-high of 4351.80, just
inches from 1999's peak of 4354.29, set on 1 February.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Government Presents Anti-Crisis Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The basis of the economic
development consists in a stable national currency, healthy
banking system to finance economic growth, a simpler and more
stable legislation to improve business environment, Romanian State
Minister Valeriu Stoica said on Wednesday, presenting the
anti-crisis Program of the government.
</P>
<P>
Romania was in a difficult moment, in an economic recession and
if it did not take action quickly it would run the risk of a deep
crisis, Stoica warned at President Emil Constantinescu's meeting
with leaders of parliamentary parties, representatives of the
civil society.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in Romania and in its political life that
the Government, the parliamentary majority, the parliamentary
opposition and three major segments of the civil society, namely
the labour unions, the business media organizations and the civic
organizations, meet together, noticed the media.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is a sign of political stability that could avoid
the crisis and allow a healthy economic growth," said Stoica, who
is concurrently minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
The anti-crisis Program presented under the title ''For a
healthy economic growth'' said there were big delays in the reform
process and a ''lot of overdue loan payments'' have been
accumulated since 1990. State sector is still considerable, the
gross domestic product decreased, exports came to a standstill,
the commercial deficit was big.
</P>
<P>
Referring to anti-crisis measures, Stoica said that they will
blend macro-stabilization policies with specific decisions foe
each sector: restructuring of state-run companies and national
utilities (power, gas, thermal energy, railways), relaunch of
farming, boosting export.
</P>
<P>
As for the banking sector, the main measures envisaged are
BANCOREX (Foreign Trade Bank) restructuring, reinvigorating the
Farming Bank and preparing it to go private, and starting sell-off
procedures in Romania's Commercial Bank, with all these to be
efficiently mediated by the newly established Agency for
Capitalization of Bank Assets.
</P>
<P>
Promoting new regulations on privatization procedures, to speed
up the process and firmly encourage domestic capital, accelerating
restructuring of industrial companies and public utilities,
boosting export are some other targets of the new government
program.
</P>
<P>
As for the farming, the main steps to be taken are granting
credits accessible to farmers and developing an efficient and
convenient equipment purchase system.
</P>
<P>
Romania's government is well-aware of the hardship suffered by
the populace as well as of the seriousness of the situation, the
end of the program presented by Stoica read.

<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A 61-year-old man from London on
Wednesday admitted to being the Mardi Gra bomber who attempted
blackmail against Barclays Bank and Sainsbury's supermarkets in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Pearce pleaded guilty at London's Old Bailey to 20
charges, including possessing firearms and explosives, wounding
and several blackmail attempts from December 1994 to April 1998,
when he was arrested. He will be sentenced at a later date.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 33 incidents in and around London since
the Mardi Gra bomber first struck in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
One person was seriously hurt by the devices planted by Pearce
in an attempt to extort money. Police at the time feared the
attacker was prepared to cause injury and death.
</P>
<P>
In the first attack, bombs were sent to six London branches of
Barclays Bank in video cassette boxes. Three people were injured
when some of the devices exploded.
</P>
<P>
Pearce was arrested after he visited a bank machine, in a
surveillance operation involving 1,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
The exact amount the bomber demanded has not been made public
but it was reported to be about 10 million pounds (16.6 million
U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Wednesday
threatened to bring nine Yugoslav commanders to the international
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"We are naming the commanders as a warning to them that the
world is watching, and that the war crimes tribunal is there and
we are going to assist them in this process," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it was up to the International War Crimes Tribunal
whether or not to indict anyone suspected of war crimes, but said
the United States would be providing the tribunal with detailed
information and names.
</P>
<P>
The United States has never mentioned the NATO bombing has
caused more than one thousand of civilian lives in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said there appeared no ceasefire in Kosovo after
Belgrade made the ceasefire offer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We... are not yet in a position to confirm that such a
ceasefire is in place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade on Tuesday declared a unilateral ceasefire in the
conflict with NATO that began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
But the alliance rejected it and said it would continue air
strikes until Yugoslavia complies with NATO demands, including
acceptance of Western troops' deployment in Kosovo, a Yugoslav
province.

UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday voiced
its support for the conclusions of the three U.N. panels on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Sergev Lavrov, Russia's Ambassador to
the United Nations, said "We do believe that we have to move to a

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Edges Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African business
mood improved slightly in March for the second month in a row,
helped by favorable financial environment both at home and abroad,
the South African Chamber of Business said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's monthly Business Confidence Index increased by
0,9 points to 84,5 in March from 83.6 in February.
</P>
<P>
The improvement, while still vulnerable, augured well for a
further cut in interest rates soon, said the chamber.
</P>
<P>
The positive developments in the economy were mainly in the
financial environment. Easier domestic monetary conditions and
relative stable international financial markets contributed to
these circumstances, it said.
</P>
<P>
Among positive factors signaling a possible economic upswing
later this year were lower inflation, the resumption of foreign
capital flows into bonds and equities, lower import and higher
export volumes, higher share prices and higher vehicle sales.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the free trade deal with the European Union
also helped business sentiment.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the gold price and South African currency rand
exchange rate declined slightly, and both manufacturing volumes
and retail sales fell.
</P>
<P>
The country was in desperate need of improved economic
performance and it was therefore absolutely imperative that the
growth potential of the economy should be enhanced by the
continuation of a prudent macro-economic policy and by addressing
the remaining structural deficiencies, said the chamber of
business.
</P>
<P>
Describing the immediate economic outlook as "subdued", the
chamber said that the election campaign, crime and violence, and
unforeseen developments on the international economic scene, as
well as the Balkans war and the dollar oil price, could all
influence business confidence in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
The domestic economy remained sluggish with high debt levels,
although the decline was slowing down, it said.
</P>
<P>
While it was too early to tell whether the latest increase in
business confidence represented a fundamental shift out of
negative territory, there were enough positive indications to
suggest that the economy was heading for the lower turning point
in the downward phase of the current business cycle, said the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
South Africa "could start to experience the benefits later in
the year for which the present more positive business mood is
paving the way," it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NIS, Yugoslavia, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 10 cruise missiles
and bombs fell on Nis early Wednesday during the fifth round of
NATO air strikes against this central Serbian city.
</P>
<P>
All missiles and bombs hit their targets but none of the
targets were military.
</P>
<P>
The hit targets were the Elektrotehna Shop, Fidelinka
Warehouse, Duvana Cigarette Factory, Subotica Pasta Factory and
Jastrebac Pump Factory.
</P>
<P>
Shock waves from the blasts also damaged adjacent civilian
buildings including residences, schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
The shop-keepers who went to work Wednesday morning only found
that their shop was completely destroyed. In the courtyard of the
shop was a huge bomb crater measuring 13 meters in diameter and 8
meters in depth.
</P>
<P>
Water from ruptured underground pipes filled more than half of
the crater while the clay from the crater was thrown and strewn
everywhere, even across the one-storey shop itself to cover the
surface of the roads 10 meters in front of the shop.
</P>
<P>
All glasses on the doors and windows of the shop were shattered
and the ceilings caved in and the tiles on the roof slid down to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
Covered by clay, dirt and shards of glasses were goods which
were supposed to be on display on the shelves but were now lying
on the floor inside the shop.
</P>
<P>
The goods included electric fans, washing machines, electronic
cookers, electrical motors, electricity wires, lamps, bulbs,
hair-driers, bolts and screws.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 meters away, one NATO bomb hit a warehouse of the
Duvana Cigarette Factory, where 1,000 tons of bundles of dried
tobacco leaves were still spewing smoke into the sky.
</P>
<P>
The entire roof collapsed onto piles of bundles of tobacco
leaves and broken steel reinforcement wires were distorted and
twisted.
</P>
<P>
Jovan Zlatic, director of the Nis Civil Defense Center, said
that the NATO attacks on Wednesday hit no other targets than
civilian buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Do NATO aggressors take everything for military targets?" he
asked.

<HEADLINE> Continued Peace Talks Key to Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday called on all
the parties concerned in the Middle East peace process to
implement existing agreements, honor the promises made and
continue the peace talks so as to break the current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, visiting Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) of China, stressed that China
has always been concerned with the situation in the Middle East
and the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is the desire of the peoples and countries
in the region to realize peace in the Middle East. A peaceful
Middle East is in the interests of all the countries in the
region and is conducive to world peace and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks during his talks with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad in Latakiya, a Mediterranean coastal city some 340
kilometers to the northwest of Damascus, the capital of Syria.
</P>
<P>
It was the strategic choice by the countries in the region to
try to solve the conflicts between Israel and the Arab nations
through peace talks, Li said, adding that despite the twists and
turns in the seven-year-long peace process, it was irreversible.
</P>
<P>
It is the key to breaking the current impasse in the peace
process to implement all the U.N. Security Council resolutions
regarding the Mideast issues, to carry out all the agreements
which the parties concerned had reached and uphold the principle
of "land for peace," the top Chinese legislator said.
</P>
<P>
Syria is an important party in the peace process. And without
the participation by Syria, there would not be peace in real
sense in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming China's stance to support the just cause of the
Arab nations to recover their lost land, Li said "No matter what
changes take place in the Middle East situation, this stance of
China will never change."
</P>
<P>
Assad reiterated Syria's position on the Middle East issues,
and highly appreciated China's efforts in seeking a just and fair
solution to the Middle East problems. He thanked China for
supporting the just cause of the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
On relations between China and Syria, Li Peng and Assad
agreed that it is necessary to increase exchanges between the
two countries in order to further promote a comprehensive
development of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that in recent years, there had been new
developments in the friendly cooperation between China and Syria.
China highly appreciates Syria's policies to actively foster its
ties with China and to adhere to the One-China stance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Assad said that the peoples of Syria and China had always
been standing shoulder to shoulder in the history of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there occurred many new and complicated matters in
the world arena, the Syrian president said that all the developing
countries should keep united in order to meet all kinds of
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that it was the basis of China's foreign
policy to strengthen the unity and cooperation with other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This unity and cooperation are of particular importance in
the current world situation which is characterized by the trends
of multi-polarization and economic globalization, the Chinese leader
said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here late Tuesday afternoon on a three-day
official visit. He is to leave Damascus for Islamabad, Pakistan,
on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer May Be More Than Just One Disease: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Different grades of breast tumor
may actually represent different types of breast tumor, British
scientists have suggested.
</P>
<P>
A study by scientists from UK's Imperial Cancer Research Fund
showed that breast tumors, which have generally been thought to
form a single category, may actually belong to different
sub-groups with different origins.
</P>
<P>
If the research is further confirmed, "the various tumor types
should offer different targets against which to develop new and
more specific drug treatments." the Imperial Cancer Research Fund
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Doctors usually grade breast tumors from I to III according to
the microscopic appearance of samples taken from suspicious lumps
with grade I the least aggressive.
</P>
<P>
However, new study by Dr Rebecca Roylance and colleagues
strongly suggested that what the grading system describes is not
the progress of a single tumor type, but existence of different
types.
</P>
<P>
"It was about ten years ago that people began to question the
meaning of these grades," said Dr Roylance, who works in Imperial
Cancer Research Fund's Human Cytogenetics and Breast Pathology
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
But Roylance said they found that if a primary tumor is treated
and then recurs, it tends to come back as the same grade.
</P>
<P>
After comparing the genetic make-up of 40 grade I tumors with
that of 50 grade IIIs, the researchers found that genetic changes
found on grade I tumors were not always found on grade III tumors,
which contradicted common predictions.
</P>
<P>
"It's unclear why some women get a grade I and others a grade
III tumor, but it's likely that there will be more than one
reason," Dr Roylance said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sees More Prolonged Crisis in Emerging Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Average growth rates in
developing and transition countries are likely to fall to just 1.5
percent in 1999, down from 1.9 percent in 1998, and 4.8 percent in
1997, making it the lowest growth rate since 1982, the World Bank
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled Global Development Finance 1999, the bank
blamed the slowing growth in emerging markets on declining trade
growth, slumping commodity prices, and tightened long-term
financing caused by the global financial crisis, which started in
East Asia nearly two years ago, spread to Russia, and sent shocks
to Brazil late last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, world trade growth slowed to 4.6 percent, compared
with 10 percent in 1997. Prices for primary commodity exports,
excluding oil, fell 16 percent. And net long-term finance dropped
by 58 billion U.S. dollars, while interest rate spreads for these
loans soared.
</P>
<P>
While the impact of these factors varies widely among
countries, their combined effect may have reduced overall demand
in developing countries by 3 to 4 percent in 1998 from 1997
levels, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, global output is forecast to slow
further in 1999, increasing by 1.8 percent, compared with a 1.9
percent increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Growth is expected to slow in Europe, while several large
developing countries, including China, India, and Mexico, are
expected to weather the difficult conjuncture relatively well, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several Latin American economies, countries of the
Former Soviet Union, and Middle Eastern and African oil exporters
are forecast to face stagnation or declines in output.
</P>
<P>
Thus, global growth rates are unlikely to return to historical
trends before 2001, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that flows to developing countries from
international capital markets plunged to 72 billion dollars in
1998 compared with 136 billion dollars in 1997, as investors in
bonds, portfolio equity, and long-term bank loans retreated from
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing
economies was more resilent, falling by less than 5 percent to 155
billion dollars in 1998 from the 1997 peak of 163 billion dollars.
Some of the East Asian crisis countries actually saw increases in
FDI despite severe recessions, as FDI was attracted by the
collapse in domestic asset prices, massive exchange rate
depreciation, and a more welcoming stance towards foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Although financing volumes, spreads and equity prices have
recovered somewhat in recent months, developing countries' access
to the international financial markets remains limited, the World
Bank said. But FDI is likely to remain the largest source of
finance to developing countries for the foreseeable future, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The report said concessional assistance to developing countries
remained at 33 billion dollars in 1998, or one-third below the
1990 level in real terms. Official development assistance from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries
has fallen to only 0.22 percent of their combined gross domestic
product (GDP), compared to 0.35 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The industrial countries had promised to contribute 0.7 percent
of their GDP as official development assistance to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite some positive development in 1998 -- notably the
progress in reducing the debt burden of the poorest, most heavily
indebted countries -- the prospects for aid remain bleak, said the
bank.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Much Needs to be Done in Forging New Policy  Towards Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The conclusion of the
assessment on Iraq was perhaps a small step, if not a big one,
towards forging a new U.N. policy on the country, U.N. said here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Celso Amorim, the chairman of the three
panels on Iraq established according to a January 30 note by the
United Nations Security Council, said there was still a long way
to go before the Council members could reach consensus on its
policy towards Iraq due to differences among them.
</P>
<P>
Amorim said his panels could only provide technical replies to
Iraqi issue and it was up to the Security Council to make
political decisions.
</P>
<P>
Amorim briefed the Council this morning on the conclusions of
his reports on Iraq which had been submitted to the Council last
week. Recommendations in the reports will be the basis for the
Council to form its new policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The first panel, on disarmament and current and future ongoing
monitoring and verification issues, recommended that intrusive
inspections under a monitoring program be needed to resume in
Iraq. It also called for a renovated or restructured U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM), now responsible for dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The second panel, on humanitarian situation, recommended
improvement and some alterations to the U.N. humanitarian
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to
provide humanitarian aid for its people. It also suggested the
Council consider authorizing foreign investment to improve Iraq's
export abilities.
</P>
<P>
The third panel, on prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property,
concluded that Iraq had not provided sufficient explanations about
missing Kuwaitis or cooperated enough in returning looted
property.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. officials, the proposals had been rejected
by Iraq for several reasons. Iraq has reiterated that lifting
sanctions is the precondition for it to resume cooperation with
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Council has been sharply divided on Iraq issue since the
U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq last December.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate: Dialogue Helps to Narrow Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has all
along maintained that different opinions on human rights should be
solved through dialogue and exchanges on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, said a Chinese delegate here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This has been proven the most effective way," said Ambassador
Qiao Zonghui, head of the Chinese delegation, at a meeting of the
ongoing 55th session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has noted with appreciation that the
European Union (EU) has decided, for the second time, not to
sponsor a China resolution at the current commission session, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensible move not only for the China-EU human rights
dialogue but also for defusing the confrontation in the
commission," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiao said, the United States government announced on
March 26 that it would sponsor an anti-China resolution by itself
due to the so-called "sharp deterioration of China's human rights
record".
</P>
<P>
"The United States has unleashed attacks on China for trying
several criminals," he said. "And what I would like to make clear
is that these persons were arrested and tried for having engaged
in the activities subverting the state power and endangering state
security, which had nothing to do with their exercise of the
freedom of expression and association."
</P>
<P>
he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, Qiao told the session, the exercise of rights is
not unlimited.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, it is subject to due limitations in the interests of
state security, public safety, public order and the rights and
freedoms of others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao predicted that the U.S.-sponsored anti-China resolution
will be doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the anti-China resolution was defeated for seven
times demonstrates that confrontation leads to nowhere," he said.

Sahaf said the two countries aimed to interrupt the pumping of
oil and hamper the application of the memorandum of understanding

<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Making a telephone call while
typing on a computer, a condition known as "phone neck", can
damage people's health, British scientists have found.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Surrey University, England, found that half of
all office workers investigated who use phone and computer
simultaneously for at least two hours a day suffer from neck pain.
</P>
<P>
The study, first of its kind in the UK, showed that almost a
third also have lower back pain and two thirds frequently or
sometimes experience headaches.
</P>
<P>
"Phone neck", caused by the phone being clasped between neck
and shoulder to free both hands for typing or taking notes, can
lead to degeneration of joints, inflammation of tendons, painful
muscle stiffening and disc trouble, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
It "increases the risk of nerve compression in the neck and
shoulder area, which could lead to problems in the spine, arm and
hands," said Elizabeth Simpson, a physiotherapist who led the
research.

CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's foreign currency reserves dropped 182
million U.S. dollars in March to 21.98 billion dollars, according
to statistics released by the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since last November that Israel's
"mountain of dollars" has dipped below 22 billion dollars. At its
peak last December, the stash of dollars hit 22.67 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon has decided to shut down two largest citrus
packing factories because of strong foreign competition, the high
cost of production and lack of government support, the Daily Star
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zaatari and Safa factories, both located in the Ghazieh
area south of the country's southern port city of Sidon, have
temporarily ceased operations after a sharp drop in sales of
citrus and other fruits to Arab Gulf states and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We were unable to maintain production after realizing that
our clients in the Gulf were buying agricultural products from
Egypt and Turkey almost 50 percent cheaper than from Lebanon,"
said Mohammed Zaatari, owner of the Zaatari plant and President
of the Sidon Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's three major cellular phone companies
spent 22 million U.S. dollars during the first quarter of this
year on advertising and promotions.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed Partner company spent 8.3 million dollars,
excluding its massive billboard campaign expenditures during its
initial penetration period. As a result, Partner attracted 100,000
clients during this period.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz
Monday met with Chief Executive of the U.S. Marathon Oil Company
Victor Beghini to tap the potential of joint investment in the
Gulf kingdom's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Beghini presented Abdullah his company's investment plans in
Saudi Arabia's petroleum and gas sectors, the Saudi Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, is reluctant
to allow foreign participation in its oil and gas exploration and
production because it currently enjoys a surplus output capacity
of over 2 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's net foreign debt at the end of 1998 was
13.7 billion U.S. dollars, down 13 percent from that of 1997, the
Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The net foreign debt to gross domestic product ratio was 15
percent at the end of 1998, and that at the beginning of 1990 was
31 percent.

<HEADLINE> Romania Cautious About Evaluating Belgrade's Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Romania appreciates in principle
"any credible step" meant to lead to a political solution to the
Kosovo conflict, Romania's Foreign Ministry stressed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokewoman with the ministry Simona Miculescu made the remark
to the press when referring to the decision of Belgrade
authorities to cease unilaterally the military actions in Kosovo
during Easter Holidays.
</P>
<P>
"Given the special complexity of the situation on the scene -
the information we have show a wide depopulation of the ethnic
Albanian segment in Kosovo - along with the political context
against which the announcement was made, we need to be cautious
about evaluating it", the spokewoman added.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, a lasting solution to the conflict involves the
fulfillment of all the conditions the international community
imposed clearly", Simona Miculescu concluded.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientist Uses Bath Water to Power TV Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A British professor has succeeded
in developing a system that uses electricity generated from hot
bath water to power his TV set, The Independent newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The system built by Professor Mike Rowe, of Cardiff University,
can generate up to 100 watts using the temperature difference
between a bath full of used hot water and another cold water
supply.
</P>
<P>
The electricity is enough to run a color TV, which needs only 80
watt, for about two hours.
</P>
<P>
Professor Rowe's generator uses devices called thermocouple,
which has a circuit made from two wires of different materials
welded to each other at each end.
</P>
<P>
If the two junctions are kept at different temperatures a
current will flow within them.
</P>
<P>
Typical thermocouple uses metals, but Professor Rowe has found
that usable voltages can also be generated by semiconductors such
as germanium and silicon.
</P>
<P>
Professor said his system can be applied on an industrial scale
to provide large amounts of electricity at low cost as all the
system needs to work is a temperature difference.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial applications are potentially huge", The
Indipendent newspaper said, "and could save millions of pounds by
using hot water discharged form the steel, glass, ceramics and
electricity generating industries."

<HEADLINE> NATO Has No Time to Pause Air Strikes, Cohen Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen told reporters here Wednesday evening that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has no time to pause air
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks at a special news briefing in
Brussels-based NATO headquarters. During the day he met with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, U.S. general Wesley Clark, NATO's
supreme commander in Europe, and 19 NATO ambassadors in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He said he and the NATO leaders talked about the latest
development in Kosovo and evaluated how to take further steps and
how long the air strikes would last. The NATO was determined to
continue its air campaign, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if sending ground troops is one of the final choices,
Cohen said there is no plan to send ground troops in current
stage. "Both United States and NATO believe air strikes must
continue," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary also said the objective of the military
operation remains degrading and disrupting the capability of
Yugoslav and Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said earlier that Cohen will also, in
the evening, meet with British Secretary of Defense George
Robertson, who came here on route to Germany, Solana and NATO
ambassadors to discuss Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to Pentagon spokesmen Ken Bacon, Cohen may on
Thursday visit Italy where he will meet members of the U.S. air
forces based at Aviano, which have carried out many of the air
attacks on Yugoslav forces in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
During his short trip in Europe, Cohen may also stop off at
Ramstein Air Base in Germany on his way home before weekend to
look at humanitarian operations being run from there to help
hundreds of thousandeds of ethnic Albanian refugees who have fled
into Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Cohen left Washington Monday for his European tour with a
number of Republican and Democrat Congressmen.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Demands Yugoslavia to Meet NATO Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
rejecting a ceasefire offer from Belgrade, insisted on Wednesday
that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should comply with all
the demands set by NATO before a peace could be considered.
</P>
<P>
In a foreign policy speech, Clinton said Milosevic's offer of a
ceasefire was "not enough" to end NATO's air campaign against
Yugoslavia as it did not meet all the NATO's commands.
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough now for Mr. Milosevic to say that his forces
will cease fire in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He must withdraw his forces, let the refugees return, permit
the deployment of an international security force," he added.
"nothing less will bring peace with security to the People of
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they believe that recent overtures by
Yugoslavia, including the ceasefire offer, were designed to weaken
NATO resolve to use military force against Belgrade, which is
determined to protect its sovereign territory of Kosovo from being
invaded by the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
White House officials were reacting cautiously to apparent
moves that may lead to the release of three U.S. army soldiers
captured by the Serb forces last week.
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said he
could not confirm the soldiers would be freed. Washington has
called for the release of these soldiers since their capture last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would welcome the release of the three American
soldiers. I can't confirm that that will take place," Berger
told NBC's "Today" program.

<HEADLINE> Most Iraqi Contracts on Hold: Iraq Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Only 40 percent of the contracts
Iraq signed with foreign companies in the current phase of the
oil-for-food deal were approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee,
an Iraqi official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh also
said that the six-month fifth phase will expire on May 25, but
many contracts for electricity, water, sanitation and education
sectors have yet to be approved, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies will not be
allowed to be implemented until they are approved by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said Iraq has in its credit 250 million U.S. dollars,
enough to cover the contracts of the current phase, but the
U.S. and British representatives at the U.N. Sanctions Committee
are still creating "pretexts and lies" to impede the approval of
the deals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., which imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, allows Iraq to export limited amount of oil
every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
To increase Iraq's oil production and export capacity, the
U.N., since the fourth stage, has allowed Iraq to import 300
million dollars of spare parts badly needed in the country's
dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Saleh stressed that many contracts Iraq concluded in the fourth
phase are still on hold.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British representative at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee, or 661 committee, of blocking the
approval of the contracts it signed with foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Seeks U.N. Intervention in Israeli Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese leaders on Wednesday
called on the United Nations to intervene to help Lebanese
residents expelled by Israeli forces return to their homes in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Nabih Berri sent a telegram to the U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan, asking him to step in and get those deportees
back to their homes, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli forces expelled 25 Lebanese residents,
mostly elderly, children and women, from their village of Shebaa
in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion came in response to Monday's desertion of four
militiamen of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
All of the deportees are relatives of the four defectors who
reportedly sneaked out of Shebaa through the hills at dawn and
turned themselves in to the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss instructed Lebanon's representatives
in the U.N. to distribute among the U.N. member states a document
concerning Israeli "barbaric" practices against Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he asked authorities concerned to set up camps for
the deportees on the border between the Israeli occupied enclave
and the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
There are currently nearly 2,500 SLA members, who are helping
Israeli forces to patrol its occupied zone and handling the
security affairs in Jezzine, a predominantly Christian town facing
the enclave.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were considered as traitors in Lebanon and its
commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by
a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting speculation that Israeli forces may conduct a
unilateral partial withdrawal from south Lebanon, the SLA's morale
is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government to escape future reprisals.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to "protect" its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Shiite
Muslim group Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to oust
Israeli forces and their allied militia.

<HEADLINE> 9 Millions of Ethiopian Kids Vaccinated Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Health announced Wednesday that over nine million children were
vaccinated against polio in two rounds of immunization campaign
conducted across the nation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hiwot Mengistu, an official from the ministry said at a meeting
in Nazareth, some 90 kilometers southeast of capital Addis Ababa,
that nearly 100 percent performance was registered in the Amhara,
Oromiya, Southern People' s and Harari states.
</P>
<P>
However, in the Somali state, the performance is less than 50
percent, the Ethiopian News Agency quoted Hiwot as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry announced last year that 9,092,852 children under
the age of five years across this African country would be
vaccinated against polio in two rounds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is among the nine countries where some children are
still becoming paralyzed every year due to the wide spread of the
polio virus.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has plans to eradicate the polio by the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
This year's immunization program will center on areas where
polio immunization coverage is low, according to the meeting held
in Nazareth.

<HEADLINE> Annan Has No Intention to Jump into Kosovo Crisis, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- As NATO is mounting air
strikes on Yugoslavia, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Anna "has no
intention of jumping into a (Kosovo) crisis, where he doesn't have
useful role to play," a U.N. spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a press question, Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman,
said the six-nation Contact Group, which is in charge of the
Balkan diplomacy, "is taking a lead" in addressing the crisis of
Kosovo, a Serbian province in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, there's a war going on," he said, "he (Annan) would
like to hold himself in reserve if at any time there appears to be
a useful role for him to play."
</P>
<P>
"Right now, he concentrating on the humanitarian side," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the U.N. spokesman echoed a Monday statement
by Annan, who said that the present role of the United Nations is
to render massive relief operations, and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees is leading the operation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The world media, including the U.S. newspapers, carried stories
that said the 185-member world body has been sidelined by the
U.S.-led NATO, which began unilateral air attacks on Yugoslavia on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Annan is visiting Geneva, where he delivered
speeches at the meeting of the Chairman/Coordinators of the Group
of 77 Chapters and the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the United Nations is not involved at all on
the military side. But one cannot tell what happens tomorrow, as
one searches for a long-term solution," Annan told a press
conference Wednesday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"What we need at the moment is to focus on the refugees, get
them to shelter, protect their rights, and take steps to ensure
that they will be able to go back home in safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
A large exodus of refugees followed massive NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family.

<HEADLINE> Simple Kitchen Appliance May Help Fight Food-Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Cooks may soon be able to test
their ingredients for food-poisoning bacteria using a simple
kitchen appliance, Britain's New Scientist magazine reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An experimental system developed by the Japanese company
Matsushita Electric, can now detect and measure the population of
pathogenic bacteria in a food sample in around 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has successfully detected Salmonella strains and
Escherichia coli O157, but the researchers hope soon to modify the
test to also identify strains of Staphylococcus bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita believes that within two or three years it can build
an appliance small and cheap enough to use in a kitchen or
restaurant, allowing suspect food to be checked before serving.
</P>
<P>
According to Matsushita, the test requires no special skill and
is "as easy to do as a pregnancy test", simply requiring a
solution of the food to be poured into a tank.
</P>
<P>
The target size for the bug-detecting kitchen gadget, which
will cost 1000 U.S. dollars, was to be about as big as "three
blenders in a row", a Matsushita spokesman was quoted by New
Scientist as saying.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks U.N. Compensation for Spread of Animal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded that the
U.N. compensate its citizens for their losses resulting from the
spread of diseases among livestock and poultry which led to the
shortage of red meat and dairies.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Agriculture Minister Abdil-Ilah Hamid said that during
the 1970s Iraq installed a strategic vaccination project capable
of producing 12 million doses annually for preventing animal
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Work in this regard was suspended due to the 1991 Gulf War and
most of the production, diagnosis, and operation equipment were
destroyed in 1996 by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said
Hameed, quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wrote to the U.N. to obtain approval to use some of the
said equipment in examining vaccine samples, said the minister,
complaining that the U.N. approval came incomplete and late, which
led to the spread of animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
Hameed asked the U.N. to send experts to estimate the degree of
damage in the vaccination project.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi media have reported that more than 1 million heads of
cattle and sheep have died of various animal diseases so far this
year.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Daily Chief Terms Ban as Political Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Faezeh Hashemi, Managing Director
of the closed Iranian daily Zan Wednesday termed the ban on her
daily as a "political move" by the conservatives against the
moderates, main supporters of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Hashemi said the order by the
revolutionary court to close down her daily was "illegal," adding
that the case of her daily should be investigated by the Ministry
of Culture and Islamic Guidance or the press court, not the
revolutionary court.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian revolutionary court Wednesday ordered to close
down the moderate Persian-language daily Zan (Women) until further
notice for publishing a letter of Farah Diba, the ousted Iranian
queen, on April 3 and a caricature on April 6 making fun of
"blood money."
</P>
<P>
Head of the Tehran revolutionary court Gholamhussein Rahbarpour
said that the mere publication of Farah's message on new Iranian
year started on March 21 was a "blatant anti-revolutionary act"
and publicity for the "vicious" (monarchical) regime.
</P>
<P>
However, Hashemi, daughter of former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, argued that publishing part of Farah's message without
any comment did not mean that her daily confirmed the message or
propagated for Farah or the former Iranian Shah regime.
</P>
<P>
She also rejected charge that her daily published a caricature
to ridicule blood money, money paid by murderers to the family of
a victim as compensation.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the daily Zan can be seen as part of the campaigns
by the right-ring factions for the sixth Majlis election to be
held early next year, Hashemi said.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers noted that the ban on the daily Zan
indicated the start of a new round political quarrel between the
powerful conservatives, who still dominate most of the
country's state organs, and the moderates.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges G7 to Review Belgrade's Truce Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
made an urgent appeal to top leaders of the Group of Seven
Wednesday not to reject the unilateral truce announced by Belgrade
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called for handover of the rights to solve the Kosovo
issue from the hands of military-men to diplomats, in a letter
addressed to top leaders of the United States, France, Germany,
Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He asked them to review the gesture without preconceived idea
and with a constructive view and make appropriate response later.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia announced Tuesday that it would cease its military
action against the Kosovo Liberation Army and conduct direct
dialogue with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. This
proposal does not bear any pre-conditions, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The tragic situation in Yugoslavia is getting more and more
serious and dangerous and the refugee problem has turned out to be
a disaster, Yeltsin told the leaders.
</P>
<P>
He called for most urgent measures to halt the deterioration of
the situation and bring it back to the political track. Russia is
making efforts so far as it could to achieve this, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the Group of Eight -- G7 plus Russia --
are scheduled to meet in Germany on Thursday following a meeting
of Contact Group officials on Wednesday. The Contact Group on
Yugoslavia is composed of Russia and five NATO members -- Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and Vice President of Yemen Abdurabu Mansour Hadi expressed
their mutual desire here Wednesday to enlarge and deepen economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and Hadi, who arrived here Tuesday on a two-day visit to
Pakistan, held wide-ranging discussions on issues of common
interest including aspects of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders hoped that the upcoming meeting of
Pakistan-Yemen Joint Ministerial Commission in May would provide a
fresh opportunity to focus on measures to expand trade and other
forms of economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also emphasized the need to activate the private sector
for taking up the vast potential in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two leaders exchanged views on the regional and
international situation with particular reference to the South
Asian scenario and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, in this context, explained to the Yemeni leader the
efforts made by Pakistan with regard to the resumption of
Pakistan-India dialogue for the resolution of all outstanding
issues including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Hadi reiterated his country's understanding and support for
Pakistan's endeavors in this regard.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the Middle East situation, the two leaders
shared dismay at the impasse owing to the Israeli intransigence
and hoped that the international community will exercise vigilance
and make concerted action in order to push the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
Hadi paid a courtesy call on President Rafiq Tarar. The call
was followed by a luncheon hosted by the president in honor of the

<HEADLINE> Killers of S. Africa's Chris Hani Denied Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The two convicted killers of
South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani were denied
amnesty by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The TRC's amnesty committee said in a statement that Janusz
Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis have failed to make a full disclosure
of the 1993 assassination.
</P>
<P>
They also failed to sufficiently prove political motivation for
the murder.
</P>
<P>
"It is common cause that the applicants were not acting on
their express authority or orders from the Conservative Party (CP)
which they purport to represent in assassinating Mr. Hani.
</P>
<P>
"The CP has never adopted, propagated or espoused a policy of
violence or assassination of political opponents," the committee
said.
</P>
<P>
Derby-Lewis was formerly a member of parliament for the CP.
</P>
<P>
The committee also rejected Walus' claim that he had acted on
Derby- Lewis' orders.
</P>
<P>
Walus, with Derby-Lewis' help, shot and killed Hani in the
driveway of his home in Boksburg near Johannesburg, on April 10,
1993.
</P>
<P>
The South African Communist Party (SACP) immediately welcomed
the TRC decision.
</P>
<P>
SACP Deputy General Secretary Jeremy Cronin said the two men
have been evasive and often arrogant, and that the party is
convinced they have failed to meet any of the criteria for
amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Cronin said both men had been sentenced to death when they were
 convicted of Hani's murder. They could count themselves extremely
lucky that they are living under an African National Congress
government which has abolished the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng's Visit to Further Fortify Sino-Pak Ties: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit to
Pakistan by senior Chinese leader Li Peng will further fortify the
existing friendly and cooperative ties between Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here Wednesday by Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro, speaker
of the National Assembly, during an exclusive interview with
Xinhua on the eve of Li Peng's visit to this South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) of China, will make a five-day official,
goodwill visit to Pakistan at the invitation of Soomro.
</P>
<P>
Soomro said that the exchanges of high-level visits between
Pakistan and China have been very frequent. They are important and
necessary in the changing world, and especially conducive to the
further strengthening of the relations between Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
"Each exchange of high-level visit brings our relations
closer," said the speaker, adding that Li Peng's forthcoming visit
to Pakistan will further cement the existing friendly and
cooperative relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Soomro said Li Peng is an old friend of Pakistan as he visited
Pakistan 10 years ago in his capacity of Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
"Li Peng is an experienced and knowledgeable leader of a great
country which is a valued friend of Pakistan. I am eagerly looking
forward to his visit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soomro noted that Pakistan and China have different social
systems, yet the friendship between the two countries has become a
model in the international community.
</P>
<P>
He is of the view that the contact and cooperation between
Pakistan's National Assembly and NPC of China will be further
increased in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
Soomro spoke highly of China's reform and opening policy
initiated by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The speaker said
he first visited China in the late 60s, and since then he has
toured the neighbor at least six times.
</P>
<P>
"I witnessed the major developments which have taken place in
China during the last two decades," he said, adding that the
Chinese leadership has adopted correct policies in accordance with
China's specific conditions for building the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China now enjoys political stability and economic
development thanks to the foresight and sagacity of the Chinese
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government and people are very happy to see a
strong and prosperous China emerging, the speaker added.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in agriculture, industry
as well as in science and technological field, and is playing an
increasingly important role in the international community for
peace and stability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and China share a lot of commonalities, and always
help and support each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that Li Peng's visit will push the
Pakistan-China all-round partnership of cooperation towards the
21st century to a new high.

The LIFFE announced Wednesday that total outstanding business
in all the Euro money market contracts at the end of the month
exceeded 2000 billion euros.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE's share of the Euribor market has increased to 87
percent. LIFFE's Three Month Euribor contracts have continued to
show growth, with open interest at over 1300 billion euros on 31
March.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume in the Euribor futures contract for March

</P>
<P>
Brian Williamson, LIFFE's Chairman, said:"It is encouraging to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate: Dialogue Helps to Narrow Differenc es  on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has all
along maintained that different opinions on human rights should be
solved through dialogue and exchanges on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, said a Chinese delegate here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This has been proven the most effective way," said Ambassador
Qiao Zonghui, head of the Chinese delegation, at a meeting of the
ongoing 55th session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has noted with appreciation that the
European Union (EU) has decided, for the second time, not to
sponsor a China resolution at the current commission session, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensible move not only for the China-EU human rights
dialogue but also for defusing the confrontation in the
commission," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Qiao said, the United States government announced on
March 26 that it would sponsor an anti-China resolution by itself
due to the so-called "sharp deterioration of China's human rights
record".
</P>
<P>
"The United States has unleashed attacks on China for trying
several criminals," he said. "And what I would like to make clear
is that these persons were arrested and tried for having engaged
in the activities subverting the state power and endangering state
security, which had nothing to do with their exercise of the
freedom of expression and association."
</P>
<P>
"It is a common practice of all countries including the United
States to punish criminals who have endangered state security," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, Qiao told the session, the exercise of rights is
not unlimited.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, it is subject to due limitations in the interests of
state security, public safety, public order and the rights and
freedoms of others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao predicted that the U.S.-sponsored anti-China resolution
will be doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the anti-China resolution was defeated for seven
times demonstrates that confrontation leads to nowhere," he said.

<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Making a telephone call while
typing on a computer, a condition known as "phone neck", can
damage people's health, British scientists have found.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Surrey University, England, found that half of
all office workers investigated who use phone and computer
simultaneously for at least two hours a day suffer from neck pain.
</P>
<P>
The study, first of its kind in the UK, showed that almost a
third also have lower back pain and two thirds frequently or
sometimes experience headaches.
</P>
<P>
"Phone neck", caused by the phone being clasped between neck
and shoulder to free both hands for typing or taking notes, can
lead to degeneration of joints, inflammation of tendons, painful
muscle stiffening and disc trouble, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
It "increases the risk of nerve compression in the neck and
shoulder area, which could lead to problems in the spine, arm and
hands," said Elizabeth Simpson, a physiotherapist who led the
research.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The road condition in Kaputa area,
Northern Province of Zambia, remains the most pressing concern for
the agencies involved in the refugee relief effort, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report released by UNHCR Emergency Response Team in Kaputa
said a culvert bridge near Mununga along the Nchelenge Kaputa road
was partially washed away due to rising water levels and caused
delays in delivering a consignment of 54 tons of maize meal to
Kaputa.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR advised that incidents of refugees looting
agricultural fields in Kaputa as a result of delayed food
distributions have been isolated and should not be dramatized
since tensions between local residents and the refugees have been
minimal.
</P>
<P>
"We should not forget that more than 6,000 Congolese refugees
are still accommodated in the surrounding villages by family
members and this is a true example of Zambian generosity," said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees in Kaputa town had risen to 17,467 by
Tuesday, it said. In addition, another 6,000 Congolese refugees
are estimated to reside in surrounding villages. The influx of
refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues at
a rate of about 200 new arrivals entering Zambia every day, it
added.

scenario, time-tested Sino-Pakistan relationship, based on
complete trust and understanding, has remained strong, vibrant and
important as ever to both sides, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid described Li Peng as "the old friend of Pakistan", as
he visited this South Asian nation 10 years ago in his capacity of
Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government, he said, attaches great importance to
the forthcoming visit by Li Peng. The visit will be an event of
great importance in the development of Pak-China bilateral
relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Lu
Shulin said that Li Peng's visit is "an important event" in
Sino-Pak relations, and it is especially important as the visit is
being made at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy termed the Sino-Pak relations as "profound,
time-tested, and all-weathered".
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that Li Peng's visit will further
strengthen the all-round partnership of cooperation between China
and Pakistan towards the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Minister Projects Four Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sounding optimism about the
future of the country's economy, Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq
Dar Wednesday projected the economic growth rate at around four
percent for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that during the year 1998-99 "we will be
able to achieve a growth rate of around four percent with
inflation being contained below 7 percent and budgetary deficit
close to the budget estimates of 4.6 percent of Gross Domestic
Products (GDP)."
</P>
<P>
Dar was addressing a meeting here attended by the envoys of the
Pakistan Development Forum (PDF) member countries and heads of
international organizations and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The PDF, previously known as Aid to Pakistan Consortium, is
scheduled to meet in Paris on April 22-23.
</P>
<P>
The minister's briefing was followed by a two-hour-long open
discussion on the present and future outlook of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Dar said he hopes that as a result of the efforts made by the
government, by the end of the current year or June, the economic
situation in his country will stabilize.
</P>
<P>
He also foresaw a GDP growth of 5.3 percent for the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
"This (growth rate) will be contributed mainly by agriculture
with 5.5 percent growth and manufacturing with 6.5 percent
growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
After resuming power by the Nawaz Sharif government in 1997,
the country managed to reverse the bad trend of economic
development in one year, said Dar.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the GDP grew by a mere 1.3 percent
in 1996-97 with a double-digit inflation rate, but a growth rate
of 5.4 percent was registered in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
In this background, he said, the fiscal year 1998-99 was
envisaged as a year of further consolidation of the gains achieved
during 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
But the sanctions Western countries imposed following the
nuclear tests last May and the worsening international economic
environment due to contagious financial crises around the world
posed serious difficulties to Pakistan's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has pursued prudent and effective
policies to meet the new challenges, which has brought fairly good
results, according to Dar.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The situation has stabilized, economic growth is
reviving and business confidence restored. Positive signs are
visible all around."
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted that difficulties on the economic
front are bound to have serious social consequences. "Despite low
inflation rate, increase in prices of some essential items has hit
the common man badly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is fully aware of these problems and have taken
a number of remedial measures in this regard, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Public Called On to Care for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Deputy Speaker of
the House of People's Representatives, Petros Olango Wednesday
called upon the public to step up efforts geared toward
alleviating the social problems facing elder persons.
</P>
<P>
The deputy speaker made the call at a special festival held
here to observe this year's World Health Day which is being
celebrated Wednesday throughout the world under the theme of
"Active aging makes the difference."
</P>
<P>
Petros said that efforts deployed so far by the international
as well as local aid organizations and associations in support of
the Ethiopian elderly are minimal.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the federal constitution of the Horn of Africa
country ensures the rights of the elderly to have access to social
services and proper care, and urged the populace to respect and
care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the festival, which was jointly organized by the
World Health Organization and the Ethiopian Ministry of Health,
Yohannes Tadesse, head of the health service and training
department of the ministry, said that of the 580 million senior
people across the world, 355 million are living in the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's World Health Day theme inspires the elderly
to involve themselves more in socio-economic and political
activities.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China, will make a five-day official, goodwill visit to Pakistan
on April 8-12.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, who is coming here at the invitation of Ellahi Bukhsh
Soomro, speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly, is the most
senior Chinese leader to visit this South Asian nation since
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit here at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's visit forms an important part of the high-level
exchanges which are the hallmark of the time-tested friendship
between the two friendly neighbors, a press release by the
National Assembly said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Pakistan and China attach great significance to
such close consultations which offer the two sides opportunities
to deepen mutual understanding and share perception on issues of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan and China enjoy an exemplary relationship. The
long-standing ties of friendship between the two countries are
underpinned by mutual trust and confidence," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan considers its relationship with China of great
significance constituting the cornerstone of its foreign policy,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Li Peng will call on President Rafiq Tarar
and hold substantive talks with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and
discuss mutual cooperation with Soomro and Chairman of the Senate
Wasim Sajjad.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Sharif will focus on all aspects of bilateral
relations and areas of interest to both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader will also deliver a keynote address on
Chinese priorities in the current global and regional strategic
scenario.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz will also call on Li Peng and
exchange views with him on important international, regional and
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng will be decorated with Nishan-e-Pakistan, an award in
recognition of the great contribution made by him to the cause of
promoting understanding, friendship and cooperation between the
two fraternal countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides the capital city of Islamabad, Li Peng will also visit
Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.

<HEADLINE> Number of Old People to Increase: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of old people in
developing countries is expected to increase by between 200 and
400 percent by the year 2025, an official of the World Health
Organization (WHO) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is pertinent to note that the most rapid changes in
population structure are taking place in developing countries
where the population of elderly people are predicted to increase
by between 200 and 400 percent by the year 2025," WHO regional
director Ebrahim Samba said in a statement to mark World Health
Day which falls on today.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of Africans aged 60 years or more would have
 increased to about 10.2 million in 2025, more than four times
what it was in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The extended family system, which used to act as a traditional
welfare system, had begun to disintegrate as a result of
modernization and urbanization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Elderly people no longer receive the kind of care and attention
they used to enjoy under the extended family system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Samba said this was a major social problem which African
communities must resolve.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary for countries to conduct surveys and
develop data on the subject for planning purposes and to draw up
national plans for the welfare of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"The countries also need to put in place or expand
community-based programs for their elderly citizens and give
special attention to their health care needs," Samba said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges $9M to Tanzania for Post-bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
has pledged to provide 9.23 million U.S. dollars to assist
Tanzania to recover from the tragic bombing at the U.S. Embassy in
Dar es Salaam last August.
</P>
<P>
An agreement for the grant was signed in the Tanzanian capital
Wednesday between U.S. Ambassador Charles Stith and Tanzanian
Minister of Finance Daniel Yona.
</P>
<P>
Out of the grant, four million dollars have been in place while
the rest is still in the pipeline, said Stith.
</P>
<P>
The grant, channelled through the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), will provide direct assistance
to the bombing victims, assist in rehabilitating damaged
infrastructure facilities and enhance Tanzania's capacity in
disaster preparedness, said the U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist bombing at the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam on
August 7, 1998 left seven people dead and more than 70 others
injured.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the U.S. government provided Tanzania
with medicine and medical equipment worth 90,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, the Tanzanian financial
minister said that eight months after the bomb blast, memories of
the shocking incident are still fresh in Tanzanian people's minds.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tanzanian government wishes to reaffirm its total
commitment to eradicating international terrorism wherever it will
manifest its ugly head.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reassures the U.S. ambassador that Tanzania
is committed to maintaining and promoting bilateral relations with
the U.S. and to developing strong economic and commercial ties
with it.
</P>
<P>
Stith said although terrorists succeeded in killing and
wounding innocent people, they did not succeed in their goal of
estranging the two nations and in fact the bilateral ties between
the two countries have never been stronger.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's newly appointed Vice
President George Saitoti told the National Assembly Wednesday that
he would seek a partnership across parties and not confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"I will not for a single moment promote confrontation, but will
seek goodwill and partnership across the House and in all
parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president, who was reappointed to the same post last

parliament, including those of other political parties, for any
consultations that would enhance parliamentary proceedings.

"The Third Session (current session of parliament) puts
legislators on the threshold of the century and they should go
down to cultivate friendship rather than confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said as the leader of government business in the
parliament, he was ready to meet with opposition leaders to break
the constitutional review impasse.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president pledged that the government would ensure all

poverty alleviation plan.
</P>
<P>
On security, he said government would ensure there was border
surveillance and increased financial allocation to security arms.

<HEADLINE> Libraries in Ecuador, Micronesia, Gambia Designated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Three libraries, located in
Ecuador, Micronesia and Gambia, have been designated United
Nations depository libraries, and territories which bring United
Nations documents and publications to users around the world, U.N.
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They are the Universidad San Francisco de Quito Library,
Ecuador, the Learning Resources Center of the College of
Micronesia in Palikir, the new capital of the Federated States of
Micronesia, and the Gambia National Library in Banjul, capital of
Gambia.
</P>
<P>
The Universidad San Francisco de Quito Library, set up in 1988,
is the second United Nations depository library to be designated
in Ecuador. It serves a faculty of 500 professors, as well as a
body of 2,200 students, and is also open to the general public,
logging an average of 32,500 users per month.
</P>
<P>
The library maintains a collection of more than 70,000 volumes
of books and 6,000 audiovisual items and subscribes up to 580
periodicals.
</P>
<P>
The Learning Resources Center is the largest library in the
Federated States of Micronesia and the first United Nations
depository library designated in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Center serves the faculty and students of the College of
Micronesia, the only collegiate level institution in the country.
Its collections comprise more than 30,000 volumes of books, 230
periodical subscriptions and approximately 700 videotapes and
420 16mm films.
</P>
<P>
The Gambia National Library was established by the British
Colonial Office in 1946. In 1962, it was incorporated into the
Gambian Government, and in 1985 acquired autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The library, which serves as both a public and a national
library, maintains a collection of more than 115,000 volumes of
books, 85 periodical subscriptions and a special collection of
Gambiana.
</P>
<P>
Since 1946, the Dag Hammarskjold Library at the United Nations
headquarters in New York, part of the Department of Public
Information, has arranged for the distribution of United Nations
documents and publications to users around the world through its
depository library system.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 373 United Nations depository libraries:
55 are located in Africa, 100 in Asia and the Pacific, 32 in
Eastern Europe, 84 in Western Europe, 48 in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and 54 in North America.
</P>
<P>
These libraries receive United Nations materials, with the
understanding that their collections will be maintained in good
working order and be available to the public free of charge.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Member States, as well as non-Members, are
entitled to one "free depository," usually national library in the
capital city. In addition, the national parliamentary library, if
open to the public, is also entitled to receive material free of
charge, U.N. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President to Visit Macedonia, Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel is expected to visit Macedonia and Albania on Sunday
in a bid to provide humanitarian aid to Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that
Demirel will visit the two countries to examine the plight of
the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Along with Demirel's visit, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will
meet with his counterparts from the European Union (EU) and other
Balkan countries in Luxembourg on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cem is also likely to take part in NATO foreign ministers'
meeting in Brussels, Belgium on Monday, Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Sermet Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel had earlier appointed Turkey's ambassador to Belgrade
Ahmet Acet as his special envoy for Kosovo and sent him to
Macedonia and Albania on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Acet will deliver Demirel's special message to the leaders of
the two countries and will prepare a special report about the
current developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported here on Wednesday that
over 8,000 Kosovo refugees had arrived in Turkey since NATO
started air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a member state of NATO, supports the military
alliance's bombings in Yugoslavia to press Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic into allowing NATO forces to enter Kosovo to
police a peace deal that would give broad autonomy to ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 Turkish warplanes stationed in the NATO bases in
Italy, have joined the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Suspends Rule on Libyan Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's supreme court Wednesday
ordered the temporary suspension of the execution of a verdict
over a missing Libyan dissident pending a formal decision on the
case in October.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Court of Appeal ruled in February that the Interior
Ministry was negligent for failing to protect Mansour Kikhia, a
former Libyan foreign minister, who disappeared in November 1993
in Cairo after attending a meeting of the Arab Human Rights
Organization. Kikhia's fate is not known now.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered the ministry to pay Kikhia's wife, Baha
el-Emary, 100,000 Egyptian pounds (29,400 U.S. dollars) in
compensation. The ministry appealed against the ruling in March.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the Interior Ministry have denied any role in
Kikhia's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Court of Cassation said in a statement Wednesday that
it will examine the appeal and a decision on the case will be made
in October.
</P>
<P>
El-Emary, who is now living in Washington, first filed the suit
before the South Cairo Primary Court, holding the Interior
Ministry responsible for the disappearance of her husband.
</P>
<P>
The primary court turned down the suit, citing lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
El-Emary later appealed to the Cairo Court of Appeal and sought
500,000 pounds (147,000 dollars) in damages. The appeal court
maintained that Kikhia was a prominent figure and the Interior
Ministry was responsible for his security when he was in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> WFP Seeks Additional Relief for Kosovar Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) has appealed to donor nations for an additional
24.1 million U.S. dollars to save the lives of Kosovar refugees in
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, a U.N. spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference this brings
the total cost of the WFP's on-goning relief operations in the
region to 46.3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a separate news release, Catherine Bertini, WFP executive
director, Wednesday said, "Our donors have been extremely generous
with food, money and logistical support. Donor response to the WFP
appeal has been so swift that 80 percent of resources have already
been pledged."
</P>
<P>
"But we are not out of the woods yet as people continue pouring
out of Kosovo," she said. "We need donors to cover the remaining
20 percent. If the refugee outflow proves to be more than 650,000,
WFP will still need more resources."
</P>
<P>
"The short-term and long-term needs of the refugees are
urgent," she said. "We need these additional funds to avert a
deterioration of the nutritional status of refugees. Some of these
refugees have not had enough to eat since the war began inside
Kosovo more than a year ago. Children are particularly hungry and
vulnerable."
</P>
<P>
As the WFP launched its appeal, the coordination of
humanitarian relief food supplies in Albania for the refugees was
in full swing, with 80 percent of the refugees in northern Albania
receiving full rations and 100 percent receiving at least some
relief food.
</P>
<P>
A massive exodus of refugees were forced to leave Yugoslavia
for neighboring Albania and Macedonia after their country was
bombed by NATO.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Paper Urges Negotiation on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The official Communist Party of
Vietnam newspaper Nhan Dan (The People) Thursday urged the United
States and NATO to immediately end their military attack against
Yugoslavia and said negotiation is the only way to restore peace
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan said in a commentary that the Yugoslavian government
has once again expressed its goodwill and resolve to peacefully
settle the Kosovo crisis by declaring a unilateral cease-fire, and
preparing for a provisional accord to grant substantial autonomy
to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and a program for the return of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Stop War And Sit Down For
Negotiations, The Only Way To Restore Peace In Kosovo," said the
reason the United States and NATO rejected Yugoslavia's offer of
cease-fire was "arrogant of a group that prefers to use military
power to solve all issues."
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO have insisted that the cease-fire
offer was "insufficient" and that before a cease-fire can be
considered, Yugoslavia must meet what they claim is "the demand
established by the international community," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called demand by the international community referred
to by the U.S. and NATO is in fact an unreasonable demand raised
by NATO for Serbia and Yugoslavia to withdraw all their forces out
of Kosovo and accept NATO's scheme to deploy 28,000 infantry
troops in Yugoslavia to interfere in the internal affairs of that
sovereign nation," the daily pointed out.
</P>
<P>
By dismissing the cease-fire initiative and ignoring the public
demand for a political solution to the crisis, the U.S. and NATO
are continuing with their military escalation against Yugoslavia,
the daily said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and NATO must put an immediate end to their
cruel military attack against Yugoslavia," the daily urged.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Crisis More Serious Than Expected: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis that began in
Asia in 1997 has turned out to be more lasting, widespread and
deeper than had been foreseen, causing dramatic and severe social
problems, a U.N. agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As many as seven economies in mainland Asia suffered negative
growth in 1998 compared with none in 1996 and only one in 1997,
the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) said in its 1999 Economic and Social Survey of Asia and
the Pacific. The survey did not identify the countries.
</P>
<P>
The survey pinpointed unemployment and poverty as the most
serious social problems in several Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Poverty increased dramatically in Indonesia from 11 to 40
percent, in Thailand from 11 to 15 percent and in Malaysia from
under seven percent to eight percent. In Thailand, estimates of
dropouts from education are over 200,000 with about half range at
the primary level. In Indonesia, overall estimate is 25 percent,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment increased from 4.7 percent in 1997 to 21 percent
in 1998 in Indonesia, 2.7 percent to 6.4 percent in Malaysia, 2.6
percent to 7.7 percent in South Korea and 1.9 percent to 4.4
percent in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The governments' ability to address social problems has been
constrained by reduced revenues and in some cases by the
conditionalities of the bailout packages. However, some of these
conditions were recently relaxed," said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The overall economic prospects will continue to be uncertain.
"Internationally, the weak state of the Japanese economy, possible
slowdown in the EU and despite its recent strengths, likely
flattening of growth in the U.S. economy in 1999 are the more
immediate sources of uncertainty," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
It said world financial markets have displayed increased
volatility, commodity prices have weakened and international
capital flows to developing countries especially debt flows, have
declined. The growth performance of developing countries in the
ESCAP region as a group in 1998 was dismal. GDP growth fell from
5.8 percent in 1997 to 0.2 percent in 1998. The forecast for 1999
however is 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In South and Southwest Asia, it increased from 4.6 percent in
1997 to 5.3 percent in 1998. It is expected to grow to 5.6 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, the GDP growth fell sharply from 4.3 percent
in 1997 to minus 6.2 percent in 1998 and is only expected to rise
to 0.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In East and Northeast Asia, the GDP went down from 7.0 percent
in 1997 to 1.5 percent in 1998 but is expected to reach 4.4
percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Role of U.N., OSCE in Halting NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Thursday called for a role of the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, the OSCE could not play an active role in the Balkans
if NATO continued its military strikes against Yugoslavia, Ivanov
told the press after meeting with OSCE Chairman Knut Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
What is the most crucial at the moment is to stop NATO's
military operation. Only after NATO halted the bombing could the
concerned parties sit down to seek a settlement of the Balkan
issues including the humanitarian crisis, said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
The Balkan conflict proved again that Europe need a security
structure which can prevent conflict like the one in the Balkans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek, also the foreign minister of Norway, a NATO member,
is the first NATO minister to visit Moscow since NATO staged
attacks on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek said the humanitarian disaster in the Balkans could
only be solved by political means. The OSCE welcomes any proposal
which can help solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Moscow Thursday after a trip to Albania and
Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government Wins House Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government headed by
Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh Thursday overwhelmingly
won a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives (lower
house of Parliament).
</P>
<P>
After two days of debate over the policy statement presented by
Rawabdeh, the 80-seat lower house approved the new government by a
vote of 66 to 12 with two abstentions, the official news agency
Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The Rawabdeh government has been widely anticipated to pass
the vote in the house after it was appointed by King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch has the constitutional rights of
appointing governments and dissolving the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has vowed in his policy statement to lift the
country's economy out of stagnation by creating favorable
circumstances for local and foreign investments and by sweeping
out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh was faced with a negative economic growth in 1998, a
two-digit unemployment rate and a fact that over one third of the
country's 4.6 million population are living under the poverty line
of 210 U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
On foreign affairs, Rawabdeh said his government would pursue
friendly ties with all Arab countries and would campaign for the
lifting of international sanctions imposed on Iraq, Sudan and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed in his statement to support all legitimate
rights of the Palestinians, including their rights of setting up
an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Houghton: Chinese Youth Side Among Best in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, Southwestern China, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's
English manager Bob Houghton claimed his under-21 side are among
the best in Asia and can see off any challenges in a bid to
qualify for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, who also coaches the national eleven, said at the
training camp here on Thursday that the Chinese youth team stands
at the same level with the continental powerhouses South Korea and
Japan--if it wouldn't be fair to say so for their national squad.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we bring out our true selves--whatever the
opponents--we have every chance to reach the Sydney Olympics," the
Englishman told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Though he admitted South Korea has the most competitive youth
team across the continent, which can be proved by the fact that
they narrowly beat defending champions China 1-0 in the final to
grab the Dunhill Cup Under-21 tournament trophy earlier this year
in Vietnam, Houghton reckoned his young men do have some edges
over their old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
"We are as good as the South Koreans, or maybe better than them,
as far as the individual talents are concerned, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to talk about other Asian threats ahead of China,
who are attempting to grab their only second entry to the Olympic
soccer after 1988, "I don't know very much about the Japanese
Under-21 side, but from the performances of their youth team (in
the Nigerian World Youth Championship) I concluded it's a very
promising side."
</P>
<P>
As for Iran, which was reported to be dragged into a brawl
between coach and players, Houghton said they are no stronger than
the Chinese lads. The same with Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Houghton said he would mostly stick with the side which broke
into the last four at last year's Asian Games soccer tournament
when announcing the final 18-man list earlier May.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic qualifying campaign begins on May 20 in
Hanoi, where China will take on the host side, Burma and the
People's Democratic Republic of Korea in the group stage.
</P>
<P>
The second leg of the round robin matches will be held in
Shanghai, China in June, with the best team to join eight other
top sides in a knock-out tournament to decide three Asian
representatives to Sydney.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian prime minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is now Chairman of the "Russia is Our
Home," said on Thursday that Russia should make efforts to stop
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
Chernomyrdin expressed his worry over the extension of the
Yugoslav crisis to other countries. Russia should manage to bring
both NATO and Yugoslavia to the negotiation table to avoid further
bleeding, he said while urging all politicians to unite together
for resolution of the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another prominent Russian politician, Ruri Luzhkov, who serves
as the Mayor of Moscow and the Chairman of "Fatherland,"
reiterated on the same day that the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
would not achieve any result.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if NATO sent its ground troops to Kosovo, it
would make another big mistake. By doing that, NATO would be
subject to "bushfighting" and face "the second Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov meanwhile called for an end to NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, saying it had forced hundreds of thousands of Kosovo
Albanian refugees to flee their homes and widened the ethnic gap
in Kosovo.

HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany
came from behind to knock out eighth seed Michael Chang of the
United States 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 at the second round of Salem Hong Kong
Open here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In other second round matches, veteran German player Boris
Becker defeated sixth seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa in
straight sets while Andre Agassi of the United States, fifth seed
Nicolas Kiefer of Germany and seventh seed Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden all advanced to the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Surprise winners of the first round, Germany's Bernd Karbacher
and Italy's Laurence Tieleman maintained their winning streak and
sailed through the next round.
</P>
<P>
Chang started his third clash with the 98th-ranked German
steadily and broke his third game to finish the first and drizzle-
interrupted set 6-3. But the German fought back immediately into
the second set by breaking Chang's first game with powerful serves
and blocks.
</P>
<P>
Chang broke back in the ninth game but wasted two break points
in the eleventh. Yet Dreekmann won one of the two break points in
the 12th game and leveled the set score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
After the two served to 5-4 in the final set, Chang conceded
three break points in his fifth game and lost the match, which
lasted for 2 hours 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the defeat "hurt him a lot" and he was "taught to
win big points" since he missed some break points in the second
set. He added that he was not "tough enough" at the big points.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong favorite, who is to play in Japan Open next week,
said he hopes the Hong Kong Open will continue since Hong Kong is
a "great place and a special place" for him where he got "great
support".
</P>
<P>
Becker, who defeated Ferreira 6-4, 7-6 (12-10), said: "I still
go out there and do my best even I am semi-retired."
</P>
<P>
Becker said his first grand slam title was won at Wimbledon and
he hopes the last grand slam event he plays will also be a
Wimbledon, which is scheduled for coming June.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals, Becker will play Tieleman, who
eliminated fourth seed Cedric Pioline of France in the first round
and knocked out Cecil Mamiit of the United States 6-3, 6-4 in the
second. Bjorkman will play Karbacher, who sent home second seed
Patrick Rafter of Australia in the first round and beat Brett
Steven of New Zealand in the second.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, beating Oliver Gross of Germany in straight sets, now
faces a tough battle with Kiefer, who scored an easy victory over
Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Finland to Grant 10 Million U.S. Dollars to Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government on
Thursday pledged to provide an emergency aid of 55 million Finnish
markka (around 10 million U.S. dollars) to help Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Of the money, 35 million Finnish markka (6.36 million U.S.
dollars) will be of humanitarian nature, and the remaining 20
million (3.64 million U.S. dollars) will be used to fund those
refugees stranded in neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The government has said that it will take in some Kosovo
refugees but the number has yet to be decided. Meanwhile, the
Finnish Red Cross is to establish a makeshift hospital or two
clinics to give emergency medical treatment to refugees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Finland is to take temporary measures to shelter
some refugees if the neighboring countries of Yugoslavia were
incapable of settling the numerous refugees who fled the flames of
war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Finnish Red Cross has reportedly collected a
donation of 8.5 million Finnish markka (1.45 million U.S. dollars)
for Kosovo refugees.

<HEADLINE> More SLA Militiamen Defect to Lebanese Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Another two members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) defected to the Lebanese
army Thursday, three days after four militiamen turned themselves
in to the government.
</P>
<P>
The pair arrived at a Lebanese army checkpoint in the eastern
Bekaa Valley from Shebaa village in the eastern part of the
Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon, the official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, four SLA members along with their wives and
children sneaked out of the 3,000-people village at dawn through
the hills and turned themselves in to the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
As a retaliation, Israeli forces Tuesday expelled 18 relatives
of the four defectors, mostly the elderly, children and women,
from the predominantly Sunni Muslim village.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has delivered urgent messages to the
U.N., asking U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to immediately
intervene and help the deportees go back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the 2,500-member SLA is helping Israeli occupation
forces patrol the occupied zone and handling the security affairs
in Jezzine, a predominantly Christian town facing the enclave.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were considered as traitors in Lebanon and SLA
commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia by
a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting speculation that Israeli forces may conduct a
unilateral partial withdrawal from south Lebanon, the SLA's moral
is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government in a bid to escape a reprisal afterwards.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Cuts Interest Rates by Quarter Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England cut interest
rates by 0.25 percent Thursday which means the base rate is now at
5.25 percent and at its lowest level for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth time in seven months that the Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee has decided to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The decision came as a welcome relief for manufacturers and
unions who have been suffering from the high value of the pound as
well as for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
However, the UK's largest mortgage lenders, the Halifax and
Addey National banks, reacted cautiously saying they would review
the situation before deciding whether to cut their rates for
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
Business is pleased by the Bank's decision to keep interest
rates moving down, but they want a more aggressive attitude to the
lowering of base rates.
</P>
<P>
TUC (Trade Unions Congress) General Secretary John Monks said:
"Rates are still too high. Manufacturing needs more of the same."

<HEADLINE> U.N. AIDS Program Gets Seventh Cosponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations International
Drug Control Program (UNDCP) has become the seventh cosponsor of
the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), announced
UNAIDS in a press release here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the joining of UNDCP to UNAIDS,
UNAIDS Executive Director Peter Piot said, "The use of
psychoactive drugs has facilitated the spread of HIV infection in
several ways. The most direct way is by HIV transmission through
needles shared by injecting drug users."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, drug-induced loss of inhibitions can lead
to sexual and other high-risk behaviors that individuals might
otherwise avoid.
</P>
<P>
The UNDCP is active in supporting HIV/AIDS prevention programs
and including such components in its own programs to reduce the
demand for illicit drugs. Youth and groups engaging in high-risk
behavior are particularly targeted.
</P>
<P>
Coordination within the U.N. system has already resulted in
more effective programming responses to drug use and the AIDS
epidemic in a number of countries.
</P>
<P>
The six existing UNAIDS cosponsors are the United Nations
Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Program, the
United Nations Fund for Population Activities, United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World
Health Organization and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reiterates Pledge Not to Get Involved in Balkan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday reiterated the pledge not to get involved militarily in
the Balkan crisis, saying that Russia would not provide weapons
for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Providing arms for Yugoslavia would mean dragging Russia into a
world war, Yeltsin told Interfax before meeting with Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev. Yeltsin warned that it was in the Balkans
that the First World War erupted.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's statement came after a non-binding resolution passed
by the Lower House which called for military aid to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has expanded its range of bombing to civilian facilities.
The bombing was an unconscionable act, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Sergeyev, Yeltsin said that Russia
would make efforts to solve the Yugoslavia crisis by political and
diplomatic means and was preparing new initiatives for a peaceful
solution to the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told the press after the meeting that the air raids
inflicted tremendous damage on Yugoslavia, yet they failed to
bring grave damage to the Yugoslav army. Yugoslavia still keeps
combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev pointed out there were two ways in the development of
the situation in Yugoslavia. One was solving the problem
peacefully, while the other was building up military pressure by
launching ground war.
</P>
<P>
The second way would spread the conflict beyond the border of
Yugoslavia and make it turn out to be a protracted war, creating
more serious humanitarian disasters in the Balkans and resulting
in more causalities.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, voted
overwhelmingly on Wednesday for a resolution urging Yeltsin and
his government to provide military aid for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Deputies in the house voted 279-34 for the non-binding
resolution, which also called for government delegations to visit
a number of countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Greece,
Romania, Bulgaria, India and Egypt, to explain Russia's opposition
to NATO military strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the president and his government to
discuss and adopt necessary measures by April 15 for providing
weapons and spare parts for Yugoslavia and sending a military
delegation to the country.

Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton said Wednesday.

He said that the strikes are beginning to "erode the capacity
to hold on" by Yugoslav forces, principally in Kosovo.
</P>

He also said that NATO is now accentuating the rhythm of
airstrikes by carrying out bombings day and night while "extending

<HEADLINE> Iranian Human Rights Body Criticizes Forced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian human rights group on
Thursday criticized an Iranian revolutionary court for closing
down the moderate daily Zan (women) and called for investigation
based on the constitution and press law.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Hassan Ziaeifar, secretary general of the Islamic
Human Rights Commission (IHRC) which was set up in 1995, said that
to deal with any press offense in Iran, there is no way but to
observe the constitution and the press law.
</P>
<P>
He said that resorting to any other means in this regard will
result in deviation from the press law and tension in society, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper was banned for publishing a letter of Farah Diba, the
ousted Iranian queen, and a caricature making fun of "blood money"
-- money paid to the family of a murdered person as compensation
by the murderer. Paying ``blood money'' is one of the main
judicial and religious principles of Islam.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily's managing director Faezeh Hashemi on
Wednesday rejected the charges against her daily and accused the
closure as a "political move" by the conservatives against the
moderates, the main supporters of the reformist President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Hashemi underlined that the
case of her daily should be investigated by the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance or the press court, not the
revolutionary court.
</P>
<P>
The ban on Zan can be seen as part of the campaigns by the
hard-line factions for the sixth Majlis (parliament) elections
slated early next year, said Hashemi, daughter of former Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance on
Wednesday night also expressed regret over the closure of Zan and
underlined that all press offenses should be dealt with by the
press court in open sessions and in the presence of a jury
according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the ministry called on the conservative
revolutionary court to respect freedom of writing and safeguard
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it has sent a written warning to the
daily's managing director deploring the negligence of the daily in
its publication.
</P>
<P>
Noting the possibility of making mistakes is unavoidable in
journalism, the ministry also called on the daily's managers to
clearly apologize for the mistake.

<HEADLINE> Israel Considers Taking in More Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here on Thursday that Israel is considering taking
in more refugees from Kosovo, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he has asked the Foreign Ministry to prepare for
the arrival of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Netanyahu announced Israel has decided to
take in 100 refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees can stay in Israel for six months, after
which they can decide for themselves whether to remain in Israel
or leave.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu stressed there is no gap in his and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's positions on the Kosovo crisis. He
said they both support NATO's actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Sharon's remarks that an independent state in
Kosovo can only turn into an international base for Islamic
terrorist activities are only his personal assessment which do not
reflect the current Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak accused
the government of speaking in two voices on the Kosovo crisis. He
said the government should take a clear stand in support of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's actions.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Jewish Agency continued its
effort to aid the Kosovo refugees now stranded in Albania.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the agency sent the second plane to Albania which
carried seven tons of supplies.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that it will continue sending aid to Albania
every day until next Monday.

the mainland and Taiwan are mutually complementary. They also
agreed that cross-Straits trade and cooperation should be further
expanded.

A number of speakers focused on whether or not Taiwan should
buy more agricultural products from the mainland. Various speakers

<HEADLINE> New Government Building Unveiled in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents will find it easier
to go through some administrative formalities as an edifice
housing nine government departments was unveiled here today.
</P>
<P>
Situated in a downtown area, the building accommodates the
government departments in charge of public administration, housing,
translation of laws, judicial affairs, and various kinds of
registration related to birth, marriage, death, property, business
and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Most of the departments used to lease offices from individual
proprietors and had to spend large sums of rent every year.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Posts and Telecommunications Department bought the
edifice last August with 408 million patacas (about 51 million U.S.
dollars). All the departments in the building should turn in
reasonable sums of rent.
</P>
<P>
The building has 33 stories, five of which are used as parking
lots. Local residents may enjoy great convenience as parking space
is rather limited in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Indian President Urges Papers to Stop Commercializing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan Thursday urged Indian newspapers to resist the tendency
of "trivializing and commercializing" news and contribute to
preservation of India's identity and culture.
</P>
<P>
"While competing with the electronic media, newspapers tend to
trivialize and commercialize news... It is an irresistible
tendency but has to be resisted," Narayanan said while addressing
a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of Indian
Newspaper Society.
</P>
<P>
He said that newspapers in India had become a "staple diet" of
the people and part and parcel of daily life and, therefore, they
should pass on cultural values.
</P>
<P>
The Indian president said that despite competing with the
exploding electronic media, the print media would have its
supremacy and described it as a "soul-stirring instrument unlike
the electronic media".
</P>
<P>
Newspapers would play a predominant role in the next
millennium, he said, adding that they were "closer to the people,
read the pulse of the people and purvey news that is acceptable to
the masses".
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that over 39,000 newspapers and periodicals
are now published in India in as many as 100 languages and
dialects.

KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The GDP growth rate for Nepal
hit an all-time low of 2.1 percent in 1998 as against 3.8 percent
in 1997, said the economic and social survey of Asia and the
Pacific 1999 released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other countries in the South Asian region recorded higher
estimated growth rates in 1998 with 5.6 percent for Bangladesh,
5.0 percent for Bhutan, 6.0 percent for India, 5.4 percent for
Pakistan and 5.5 percent for Sri Lanka, said the survey conducted
by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
The survey found that as a result of bad weather, agriculture,
which contributes to about 40 percent of GDP in Nepal, grew by
only 1.1 percent in 1998 compared with 4.1 percent in 1997 while
non-agricultural sector grew by 2.8 percent, down from 3.5 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the manufacturing sector in Nepal declined as well
because of a downturn in the carpet and ready-made garment
industries but the service sector performed better as tourist
arrivals improved in the Visit Nepal Year '98, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate in Nepal fell to 4.0 percent in 1998 from 7.7
percent in 1997. As a result, lower growth in prices of food and
non-food items was observed.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that in 1998 Nepal's exports to India, its
biggest trading partner, increased by more than 50 percent; total
merchandise exports grew by 11.7 percent which was slightly higher
than 1997.
</P>
<P>
Imports from India increased marginally whereas imports from
other countries fell sharply. The survey noted that trade deficit
decreased substantially for Nepal in 1998 as a result of good
exports and fall in imports.
</P>
<P>
For increasing liquidity to boost the economy, nominal
refinance rate was lowered, maturity restrictions on government
securities and re-discounting and secondary transaction were
removed and cash reserve ratio was lowered in 1998 in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, foreign direct investment in Nepal decreased to 11.1
million U.S. dollars as against 28.4 million dollars in 1997.
However, there was a large increase in foreign aid and overall
balance of payments was in surplus, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
It said foreign investment has been welcomed in Nepal, but
delayed structural reforms, often due to political instability,
constrained such investment.
</P>
<P>
The issue of large sums of non-performing loans continues to
create concern and the need to create an enabling environment for
the private sector has been increasingly recognized, it added.

<HEADLINE> Pact Reached Over Currency Issue in Somalia + </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- An agreement was reached between
faction leader Hussein Aidid and the businessmen in south
Mogadishu Thursday over the disputed importation of newly printed
Somali shilling notes.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference held by Aidid and Mohamed Abdulle
Daylaf, who spoke on behalf of the businessmen, the two sides
announced what they called a total settlement over their five-day
dispute.
</P>
<P>
But neither side went into the details to mention the terms of
their agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, sources close to the businessmen said that Aidid
has renounced his claim of having the rights to control the money,
while the businessmen themselves had come up with a compromising
agenda acknowledging the existence of Aidid's authority as their
faction leader since they both belong to the same Habar Gidir
clan.
</P>
<P>
Since the dispute has been settled, more than 35 billion Somali
 shillings worth of four million U.S. dollars are expected to soon
reach Ballidogle airport, 90 kilometers south of Mogadishu, as the
first consignment.
</P>
<P>
About 50 battle wagons and nearly 700 heavily-armed militiamen
belonging to the businessmen are now stretched between Mogadishu
and Ballidogle airport, ready to escort and secure the arrival of
the money.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the rest of 100 billion Somali shilling notes
will follow to reach Mogadishu later on. This will make the total
amount of the notes worth 14 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The release of the money printed in Canada by a Malaysian group
 known as Adorna has been worked out smoothly by the businessmen
after allegedly paying 800,000 dollars more for the completion of
its printing.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Adorna group had in 1996 agreed with late General
Aidid to print over 170 billion somali shilling notes for his
faction.
</P>
<P>
However, the first consignment of the money of 35 billion
Somali shillings worth of four million dollars, had reached
Mogadishu in 1997 and was used by Hussein Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Somali shillings against the hard currencies
especially the U.S. dollar has taken a new low in its history as
the news of the agreement between Aidid and the independent
businessmen over the money dispute has reached the streets and the
capital markets. One dollar Thursday can buy 9,000 Somali
shillings instead of 8,560 shillings in late March.
</P>
<P>
According to the economists, the printing of the Somali
shilling notes will be an open business for all, thus further
endangering the overall poor economy and the existence of the
Somali shillings as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen have already begun selling their goods only in
U.S. dollars, predicting that the value of Somali shilling will
keep devaluating.

<HEADLINE> Asian, Pacific Region Economy Recovering: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A UN report released here on
Thursday says that the economic crisis in Asia may have bottomed
out and the regional economy may start a stable recovery soon.
</P>
<P>
The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 1999, an
annual investigation conducted by the Economic and Social Council
for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), a part of the United Nations,
concludes that although uncertainties remain in the near future,
evidence of recovery has begun to show up.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus and foreign exchange reserves have all began to
pick up in some of the nations that had been severely hit by the
economic crisis. Foreign exchange rates and stock markets have
also shown signs of recovery while the pressure of inflation has
been eased, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Although the economic prospects remain not very clear, the
report says that it is generally agreed that the worst period of
the crisis has gone away and that the economy of Asia and the
Pacific region may soon pick up.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) of the
developing nations in the region is expected to increase from 0.2
percent in 1998 to 3.6 percent in 1999, the report says. The GDP
of southeast Asian nations is expected to rise from a negative 6.2
percent to 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to the worsening of the Asian financial crisis,
international trade and economic growth in the region dropped
significantly last year from the previous year. Among the 19
countries on the Asian continent, seven reported a negative
economic growth last year.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP growth rate declined one percentage point to 7.8
percent last year, but it was still one of the highest in the
world, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Hints At Delaying Independence Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, on
a visit to Japan, on Thursday hinted at delaying a planned
unilateral declaration of independence by Palestine, the Kyodo
News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed the intention during a meeting with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Kyodo quoted a Japanese Foreign
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to make a final decision that will satisfy all the
nations, including Japan...that advised me to postpone the
declaration at least until Israel holds a general election (May 17)
," Arafat told Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a two-day visit. In his
talks Wednesday evening with Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura, Arafat spelled out his plan to make a final decision
around April 27 when the Palestinian Central Council convenes to
discuss the planned statehood.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi advised Arafat to delay his plan to unilaterally declare
an independent Palestinian state on May 5, the day after an
interim self-rule agreement with Israel expires, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, however, reiterated Japan's support for the right of
Palestinians to self-determination, and vowed to continue "both
economic and political assistance" to help Palestinians build a
state through the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The five-year interim accord cleared the way for negotiations
to begin on a final, comprehensive peace settlement as called for
in the 1993 Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been traveling around the world to listen to
opinions about his plan to declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
He visited Turkey, Jordan and Russia before flying into Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
After ending his visit to Japan on Thursday, Arafat left for
Vietnam and will later visit China, Indonesia, Pakistan and other
Asian nations as well as African nations. He has already traveled
to European nations and the United States.

AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian delegation headed by
Queen Rania Al-Abdullah left Amman Thursday for Macedonia to
deliver relief supplies to the Kosovo refugees there, Jordan's
Petra news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian delegation will present tents, food, medicine
and other relief materials to the ethnic Albanians refugees now
strangled in Macedonia after fleeing the Serbian province of
Kosovo, Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
Queen Rania's mission to Macedonia was her first official
foreign trip since she was proclaimed queen on March 21 by
her husband King Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has ordered emergency humanitarian aid to Kosovo
refugees after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
launched bombing campaigns on Yugoslavia more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has blamed the exodus of refugees from Kosovo on
alleged ethnic cleansing by the Serb forces against ethnic
Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Genocide Never Committed Again: OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), reaffirmed the
resolve to ensure that Rwanda genocide is never committed again in
the African Continent or any where else in the world, local
newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made Wednesday by the OAU Secretary General
when he was speaking at a meeting here to commemorate the fifth
anniversary of Rwanda genocide which killed over 500,000 Rwandan
from April to July 1994.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "this ghastly event will forever haunt us and evoke
the indictment to our collective humanity as we recalled how the
world watched with horror but did very little, if anything at all,
to stop the brutal and systematic decimation of a people."
</P>
<P>
He recalled the endorsement of the establishment of an
international panel of eminent personalities to investigate the
genocide in Rwanda and the events surrounding it in the Great
Lakes region by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government
meeting in Ouagadougou in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the main objective of the panel is to draw
a lesson from the Rwandan tragedy and to contribute toward the
promotion of national healing, reconciliation and cohesion in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of
the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said the
most fundamental cause of civil conflict in Africa is not ethnic
diversity but poverty which is also a consequence of civil war.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to support the people and
government of Rwanda in their efforts for reconciliation and
economic growth "necessary to address the poverty and economic
inequities, as well as other social and political underpinnings of
the conflict".

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China has approved a set of
regulations on the building, management and supervision of the
public housing fund to ensure the smooth process of the housing
reform.
</P>
<P>
The public housing fund is created by contributions from
employers and employees. The employees are required to deposit a
certain portion of their salary into the fund.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that the fund is set up for the sole
purpose of purchasing, building, and renovating housing. But the
management center, an independent non-profit institution, can use
the fund to buy state debentures upon approval of a housing
committee composed of government officials, trade unions, and
experts.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the public housing fund management
center's work is supervised by the financial departments of local
governments. In addition, employers and employees have the right
to be informed about the fund management.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A law drafting team for the law on
the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises was installed
here today under a National People's Congress subcommittee, the
Financial and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises are an important component
of China's national economy but are in a disadvantageous position
compared with their larger competitors, senior legislators and
government officials said at today's installation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Legislation to promote the development and competence of small
and medium-sized enterprises is necessary for national economic
development and reform of the country's economic system, said Chen
Guangyi, chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of small and
medium-sized enterprises registered with the government now
exceeds 10 million.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises produce 60 percent of the total value of
industrial output, contribute 40 percent of all taxes and profits,
and provide 75 percent of all urban jobs, said Shi Wanpeng, vice
minister of the State Commission of Economy and Trade.
</P>
<P>
According to legislators, a draft law based on opinions
solicited nationwide is expected to be submitted for discussion by
the NPC Financial and Economic Committee in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Youths Hold 13 Oil Stations over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Angry youths in the Niger Delta of
Nigeria took a new dimension Wednesday when youths from 61 Ijaw
communities took over 13 flow stations demanding more compensation
by oil companies for their oil spills.
</P>
<P>
After the expiration of an ultimatum Monday, the youths have
already seized five barges, four tugboats and one sea track
belonging to oil companies in the region, This Day newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a release issued by the Association of Mobil Spill Affected
Communities (AMSAC), the youths said that they had rounded up its
war against Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited with the taking over
of 13 flow stations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, seven flow stations belong to Shell
in the Batan area and six in the North Bank Oil Fields belong to
Agip.
</P>
<P>
AMSAC's dispute with Mobil started after the 40,000 barrels
spill at Idoho Oit on January 12, 1998 which affected members of
AMSAC communities and other settlements along the Atlantic
Coastline.
</P>
<P>
After paying 20,000 naira (about 222 U.S. dollars) to some
victims, Mobil is said to have refused to pay the rest of the two
billion (about 22 million Dollars) naira compensation demanded by
the affected communities.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Records Exceptional GDP Growth: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Asia was the only bright
exception in 1998 when developing economies in the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) region as a
group recorded a growth rate of close to zero percent due to
deepening financial crisis, a survey on the region found.
</P>
<P>
South and Southwest Asia recorded an estimated 5.3 percent
growth of real GDP in 1998 while the developing economies as a
whole in the region witnessed a growth rate of only 0.2 percent as
against over 7 percent in 1996 and almost 6 percent in 1997, noted
the economic and social survey released here Thursday by the
ESCAP, a U.N. commission.
</P>
<P>
In the South Asian region, the real GDP growth rate in 1998 was
5.6 percent, 5.0 percent, 6.0 percent, 2.1 percent, 5.4 percent
and 5.5 percent respectively for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka when major developing economies in other
sub-regions saw negative growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The real GDP growth rate for the developed economies of the
ESCAP region was minus 2.2 percent in 1998, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that after a growth rate of 3.2 percent in 1997, the
world economy slowed sharply to a rate of 1.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rates in the countries of South and Southwest Asia
were either lower, or increased very slightly in 1998 as compared
with 1997, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
In the sub-region, the relative insulation of the financial
markets moderated the contagion effect of the regional economic
crisis on the domestic economy, the survey observed.
</P>
<P>
Among the least developed countries, growth was much less
robust in Southeast Asia than in South Asia. The survey said one
reason was that foreign direct investment flows to these countries
slowed as investors from Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand either
delayed or canceled proposed projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the slowness in achieving greater depth in financial
markets has been an impediment in diversifying the sources of
finance for development in the South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of higher GDP growth rates has also been
constrained by inadequate infrastructure, low productivity and
inefficiency in public sector enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal improvement is another issue with which most of the
countries of the South and Southwest Asian regions have been
grappling with little success," the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
It said for the least developed countries, namely, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal in the South Asian region, poverty
alleviation continues to be the major challenge.
</P>
<P>
"To break through the poverty syndrome, the existing pace of
GDP growth needs to be accelerated significantly," it said. "A
pertinent policy issue for these countries is how the quality and
effectiveness of official development assistance, on which they
are dependent, can be enhanced."
</P>
<P>
The survey for 1999 also touched upon the application of
information and communication technology.
</P>
<P>
It said much more progress in making the technology accessible
to economic actors has occurred in the newly industrializing
economies and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries, and in some other larger countries including China and
India.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Strategy to Build Technopreneurship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Defense Tony Tan Keng Yam Thursday announced his
country's comprehensive strategy to build a critical mass of
technopreneurial talent.
</P>
<P>
Tony Tan, who chairs the Technopreneurship 21 Ministerial
Committee, told a press conference that Singapore will launch a
systematic, comprehensive strategic plan to develop and attract
technopreneurship talent to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In outlining the strategy, he said it will be carried out
through four initiatives centering on education, facilities,
regulations and financing.
</P>
<P>
Citing education as a crucial component of the strategic plan,
Tony Tan said Singapore universities should be revised to become
engines of innovation and technopreneurship and grow into world
class institutions which are not only generators of trained
manpower but also generators of business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Singaporeans need to be infused with a culture
of innovation and enterprise and a readiness to take calculated
risks through education, he said, "We have started revamping our
schools to encourage innovation and creative thinking and
pervasively use and exploit information technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tony Tan said comfortable and conducive facilities that provide
an intellectually stimulating and creative environment will be
created under the so-called T21 plan to attract technopreneurial
talent to gather.
</P>
<P>
He also said a review of rules and regulations will be made
with the aim of removing obstacles and building up a more
supportive environment and infrastructure for technopreneurs to
start business and realize their full potential.
</P>
<P>
"We will change our laws and regulations if recommended and
found necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy prime minister, the Singapore
government will establish a 1-billion-U.S.-dollar
Technopreneurship Investment Fund (TIF) to signal its commitment
to technopreneurship development.
</P>
<P>
The TIF is intended to draw more venture capital activities
into Singapore, Tony Tan added.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the National Science and Technology
Board will be designated as the leading government agency to
provide focus and direction to the technopreneurship drive.
</P>
<P>
Tony Tan said the most important challenge for the Singapore
economy in the 21st century is to rapidly transit from a
capital-intensive manufacturing and services economy to a globally
competitive advanced knowledge economy with a strong and vibrant
technopreneurship sector within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Innovation and technopreneurship will form a crucial part of
Singapore's next wave of economic growth in the 21st century, he
said, stressing that it is the earlier the better to promote
technopreneurship.

<HEADLINE> Australian Media Giant Drives Stocks to Record Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket surged
to another all-time closing high Thursday, powered by a bullish
performance in select blue chip stocks, in particular Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark All Ordinaries Index ended 26.6 points stronger
at 3,056.2 after hitting a record intraday high of 3,061.6 points.
</P>
<P>
It eclipsed the previous record closing high of 3032.9 set on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the recent strength in the market was
driven again by News Corp. with the Commonwealth Bank and Rio
Tinto also leaping ahead, while the broader market was marginally
better, Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
The market also showed a trend to stay above the 3,000-point
mark.
</P>
<P>
"Probably domestically the catalyst to holding it above 3,000
would be if interest rates do flatten out and could potentially go
lower from here," Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
News Corp.'s ordinary shares closed 71 cents, or 5.25 percent,
firmer. Volume was a massive 8.31 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The group's preferred shares were 67.5 cents, or 5.28 percent,
higher at 13.46 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall the media sector performed strongly, with Publishing
and Broadcasting climbing 41 cents, or 4.2 percent on speculation
that the media company would bring forward plans to float its
on-line business.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Ten Network Holdings climbed 7 cents, after it posted
solid first-half earnings Wednesday, while Seven Network shares
were flat at 5.25 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth and ANZ banks also provided some spark to the
banking sector, rising 48.6 cents and 25.5 cents respectively.
</P>
<P>
The National Australia Bank closed 5 cents higher while Westpac
dropped 1.3 cents.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the All Industrials Index rose 52.9 points to 5,516.6
while the All Resources Index added 3.4 points to 1,037.6.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the resources sector was Rio Tinto, which
jumped 73 cents, or 3.37 percent, after a rise in London Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
But the rise failed to help fellow miners WMC which lost 3.7
cents at the end of the day and North, which was down 1.2 cents.
Sector leader BHP added 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index fell 8.4 points to 960.3.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney gold bullion closed at 280.15 U.S. dollars an ounce,
a rise of 1.15 dollars an ounce from Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
National turnover stood at 460.71 million shares worth 1.31
billion Australian dollars (816.13 million U.S. dollars). There
were 605 falling stocks and 564 rising ones while 450 remained
steady.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise For Fourth Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices surged in Tokyo for the
fourth consecutive trading day Thursday, boosted by continued
brisk buying by foreign investors and a strong showing Wednesday
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 292.19 points, or 1.77
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 16,846.69, finishing
above 16,800 for the first time since March 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 20.43 points, or 1.54 percent to 1,
345.07.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section expanded to 826.47 million shares
from 709.71 million shares Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei opened lower, dragged down by selling following the
recent gains. It soon rebounded, however, helped by the rise in
New York stock prices and the U.S. dollar's strength against the
yen, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have played the major role in lifting share
prices in Tokyo, and their active stance has encouraged those who
waited to buy stocks on dips to move in, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 882 to 351, with 95 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weakens With Fall in Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Weaker-than-expected labor force
figures pushed the already tenuous Australian dollar down almost
three quarters of a U.S. cent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished at 62.36 U.S. cents, its lowest
level in more than a month. It closed at 63.06 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild &AMP; Sons senior foreign exchange manager Paul
Macarounas said that selling interest in the Australian dollar had
been evident during the morning and the jobs figures from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) simply tipped it over.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said earlier in the week the Australian dollar was
stubbornly holding onto the 63.00 U.S. cents level.
</P>
<P>
"And really it should have been lower, especially with the U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate breaking higher and gold
languishing around its lows," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today it had a little bit of a catch up, certainly the numbers
have helped but really the selling started before the figures came
out," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ABS reported total employment fell by 7,400 to 8.703
million, adjusted, in March after rising by 32,900 in February.
</P>
<P>
Australia's unemployment rate remained steady at 7.4 percent
and the participation rate was at 63.0 percent from 63.1 percent
in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate had been expected to rise to 7.5 percent
with forecasts ranging between 7.3 percent and 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The worse than expected employment numbers pushed it through
62.50 U.S. cents," Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar was buying 0.5777
euro from 0.5831 at Wednesday's close and 75.40 Japanese yen from
76.24.

on Thursday concluded his three-day official visit to Syria and
left here for Islamabad, capital of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Li met with his Syrian counterpart or
President of the People's Council Abdel Kader Kaddura, Prime

discussed with them the bilateral relations and regional and world
issues of common concern.
</P>

The top Chinese legislator and the Syrian leaders agreed that
efforts should be made to further develop the bilateral relations
in the political, economic and trade, science and technological,

</P>
<P>
They also agreed that China and Syria should join hands in
promoting unity and cooperation among the developing countries
around the world, and in the efforts for pushing forward the
Middle East peace process and seeking a just and fair solution to
the Middle East issues.

<HEADLINE> Sharon to Demand Russia Halt Technology Transfer to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon will make a visit to Russia next week during which he will
ask for a halt to Russia's alleged transfer of nuclear technology
to Iran, Israel Radio reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be Sharon's third trip to Moscow in less than a
month, during which he will meet with his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov also over improving the relationship between Israel and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's scheduled visit to Moscow was announced after he
expressed his reservations about the ongoing airstrikes on
Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has avoided condemning Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and has not voiced support for the NATO strike.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry has expressed
"satisfaction" with Sharon's position, officials in Israeli Prime
Minister's Office disclosed.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Israeli government told local daily Haaretz
that Sharon's lukewarm approach to NATO's actions in Yugoslavia
was driven by a desire to woo the Russians, the traditional ally
of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"Sharon believes that such a position on Kosovo will enable
him to get something in return from the Russians in two
spheres: the halting of the transfer of technology to Iran and
the generation of economic links, such as investments," the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said it has evidence that Russian firms are
providing nuclear weapons technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia insists that all its government agencies are
in compliance with rules designed to prevent the spread of
nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
There has been no breakthrough on the issue during Sharon's
visits to Moscow last month.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Cabinet Approves 1999 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese cabinet Wednesday
night endorsed the 1999 fiscal budget bill which sets the deficit
at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be submitted to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
The bill targets revenue for 1999 at 4,990 billion Lebanese
pounds (3.32 billion U.S. dollars), compared with 4,430 billion
pounds (2.95 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The spending was set at 8360 billion Lebanese pounds (about 5.5
billion dollars), compared with 7,186 billion pounds (4.79 billion
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Information Minister Anwar Khalil told reporters after
the cabinet session on Wednesday night that a new income tax
system would be imposed, replacing the existing flat rate of 10
percent. But, he didn't give any details of the system.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star Thursday quoted cabinet sources as saying the
government would introduce a 30 percent tax on alcoholic
beverages, tobacco and other non-essential commodities and increase
gasoline price by 2,000 pounds (1.3 dollars) per 20 liters.
</P>
<P>
However, customs duties on raw materials for industry were
lowered on a range of goods.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also decided to impose a 40 percent price hike on
celluar telephone calls, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese economy is undergoing a record recession since the end
of the 1975-1990 civil war with the public debts having hit 18
billion U.S. dollars, one of the highest in the world on per
capita basis.

<P>
NICOSIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States declined to take
a position on a Cypriot initiative for the release of three U.S.
soldiers captured by Yugoslav forces, the Cyprus News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our Ambassador in Greece and our Embassy in Cyprus are talking
to the relevant governments and we have been informed of their
intentions and we are not going to take a position on this,"
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin told the press.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' House of Representatives (parliament) Speaker Spyros
Kyprianou flew to Athens on Wednesday and is waiting for a safe
passage later Thursday to Belgrade, where he hopes to pick up the
three U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. is assisting by making arrangements so
that Kyprianou may fly to Belgrade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both Rubin and the White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart repeated
U.S. claims that there is no basis for holding the three soldiers
in the first place and they described their arrest as "illegal."
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that the soldiers were part of the troops
dispatched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as
potential peacekeeping troops to Kosovo once Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic accepts a peace deal with independence-seeking
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been bombing Serb targets since March 24 with a
claimed aim of stopping what the NATO said Milosevic's killing and
ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> New Island Emerges Off Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A new island has newly emerged
off the southwestern coast of Pakistan, the Pakistani Ministry of
Defense said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The island was first sighted by a local fisherman near River
Hingol's estuary 52 nautical miles (96 kilometers) east of Ormara,
a town in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The fisherman reported his discovery to the Pakistan Navy (PN)
in the third week of March, who then carried out a detailed survey
of the area around the island and named it "Jezira Malan."
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by a PN ship, "Behr Paima," showed that
the island is 220 meters in length, 175 meters in width and 25
meters in height, located 1.6 nautical miles (three kilometers)
from the coast.
</P>
<P>
The soil composition of the island appeared to be mud and brown
sand and some gaseous eruptions were observed on its eastern side
which might be indicative of hydrocarbon deposits in the area,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The sudden emergence of the island can be attributed to seismic
activities as the area between Ormara and Hingol is known to have
mud volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
The matter has been reported to the Pakistani government and
further investigations are in progress by concerned ministries
with full assistance from the PN, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Philippines President Drops Libel Case Against Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced Thursday his decision to drop a 100-million peso
(about 2.5 million U.S. dollar) libel case he filed against the
Manila Times.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a news release that he accepted the
public apology given by the family that owns the Manila Times, as
printed in the paper's front page Thursday under the column of the
paper's president Robina Gokongwei-Pe.
</P>
<P>
"I think that after the public apology, and I accept the
apology, the book is already closed," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The paper earlier publishing a report alleging that President
Estrada affected a 17-billion dollar deal between the National
Power Corp. and the Argentine firm IMPSA-Asia Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Gokongwei-Pe, owner the Manila Times, wrote in her column
entitled "From the Times President" that "I would like to extend
my sincerest apologies for the anxiety you felt from The Times
story published on February 16, 1999."
</P>
<P>
The article that appeared on the front page of the Manila Times
 became the subject of the libel charges filed against
Gokongwei-Pe along with the members of the company's board of
directors and the editorial board of the paper.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada filed the case on March 9, disgusted over
insinuations in the newspaper report that the Presidential Palace
inserted last-minute amendments to a power contract to favor an
Argentine firm.
</P>
<P>
The public apology, which was reportedly opposed by the
newspaper's editorial board, prompted all the editors of the
Manila Times to file their resignation effective April 22.

TUNIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Libya has appealed to foreign oil
companies to resume their activities in Libya after the United
Nations lifted sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Libyan daily Al Arab quotes Libyan Minister of

<HEADLINE> 7 Abduction Suspects Arrested in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Seven suspects including a reserve
sub-inspector of police were arrested by Sri Lanka's special
police team Wednesday in connection with the abduction of a
millionaire, police sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police also recovered over 17 million rupees
(242,857 U.S. dollars) from the possession of the suspects, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The millionaire, G. C. Wickremasinge, is former chairman of
Aitken Spence &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
He was abducted on the early morning of March 30 when he was on
his way to Colombo Golf links. Later the abductors demanded a
ransom of 20 million rupees (286,000 dollars) from his wife for
his release.
</P>
<P>
The ransom was paid the same night and the victim was released
the following morning.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came when police were tipped off by the
manager of the People's Bank Migallewa of Kurnegala that a sum of
290,000 rupees (4,142 dollars) all in one thousand rupee bills
bearing the identical serial numbers of the ransom money had been
deposited by a person, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Then the police team rushed to the bank and arrested the man,
the president of a farmers' organization, who deposited the money.
</P>
<P>
This led to the arrest of six others and police believed that
the reserve sub-inspector of police had led the group, the sources
added.

<P>
The country started a plan to treat the disease in 1982, and

HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The price of sugar has gone up by
20 percent with immediate effect, rural bus fares will go up by 28
percent Friday, the daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira
said Wednesday that the government had reached an agreement with
sugar producers for a 20-percent price hike.
</P>
<P>
The sugar industry had been pressing the government to award an
increase, saying local sugar was the lowest price in southern
Africa. The industry's export earnings had also dropped as a
result of a sharp fall in world prices, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to the increase because it wanted to
safeguard the jobs of thousands of people employed in sugar
estates, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern at the price of fertilizer which had
increased six times since February last year. The latest round of
increases was that of between 15 and 20 percent which took effect
last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said on Thursday that the NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia will continue methodically.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with France Inter radio station, Richard said
the proposal on unilateral cease-fire in Kosovo by Belgrade
indicated that the power of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
was beginning to "crack" in front of a "total deletion of his
military potential."
</P>
<P>
"We have destroyed in a great number the military
infrastructures, and the capacities of commanding" of the Yugoslav
forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the means of Yugoslav ground troops remained relatively
unattacked because of the presence of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister estimated that "progressive and controlled
steps in military strikes ... are the most rapid and most
efficient way" to achieve the goal of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is ... to give the people the right to live in
Kosovo in peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Malawi to Discuss Regional Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will send a
30-member delegation to attend a meeting in Malawi to discuss the
construction of the Mtwara Development Corridor, a key regional
trade link.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be chaired by Tanzania's Minister of Works,
Anna Abdallah, will make a proposal to lure investors to develop
the corridor, located in southern Tanzania border areas.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Works told Xinhua Thursday
that the minister will leave for Malawi to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Media sources said that the delegation will suggest hosting a
conference in November in Arusha, northern Tanzania, to attract
businessmen to invest in the corridor which will benefit Tanzania,
Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
After a state visit by the Malawi's President Bakili Muluzi to
Tanzania in January this year, developing the corridor, or
building a highway linking up the deep-water Mtwara Port in
southwestern Tanzania with the Mbamba Bay on Lake Nyasa in the
south, has been put on the agenda of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The corridor will be a shortcut for the transportation of goods
from the Indian Ocean to landlocked Malawi and Zambia. The project
is also expected to spur the economic development of the forgotten
areas in northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, shortage of funds has hampered the project.
Bureaucracy, poor infrastructure and inadequate facilities are
also cited as a snag to investors in the project.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials and business community from both
countries are expected to raise their concerns and explore ways to
address the problems during the Malawi meeting.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting on the Mtwara Development Corridor was held
in January this year in Tanzania where more than 100 delegates
from the two countries attended.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Registers for June Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
registered here Thursday for the June general election.
</P>
<P>
"Insya Allah (With God's permission), we have to succeed with
the general election by holding it fairly and justly," the
president told the press after the registration in the Kuningan
Timur village of South Jakarta, along with his wife, Hasri Ainun
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all eligible voters to use their voting
rights at the general election slated for June 7.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said, "All the eligible voters here should take the
benefit of it. This big nation has many times conducted the
general election. They are aware that (voting) is not only a right
(of every citizen) but also a duty."
</P>
<P>
The voter registration process, which has entered its fourth
day, is still relatively quiet as some of the regions have not
completed the establishment of its regional election organization
committee (ppd) and polling committee (pps), such as those in
Central Sulawesi, Central Java and East Timor, officials from the
General Election Commission (KPU) said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jakartans were seen queuing up at voter registration
points across the capital city on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The registration of voters for the forthcoming election
officially began last Monday (April 5) and will continue through
to May 4.
</P>
<P>
The voting right is restricted to citizens aged at least 17
years old, but those who are younger and married are also allowed
to vote.
</P>
<P>
To register, people must produce some form of identification,
such as identification cards, driver's license, marriage
certificate or school diploma.
</P>
<P>
KPU officials estimated that about 128 million of the 202
million population in the country are eligible voters in the June
election, touted as the first democratic poll in over three
decades.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Journalists help people get to
know more about the distant world and since China's reforms and
opening-up began two decades ago, more foreign journalists have
kept coming here to get a closer look, providing insights and
intriguing stories to introduce China.
</P>
<P>
They have told overseas readers about the vigor and vitality of
this rapidly-developing country. At the same time though, a large
number of Chinese journalists have gone outside China to give
Chinese readers a look beyond their borders.
</P>
<P>
One of the promoters of exchanges between Chinese and foreign
journalists has been the All-China Journalists Association (ACJA),
which has played a special role as a bridge, according to Liang
Guihe, member of its secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The ACJA had been closed down but resumed its work in 1980 and
has had exchanges with more than 100 countries, involving nearly 1,
000 groups and 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
This has continued to the present and is perhaps exemplified by
the on-going Press Seminar of China and ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) here, ACJA's first international
convention ever. It has pulled in delegates from 9 countries to
discuss making better use of the mass media for Asian economic
prosperity.

<P>
ACJA is trying to make China better known around the globe,
Liang explains. For instance, Greece sent a team of journalists,
the first of its kind, here last year. They were so amazed that
they responded by giving China full coverage back home, causing a
wave of interest in China. The Greek speaker of parliament called
for non-interference in other nation's internal affairs after
visiting Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In addition to giving better prospects to friendly media ties,
ACJA provides a source for information for smaller countries and
is significant in helping demonstrate the true nature of China,
Liang says, adding that, "ACJA has always tried to provide a free
and relaxing environment for overseas journalists."
</P>
<P>
More overseas journalists have come to understand the concept
of value of the Chinese, he says, and a large number of well-known
magazines like the US's National Geographic send journalists for
interviews every year. These influential publications are
generally more positive and objective in their coverage, Liang
says.

One journalist from Canada's Toronto Star, after seeing China
with his own eyes, said that making use of the negative side of
China by Western journalists is wrong and that he hopes to help
people understand China through his stories.
</P>
<P>
One free-lance journalist with the US's Philadelphia Inquirer
visited rural families on her own and congratulated the village on
its elections.
</P>
<P>
Through various exchanges and through cooperation, Chinese
members of the press have discussed press freedoms and the nature
of the press with their counterparts overseas. China shares a view
with the ASEAN countries that the press should serve society in a
positive way, Liang says.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges between journalists help enhance mutual understanding
and friendship. This year provides a special occasion for
journalists around the globe, on the 50th anniversary of New China
and the return of Macao and ACJA will, as usual, function as a
special venue for professional exchanges and friendly national
ties, Liang says.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Bank Credit Remains Tight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Although the Central Bank of the
Philippines lowered its key interest rates and the bellwether
91-day treasury bill rate went down to the pre-crisis level, the
country's bankers are still refraining from smiling at their
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
For the eighth time since the start of this year, the central
bank cut its overnight borrowing and lending rates this week by
another 12.5 basis points to 11.75 percent and 13.75 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been trying for the past three months to reduce
its rates to prod the country's banks into lending more to get the
economy moving.
</P>
<P>
The rate on the 91-day treasury bill, the benchmark banks use
to price their loans to borrowers, dropped by 29.7 basis points
last Monday to settle at 11.487 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the country's banks continue to gingerly approach the
prospect of more aggressive lending with official figures showing
that for January 1999, at least, bank credit remained weak as net
domestic credit fell 3.8 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Credit risk and credit worthiness of borrowers are the
buzzwords among bankers in the country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The slack credit growth was due partly to banks' reluctance to
take risks, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of non-performing loans of the country's banking
system climbed to 12.1 percent in January from 10.4 percent in
December and 11.8 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
As a precondition for renewed lending activities, banks will
have to liquidate their non-performing assets first, the analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Leonillo Coronel, executive director of the Bankers Association
of the Philippines, said the banks are also more concerned right
now over the quality of the loans they extend, instead of the
spreads.
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of credit quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many analysts said, there must be "an atmosphere of
credit worthiness" in the economy before banks respond to the
market conditions created by monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
The banks are still looking for more concrete signs of recovery
before they start lending aggressively, said Sergio Edeza, former
treasury director of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
With the Asian financial crisis still lingering, the country's
manufacturers, major potential borrowers, are not taking advantage
of the lower rates to tap the necessary capital to expand their
businesses and increase production, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the automobile and appliance industries were among
the hardest hit by the crisis and lending to these sectors is
still bound to be weak, they said.
</P>
<P>
The reason, they said, is that the expected rebound in consumer
demand may not be large enough.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1997, loan growth in the country outpaced the
growth of gross domestic product (GDP) by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
But loan portfolio growth of the commercial banks is expected
to post flat to marginal increases this year, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be anywhere from flat to low growth in 1999," said
April Lee of CitiSecurities.
</P>
<P>
"The most optimistic scenario among the banks we talked to was
a 10-percent loan growth," she said. "But that's optimistic."
</P>
<P>
The analysts believed that the long-awaited trend reversal of
credit will come after 2000, possibly in 2001 along with higher
GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
"Banking is a lag sector," said Worldsec Securities research
head Erico Claudio. "That means the economy has to improve first
before we see any improvement in banks."

<HEADLINE> Israel's Residency Revoking Policy Fails: Husseini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's policy of revoking the
residency status of Palestinians who were born in Jerusalem but
live outside the city has failed, said a senior Palestinian
official.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Minister in Charge of Jerusalem Affairs of
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), was quoted on Thursday
by the local daily Ha'aretz as saying the policy has actually
attracted back to the city a large number of Palestinians for fear
of losing their residency rights.
</P>
<P>
Before 1995, Husseini said, when Israel began to revoke
the residency rights of hundreds of Palestinians each year,
there were about 180,000 Palestinians in the city, and today
the number has climbed to about 215,000.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that about 6,000 new Palestinian housing units
have been erected in East Jerusalem in the past three year in
response to the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
Until 1995, Israel allowed Palestinians to retain their
permanent resident status in Jerusalem as long as they did
not live abroad for more than seven years and returned
periodically to the city.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, Israel abruptly changed its policy, and many
Palestinians had their identity cards revoked and were forced to
leave the city.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Israeli Interior Ministry has denied
permanent status to Palestinians who have been forced to move
to the city's suburbs because of lack of housing in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, as well as the National Insurance Institute,
denied these Palestinians the rights to live in the holy city on
grounds that their "center of life" had changed to another town,
even if members of their family still live in Jerusalem and their
children study there.
</P>
<P>
The residency status of some 788 Palestinians were revoked in
1998, 606 in 1997, 189 in 1996 and 96 in 1995, according to
Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli and 14 Palestinian human rights organizations
last year petitioned the High Court of Justice over the issue
of revoked residency permits for Palestinians. The Court is
scheduled to discuss the issue on April 22.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs Of Macao SAR Basic Law (17) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- This is the 17th in a question and
answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can the Central People's Government station troops in the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
Article 14 of the Basic Law of Macao says that the Central
People's Government is responsible for MSAR's defense. The Hong
Kong Basic Law provides for the stationing of troops in Hong Kong
but there is no such provision in the Macao Basic Law. But, the
answer to the question about whether the Central People's
Government will have power to station troops in the Macao Special
Administrative Region is a definite yes.
</P>
<P>
Defense is a general concept and troops are used for defense.
Because the Basic Law already says that the Central People's
Government is responsible for the defense of the MSAR, the
stationing of troops there is something the Central Government
decides in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
On September 18, 1998, Qian Qichen, Chairman of the MSAR
Preparatory Committee, said at the Committee's Third Plenary
Meeting that, in accordance with Article 14 of the Basic Law, that
the Central People's Government finds it necessary to station an
appropriate number of well trained troops in the MSAR as a symbol
of its exercise of sovereignty over Macao and to ensure social
stability and development there.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has officially informed the Portuguese
Government of its decision. On September 19, at the closing
session of the Third Pleanry Meeting, Qian emphasized that the
troops stationed there will be responsible for defense only and
will not intervene in the internal affairs of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The expense of maintaining them will be covered by the Central
People's Government, whose decision to station them there conforms
with the Basic Law and expresses China's sovereignty over Macao
and is in the interest of the people in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Manila Forms Committee to Implement Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to bring lasting peace to
the country, Philippine President Joseph Estrada has created a
high-level committee to help ensure the full implementation of the
peace agreement forged with the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Under Administrative Order No. 63, the president created the
Cabinet Supervisory Committee to address executive issues and
concerns involving the implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora will head the supervisory
committee, with former Ambassador Manuel Yan, presidential adviser
on the peace process, as vice chairman, the Philippine News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the administrative order, the committee would provide a
more "focused and more effective direction and supervision" in the
implementation of the peace agreement signed between the
government and the MNLF on September 2, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the committee include the secretaries of the
Departments of National Defense, Public Works and Highways,
Agriculture, Budget and Management, and Transportation and
Communication.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 peace agreement calls for the establishment of a
Special Zone of Peace and Development (SZOPAD) and the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development in Mindanao.
President Estrada said the accord "signaled the end of decades of
strifes and hostilities" between the government and the MNLF and
"brought hopes to improve the conditions of the Muslim people in
the Southern Philippines"
</P>
<P>
According to the order, the committee will "monitor, in
coordination with concerned agencies, the implementation of
various peace and development projects being undertaken in the
SZOPAD."
</P>
<P>
The committee is also tasked to "address the problems that
hinder the effective implementation of the peace accord," the
order said

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Seek Stronger Ties With Gulf States: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said Thursday night that his country would seek further ties with
the Arab states in the Gulf, a traditional stronghold for
Jordanian labor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Jordan TV following his return from a three-day
visit to Saudi Arabia, the monarch said his talks with Saudi
leaders focused on further developing bilateral ties and
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he hopes to see further strengthening of
relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states,
but he denied a report that Jordan is seeking to join the
six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where that (report) came from. I think we just
need to leave that gossip at this stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The king was referring to a report by the London-based
newspaper Al Quds Al Arabi which said Monday Abdullah would
officially inform Saudi officials of Jordan's desire to join the
GCC later this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted senior Arab sources as saying that Saudi
Arabia had initially agreed to Jordan's request.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, founded in 1981 to boost regional cooperation, now
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Riyadh is part of his efforts to rally
support in the Gulf states for the stagnant economy of his desert
kingdom, and he is also expected to visit Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates later this month.
</P>
<P>
His visits to the Gulf states are aimed at amending ties which
sifted during the 1990 Gulf Crisis as a result of Jordan's
sympathy with Iraq after the latter invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf states have been the largest market for Jordanian
labor export, which is one of the three pillars of its national
economy along with foreign aid and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials expressed the hope that Abdullah's
just-concluded visit to Riyadh will help reopen the Gulf labor
market for Jordan which was badly affected by the Gulf Crisis.

The defense minister, who returned from Tajikstan Wednesday,

<HEADLINE> U.S.: "No Position" on Cypriot Mediation Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States declined to take
a position on a Cypriot initiative for the release of three U.S.
soldiers captured by Yugoslav forces, the Cyprus News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our Ambassador in Greece and our Embassy in Cyprus are talking
to the relevant governments and we have been informed of their
intentions and we are not going to take a position on this,"
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin told the press.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' House of Representatives (parliament) Speaker Spyros
Kyprianou flew to Athens on Wednesday and is waiting for a safe
passage later Thursday to Belgrade, where he hopes to pick up the
three U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. is assisting by making arrangements so
that Kyprianou may fly to Belgrade on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both Rubin and the White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart repeated
U.S. claims that there is no basis for holding the three soldiers
in the first place and they described their arrest as "illegal."
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that the soldiers were part of the troops
dispatched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as
potential peacekeeping troops to Kosovo once Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic accepts a peace deal with independence-seeking
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been bombing Serb targets since March 24 with a
claimed aim of stopping what the NATO said Milosevic's killing and
ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.

HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy, which hit low
levels toward the end of last year, appears to be continuing on
another bumpy ride this year, economists have said.

In an interview, President of Zimbabwe Economic Society Kennias

He said the 50 percent inflation level, which the economy was

macro-economic stability."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Constitution Not to be Changed: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian constitution will not be
altered in 2001 to pave way for one presidential candidate,
Information and Broadcasting Services minister, Newstead Zimba has
said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Thursday quoted Zimba, who is also
chief government spokesman, as saying the candidature in the 2001
presidential and general elections will be dependent on the
constitution and that candidates who will not qualify will not
contest.
</P>
<P>
Zambian main opposition party, United National Independence
Party (UNIP) national chairman, Malimab Masheke, told the press
Sunday that his party would fight the Zambian constitution "tooth
and nail" to pave way for its leader, former president Kenneth
Kaunda, to contest the 2001 polls.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said in an interview in Lusaka Wednesday that there had
been a chain of commissions interviewing Zambians country-wide
about who they thought should be eligible to stand as president.
</P>
<P>
He charged that no one was born to rule this country and that
there must be time when leaders defeated in polls or
constitutionally should not continue using other fora to make
unnecessary claims.
</P>
<P>
UNIP information and publicity secretary, Bweendo Mulengela,
had declared that its presidential candidate in the 2001 elections
would be Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda had been ruling the country since its independence in
1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by current President
Frederick Chiluba. He was barred from running for the country's
presidency during the 1996 elections, when a constitutional
amendment was adopted under which foreign nationals and those with
foreign parentage are prohibited from contesting the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next elections
after Ndola High Court declared him stateless at the start of the
month.
</P>
<P>
Zimba emphasized that the government was following the will of
Zambians who had spoken through the past commissions and indicated
that they would not allow themselves to be enslaved.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Tells Graduates to Seek Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has suggested local university graduates to seek jobs abroad
because Kenyan labor market could no longer guarantee employment
for all.
</P>
<P>
Moi told local graduates Wednesday to "be open-minded and
strive not only for paid jobs, but more importantly, for
self-employment", the East African Standard reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our country has continued to experience severe difficulties
which have reduced the capacity of the economy to create adequate
employment opportunities for the large number of people who join
the labor market each year, " Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at at the graduation ceremony of the Jomo Kenyatta
University of Agriculture and Technology, Moi said he was
delighted to encounter more than 300 Kenyan medical doctors
during his recent visit to Botswana, a southern African country.
</P>
<P>
He said that even in Namibia and South Africa, there were
plenty of job opportunities for Kenyan university graduates and
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has suffered low annual economic growth rate since 1997.
The growth rate was 2.3 percent in 1997 and 1.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The president also warned politicians to guard against
misleading Kenyans into believing that money provided by the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was for free.

<HEADLINE> China is Capable of Increasing Grain Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China still has the potential to
increase its grain supply, and the country plans to raise grain
production through modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Agriculture official said that great differences
exist between unit grain output per hectare in various areas,
ranging from 3,000 kilograms to 15,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the grain production target can be reached if the
unit output grows by 1 percent annually, and that unit grain
output rose by 3.1 percent on an annual basis from 1950 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 35 million hectares of wasteland that can
be used for farming purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology now contributes only 42 percent to
China's grain production, lagging far behind developed countries,
and therefore the country will increase efforts to install agro-
technology nationwide, he said.

<P>
The bill will be submitted to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
The bill targets revenue for 1999 at 4,990 billion Lebanese

pounds (2.95 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australians Lose US$7 Billion on Gambling Yearly: ABS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Australians lost a record 11
billion Australian dollars (6.93 billion U.S. dollars) on gambling
in the financial year of 1997-1998, delivering a fat increase in
profits for the industry's owners.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented 595 Australian dollars (374 U.S.
dollars) for every man, woman and child in the country over the
year with a population of 18 million, according to the figures
released here Thursday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS).
</P>
<P>
The 11 billion Australian dollars amounted to 2 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, or more than what was spent on
the other great vices, alcohol and tobacco, combined. Or in even
starker terms, for every dollar Australian households spent on
food in the past financial year, they lost 27 cents gambling.
</P>
<P>
The losses in the past financial year were a massive 40 percent
higher than the 7.8 billion Australian dollars (4.9 billion U.S.
dollars) lost in the financial year of 1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
Some of the biggest winners from the increase in gambling have
been pub owners. They more than doubled their profit margins from
gaming activities over the three years, the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
It said pubs, taverns and bars with gambling facilities enjoyed
an operating profit margin of 8.6 percent in the past financial
year ending on June 30, 1998, more than double the 3.9-percent
margin they took in the 1994-1995 year.
</P>
<P>
The huge increase in margins helped spread poker machines into
more pubs. The ABS noted a 20-percent rise in the number of pubs
with gambling facilities to 2,785 at the end of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Poker machines remained Australia's most popular form of
gambling and actually boosted their share of the industry's
takings to 4 billion U.S. dollars, or 57.6 percent, up from 2.4
billion U.S. dollars, or 50.5 percent in the 1994-1995 year.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state, of which Sydney is the capital, remained
the biggest gambling state although neighboring state Victoria, of
which Melbourne is the capital, rapidly gained ground over the
three-year period and was growing the fastest in terms of takings.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Creates Gardens for World Horticulture Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
prepared two gardens, the Qilu Garden and the Peony Garden, for
the upcoming '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government spokesman said Shandong will be the
only Chinese province with two outdoor exhibition areas.
</P>
<P>
The exposition will be held in Kunming, capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province, between May 1-October 31 and is expected
to attract participants from 93 countries and international
organizations. Some 10 million people from China and abroad are
expected to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
The Qilu Garden, which covers an area of 1,720 square meters,
feature Mount Taishan, the Baotu Springs, and Confucian culture.
In addition to some 2,100 ornamental plants from the province, the
garden has dozens of carved stones and tablets with inscriptions
depicting the province's major scenic spots and historic sites, as
well as historical figures.
</P>
<P>
The 900-square-meter Peony Garden exhibits around 500 different
kinds of peonies from the city of Heze in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Heze, dubbed the "home of peonies," grows hundreds of kinds of
peonies on more than 600 hectares of land each year, and is the
world's largest peony producing and export center.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Starts Major Environmental Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has launched an ambitious environmental project to clean up all
the waters and afforest all the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's devastating floods in many parts of China,
which killed 3,004 people and brought more than 200 billion yuan
in losses, the central government has given top priority to
environmental and ecological programs. Land erosion has been
identified as a major cause for the devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is a mountainous area and has been included in a state
program to curb severe soil erosion along the Yangtze River.
Surveys have discovered that 37 percent of all the land in the
province is now suffering from serious erosion.
</P>
<P>
Under this new program, local people will further transform
cultivated lands, plant trees and grass, build small water
conservancy projects, and carry out other ecological projects.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, six billion yuan has been spent
by the province to curb soil erosion over the past decade, during
which more than 400,000 projects have been implemented to control
erosion over an area of 22,000 square kilometers.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post,
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday
distanced himself from the remarks of Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon on the future of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has warned against creating an independent state in
Kosovo, saying it could turn into an international base for
Islamic terror activities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Sharon was talking about long-term issues which
are not relevant to and do not reflect current Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz,
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will head to Russia
next week for his third trip to Moscow in less than a month.
Sharon's trip will include talks with his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov. The issue of Russian transfer of technology to Iran is
expected to be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot,
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on
Wednesday that Israel will take in 100 non-Jewish refugees from
Kosovo. Netanyahu said that Israel felt compelled to make the
humanitarian gesture because of the painful memories of the
Holocaust. He said that the refugees will be able to stay in
Israel for six month, after which they can decide for themselves
whether to remain here or not.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sri Lanka Faces Uncertain Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is facing an uncertain
political future as the ruling People's Alliance (PA) narrowly won
the polls at the five crucial provincial council elections,
analysts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The PA of President Chandrika Kumaratunga gained all the five
councils at stake in the polls on Tuesday, four of which were held
formerly by the main opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition party allegations of election violence and
violations, the PA victory in holding Western Province and
additionally winning Central, North Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa
provinces is considered significant.
</P>
<P>
The historic victory is considered a personal triumph for
President Kumaratunga and an overwhelming endorsement of her
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The victory also showed that the UNP has not been accepted by
the country as an alternative government.
</P>
<P>
However, the PA's margin of victory against the UNP was
extremely thin.
</P>
<P>
Overall in the five provinces the PA obtained 46.25 percent or
2,105,546 votes against the UNP's 43.48 percent or 1,979,546
votes, giving the PA a majority of 2.27 percent or 126,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition won 120 out of the 263 seats while the UNP
got 112. The remaining went to smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
The PA got enough seats to form the administration on its own
only in North Central Province. It will have to depend on Tamil
and Muslim parties' support for forming the administration in the
four provinces of Western, Uva, Central and Sabaragamuwa.
</P>
<P>
In the 1994 presidential elections, the PA won a convincing 62
percent of the votes. But the highest percentage received by the
ruling party in Tuesday's voting was 53 percent in one province.
</P>
<P>
In the most populous Colombo district, the ruling party
garnered a mere 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the ruling party is losing momentum as President
Kumaratunga's early promises to end Sri Lanka's civil war remain
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Given the decline in popularity, the ruling party may feel
hesitant about advancing the parliamentary and presidential
elections due next year.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the tight results showed that neither party
has immediate answers to the difficult problems Sri Lanka faces
such as a slowing economy and the 16-year war against the
separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's gross domestic product expanded by a strong 6.4
percent in 1997. It is estimated to have grown by only 4 to 4.5
percent in 1998 and officials have forecast lower economic growth
rates for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels have been fighting
the Sri Lankan government for a separate Tamil homeland in the
country's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The UNP improved on their 1997 performance in local government
elections and appeared to have won the minority Tamil and Muslim
votes in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Colombo, the UNP won overwhelmingly in areas
where the minority Tamils are predominant, indicating the
minorities had swung from the ruling PA.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNP, which ruled the country for 17 continuous
years from 1977, has been accused of bribery, corruption and being
responsible for the disappearance of thousands of persons during
its rule. And it has found it difficult to fend off these
accusations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, its current leadership is faced with serious
differences within the party itself which has damaged its image
among the public.
</P>
<P>
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), or People's Liberation
Front, gained 5.46 percent of votes or 15 seats, emerging as the
third largest party in the country.
</P>
<P>
The JVP, which was responsible for the youth uprising of the
early 1970s and the subsequent period of terror in the late 1980s,
has made a significant breakthrough into the mainstream of
politics in the five provinces.
</P>
<P>
While it was expected to have performed better, observers
believe that it has still not been able to impress on the country
that it is no longer seeking an armed rebellion but a place in the
administration through democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the emerging JVP, the main battle is still being fought
between the PA and UNP in the parliamentary and presidential
elections due next year. But it is too early to say which party
will gain the upper hand as the civil war is dragging on and the
economy is slowing down.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends Policy of Engagement With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday warned against a "campaign-driven cold war" with China
and vowed his administration will continue its efforts to engage
rather than confront the reform-oriented Asian country which
envisages a promising future in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks in a foreign policy address to a
gathering sponsored by the U.S. Institute for Peace here at the
Renaissance Mayflower Hotel just before Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
flew in this afternoon to continue his eight-day official visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"As the next presidential election approaches, we cannot allow
a healthy argument to lead us toward a campaign-driven Cold War
with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a cold war would have tragic consequences: "
an America riven by mistrust and bitter accusations, an end to
diplomatic contacts that have produced tangible gains for our
people, a climate of mistrust that hurts Chinese Americans and
undermines the exchanges that are opening China to the world."
</P>
<P>
Some Republican Congressmen and newspapers have whipped up an
anti-China propaganda recently, accusing China of "stealing U.S.
nuclear secrets."
</P>
<P>
The accusation, denounced by China as "groundless" and "
fabrication", was seen by many Americans as dirty party politics
that usually get fueled up as presidential campaign takes to a
heat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president called on the American people, policy makers
and politicians not to "lose sight of the larger interests we have
in seeing that this very great country has the maximum possible
chance to emerge a more stable, freer, more prosperous, more
constructive partner with the United States in the new century."
</P>
<P>
"In the last 20 years China has made incredible progress - in
building a new economy, lifting more than 200 million people out
of absolute poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing problems and challenges China faces today, Clinton said
the solutions to these issues" lie in the choices China makes,"
and the United States has an interest in "seeking to make a
difference" in the country through the policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do that simply by confronting China or trying to
contain her. We can only deal with the challenge if we continue a
policy of principled, purposeful engagement with China's leaders
and China's people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed the need to integrate China into the World
Trade Organization "on clearly acceptable commercial terms."
</P>
<P>
"Getting this done, and getting it done right, is profoundly in
our national interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States also has an interest in cooperating with
China on environmental protection issues, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working with China on a study of emissions
trading -- a tool that has cut pollution at low cost in the United
States and which could do the same for China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Farmers Earning More Than Others In Rural China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Farmers on the outskirts of
Shanghai continued to lead farmers in other parts of the country
last year in earnings.
</P>
<P>
Per capita annual incomes of Shanghai farmers were 5,400 yuan
in 1998, up 2.5 percent from 1997, according to the Shanghai Rural
Social and Economic Survey Team.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the rapid development of township
enterprises and a rural service industry that provide work for
about 70 percent of the local farmers. Non-farming incomes account
for 71.6 percent of their total earnings, a 0.8 percentage point
increase from 1998. Farming-related incomes fell 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth in annual incomes slowed to a record low in
recent years, according to Cheng Ying, a member of the survey team,
which studied 600 households, where 44 percent were earning less
than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Expects Mild Economic Recovery in the Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United Nations
has expected the 1999 will see a mild economic recovery in the
ESCAP region.
</P>
<P>
In its Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 1999
released here Thursday, ESCAP said that barring any further shocks
in the financial markets, some positive development will generate
a mild recovery in the region towards the latter part of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, ESCAP gave a forecast of 3.6 percent GDP growth
of the developing economies of the ESCAP region in 1999, with a
5.6 percent-growth forecast for South and South-West Asia, 0.4
percent for South-East Asia and 4.4 percent for East and
North-East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating the survey at a press conference this morning on
behalf of the ESCAP, Tan Song Chuan, Managing Director of the
Singapore Trade Development Board Consulting (STDBC) said the
worst is over for the region with Thailand and South Korea leading
recovery and Malaysia a step behind.
</P>
<P>
However, ESCAP noted that there are concerns regarding the
sustainability of the improvement in the light of only limited
progress in financial sector restructuring, the continued credit
crunch, the still growing burden of non-performing loans and no
major recovery of exports.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the growth performance in the ESCAP region, ESCAP
said GDP growth rate of developing economies of the ESCAP region
dropped to 0.2 percent in 1998 from 5.8 percent in 1997 with
South-East Asia experiencing one of the worst years on record .
</P>
<P>
Out of 19 developing countries of mainland Asia, seven suffered
negative growth in 1998 compared to none in 1996 and only one in
1997, it said, adding a number of countries are experiencing
severe social problems in the form of mounting unemployment,
increased incidence of poverty, sharp dropouts of school students
and large cut in consumption of health services.
</P>
<P>
On recent positive developments. ESCAP highlighted a downturn
trend in interest rates, recovery and stabilization in exchange
rates and stock markets, increase in foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
On global economic environment, ESCAP said growth rate in world
economy fell to 1.7 percent in 1998 compared to 3.2 percent in
1997. and trade growth in volume terms declined even more
precipitately, from 9.7 percent in 1997 to 3.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP underlined that a number of development in world economy
have adverse implication for the ESCAP region, referring to weak
state of Japan economy, the possible slowdown in EU and the likely
flattening of growth in the U.S. economy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP also drew attention to a major uncertainty in the behavior
of capital flows, saying "world financial market have displayed
increased volatility, commodity prices have weakened and
international capital flows to developing countries, especially
debt flows, have declined."
</P>
<P>
New developments suggest that non-FDI (foreign direct
investment) private capital is not likely to start flowing into
the region soon on any substantial scale and FDI flows may remain
concentrated in acquisitions of existing assets rather than
creating new production capacity, ESCAP noted.
</P>
<P>
On measures to be taken to ensure a recovery, ESCAP said
policies at the national, regional and international levels are
needed to overcome the problems created by the economic crisis as
government's ability to address social problems has been
constrained by reduced revenues and, in some cases, by the
conditionalities of the bailout packages.
</P>
<P>
Consideration needs to be given to reforming the international
architecture and intensifying regional cooperation, including
consideration of the establishment, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pork Prices Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua)-- Pork prices have been in a downward
spiral since the beginning of the year, causing severe losses to
pig farms, according to a Ministry of Agriculture survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in 400 counties, found that, in March,
piglet prices fell by an annual rate of 50 percent and pork fell
21.8 percent to 6.42 yuan per kilo and 9.9 yuan per kilo
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This cost farmers about 100 yuan more per pig. Sales of breeder
pigs were down by more than half even at prices that were down
more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the sharp price decline to an excess of pork.
</P>
<P>
Pigs were at their most profitable level in 1997, but the
aggressive expansion of pig raising and increased pork output have
been met with shrinking market demand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that increased beef, mutton, and poultry output
has eaten into the pork market. The three items grew from 20.2
percent of the meat market in 1990 to 32.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Consumer incomes have had slower growth as well, and the high-
income consumers are tending to buy more vegetables, eggs, and
milk while low-income people are spending less on meat.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this trend, the ministry recently called a meeting
of officials from Shandong, Sichuan, and other pork-producing
provinces for a strategy discussion. As a solution, it says it has
decided to break up the monopoly on pork production and sales and
try to create a more natural market that allows for a smoother
flow of information and sales that respond purely to market demand.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry plans to come down hard on charges
and illicit fees levied on farmers and will make a greater effort
to promote pork processing.

<HEADLINE> South China Tiger In Shanghai Has Three Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A 4-year-old South China tiger
has given birth to three cubs at the Shanghai Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The mother's milk was insufficient to care for the cubs and in
less than three days she left them to the care of zookeeper Gu
Wenyang who has been working at the Shanghai Zoo for more than 30
years.
</P>
<P>
The cubs now get four meals a day with 55 milliliters of
powdered milk and to protect them from the changeable weather, the
room temperature is set at 27 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The eldest cub, a male, weighed 1,500 grams at birth, the
second, 1,350 grams, and the third, 1,250. Half a month of growth
has added 50 grams each to their weight.
</P>
<P>
But zoo workers are worried about inbreeding among South China
tigers, resulting from the decrease in numbers of the rare species.
There are 53 South China tigers at 21 zoos in China.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger has a life span of 18 to 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Mia Audina Warned by Indonesian Badminton Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) issued a warning letter to former world women's
number one Mia Audina, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PBSI sent the letter to the ace shuttler Mia on April 7 for
undisciplined behavior. This is the first time in history for the
national badminton's ruling body issued a warning letter to its
players.
</P>
<P>
PBSI chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo said that he had yet to
decide on a sanction for the 19-year-old shuttler and would wait
for her to return from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Coach Liang Chiusia said earlier that Mia had asked for
permission to stay in the Netherlands after competing in the All
England championships to marry Surinamese boyfriend Tylio Lobman
last month.
</P>
<P>
But PBSI deputy in charge of athletes development Hadi Nasri
denied the allegation, saying Mia did not ask for permission prior
to her departure for the All England.
</P>
<P>
"She didn't say a word to officials here. She just said to her
coach that she would get married. If she had asked for permission,
we wouldn't have said no," he said.
</P>
<P>
With only a month to go to the Sudirman Cup and the World
Championships in Copenhagen next month, Mia has yet to show up at
the National Badminton Center in Cipayung, East Jakarta, for
training.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said PBSI had yet to name the team members for the
Sudirman Cup and still had no idea whether Mia would be ready to
compete in two major events in two consecutive weeks.
</P>
<P>
He also said PBSI would still observe Mia's form in several
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"If she doesn't show any commitment to the sport and has poor
form,there's nothing else we can do but have her sent out of the
center," he said.

<HEADLINE> Plastic Sheeting Help Fight Drought In Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Hu Shanmin, a farmer in Fuping
County in China's Shaanxi Province, says that the green wheat
sprouts in his field are a miracle at a time when people are
worrying about withered crops during the long period of drought.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi had suffered from drought since last October.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Hu says that his seedlings would have withered
if he hadn't used plastic sheeting. He expects to have a good
harvest this year as one of the farmers who have benefited from
the new technology, which has been applied to 147,000 ha of
farmland in the province since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Per-ha. grain output of the province was increased by about 1,
500 kg. and 1,200 cubic meters of water was saved when the plastic
sheeting started being used to protect crops and retain moisture.
</P>
<P>
The technology has been welcomed by farmers on China's loess
plateau. In 1998, the provincial government offered 75 million
yuan in loans to help apply the technology to 130,000 ha. of
farmland. That is expected to reach 270,000 ha. next year.

LANZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight people accused of illegal
logging who attacked forest rangers when they were challenged in
Minxian County in northwest China's Gansu Province have been
sentenced to various prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The longest was for 6 years. Another person caught who was
below the age of 16 was released.

they tried to persuade the villagers not to cut trees. Five police
cars were also damaged during the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The county's procurator department investigated the case and
charged 9 of them with interfering with law enforcement and
inciting violence.
</P>

The provincial government introduced last October a ban on the
cutting of trees and closed down 30 lumber companies and outlets
to improve the condition of forest areas.

<HEADLINE> IMF Asks Manila to Pay at Once Ramos Obligations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has asked the Philippine government to immediately pay 68
billion pesos (1 U.S. dollar is equal to about 40 pesos) in
obligations left behind by the previous Ramos administration,
warning that delays in settling the unpaid accounts will hurt the
country's credit rating abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times reported Thursday that the IMF also urged the
Estrada administration to avoid piling up similar obligations,
which are mostly owed to contractors undertaking government
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Members of a visiting IMF team raised the issue Wednesday,
right at the start of their two-week review of the country's
economic performance for the first quarter of the year, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure-oriented Ramos administration left behind
108 billion pesos in unpaid accounts owed to contractors. The
Estrada administration, which took over last June 30, has so far
settled only 40 billion.
</P>
<P>
While the IMF officials acknowledged that the financial crisis
was partly to blame for the accumulation of the accounts payable
under the Ramos administration, they nevertheless pointed out that
it must also be due to some "systemic problems" caused by weak
revenues and the propensity to borrow.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Fails to Reach Paddy Production Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The paddy production of Myanmar
reached over 17 million tons annually in the last few years
beginning 1996-97 fiscal year against the annual target set at 20
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"The targets could not be realized as expected. Obstacles are
being faced in developing the agricultural sector as it is at
large and related with many other sectors," Myanmar leader Senior
General Than Shwe was quoted by Thursday's official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, various means are being sought in developing the
sector as projected," Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State
peace and Development Council, told officials of three divisions
Tuesday on his inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
He added that invitations have been extended to national
entrepreneurs who have capital and expertise to effectively and
fully use the nation's land resources as the new force.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year when the government started
allowing private entrepreneurs to reclaim vacant, virgin, fallow
and wetlands in the country, a total of 467,370 hectares of such
lands in six divisions and states have been reclaimed to cultivate
crops to boost the country's agriculture products.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's paddy production
has been dropping steadily in the past few years, falling from 19
million tons in 1995-96 to 17.66 million tons in 1996-97 and again
to 17.3 million tons in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic products (GDP) and 35 percent of the export in value,
grew by 2.9 percent in output value in 1997-98 against the target
of 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The national GDP rose by 4.6 percent in the year against the
target of 6.4 percent.
</P>

The figures for 1998-99 which ended March have not yet been

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Rejects No-confidence Motion Against Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian parliament rejected
the no-confidence motion by the opposition against the
government's reform of the national industrial structure by a vote
of 139 to 87 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The motion was put to the vote in the presence of Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov who had cut short a visit to Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
On the open ballot, the motion was rejected by the Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF) and the Popular Union, which were joined
by Arlin Antonov of the Alliance for National Salvation (ANS) and
independents Hristo Ivanov and Hristo Petrov. It was backed by the
Socialist-dominated Democratic Left, the Euro-Left and 15 MPs of
the ANS.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the weaknesses, mistakes and delay of reform
in some sectors, but it is not a reason to stop at this point,"
the prime minister told the MPs after the vote. He thanked the
parliamentary majority and independents for the trust they had put
on the government, adding that the vote had made the cabinet feel
stronger and more confident in what it is doing.
</P>
<P>
"This day was a success for Georgi Purvanov, the leader of the
opposition Socialist party, because he managed to close the circle
and to lead the Socialist party throughout the vote without having
to admit the failure of the economic policy of the party," said
Kostov.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the leaders of the Euro-Left and the ANS,
Alexander Tomov and Ahmed Dogan, have been used to covering up the
failures of the Socialist party.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament, Georgi Purvanov said the country
needs a new policy and a new team to implement it. In his view,
the vote foretold the "death" of the reformist majority,
consolidation of the opposition, and retailoring of parliamentary
space.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to share the responsibility for the policy of
liquidation, which we do not support," Dimiter Loudjev said on
behalf of the ANS. He warned that social peace in the country is
in jeopardy and stressed the role of the Movement for Rights and
Freedoms in preserving ethnic peace in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
This vote ushered in a new political model. The opposition put
the beginning of a powerful national movement of versatile
composition, said Euro-Left's Alexander Tomov. He said the
government is pursuing a wrong macroeconomic policy and the key
mechanisms of the currency board are at risk.
</P>
<P>
UDF floor leader Ekaterina Mihailova said the opposition used
the motion ahead of local elections to conceal the difficult days
that are in store for Bulgaria. She asked whether those, who want
a new policy and a new government team, have the courage and a
program to face the voters.
</P>
<P>
The ruling majority is aware of what is in store for it. It is
the most unpopular step of the structural reform, but they will
not escape their responsibility, she said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's War Veterans Protest Against NATO's Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam War Veterans'
Association (VWVA) have voiced strong protests against NATO's
military escalation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
demanded end to bombing of Yugoslavia, Vietnam's English daily
Vietnam News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5 million-member association said in a statement issued
recently that all war veterans in Vietnam fully support the just
struggle and determination by the Yugoslav people against
aggressive acts for national independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The association said NATO's brutal air attacks against
Yugoslavia's territory including Belgrade had caused heavy losses
and serious consequences for the population, particularly women
and children, created a movement of refugees, complicated the
Kosovo problem, and jeopardized peace and stability in the Balkans
regions, Europe, as well as the world.
</P>
<P>
By launching military attacks, the VWVA said, NATO and the
United States have seriously violated the U.N. Charter and
international law, and created a dangerous precedent in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The VWVA also fully supported the Vietnam's Foreign Ministry's
March 25 statement, and the search for a long-term peaceful
solution for the Kosovo problem so as to bring peace to
Yugoslavian people to rebuild their country.

<HEADLINE> European Nations Offer Aid to Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 VIENNA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Some European countries have
offered aid to the Kosovo refugees, including food, medicine, and
materials for building camps to shelter tens of thousands living
in overcrowded conditions in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Austria on Wednesday approved a plan offering about 40 million
U.S. dollars to set up an Austrian camp in Albania to shelter the
Kosovo refugees. The government has also decided to take 5,000
refugees into Austria.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has reportedly shipped 50 tons of aid which includes
food, medicine and carpets to refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians are being forced by Serbians to flee Kosovo
in large numbers. The NATO alliance started bombing Yugoslavia 13
days ago to force Yugoslavia to agree to a peace plan for Kosovo,
where the majority of the population is Albanian.
</P>
<P>
 Sweden has also sent a 30-vehicle convoy of humanitarian aid
Monday to the Kosovo refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Italian government is planning to build camps
in Albania to house about 25,000 Kosovo refugees, said a press
release by the Ylberi Coordination Center.
</P>
<P>
The Center was formed by representatives of the Italian
Embassy, the Special Diplomatic Delegation, the Delegation of
Experts, the Interforze Delegation of Italian Police and Civil
Defense.
</P>
<P>
The Center will set up an army field hospital before April 9,
in which 100 patients can simultaneously receive medical treatment,
said the press.

<HEADLINE> Exports Between ALADI Countries Fell 5.5 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, exports from ALADI member countries fell 1.5
percent, from 211.91 billion dollars in 1997, to 208.64 billion
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Global external sales of member states were reduced from 257.42
billion dollars in 1997, to 251.65 billion dollars in 1998, which
represents a reduction of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inter-regional imports registered a slight fall of 0.8 percent,
from 46.47 billion dollars in 1997 to 46.12 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Global imports of ALADI members were 289.02 billion dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary said the causes of the variations in
inter-regional commerce were attributed to a strong fall in
international prices of diverse manufactured products and raw
materials, and from consequences of the financial crisis of Asia
and Russia, and included natural disasters which affected some of
the ALADI countries.
</P>
<P>
Rojas said the economic growth of Latin American countries had
been reduced from more than 5 percent in 1998 to less than half of
that rate in 1998, under the influence of the Asian and Russian
crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
arrived here from Los Angeles Wednesday by special plane to
continue his eight-day official visit to the United States at the
invitation of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived in Los Angeles Tuesday to kick off the visit,
is the first Chinese premier to visit the country in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, the Chinese premier is expected
to have an extensive and in-depth exchange of views with Clinton
on Sino-U.S. ties as well as major international and regional
issues of common concern. Zhu will also co-chair the second
meeting of the China-U.S. Environment and Development Forum with
Vice-President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at the Andrews Air Base at 17:30 (local time),
and Zhu and his wife, Lao An, were given a red-carpet welcome.
</P>
<P>
Present at the air base to welcome Zhu and his wife were U.S.
Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo, U.S.
Ambassador to China James Sasser and Mrs. Sasser as well as other
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the Ministry of the Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation who arrived in Washington earlier,
greeted the Chinese Premier at the air base.
</P>
<P>
Also present were over 350 representatives of the local Chinese
community and Chinese students studying in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's entourage included State Councilor Wu Yi, State Councilor

<HEADLINE> China Not To Depend on Increased Timber Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Although China faces timber
shortages this year because of its massive forest protection
campaign, the government says it has no plans to increase timber
imports substantially and will restrict imports to rare species
and large diameter logs.
</P>
<P>
It will satisfy domestic demand mainly by planting more fast-
growing, high-yield species of trees and by developing substitutes,
according to Kou Wenzheng, the director of the State Forestry
Administration's Forest Resources Department.
</P>
<P>
The central government began its ambitious forest protection
project soon after last year's heavy flooding in the Yangtze,
Nenjiang, and Songhua rivers by stopping or limiting logging of
forested parts of the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers, and in northeastern China and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, which account for 80 percent of the country's
forests and produce half of the country's commercial timber.
</P>
<P>
The administration also plans to reduce timber cutting by 12
million cu.m. this year and by 22 million cu.m., or about 20
percent of its timber consumption, by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Kou says that China can solve the problem on its own, because a
seventh of China's more than 46 million hectares of man-made
forests will reach maturity over the next 5 years, which will add
210 million cu.m. commercial timber.
</P>
<P>
The 4 million additional hectares of fast-growing, high-yield
trees, together with the addition of 1.3 million hectares of young
forests annually are expected to add another 20 million cu.m. of
commercial lumber by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Things at the Beijing National Timber Trade Market, where
everything appears quiet except for the clattering of keyboards
and occasional phone calls, confirm what Kou says. Timber prices
for the last quarter of 1998 rose 30 percent in some areas but
returned more or less to normal in the first quarter this year,
with an increase of only about 5 percent. There's unlikely to be
either a sharp rise in prices or a serious lack of timber in the
future, according to the Market's Deputy Manager Zhang Shiwei.
</P>
<P>
China has also made an effort to develop substitutes. Zhang
Jiurong, the vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Forestry
Science, says that methods to manufacture fiber boards out of
bamboo and sugarcane are being used in southern China and the
quality of some timber products has been improved.
</P>
<P>
Kou says that the central government plans to encourage timber
processing factory improvements by offering preferential tax
treatment to help save over 2 million cu.m. of commercial timber
annually. This will help stabilize the international timber market,
and protect forest resources outside China, Kou says.
</P>
<P>
Annual timber imports meet a third of China's total domestic
needs. In the past, China has been the world's second largest
timber importer, after Japan, accounting for a third of the
world's total trade.

<HEADLINE> Muscovites Rally Against NATO's Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Muscovites staged a
demonstration Wednesday to protest NATO's blatant bombardment of
Yugoslavia and voice support for the country's tenacious
resistance to aggressors.
</P>
<P>
The rally, held near the Kremlin Palace, lasted for about two
hours. It was the first large-scale organized protest in Moscow
since the start of the U.S.-led NATO military strikes against
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Many demonstrators held placards with anti-NATO slogans on them
and carried target-shaped pictures on their breasts, which have
turned into a symbol of Yugoslav resistance to aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the rally, the leaders of the Fatherland Movement,
the Russian Communist Party and other parties made speeches at the
rally. They demanded NATO halt strikes against Yugoslavia, restart
negotiations on the Kosovo issue, and appealed to Russian leaders
to provide stronger support for the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
An appeal adopted by the rally said the NATO's aggression
caused the exodus of refugees out of Kosovo and made the Yugoslav
people suffer.
</P>
<P>
It said those who seek hegemony in the world have banished the
historic lessons from their minds and try to ignore the world
order established after World War II.
</P>
<P>
The appeal also said that Russia will never ignore its "
Yugoslav brothers'" fate.

XIANDU (Zhejiang), April 8 (Xinhua) -- "I like you", a Japanese
girl says to a Chinese boy who replies "I like you more", not as a
declaration of love, but as part of an international exchange.
</P>
<P>
They are part of a group of volunteers who are here for the '99
China International Young Volunteers Camp for environmental
protection and cultural exchanges. They come from Asia, Europe,
Oceania and North America and have shown great interest in
learning Chinese even though they use English at camp.
</P>
<P>
"I like you" was the first thing they learned to say in Chinese
and next came "hello". A 66-year-old man from Japan has brought
books on how to learn Chinese and always takes notes when he comes
across new words. Other volunteers say he is a good example of
combining principle with practice.
</P>
<P>
An Australian who is studying environmental protection at
Beijing University has become an expert among volunteers, but he
is modest and looks shy when the other volunteers say his Chinese
is as good as that of Da Shan, a Canadian who is proficient in
Chinese. When he sang a Chinese song "If There Were No Communist
Party, There'd Be No New China", everybody was stunned by his
fluency.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia is hopeful the Yugoslav
situation does not produce a negative effect in its relationship
with the United States, said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov at a
press-conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Prime Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov
called U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore to discuss finding a way to
end the Balkan crisis and preserving Russian-U.S. relations
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the call, Primakov said the Kremlin will make every
effort to reduce the negative effects resulting from the
Yugoslavia situation, although some negative influences were
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
Developing a good relationship with Washington is a Moscow
policy, stressed Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the western countries' position on the Yugoslav
statement of ending military operations, the minister said NATO is
still awaiting Belgrade's responses to the following NATO requests:
Yugoslavia must withdraw not merely military force but
paramilitary forces, such as the police, from the Kosovo province;
it must also guarantee the safe return of the Kosovar refugees to
their native land and to provide them with humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
NATO knows that inevitably they will have to return to the
negotiating table to resolve the Kosovo issue, Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Advises Manila to Boost Revenue Collections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is advising the Philippine government to step up prescribed
reforms for the fiscal sector to boost revenue collections, the
Philippine Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, a visiting IMF mission which held
an initial meeting with the Philippine Finance Department
Wednesday said the Fund wants a "mapping-out of an action plan for
1999" to end the persistent income shortfalls by the country's
Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).
</P>
<P>
BIR, the top revenue earner of the country, pulled in only
337.175 billion pesos (1 U.S. dollar is equal to about 40 pesos)
last year, vis-a-vis the 347.675 billion pesos set by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
This brings the 1998 collection (Including those of the Bureau
of Treasury, the Bureau of Customs, and other agencies) to 462.52
billion pesos, down from 1997's 471.843 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
Government officials pointed out that the 7.1% growth in BIR's
earnings last year from the 314.497 billion pesos recorded in
1997, was lower than the 9.7% inflation rate in 1998, connoting a
declining tax effort.
</P>
<P>
Such a problem poses a threat to government's aim of attaining
a robust economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the IMF was also concerned over the
government's unprogrammed overspending seen in the last months of
1998 that resulted in a bigger-than-expected fiscal deficit of 50
billion pesos. This exceeded the 49 billion pesos ceiling placed
by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The government has forged a "precautionary arrangement" with
the IMF in the summer of last year, obliging the former to carry
out economic reforms in exchange for a 1.4 billion U.S. dollars
financing to be disbursed in tranches until March 2000.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has allowed the government to incur a deficit of as
much as 68.4 billion this year, to facilitate the Philippine
government's "pump-priming" agenda.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,833 hectares of poppy
plantations illegally grown in remote areas of the country's
northern and eastern parts were destroyed in 1998-99 poppy
cultivation season from November 1998 to March 14, 1999, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poppy fields, jointly destroyed by army units, local
intelligence units, police force and local people, were in Shan,
Kayah and Kachin states and Sagaing division.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are going on to search and destroy the illegal poppy
plantations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, a total of 32,787
hectares of poppy fields in the past ten years from 1988 to 1998
were destroyed, deterring the yield of 356.17 tons of opium during
the period.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar official statistics, in 1998 there were
61,236 hectares of poppy cultivation in the entire country that
would yield 665.28 tons of raw opium and could be refined into
66.52 tons of heroin, while the State Department of the United
States said in its statement issued in March 1998 that there were
157,089 hectares of poppy cultivation that would produce 2,365
tons of raw opium and 197 tons of heroin.

LIMA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
criticized NATO's bombing of civilians in Yugoslavia on Wednesday
and said the conflict in Kosova should be resolved in a peaceful
manner by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"This cannot be justified" he emphasized, after stating that he
had been observing the air attacks on Belgrade on the television.
</P>
<P>
"Grave precedents are being established by the NATO bombing,
which puts civilian populations at risk in one way or another. We
believe this to be intolerable" he added.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori also said the bombing of civilians "is progressively
worsening, and constitutes a magnificent opportunity for returning
the issue to the UN, by way of its Security Council, to the role
which the international community assigned to it after the end of
World War II."
</P>
<P>
"The UN and its Security Council cannot be ignored or replaced
by a regional organization" said Fujimori at a press conference
from the Government Palace.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the help of his country "at the request of the UN
in any conflict, such as that of Kosova, when it is requested
through civilized channels and not through debatable actions which
are receiving world-wide criticism."
</P>
<P>
"Peace continues to be the most costly human right, for this
reason we emphasize that we cannot put peace at risk, we must
strengthen it," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Threatens to Halt Tripartite Talks on E Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Portugal Wednesday threatened to
abandon United Nations-sponsored talks with Indonesia, should
violence against civilians continue in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Ana Gomes, the Portuguese special envoy for Indonesia, said her
country will withdraw from the talks if military personnel fail to
end the rising tide of violence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with jailed pro-independence East
Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao at his detention house in Central
Jakarta, Gomes said continued violence could threaten the
reconciliation process in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
She quoted Xanana as saying the latest bloody clashes between
pro and anti-independence factions claimed 49 lives in Liquica
regency, East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Another 70 casualties were reported over the past two months in
East Timor, Gomes said, adding that right now, tensions are
spreading to the regencies of Baucau and Viqueque.
</P>
<P>
"We think that an international investigation is indeed
necessary to establish what has happened in Liquica," Gomes was
quoted by Indonesian newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said the violence in Liquica was aimed at disrupting
tripartite talks between Indonesia, Portugal and the United
Nations which are scheduled to resume later this month.
</P>
<P>
Portugal demanded that Indonesian security authorities deal
with the situation more seriously, otherwise it will withdraw from
the tripartite peace negotiations on East Timor, she added.
</P>
<P>
Gomes also clarified Xanana's earlier controversial instruction
to his followers to undertake a general popular insurrection
against armed militia groups. She said he only "authorized his
people to exercise self-defense against the aggression".
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
rejected claims by pro-independence East Timorese that 49 people
had been killed in Liquica regency.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true," ABRI spokesman Major General Syamsul Ma'arif
said, adding that the military would investigate the claim.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Minister of Justice Muladi Wednesday said that the
government would review its policy of housing Xanana in his
present special detention quarters "if it was true that Xanana
declared a war against ABRI and Indonesians".
</P>
<P>
The aim of placing Xanana in special detention "was so he could
contribute more effectively to the settlement of the East Timor
problem... not for declaring a war like that, whatever the
reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has suggested that the U.N.-sponsored
direct balloting to determine if the East Timor wants autonomy or
independence should be held in July.

<HEADLINE> China Cracking Down On Issuing Of False Invoices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Taxation (SAT) is taking steps to control invoices with a
nationwide check on bogus invoices from April to June.
</P>
<P>
An SAT official says that this is a way of combating the misuse
and falsification of invoices and one of the most important
weapons in the fight against tax evasion that has resulted in a
loss of tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The check will be carried out in three steps: internal
inspection of invoice offices and individuals; an inspection by
tax officials; and straightening out penalties and requirements.
The administration will investigate all value-added tax (VAT)
payments and the entire invoice procedure will be revised to
comply with SAT requirements.
</P>
<P>
The state has reported that 62 people have been sentenced to
death in China over the past 5 years for charges related to VAT
invoices.

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Jeff Kennett, premier of Australia's second richest state

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Emphasizes Yugoslavia's Position on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic emphasized Wednesday that Yugoslavia would stick to a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis within the Serbian
Republic through direct dialogues and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the statement when meeting with visiting Russian
State Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev, according to the official
Tanjug News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO bombing for the past 13 days had forced many
Kosovars to leave their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Then NATO would send forces to take control of Kosovo under the
excuses of preventing anti-humanity disaster, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But in fact, he emphasized, the disaster was caused by NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's war against Yugoslavia was an unprecedented
crime committed upon a sovereign state and its innocent people.
</P>
<P>
The top priority of the Yugoslav people was to safeguard their
homeland, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Russian parliament speaker said Russia
strongly condemned NATO's aggression on Yugoslavia and demanded an
immediate end to its bombing.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia had the obligation to give humanitarian aid to
Yugoslavia and it hoped to do more to bring an end to the crazy
war launched by NATO.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifying Poverty-Relief Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- With less than two years left to
achieve the goal of eradicating poverty, China is intensifying
poverty-relief efforts among poor rural residents in the central
and western regions, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Government officials admitted that, despite years of efforts
which have raised millions of the rural poor out of poverty, large
numbers of poor people still remain to be provided with adequate
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people stood at about 50 million at the end
of 1997, with no more up-to-date figures available. The poverty
level in China is set at annual per capita income below 640 yuan (
77 US dollars), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has pledged to basically solve the food
and clothing problems of poor rural residents by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Half of the remaining poor rural residents are now living in
abject poverty, lacking the basic conditions for working and
living decently," Zhang Lei, deputy director of the State
Council's Leading Group Office on Poverty Alleviation and
Development, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's remarks came at a workshop on women and poverty held in
Beijing yesterday. He said the government has urged determined
implementation of the poverty-alleviation responsibility system
that holds leading Party and government officials in localities
accountable for the work.
</P>
<P>
In those counties which have substantially solved the problems
of a shortage of food and clothing, local governments should help
farmers by guiding them towards growing commercial crops and
developing competitive businesses, thus saving them from plunging
back into destitution, he said.

<HEADLINE> Poor Women Need Help from Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- More than half of China's 50
million poverty-stricken population are women, and they deserve
more help from all social strata to get out of their plight,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Shen Shuji, vice-
chairman of the All-China Women's Federation as saying that more
women are mired in poverty than men, and they find it more
difficult to shake off the shackles of destitution.
</P>
<P>
"In the past decade, anti-poverty campaign initiated by women's
federations nationwide have lifted at least 1.6 million rural
women out of absolute poverty," Shen said at a five-day workshop
on women and poverty which started here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said her federation plans to raise another one million poor
women out of poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1998, international poverty-eradication aid
projects benefited more than 300,000 rural women in over 20
provinces.
</P>
<P>
While appreciating overseas support, Shen appealed for all
segments of society to launch more development projects to lift
women out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Women rural laborers, numbering 210 million in 1997, account
for 47 percent of China's rural workforce, according to
participants in the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 25 million of the women in rural areas aged
between 15 and 40 are illiterate, preventing them from playing a
bigger role in the country's drive to modernize its agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, twelve state commissions and ministries
have provided practical skills to 300,000 poor women a year, and
helped three million rural poor women out of poverty, says the
paper.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-China Bilateral Trade Reaches Nearly 400 Mln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar-China bilateral trade
reached 381.1 million U.S. dollars in 1998, 21.56 percent more
than that in 1997 which was 313.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures, issued by Myanmar's Central
Statistical Organization, show that the country imported 257.7
million dollars' worth of goods from China, while exporting to
China commodities valued at 123.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar mainly imports from China capital and consumer goods
including transport and electrical machinery and apparatus, while
its chief exports to China cover timber, marine and agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Border trade between Myanmar and China has been playing an
important role in the two countries' bilateral trade. So far,
Myanmar has opened, on its side, six trade points along the border
with China.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to expand the foreign trade, Myanmar exempted
the 5 percent commercial tax since February 1998, lowering the
border trade service charges to 8 percent from 10 percent and
raising the income tax rate on imported commodities from 1.5
percent to 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Italy Against Transferring Kosovo Refugees Outside Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy said on Wednesday that the
Kosovar refugees should be assisted within the Balkan region,
instead of being transferred to other regions as favored by some
countries like the United States.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema told Sadako Ogata, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), that the
idea of going to Western countries "is not favored by those
refugees, and would push farther into the future the possibility
for them to return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner, on her way to Albanian capital of Tirana
and Macedonian capital of Skopje, conferred with D'alema on how to
assist Kosovars remaining in the Serbian province of Kosovo and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner voiced her great appreciation for the
leading role Italy has taken on to coordinate aid in Albania with
its relief operation "Rainbow," in response to the UNHCR appeal.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema informed the high commissioner of relief operation "
Rainbow" which aims at setting up camps along the Albanian border
and the relief items to be stockpiled in these reception centers.
</P>
<P>
After pointing out that the Italian government has never closed
its borders to refugees, D'Alema said Italy is ready and willing
to bring special cases into the country but believes that "all
evacuation measures must be temporary and exceptional and must
come about on a voluntary basis."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Interior Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino,
rejected Washington's plan to ship Kosovo refugees to the U.S.
naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba as one which "would really mean
completing their deportation" and would be "impossible."
</P>
<P>
Jervolino, who met the high commissioner earlier in the day,
argued that these people should not be taken to Cuba but assisted
nearby.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, about 621,000 refugees have left Kosovo
since the beginning of the crisis in March 1998, with 293,000 of
these displaced in Albania, 136,000 in Macedonia, 60,000 in
Montenegro, 24,300 in Bosnia, 7,000 in Turkey and 100,000 in other
26 countries in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Form Team For 2006 Asiad Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Sports Council (KONI)
plans to set up a special team to organize Indonesia's campaign to
host the 2006 Asian Games (Asiad), the Jakarta Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general Rudolf S. Warouw said that the team members'
names would be announced after the inauguration of KONI's new
officials by President B.J. Habibie at the State Palace on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The special team will include Jakarta governor and mayors and
representatives from the state minister of youth affairs and
sports office. The team's task is to ensure other Asiad
participating countries that the Indonesian government and people
fully support Indonesia bid to host the quadrennial event," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Warouw also said that KONI would work together with officials
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to intensify the diplomatic
approach.
</P>
<P>
KONI will send its officials to attend the Olympic Committee of
Asia general assembly in Kuwait in November.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said the officials would have to fill out an application
to bid. Bidding will start early next year. KONI earlier send a
letter of intent offering Indonesia as host to the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"The President himself has thrown his weight behind the idea of
hosting the Asiad. His approval is one of the main requirements
for bidding," he said, adding that the new government gave better
attention to sports development in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, some sports organizations criticized KONI's plan,
saying it was unrealistic due to Indonesia's prolonged two-year-
old economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bidding for the 2006 Asiad is part of KONI's ambitious Golden
Garuda project, aimed at making Indonesia the host and finishing
at least sixth in the medal tally.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said Indonesia would face tough challenges from Malaysia,
India, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Each bidding country must submit its proposal along with an
application fee of 10,000 U.S. dollars. If a country is appointed
host, it is required to contribute another 190,000 U.S. dollars to
the Olympic Council of Asia by three months after the announcement.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' BOP surplus, GIR Level Rise Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) had improved further to a surplus of 1.67 billion
U.S. dollars as of March 22, from 1.38 billion U.S. dollars
surplus as of end-February this year, Manila Bulletin reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted officials of the Philippine Central Bank
as saying that the surplus could increase further by end-March to
as high as 1.87 billion U.S. dollars with the expected inflows
from foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the net international reserves (NIR) as of
March 22 stood at 9.67 billion U.S. dollars, compare to the
end-February figure of 9.39 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both the NIR and the BOP levels for the period in review
exceed the full-year government's projections with the IMF of 9
billion and 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The March 22 improvement in the BOP was brought about by the
increased dollar deposits by the national government to the
Philippine Central bank.
</P>
<P>
This was in the form of the proceeds of the government's bond
flotations and some borrowings for the period.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the gross international reserves (GIR) had gone up
to 12.9 billion U.S. dollars as of the end of the last month.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official of the Central Bank had earlier said that
the progress in the trade balance, the volume of dollar inflows,
both portfolio and direct investments, as well as amount of loans
accessed by the government from both the multilateral and
bilateral creditors would spell the difference for the revised BOP
position this year.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Review Disarmament Plan: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense minister, who returned from Tajikstan Wednesday,
told the press that Russia would increase the size of its 1.2
million-strong armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Russia decided to reinforce its combat forces because NATO
intends to implement a new strategy in which the bloc may use
force in any place without approval from the United Nations,
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and President Boris Yeltsin were concerned
about NATO's new strategy, noting that their "worries" were
confirmed by NATO's military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister warned that if NATO launched a ground war
in Yugoslavia, the Kosovo conflict is likely to spread beyond
Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev believed NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia has
undermined the Russia-NATO relationship established within the
framework of a "peaceful partnership plan."
</P>
<P>
Under the current situation, it is impossible for Russia's
State Duma (lower house of parliament) to ratify the Russia-U.S.
START-II nuclear weapons treaty, Sergeyev said.

VIENNA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Some European countries have
offered aid to the Kosovo refugees, including food, medicine, and
materials for building camps to shelter tens of thousands living
in overcrowded conditions in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Austria on Wednesday approved a plan offering about 40 million
U.S. dollars to set up an Austrian camp in Albania to shelter the
Kosovo refugees. The government has also decided to take 5,000
refugees into Austria.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has reportedly shipped 50 tons of aid which includes
food, medicine and carpets to refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians are being forced by Serbians to flee Kosovo in
large numbers. The NATO alliance started bombing Yugoslavia 13
days ago to force Yugoslavia to agree to a peace plan for Kosovo,
where the majority of the population is Albanian.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has also sent a 30-vehicle convoy of humanitarian aid
Monday to the Kosovo refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Italian government is planning to build camps in
Albania to house about 25,000 Kosovo refugees, said a press
release by the Ylberi Coordination Center.
</P>
<P>
The Center was formed by representatives of the Italian Embassy,
the Special Diplomatic Delegation, the Delegation of Experts, the
Interforze Delegation of Italian Police and Civil Defense.
</P>
<P>
The Center will set up an army field hospital before April 9,
in which 100 patients can simultaneously receive medical treatment,

northeast China's Liaoning province, plans to restore part of its

Plans call for the ground around the Dazheng Hall (Major

Renovation efforts in the past caused the ground around the
Dazheng to be raised to make the floor level with the surrounding
area, affecting the overall looks of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
A study has shown that the original ground was half a meter
lower than the current ground level around the Dazheng, which was

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth to Visit Australia Early Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Head of State Queen
Elizabeth is going to visit Australia early next year at the
invitation of the Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a
spokesperson for the prime minister confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"No date has been set but it is expected it (Queen Elizabeth's
visit to Australia) will be in the first half of next year",
Willie Herron, a spokewoman for the prime minister told Xinhua in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
It is probably her last visit as Australia's Head of State as
Australian voters are going to decide in a referendum later this
year whether Australia should become a republic and have their own
president.
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace Thursday also confirmed that the Queen would
visit Australia in the first half of 2000 in a visit carefully
timed to avoid controversy as voters decide whether to keep her as
the constitutional monarch, the Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
If Australia votes for a republic, the monarchy would be
replaced by a president on January 2001, the centenary of the
Australian federation.
</P>
<P>
The Queen, who is currently the sovereign of 17 Commonwealth
countries, including Britain's former colony Australia, has always
declined to get involved in the republican debate, insisting that
the question is purely a matter for Australia to decide.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth last visited Australia in 1992 to help Sydney
celebrate its 150th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating then
incensed Australia's monarchists by making what was interpreted as
a pro-republican speech and then placing his arm on the Queen's
back at a reception.
</P>
<P>
His wife Annita Keating breached protocol by not wearing
gloves or a hat to welcome the Queen and failed to curtsey.
</P>
<P>
The incident horrified the British press and caused them to dub
Keating the Lizard of Oz (Australia).
</P>
<P>
Howard, a lifelong monarchist, is unlikely to commit any
similar breach of protocol.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ship Monitored by NATO Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) - The Russian reconnaissance ship sent
to the Mediterranean was monitored by NATO navy, Russian navy
command said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Liman (Estuary), which left the Ukrainian port of
Sebastopol on Friday, is the first of a seven-vessel flotilla from
the Black Sea Fleet that Russia plans to send toward the Yugoslav
coast.
</P>
<P>
The ship is part of Russia's response to NATO bombing on
Yugoslavia. Its declared task is to "collect information" about
the situation around Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the ship entered the Mediterranean, it was monitored
by navy forces from Greece and Turkey, both NATO member states,
the Russian navy command said. At present, NATO naval vessels
participating in the war against Yugoslavia, and navy forces from
other countries kept watch on it.
</P>
<P>
NATO command was concerned that the Russian ship would sent
intelligence about cruise missiles fired by U.S. and British
vessels and submarines not only to the Black Sea Fleet, but also
to the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
Possibilities of provocations against the ship by NATO
warplanes and submarines could not be ruled out, the Itar-Tass
news agency said, quoting Russian navy experts.
</P>
<P>
They proposed Russia should send additional navy forces to the

<HEADLINE> Philippine  Banks' Reserves Cut by One Percentage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson announced Wednesday a one percentage point cut in
banks' reserve requirements effective April 15, Malaya newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The governor also reported that the Monetary Board of the
Central Bank has approved the exemption from the required
loan-loss provisions all loans given out after March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The two moves will hopefully stimulate the economy by
encouraging banks to resume lending.
</P>
<P>
The one percentage point cut will be done on the liquidity
reserve requirement currently set at five percent.
</P>
<P>
Thus the reserves against deposits will be set at 14 percent
effective in mid April.
</P>
<P>
The cut will free another 11 billion pesos (47.5 million U.S.
dollars) for banks to lend to customers.
</P>
<P>
The government was encouraged to order another cut in reserves
after the March inflation rate dropped sharply to 8.7 percent from
9.9 percent in February.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- It is not too late to stop the
NATO war against Yugoslavia, said the representative of the
Organization of United Nations for education, science and culture
(UNESCO) in Panama on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a message of the international organization
quoting its director Frederico Mayor Zaragosa, all the parties in
the conflict, including Albanians and Kosovans, should seek a
peaceful solution to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to worry more about the victims of this cruel
conflict, which is ethnically based, where the most vulnerable are
the weakest", he said.
</P>
<P>
In the calls to the international community to close the ranks
in favor of the refugees, UNESCO stressed the nececity to help the
thousands of refugees which are the consequence of the war.
</P>
<P>
Zaragosa said that "today, once again the arms are doing the
talking and thousands of people run the risk of death".
</P>
<P>
UNESCO, reminded that the UN was created at the end of the
second world war to protect future generations from the scourge of
war, and was emphatic in signalling that the mission to establish
in the minds of men was the defence of peace.
</P>
<P>
According to Zaragosa, the grave situation in the Yugoslav war,
has been changed into "a failure for all of us".
</P>
<P>
The international organization gave a call to reason to all the
responsible parts in the conflict, so that the thread of dialogue
could again be begun in the best terms and a peaceful political
solution could be found. "The search for peace in Yugoslavia
should stay as the top priority in Yugoslavia," demanded UNESCO.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Shocks Germany 2-0 at Nigeria '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian "Flying Eagles" Wednesday
defeated Germany football team by 2-0 at the National Stadium in
Lagos in a tension-soaked match of the on-going 10th World Youth
Championship tagged Nigeria '99.
</P>
<P>
The second-half goals scored by substitute Ganyu Shittu and
Hashimu Garba shot Nigeria to the top of Group A with four points
following the draw match with Costa Rica in the opening game on
April 3.
</P>
<P>
After a barren first half, Shittu, who came in for an injured
Chikelue Iloanusi, made a successful connection of a shot from the
left flank in the 69th minute, leaving German goalkeeper Timo
Heldebrand standing in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
Twelve minutes later, fast attacker Julius Aghahowa broke free
in one of his trademark forays, and his lob into the German 18 was
put past hildebrand by Garba.
</P>
<P>
Though there were still some nine minutes to go, the
celebration had begun. Members of the Nigerian football
supporters club hit their drums with increased intensity and fans
danced away in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
After the match watched by 20,000 spectators, the fans broke
into several groups as they left the National Stadium venue of the
game, singing and dancing as the "Flying Eagles" had won the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Seeking an early goal, the "Flying Eagles" went into full
throttle from the blast of the whistle, piling non-stop pressure
on the Germans and earning at least a half-dozen corner kicks in
the first half alone.
</P>
<P>
The Germans had come into the game cautiously, apparently
hoping for a draw. But they too went for broke after Nigeria's
goals with German striker Patrick Falk running rings round the
Nigerian defence to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The match was not without incident as Nigeria's Iloanusi had to
be taken out of stadium in an ambulance after he was injured in a
clash with a German player.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Suffers Early Exit at Hong Kong Tennis Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Reigning U.S. Open champion Pat
Rafter of Australia suffered another early exit here Wednesday
when he was ousted by Germany's veteran Bernd Karbacher in full
sets in the first round of the 350,000-U.S.-dollar Hong Kong Open
tennis.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Rafter, ranked fifth in the world, was toppled 7-6
(7-4), 6-7 (1-7), 2-6, and his win-loss record in 1999 is 6-7. He
was off to a slow start similar to last year's performance.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed because it was a pretty ordinary effort
on my part," said Rafter, who arrived here 24 hours ago from
leading Australia to a 4-1 Davis Cup victory over Zimbabwe in
Harare Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter said: "The conditions here were extremely different to
what I played last week...the court here is faster."
</P>
<P>
After exchanging tie-breaker in the first two sets, 31-year-old
Karbacher played steady game with his powerful returns to Rafter's
backhand, breaking Rafter in the first and eighth games in the
deciding third set to clinch a 6-2 win.
</P>
<P>
Joining the Australian, fourth seed Cedric Pioline of France,
former French Open runner-up, was beaten 6-2, 1-6, 4-6 by Italy's
Laurence Tieleman.
</P>
<P>
World number four Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands
encountered stiff challenge from Takao Suzuki before edging out
the Japanese with an identical score of 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Both players performed serve and volley game but top seed
Krajicek said he could get more confidence and get better as the
competition went on.
</P>
<P>
American third seed Andre Agassi made short work of Italian
Gianluca Pozzi, winning 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Other seeded players Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, Wayne Ferreira
of South Africa and Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden booked their first
round victories Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Women in Shenzhen Marrying Overseas People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas people seem to be losing
favor with the young women of Shenzhen, the country's first
special economic zone in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The city had a boom period in overseas liaisons during the late
eighties, but now the city's economic development is offering
young women other opportunities for a better life.
</P>
<P>
The number of women in Shenzhen who married overseas people in
1998 was 651, down from 1,167 in 1988, according to the city's
civil affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
But what these marriages have lost in numbers, they have
apparently gained in quality as age differences between husbands
and wives are less dramatic than in the past.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 92 percent of the marriages in 1988 were between local
residents and Hong Kong partners, but this figure dropped last
year to only 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that fewer locals view marriage as the pathway to a
better life because their current living standards are much higher
than last decade, becoming closer to Hong Kong and some developed
countries.

<HEADLINE> Late Equaliser Keeps Man United Alive in Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A goal in injury time from Ryan
Giggs helped Manchester United with a 1-1 draw against Juventus in
the first leg of the semifinal match of the European Champions
League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While in another semifinal match, Bayern Munich also had to be
contend with a draw with Kiev Dynamo on road.
</P>
<P>
But while Bayern's sparked delight for the few travelling
German fans in Kiev, United's brought a wave of relief to Old
Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Bayern had trailed 2-0 and 3-1 but Carsten Jancker's goal to
make it 3-3 put the Germans firmly in the driving seat for the
return leg.
</P>
<P>
Giggs blasted the ball home from close range in injury time to
give United a 1-1 home draw with Juventus who had led through
Antonio Conte's 25th minute shot.
</P>
<P>
Juventus took the initiative from the start at Old Trafford
where United were hoping for a repeat of the 2-0 quarterfinal
defeat of Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
Unrecognisable from the team which has limped along off the
pace in Serie A, Juve dictated the pace of the game against a
below-par United.
</P>
<P>
The Italians took a deserved lead when Edgar Davids played a
clever through ball for Conte and the Juve skipper shot sweetly
past Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
Juve continued to dominate, with Davids and fellow midfielder
Zinedine Zidane controlling the midfield and Filippo Inzaghi a
constant threat up front.
</P>
<P>
United, unbeaten in 20 matches in 1999, did not threaten until
the last few minutes when they launched a sustained assault on
Angelo Peruzzi's goal.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Teddy Sheringham deflected a Roy Keane shot into the
net two minutes from time but the goal was ruled out for offside.
</P>
<P>
But, with Juve seemingly set for victory, David Beckham slung a
hopeful cross into the box and after it was half-cleared Giggs
crashed the ball into the roof of the net.
</P>
<P>
Juventus are still favourites to reach the final for the fourth
successive year but Giggs' lifeline left United in with "a great
chance," according to their manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"If we had performed in the first half as we did in the second
we would have been much better off," said Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"I thought Juventus were outstanding in the first half but we
have to look at our own performance."
</P>
<P>
Dynamo got off to a great start against Bayern when in-form
striker Andriy Shevchenko put them ahead after 15 minutes and then
Kakha Kaladze appeared to touch in a Shevchenko free kick after 43
minutes to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Michael Tarnat pulled one back for Bayern from long range in
first-half injury time but Kiev restored the two-goal cushion with
a stunning Vitaly Kosovsky volley in the 49th minute.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, the runaway leaders of the Bundesliga, continued to go
forward, risking more breakaways by Shevchenko.
</P>
<P>
The adventurous policy paid off when Stefan Effenberg pulled
another back 12 minutes from time and Jancker's third away goal
put them on course for their first European Cup final since 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ryan Giggs threw Manchester United
a European Champions League lifeline with an injury time equaliser
in the first leg of their semifinal tie against Juventus Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Just when Juventus looked like pulling off the perfect smash-
and-grab, Giggs popped up at the far post to smash the ball into
the roof of the net and send Old Trafford into raptures.
</P>
<P>
United, who are desperate to win the continent's premier trophy
for the first time since 1968, had seemed destined to suffer a
potentially fatal blow to their European dreams when Antonio Conte
grabbed a gilt-edged away goal in the first half.
</P>
<P>
But Alex Ferguson's men never gave up and despite being the
inferior side for much of the game, a frantic assault on the
Italians' goal in the dying minutes paid off with the thrilling
equaliser.
</P>
<P>
United had been cursing their luck after having a penalty
turned down and a "goal" ruled out for offside -- but Giggs'
opportunistic intervention at least gives them a hope for the
second leg in Turin.
</P>
<P>
The visitors had been well worth their lead and could have
added to their tally during an enterprising first half, when they
took the game to United and carved out a hatful of clear chances.
</P>
<P>
World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, who had been doubtful
before the game with a knee injury, and Dutchman Edgar Davids
dominated the midfield for Juventus.
</P>
<P>
United, by contrast, failed to impose themselves on the match
and were forced to chase shadows for long periods as the visitors
kept possession.
</P>
<P>
Dwight Yorke was ineffectual up front, David Beckham and Ryan
Giggs only featured fleetingly and the defence was frequently left
flat-footed by Juventus' sweeping counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
Juventus stunned the home side with an all-out assault in the
opening stages and Peter Schmeichel did well to keep out a sharp
shot from Filippo Inzaghi.
</P>
<P>
Beckham unleashed one of his trademark curling free-kicks in
the 22nd minute but, with most of the United support believing the
ball was heading for the top corner, it drifted just wide.
</P>
<P>
And Juventus went straight up the other end and an incisive
attack gave them the vital away goal.
</P>
<P>
Zidane showed that even when not fully fit he is a force to be
reckoned with, as he picked the ball up wide on the left and cut
inside. Davids took over and threaded a glorious pass into the
area where Conte stroked the ball past a despairing Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
With the Italians now well on top, Schmeichel was forced to
save at the feet of Zoran Mirkovic.
</P>
<P>
Gianluca Pessotto should have made it 2-0 in the 37th minute,
after Davids split the United defence with another superb pass,
but with only Schmeichel left to beat he hit his shot high and
wide.
</P>
<P>
In the final minute of the half Inzaghi clipped a shot just
wide after Zidane's cross from the right had again caused major
problems for the United back line.
</P>
<P>
With Ferguson fearful of his side facing a mountain to climb in
Turin, United pushed on in search of an equaliser after the break.
</P>
<P>
And they at last began to cause problems for the visiting
defence, with some fluent attacking play.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Ronny Johnsen headed over and Cole came close after
an incisive ball from Paul Scholes, who then blasted a shot the
wrong side of the angle from long-range.
</P>
<P>
Peruzzi saved a flashing header from Giggs and Cole sent
another half-chance wide after a surging run into Juventus
territory.
</P>
<P>
Cole was beginning to impose himself on the opposition and his
belligerence set up Roy Keane, who slammed a low drive from the
edge of the area that Peruzzi did well to hold.
</P>
<P>
United were convinced they should have had a penalty in the 74
th minute, when Giggs' shot struck the hand of Mark Iuliano -- but
the referee waved play on and Scholes put the rebound wide.
</P>
<P>
With United throwing everything forward, Zidane almost
capitalised for Juve, but dragged his shot across the face of the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes from time a header from Old Trafford forgotten man
Teddy Sheringham deflected Keane's piledriver into the net -- but
with the stadium celebrating, the linesman raised his flag.
</P>
<P>
And in the last minute Scholes, who scored in similarly last-
gasp circumstances against Inter, had two great chances -- first
he put a header straight at Peruzzi and then saw a shot blocked by
a covering dive.
</P>
<P>
But with the crowd convinced United were heading for a home
defeat, Beckham hooked a hopeful ball from the byline, the defence
failed to clear the ball and Giggs took his chance by lashing home
the loose ball.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson: We've Still Got a Great Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson admitted Ryan Giggs had got his side out of jail with his
last-gasp equaliser in the first leg of the European Cup semifinal
against Juventus on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson accepted United had been overshadowed by their Italian
opponents for much of the contest.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted they could still reach the final despite
conceding a goal at home.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Giggs' goal would prove to be a lifesaver, Ferguson
said:"I hope so. I think it does give us a great chance.
</P>
<P>
"But if we'd performed like we did in the second half in the
first it would have been better."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was full of praise for the visitors: "I thought
Juventus were outstanding in the first half -- all counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at ourselves because every time we made a
mistake they were off in a flash and they gave us a real hard time.
</P>
<P>
"But in the second half our wide players got to grips better in
terms of defending and I think that made a big difference."
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he had felt fate was against his team, who had a
goal disallowed and had a penalty appeal turned down.
</P>
<P>
"It looked that way for a long time," he shrugged. "On the
offside where the goal was disallowed, the linesman flagged well
after the ball was in the net.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not it was offside, he was still very, very late
with his flag," he said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Use Becoming A daily Essential in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 37 million U.S.
adults use the Internet at home on at least a daily basis,
compared to only 19 million in mid-1997, according to a new study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a nationally representative survey of more
than 1,000 U.S. adults by the end of 1998, also found that the
number of daily U.S. Internet users at work has mushroomed from 19
million to 32 million since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has gone from being a curiosity to being a daily
source for e-mail, shopping, research and news," said the study
conductor Strategis Group, an e-data resources and market analysis
company. The group estimates that 84 million Americans or 42
percent of U.S. adults, now use the Internet at home or at work.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, 44 percent of Internet users in the
United States spend less time watching television due to Internet
use. Therefore, there will be a market share war between
television and Internet Web sites for viewship and advertising
money.
</P>
<P>
Adults in 34 million U.S. households now use the Internet a
total of 65 million hours per day, compared to 525 million
television viewing hours for all U.S. adults.
