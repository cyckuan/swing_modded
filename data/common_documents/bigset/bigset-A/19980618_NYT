CAMPAIGN FINANCE PROPOSAL IS SACRIFICED FOR BIGGER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another vote on campaign finance, the House on
Wednesday night resoundingly rejected a measure that was widely
considered one of the main threats to a bipartisan bill to ban
unregulated campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated measure, the first of 11 the House will debate,
would have created a 12-member commission, split evenly between
Republicans and Democrats, to study how best to overhaul the
campaign finance system. Many Democrats and Republicans said that
in principle they supported the proposal, sponsored by Rep. Rick
White, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill was voted down 156 to 201 by House members who
viewed it as an effort by the Republican leadership to doom two
major pieces of legislation to overhaul the system of campaign
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering supporters of the overhaul effort, 64 Republicans
voted with 136 Democrats and 1 independent to reject the commission
proposal. Another 68 members, mostly Democrats, voted ``present,''
indicating that they agreed with the measure but did not want to
hurt the chances of one of the main overhaul proposals sponsored by
Reps. Chris Shays, R-Conn., and Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Under procedures set by Republican leaders, the House will
debate 11 versions of the legislation and the one that receives the
most votes will become the House bill. Wednesday night's vote made
it unlikely that the commission proposal would survive to become
the primary legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they will vote `present' or `no' is because they
know that this is simply an attempt at the moment to undercut
Shays-Meehan,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., during a
sometimes shrill debate over which side wanted genuine change.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the vote completed than the debate on campaign
finance stalled again when the House put off a procedural vote to
allow members to offer nearly 280 amendments. Republican leaders
maintain they are simply paving the way for a ``free and open''
debate. But Democrats and supporters of the overhaul effort called
it an attempt to kill off the legislation, slowly and deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear on Wednesday night whether Republicans had
enough votes to permit the many amendments or whether Democrats
would be able to defeat the move.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Wednesday night's vote and the
squabble over the amendments indicated that pressure was mounting
on Republican leaders to act on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress oppose the effort to tighten the
law on unregulated campaign contributions, known as ``soft money,''
a major provision of the Shays-Meehan proposal, seeing it as an
effort to erode their party's traditional fund-raising advantage.
Republican leaders also oppose efforts to regulate issue
advertising, another component of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of legislation in the campaign finance debate,
sponsored by a group of House freshman, would restrict soft-money
donations.

TESTIMONY CONCLUDES IN BRAWLEY DEFAMATION SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to clarify identity of Steven Pagones in 5th graf)  (ja) 
 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ After seven months, more than two dozen
witnesses and the last-minute appearance of a television celebrity,
testimony concluded Wednesday in the Tawana Brawley defamation
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been marked by outrageous antics and, in keeping
with its history, it ended with a threat of further dramatics. But
breaking with history, the judge put a stop to that.
</P>
<P>
   Justice S. Barrett Hickman of State Supreme Court left the
courtroom Wednesday afternoon with a box of papers in his arms,
prepared to work on the complicated charge to the jury. Closing
arguments are expected to begin some time next week and the jury
could begin deliberations before the end of month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is very happy to have reached this point,'' said
Hickman. ``There may have been some doubts as to whether we would
or not.'' The judge has endured bruising attacks from all four
lawyers involved in the case, and criticism from outside observers
about the the length of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. are
being sued by Steven Pagones, a former Dutchess County assistant
district attorney, because they publicly accused him of
participating in the abduction and rape of Miss Brawley in 1987. A
grand jury that investigated the allegations in 1988 determined
there was no evidence that Miss Brawley had ever been assaulted,
and specifically exonerated Pagones. He has charged that the
defendants acted recklessly and maliciously and is now seeking
about $400 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hardy, the lawyer representing Sharpton, attempted to
wrap up his case by asking Geraldo Rivera, the television
personality, to testify about the ``crucial issue'' of Sharpton's
character. Rivera, arriving at the Dutchess County Courthouse an
hour late, said he had known Sharpton for 15 years and was prepared
to testify that his character was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe that Al Sharpton is capable of malice,''
Rivera said outside the courthouse. ``I believe history will
ultimately recognize Rev. Sharpton as one of the great civil rights
leaders in America.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rivera had taken the stand, Stanton said he was prepared to
call any number of witnesses to rebut whatever Rivera might have
said. This could have pushed testimony into the trial's fourth
season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hickman has frequently been criticized for losing
control of the proceedings, he had previously ruled that Rivera
would not be allowed to testify. Wednesday, he held firm. In
stopping Rivera's testimony, the judge said the issue of character
was at most only ``remotely relevant,'' and that it would cloud
other more important issues, unnecessarily prolonging the trial.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Hardy rested his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, fine,'' said the judge. ``That's cause for some
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no cheers, however, and observers exited quietly, as
they would on any other day. Sharpton, who was making a rare
appearance in court, embraced Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But some people were smiling: the jurors. One court officer said
that the jurors were so happy they were almost singing as they left
the building. And he hazarded a guess as to why: ``They won't have
to listen to witnesses drone on, although I have a feeling their
ears will be bleeding by the time summations are over.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the jurors, the trial that began last Nov. 18, has
had bitter consequences. One juror had to draw heavily on her
savings to support herself while sitting on the lengthy trial.
Another, an alternate, was hit by a car and critically injured as
she returned to court from a lunch break. Both women were
eventually excused. Now six jurors and two alternates remain.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it marked the end of testimony at the trial, there
were those who were disappointed by the decision that prevented
Rivera from taking the stand. Sharpton said later: ``I can be
called a buffoon, but a guy comes in to testify that I have an
excellent character, and he's not allowed to. We call this
justice?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Maddox said he would not appeal the jury's
decision, whatever it might be.``I don't think there's a court in
this land that will give Maddox, Mason and Sharpton justice,'' he
said. ``It would be an exercise in futility to take this case any
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones needed to prove that Sharpton and the other defendants
disregarded facts and willfully avoided learning the truth when
they accused him of attacking Miss Brawley. To do so, Pagones'
lawyer, William Stanton, called 24 witnesses to the stand _
including hospital nurses who said there had never been any
evidence of rape, and a neighbor who said she had seen the
15-year-old Miss Brawley crawl into the garbage bag in which she
was later discovered, covered in excrement and racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who is representing himself, called four witnesses and
sought to show that Pagones had been protected from justice by a
corrupt legal establishment. Stephen Jackson, representing Mason,
called only one witness. Hardy asked his client, Sharpton, and
Pagones to return briefly to the stand to clarify several points.
In total, there were 29 trial witnesses and 303 exhibits and
supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pagones said he was relieved to be done with this portion
of the case, he couldn't resist a final jab at the defense:
``Mason, Maddox and Sharpton tried to call everybody except for the
relevant people _ Tawana, Glenda Brawley and Ralph King,'' he said,
referring to Miss Brawley, her mother and stepfather. ``You didn't
hear from any of them and you've got to ask why.''

INTERACTIVE PARK TO MAKE FLORIDA DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co., hoping to lure the elusive
teen-age crowd with never-before-seen interactive thrill rides,
will roll out its newest franchise DisneyQuest, an indoor theme
park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are toddlers who love Mickey Mouse and the singing and
dancing dolls on It's a Small World won't be clamoring to go.
DisneyQuest features such stomach-churning attractions as
gravity-defying virtual roller coasters designed by the riders and
air-supported rafts paddled through a roaring river surrounded by
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think DisneyQuest will draw well from teen-agers rather than
younger kids,'' said analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co.
in St. Louis. ``I'd say the core crowd is anywhere from 9 to the
early 20s. It seems that when children get over a certain age these
days, they get much more into virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The first DisneyQuest, which can hold more than 1,400 customers
at once, is being promoted as an afternoon's or evening's worth of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Admission will be $7, $15 and $20, priced according to how many
``play units'' a customer wants with credit deducted on a
rechargeable smart card. Disney spokeswoman Denise Villanueva
promised minimal waits for rides, or, as she put it, ``You won't
even know you're waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant, which has been developing the concept
since the early 1990s at Walt Disney Imagineering, will launch the
first DisneyQuest in the shadow of its massive Orlando, Fla., theme
park complex next to the Pleasure Island and Downtown Disney
attractions. The 100,000-square-foot facility will include two
food-service areas operated by the Los Angeles-based Cheesecake
Factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have any problems getting customers to the
first DisneyQuest,'' said Bannister, who toured the site with other
Wall Street analysts during a morning-long presentation in April.
``I really enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Disney approach to new projects is almost Oriental,'' said
Dennis Speigel, president of Cincinnati-based International Theme
Park Services. ``They study it for a long time before they design
and build it in order to be certain that they've got the concept
right. They demonstrated that when they opened Animal Kingdom in
Florida this spring after working on it for almost 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's go-slow approach gave Sega GameWorks _ a joint venture
between Sega, DreamWorks SKG and Universal Studios _ the chance to
build lower-cost versions of an interactive park for free-spending
teens and young adults, and it has opened a half-dozen locations
since March 1997. Several GameWorks executives came from Disney
after working on DisneyQuest's development.
</P>
<P>
   GameWorks, which already operates at two sites in Los Angeles,
plans to be in 100 sites by 2002. The sites are a combination of
nightclub, arcade and theme park, backed by entertainment titan
Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney, DisneyQuest is part of its parent's amped-up
efforts to retain its status as the premiere brand name in
entertainment through aggressive expansion into new ventures
through its 2-year-old Regional Entertainment division. Within the
last 18 months, it has launched the Club Disney play-park chain and
the ESPN Store. It will open the first ESPN Zone restaurant in
Baltimore next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers have been looking for what works in small
facilities to capture the demographic that spends the money,''
Speigel said. ``So you don't want to be a baby-sitter or go after
people over 45. What you're looking for is offering people short
bursts of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney has not disclosed how much it will spend on each
facility, but Bannister estimated they will typically cost
$30million to $40million to open. The key will be to attract local
residents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of these expansions by Disney is a recognition
that people don't only spend leisure dollars on vacation,''
Bannister said. ``They spend on evenings and weekends, so these
brand extensions are a way to get at dollars from people who are
within an hour's drive. And after those people go to DisneyQuest,
they're more likely to visit the other Disney sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Speigel, who works as a consultant to the theme-park business,
has already recommended to the developers of the Millennium Tower
complex planned for Newport, Ky., that they consider including a
DisneyQuest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a DisneyQuest could make a lot of sense for that
location,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The DisneyQuest opening Friday in Florida has four sections:
</P>
<P>
   --Explore Zone, which includes a 150-foot-long slide, the
Virtual Jungle Cruise, Hercules in the Underworld and Aladdin's
Magic Carpet Ride.
</P>
<P>
   --Create Zone, which includes CyberSpace Mountain with a
360-degree pitch-and-roll simulator, Sid's Create-a-Toy, Magic
Mirror and Living Easels.
</P>
<P>
   --Score Zone, which includes Ride the Comix!, Invasion! An Alien
Encounter, and Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam.
</P>
<P>
   --Replay Zone, which includes ``classic'' rides such as Buzz
Lightyear's AstroBlaster, Dumbo's Water Race and Mickey's Lunar
Rally.

CHILD'S PLAY

By ROB MIECH  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ken Griffey Jr. nearly popped a lung late
Tuesday afternoon when he saw David Segui's newly bleached swath of
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you singing the anthem tonight?'' Griffey yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey continued his ribbing, comparing Segui to the Spice
Girls, sending Seattle Mariners teammates Rob Ducey and Jay Buhner
into roars of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Later during batting practice, the 28-year-old Griffey displayed
the enthusiasm of an 11 year old when he played safety against a
wave of teammates trying to catch baseballs as a receiver would
catch a football.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to tell that these players, many of whom have
been mentioned in trade rumors, had lost 18 of their previous 26
games. Griffey's playful demeanor and carefree attitude must be as
contagious as the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle outfielder Glenallen Hill paused about 20 seconds when
asked about Griffey's most valuable characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he interacts with his teammates during adversity,''
Hill said. ``He's like a cornerstone. It's hard to explain the
energy he gives off. It's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the clubhouse, Griffey neatly folded a bundle of
form-fitting Nike garments, placing each in a steel footlocker. A
lengthy discussion ensued between Griffey and someone about the
uniqueness and costliness of such clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In a routine Abbott and Costello would have enjoyed, Griffey was
asked why Nike treats him so well. He quickly flashed his right
index finger. Then the four fingers of his right hand hit the air.
Then those four with three fingers from his left were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Five Griffey fingers soon appeared, then six. He slowly
continued to mark his American League MVP numbers from last season
_ 147 RBI, 56 home runs, .304 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Unspoken point made, loud and clear. The Mariners will pay
Griffey $8.5 million a season through 2000 to continue putting up
MVP-like numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Wednesday's game against the Anaheim Angels with a
league-high 26 home runs, and he'll battle Mark McGwire in pursuit
of Roger Maris' record 61 homers for a second consecutive season.
Griffey is on pace for 63.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers and his place in history, however, have scant bearing on
Griffey, the cornerstone of a franchise who is difficult to corner.
He said the game is in good hands, that he just tries to play hard
and he has no time to chat.
</P>
<P>
   A clubhouse attendant stops by with three baseballs, and Griffey
says the price of a signature has jumped to $40. ``College fund for
the kids,'' he said of his young son Trey and daughter Taryn. Then
he smiles and signs. No money is exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   He joins his teammates, who are watching an Eddie Murphy movie
on the clubhouse TV set. ``This is the funny part,'' he said,
stepping up to a couch. The room explodes. He steps back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about most things,'' he said. ``I just want to
be the best person I can be, the best player I can be. If that's
not good enough for somebody, I couldn't care less. As long as it's
good for my family and myself, those are the people I have to worry
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to be truthful to myself, and that's it. All I
have to do is go out there and play, and when I wake up the next
morning I look in the mirror and ask myself if I did the best job
that I could yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said he has never played the game to prove something to
others or himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make a mistake,'' he said, ``I'm human like everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Angels reliever Mike Holtz's thought on Tuesday. Holtz
faced Griffey in the top of the eighth inning with the Angels
leading 3-2. Although he's struggled this season, he didn't this
time, retiring Griffey on a pop-up to first baseman Cecil Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you have to be perfect,'' Holtz said. ``You
don't have time to think. He's one of the greatest hitters in the
game and it's a very stressful situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Four pitches _ no fastballs over the middle of the plate, just
three breaking balls and a key second-strike forkball down and away
_ and Holtz was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll set some great records,'' Holtz said of Griffey. ``For
me, it's a real privilege to have the honor to actually be able to
go out there and pitch to him. You sit there and say to yourself,
`I'm pitching to Ken Griffey.' At the same time, it's your job to
get him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the real highlights in baseball. He has a certain
energy about him and he just has fun playing the game. It seems the
game comes so easy to him. You like to see guys who really enjoy
going out there, who have fun and smile at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what has impressed Angels center fielder Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has fun and it shows,'' Edmonds said. ``I've always admired
his demeanor. He never seems to get frustrated. I watch him and he
never loses his cool. That's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, though, were a depressed group after Tuesday's
game. Patches of players sat before their cubicles, unemotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans take vacations to see Ken Griffey Jr. play, and my heart
goes out to them when he comes up in a big situation and he doesn't
come through,'' said Hill. ``My heart goes out to them those few
times.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the laughter, the smiles and Griffey were long gone.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beanie Babies have gone upscale.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people lined up at a Nordstrom department store
hours before it opened Wednesday so they could buy a few
hard-to-get members of the doll set causing a national hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Keating, manager at the upscale retailer's girls
department, said customers were already crowded around the entrance
when she arrived for work nearly two hours before the store's 10
a.m. opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, Wow. I couldn't believe there were that many cars
in the parking lot,'' Keating said. ``I heard from (employees in)
our housekeeping (department) that people were here in sleeping
bags at 2:30 this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies have become a cultural phenomenon. McDonald's sold
an estimated 150million Teenie Beanie Babies in two weeks this
month after a similar run last spring. Internet sites dedicated to
Beanie Babies report some of the dolls are selling for as much as
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Keating wouldn't say how many dolls were in Wednesday's shipment
but said they were all sold by 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the Topanga Plaza store's shipment included the
extremely hard-to-get Peace the Bear, Valentino, Curly and Erin
dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Erin is selling for up to $300 on the street and some other
styles are also fetching top dollar, said Keating, adding that one
shopper said she paid $100 for one of the dolls Nordstrom was
selling for $4.95. HOW'D THEY KNOW? So how did hundreds of
customers who arrived up to eight hours before opening know the
Beanie Babies would be at the Topanga Plaza Nordstrom? Nordstrom
told them.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based retail chain has a Beanie Babies hotline
``because we get so many calls about them,'' said Leslie Harris,
the company's statewide public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   When store managers in Southern California learn about a Beanie
Babies shipment, they update the hotline.
</P>
<P>
   The phone number for the L.A. area is (310) 750-2627. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Darryl Strawberry strikes out about every third
at-bat, and his batting average is about 30 points lower than the
Yankees' team average. Weeks can pass between his home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But that occasional jolt of power is why the Yankees signed him,
why his manager started him on Wednesday night. Strawberry smacked
a three-run homer in the first inning of the Yankees' 5-3 victory
against Baltimore, refreshing the first-place team, which had lost
three of its last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's 465-foot shot _ the longest home run ever hit in
the seven-year history of Camden Yards _ helped Andy Pettitte
improve his record to 8-5 as he pitched seven and one-third
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Gene Budig, the American League president,
suspended the Yankees' Mike Stanton for hitting Baltimore's Eric
Davis with a pitch on Monday night. The bad blood continues to
simmer: the Orioles' Norm Charlton knocked down Strawberry with a
fastball in the seventh inning on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre has used Strawberry intermittently, in
situations tailored to Strawberry's strengths. He almost never
plays against left-handed pitchers, and sometimes he doesn't start
against right-handed pitchers who throw particularly hard. Whereas
Tim Raines never seems to lose his swing, Strawberry is often left
searching for his, after a couple of days off, hacking wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, Strawberry felt all right. In batting
practice, he hammered a ball halfway up the scoreboard in Camden
Yards. Imagine a space shuttle launching: 480 feet, the first ball
ever hit to that spot in the ball park. A portent of good things to
come for Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of days, I took some extra b.p.,'' Strawberry
said. ``It really kind of got me going. I had a good rhythm
going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he's swinging the bat,'' Torre said. ``I like
the life in his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone said: ``Straw had a little fire in his eye. He wasn't
happy about missing the game on Wednesday night and being out of
the lineup. It was almost as if he had something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the Yankees' offense this year has been the
patience of its hitters. Even when they haven't generated hits,
they have forced the opposing pitcher to work hard and throw an
inordinate number of pitches. Boston's Pedro Martinez once needed
130 pitches to get through five and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   Without the injured stars Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter,
however, the quality of the Yankees' at-bats has eroded. The young
left fielder Ricky Ledee has replaced Williams, often going down on
one or two pitches; the free-swinging Luis Sojo has taken over for
Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, they reversed this trend against the
Orioles' Mike Mussina. Sojo walked with one out in the first
inning, the culmination of a seven-pitch at-bat and only Sojo's
second walk this season in 62 plate appearances. Paul O'Neill then
hit a bouncer through the third-base hole; Sojo stopped at second.
Mussina blew a 92-mile-an-hour fastball past Tino Martinez for a
strikeout and the second out of the inning. (Martinez was batting
.326 when Armando Benitez threw a fastball into his back May 19.
His average has subsequently dropped more than 35 points.)
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who had been 0 for 6 in his career against Mussina,
strolled to the plate, booed lustily, for being himself and for
taking a punch at Benitez last month. Mussina missed with a
curveball to run the count to 2-1. Mussina threw a tailing
fastball, his 20th pitch of the inning. Strawberry swung, and in
center field, Brady Anderson took one step back and stopped, slowly
turning around and looking skyward. A high wall looms beyond the
center-field wall, and Strawberry's home run skipped off that.
</P>
<P>
   Three innings later, Joe Girardi smacked a hanging curveball
into the left-field stands. Baltimore home runs by Rafael Palmeiro
and Joe Carter cut into the lead against Pettitte, but he was in
control after seven innings with a 5-2 advantage.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beanie Babies have gone upscale.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people lined up at a Nordstrom department store
hours before it opened Wednesday so they could buy a few
hard-to-get members of the doll set causing a national hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Keating, manager at the upscale retailer's girls
department, said customers were already crowded around the entrance
when she arrived for work nearly two hours before the store's 10
a.m. opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, Wow. I couldn't believe there were that many cars
in the parking lot,'' Keating said. ``I heard from (employees in)
our housekeeping (department) that people were here in sleeping
bags at 2:30 this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies have become a cultural phenomenon. McDonald's sold
an estimated 150million Teenie Beanie Babies in two weeks this
month after a similar run last spring. Internet sites dedicated to
Beanie Babies report some of the dolls are selling for as much as
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Keating wouldn't say how many dolls were in Wednesday's shipment
but said they were all sold by 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the Topanga Plaza store's shipment included the
extremely hard-to-get Peace the Bear, Valentino, Curly and Erin
dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Erin is selling for up to $300 on the street and some other
styles are also fetching top dollar, said Keating, adding that one
shopper said she paid $100 for one of the dolls Nordstrom was
selling for $4.95. HOW'D THEY KNOW? So how did hundreds of
customers who arrived up to eight hours before opening know the
Beanie Babies would be at the Topanga Plaza Nordstrom? Nordstrom
told them.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based retail chain has a Beanie Babies hotline
``because we get so many calls about them,'' said Leslie Harris,
the company's statewide public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   When store managers in Southern California learn about a Beanie
Babies shipment, they update the hotline.
</P>
<P>
   The phone number for the L.A. area is (310) 750-2627. &QL;

SECRETARY OF STATE RESPONDS TO OVERTURES FROM IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to   report on actual speech instead of prepared version;
rewriting throughout)  (See also IRAN-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called on Iran
Wednesday night to join the United States in drawing up ``a road
map leading to normal relations.'' She made the remark as part of
the Clinton administration's first comprehensive reply to cautious
overtures from Iran's moderate president.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after the 1979 Iranian Revolution ruptured
relations with Washington and installed a fundamentalist Islamic
government in Tehran, Albright said it was time to find ways to
bridge the gap between the two nations and the civilizations they
represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to do so would be irresponsible,'' she said, insisting
that the United States had no quarrel with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who is regarded as one of the administration's
harshest critics of Iran, changed course Wednesday night in a
speech in New York to the Asia Society, and focused on promising
aspects of the new Iranian government. In her remarks, she hailed
President Mohammad Khatami, who took office last summer, as a man
who ``deserves respect because he is the choice of the Iranian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami was elected with the strong support of women and others
who hope for a relaxation of Islamic rule, but conservatives want
to reverse the trend. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme
leader, is a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While praising Iran for taking several steps to redress
longstanding conflicts, Albright also demanded progress on human
rights, a turning aside from terrorism, and evidence that Iran was
not trying to develop weapons of mass destruction. She offered no
specific incentives or promises of additional American actions, but
said the United States was ``ready to explore further ways to build
mutual confidence and avoid misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright noted that the United States had relaxed rules on
travel to and from Iran and supported cultural and academic
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamic Republic should consider parallel steps,'' she
said. ``If such a process can be initiated and sustained in a way
that addresses the concerns of both sides, then we in the United
States can see a very different relationship. As the wall of
mistrust comes down, we can develop with the Islamic republic, when
it is ready, a road map leading to normal relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state listed steps Iran has taken in recent
months that have been viewed favorably in Washington, including
giving public support to Yasser Arafat _ and not more radical
leaders or groups _ as the voice of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Khatami had denounced terrorism and condemned the
killing of civilians in Israel in January. She also mentioned the
record of Iran in fighting drugs and its efforts to help bring
peace to Afghanistan in talks that involve both American and
Iranian officials. Administration officials also say that other
channels of communication have been opened with Iran, but would not
give details about what they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view these developments with interest, both with regard to
the possibility of Iran assuming its rightful place in the world
community, and the chance for better bilateral ties,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said that progress where it existed ``must be
balanced against the reality'' of serious obstacles in such areas
as terrorism and Iran's attempts to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical and nuclear arms. Without progress
on such issues, economic sanctions will remain in place, as will
American opposition to the development of Iranian oil and gas
pipelines, American officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright also lamented ``inflammatory and unacceptable'' Iranian
denunciations of Israel, which Tehran does not recognize. And she
asked for more progress in ending serious abuses of human rights.
She did not cite the case of Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born
British writer on whom the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
pronounced a death sentence for blasphemy in 1989 because of his
novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' in which Muslims found derogatory
references to their faith and its founder. A senior official said
Wednesday night that this issue has always been part of the
administration's human rights agenda on Iran, and it was not
necessary to mention it on every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke against a backdrop of deep and unsettling changes
in Asia that administration officials said played a part in her
opening to Iran. Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan have abruptly
changed the atmosphere across the region, provoking concerns that
Iran as well as Iraq could renew hopes of developing nuclear arms.
At the moment the United States has no leverage in Iran and is
losing support for its policy of continued sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Asian economic crisis is beginning to have
ripple effects around the world, adding to the problems India and
Pakistan will face because of the loss of World Bank loans and
other financial aid as a result of the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis figured in Albright's speech. On the
day that President Clinton stepped in to support the faltering
Japanese currency, she told the Japanese that ``more needs to be
done'' to contain the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Indonesia, which she described as ``a country of critical
strategic importance'' to the United States, Albright stopped short
of endorsing President B.J. Habibie's proposals for the gradual
establishment of a genuinely democratic electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   But in a gesture of confidence, she announced that all American
diplomats evacuated from the country in May during the unrest that
led to the fall of President Suharto would now return and that the
United States would step up aid in food and support for democratic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright also touched on Korea, India, Pakistan and
China, reiterating administration policies, the largest part of her
address was devoted to Iran and the administration's long-delayed
response to overtures made to the United States by Khatami in an
interview with CNN in January. In that interview, Khatami, who was
elected a year ago despite the opposition of the country's
conservative religious leadership, spoke of his respect for the
American government because it reflected ``the great American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright went out of her way in her speech to demonstrate that
the United States was not ``anti-Islamic'' and that Americans would
do well to learn to understand ``Eastern civilization and Islamic
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Islam is the fastest-growing religious faith in the United
States,'' she said. ``We respect deeply its moral teachings and its
role as a source of inspiration and instruction for hundreds of
millions of people around the world.''

TRAINING PARTNERS VIE FOR RECORD IN 100-METER DASH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change `yard' to `meter' in hed. No other changes.)   (ja)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Athens, Ato Boldon won a 100-meter dash Wednesday in 9.86
seconds, missing the world record by two-hundredths of a second.
Only two men have run faster in track and field's glamour race.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, an ocean and two half-continents away, Maurice
Greene heard the result and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of stuck on that time,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said it proudly and with a smile because Boldon is his
training partner and good friend. One or the other seems about to
break the world record. Or perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is a 23-year-old American. Boldon is 24 and runs for his
native Trinidad. They train in Los Angeles under John Smith, a
former Olympian and world record-holder who has become track and
field's sprint guru.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will run the 100 meters and maybe the 200 in the U.S.
outdoor championships, which start Friday and end Sunday in New
Orleans. Because the meet is limited to American citizens, Boldon
went to Athens for the Tsiklitiria international, a lesser
competition, and beat Frank Fredericks of Namibia (timed in 9.93
seconds) by two feet. Later, Boldon won the 200 meters in 19.88
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The only accepted 100-meter times faster than Boldon's Wednesday
were 9.84 seconds by Donovan Bailey of Canada in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics and 9.85 by Leroy Burrell in 1994. Previous 9.86's had
been run by Carl Lewis, Fredericks, Greene and Boldon, with Boldon
doing it two months ago in Walnut, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There have been faster 100's that do not count. Ben Johnson of
Canada ran 9.79 in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, only to lose the gold
medal and the world record when he tested positive for illegal
bodybuilding drugs. Obadele Thompson of Barbados ran 9.69 in 1996
in El Paso, aided by a following wind far over the
4.473-miles-an-hour limit for record recognition. Greene has run
9.79 this year, aided by a lesser but still excessive wind.
</P>
<P>
   Greene faces the 100-meter quarterfinals and semifinals Friday
night and the final Saturday night. In separate interviews
Wednesday, Greene and Smith said Greene was ready to break the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the right conditions,'' Smith said, ``Maurice will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said: ``My goal is to break the record and as soon as
possible. I'd like to do it every time I step on the track. If Ato
breaks it, I'll be happy for him, and I've just got to break it the
next day.''

BENNETT'S BALLAD TO A `GOOD LIFE'  
 A FAVOR FROM THE BOSS  
 GOOD DEEDS  
 LUCKY DAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can learn a lot about yourself by reading your own
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wait a minute, this is a good read,''' declared Tony
Bennett, who left the writing to Will Friedwald, the author of
``Sinatra! The Song Is You: A Singer's Art'' (Da Capo, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   And that was only the opening of ``The Good Life,'' which Pocket
Books is scheduled to publish in the fall. Friedwald is still
working on the manuscript. ``He's now in the 1970s,'' Bennett said.
``He interviews almost everybody I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   And dredges up things that Bennett was too busy living his life
to pay attention to; for example, that he received a presidential
citation in the 1950s. ``I was the GI who went the farthest with my
education under the GI Bill of Rights,'' Bennett said. ``That just
knocked me out.'' (He attended the American Theater Wing, later
known as the Actors Studio. ``The best bel canto teacher, the best
coach for teaching popular singing and jazz, and Stanislavsky's
secretary, who performed with Stanislavsky, as an acting coach,''
Bennett said.)
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that becoming a co-author was not his own idea.
``They called me,'' he said of the editors at Pocket Books. ``I'm
at the right age. I'm going on 72. It's just naturally a time when
you start reflecting, even though you don't like to retrogress.
It's a time when you can see a story in all the different things
that have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Boss, Always the Boss
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner saw five teen-agers spray-painting graffiti
on Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one with the can,'' Ray Negron recalled Wednesday.
``He's telling me he's going to have me arrested, damaging Yankee
Stadium, sacred ground, etc. They had a holding cell downstairs.
He's telling me he's taking me there, a little police station. I'm
begging him to give me a chance. He asks me, why should I give me a
chance? I said, `Because my mother's going to kill me.' He makes a
quick about-face. He takes me to the Yankee clubhouse. The door
opens up, he pushes me in and says, `Give this guy a uniform. He's
got damage he's got to work for.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was 25 years ago. Negron was a batboy for a couple of
seasons, then played with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization.
Later, he returned to the Yankees, working with Reggie Jackson and,
more recently, Dwight Gooden. He left the Yankees in January to
work for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But he still has the boss' telephone number, which is how
Negron's 13-year-old son, Jon-Erik, came to be a batboy for a day
at Yankee Stadium last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did great,'' Negron said. ``People love to trash George.
But think about it: That was a million-to-one shot that George
Steinbrenner was going to catch me. I hope this doesn't start a
whole flurry of kids doing graffiti at Yankee Stadium. Look out.
People don't realize George was a track star in school.''
</P>
<P>
   `Seinfeld' and Ford Benefit Charities
</P>
<P>
   Old ``Seinfeld'' scripts keep surfacing. The Urban Justice
Center, a nonprofit advocacy organization for the homeless, said it
would auction a script for the last episode of the long-running
sitcom at a benefit next week. The center got the script from one
of its directors, Phyllis Louis-Dreyfus, the stepmother of Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, who played Elaine on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a silver cover, very fancy,'' said Ann Vermes, the
center's director of development. ``I'm guarding it with my life.''
A script from the final episode of the show about nothing is worth
something: Ms. Vermes said she had read on the Internet that a
similar script sold for $9,100 on the night the final episode was
broadcast last month ... Anne Ford, a daughter of Henry Ford II and
a great-granddaughter of the founder of Ford Motor Co., is pledging
$1 million to the National Center for Learning Disabilities, a
Manhattan group of which she is chairwoman. Her commitment is
personal: her daughter, Allegra Ford, was diagnosed with severe
learning disabilities 20 years ago. ``I determined, back when my
daughter was very young,'' she said, ``that I must help all those
parents like me, who feel helpless in a world where
misunderstandings about learning disabilities can devastate you.
Parents still feel uncomfortable about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Randall at Center Stage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Randall got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, his public relations agency sent out faxes saying
that Randall, 78, was ``pacing with anxiety.'' His wife, Heather,
28, was pregnant, and Randall hoped the baby would be born on a
Monday, ``because in his 60 years onstage, Tony Randall has never
missed a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Jefferson Salvini Randall was born at Beth-Israel
Hospital on Monday, Randall's day off from ``The Sunshine Boys''
with Jack Klugman at the Lyceum Theater. The 7-pound, 2-ounce boy
is the second child for the Randalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could write such a story?'' Randall said Wednesday. ``I
always thought my father was too old to have children. I guess it's
repeating family history. I think my father was in his 60s when we
were born.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby was named for two 19th-century performers. ``One was a
comedian, one was a tragedian,'' Randall said. ``He'll be the
master of them all.''

RANGERS LOSE TO ATHLETICS, 3-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This time don't blame the starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only part of the Rangers' game that stood up last
night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   But John Burkett's strong seven innings weren't enough to
overcome defensive lapses or the offensive futility against Oakland
starter Kenny Rogers, and the Rangers' slide continued with a 3-2
loss. The Rangers have lost six of seven games and are 9-14 since
May 24 after a 31-16 start. They've lost nine of their past 12
games at The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're losing it's tough,'' Burkett said. ``But I haven't
played with a team yet that went through a whole season playing
well. In '93, I was with the Giants and we won 103 games, but we
lost eight in a row at home in August. We're in a low point right
now, but we've got a team that's going to keep going out there and
firing away and taking our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' defensive mistakes came from two of their more
reliable defenders. First baseman Will Clark committed two errors
that led to two unearned runs, and shortstop Kevin Elster's bobble
on a possible rally-killing double-play ball in the second led to
another run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the rest of the team, but I didn't help
John tonight,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave three runs away,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Our
defense was not been very sharp tonight to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been lately. Starting pitching has been the focal
point of the Rangers' troubles, but their defense has fallen off as
well. The Rangers, who won a division title two years ago by
leading the league in defense, have committed 17 errors in their
past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was missing last night as well, even though a
left-hander was on the mound. The Rangers were hitting a
league-best .345 against left-handers before last night's game but
managed just four hits through seven scoreless innings against
Rogers. Roberto Kelly's two-run homer in the eighth made it a 3-2
game, but the Rangers could do no more against Oakland relievers
Mike Fetters and Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's troubles started in the first inning when he couldn't
handle Ben Grieve's sharply hit two-out grounder. The Athletics
followed that with a single from Matt Stairs and a double by Mike
Blowers to take a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada started the second inning with a single, and
Elster could only get a force after bobbling Ryan Christenson's
grounder. A.J. Hinch's single put runners on first and third, and
Christenson scored when Clark threw too late to home on Rickey
Henderson's chopper.
</P>
<P>
   The final defensive mistake came in the eighth, and it proved
even more painful after Kelly's home run. With two outs and runners
at first and third, Tejada broke for second base. Catcher Ivan
Rodriguez's throw had him beaten so badly that Tejada stopped and
was caught in a rundown. But Clark, trailing on the play, failed to
catch a short toss from second baseman Luis Alicea and Blowers
raced home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I booted one, and on the other I got too close to the
runner,'' Clark said. ``We had a collision, and that's when the
ball popped out. I'm not going to make excuses. When things are
going well, you can get away with mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Rangers aren't going well. The frustration is
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three weeks ago, it seemed no matter how many runs the other
team scored, we would score more,'' Burkett said. ``No matter what
the situation, we would win the ballgame. Now it's the other way.
But I'm sure we'll get it turned around.''

   Four-run ninth &QL; 
against Brantley &QL; 
sinks Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Add Jeff Brantley to the list of high-profile closers the Astros
have beaten and battered this season, particularly in the past nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros hijacked Brantley for four runs in the bottom of the
ninth en route to a 6-5 come-from-behind victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals on Wednesday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Astros' 20th come-from-behind victory of the season,
and the 11th time they have won in their last at-bat. If Brantley
needs a support group, he might get some sympathy from Detroit's
Todd Jones or Cincinnati's Jeff Shaw. Both fell prey to the Astros'
ninth-inning magic in the past nine days, Jones being victimized
twice.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 37,417 was in place at the beginning of the game, but
about 10,000 of them headed for the exits after Mark McGwire's
final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one (thing to say) for those people who left after
(McGwire's) last at-bat,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``They must not have been following this club very closely in the
last couple of weeks. We do have a habit of pulling off some
miraculous finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   This one was a heart-stopper. The Astros entered the ninth
trailing by four runs but showed the confidence of Michael Jordan
on a layup. Derek Bell drove home a run with a sacrifice fly, Jeff
Bagwell hit a tying two-run homer, and Brad Ausmus provided the
slam dunk with a game-winning single off Curtis King, who was
unsuccessful in his attempt to rescue Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for something over the plate,'' said
Ausmus, who was 3-for-4. ``That's probably the most fun I've had on
a hit this year. It's great when the guys come out and hit you on
the top of the head and you get to walk off the field a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good offensive club, and you know we're going to
score runs, so you can never count us out. Four runs in the ninth
inning is a possibility for us. On the scoreboard, it looks worse
than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros increased their lead over the Chicago Cubs to three
games in the National League Central Division. They also pushed the
Cardinals 9{ games off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' rally spoiled a strong outing by Cardinals starter
Todd Stottlemyre and took Astros starter Jose Lima off the hook for
what was shaping up to be a hard-luck loss. Stottlemyre, the
Cardinals' only healthy front-line starter, held the Astros to two
runs in 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lima matched Stottlemyre's effectiveness on the mound, but a
crucial eighth-inning throwing error cost the Astros starter a
chance at his eighth victory and would have cost his team the game
if not for another exhibition of late-inning magic.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 2 and runners on first and second, Lima
pounced off the mound to field Tom Pagnozzi's sacrifice-bunt
attempt. Lima had a play at third base on pinch runner David
Howard, but the pitcher's throw to third baseman Bill Spiers ended
up in the Cardinals' bullpen down the left-field line. Willie McGee
scored all the way from first, and the Cardinals added one more run
in the inning to take a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another large crowd came out to watch McGwire, and this time he
lived up to the hype. After going 0-for-3 on Tuesday, McGwire was
3-for-5 with two singles and his 32nd homer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I was very happy about (the crowd leaving so
early),'' Bagwell said. ``I understand people want to see Mark, but
I'd like to think they'd also be coming to see the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing some pretty good baseball. We're a
resilient club, and that's a good feeling to have this early in the
season. A win like this was a big lift for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre struggled with his control in the first inning,
walking the bases loaded and giving Carl Everett a chance to do
some damage. Everett, who is hitting .400 with the bases loaded
this season, grounded out to second to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were more efficient in the second inning, turning two
singles and a sacrifice bunt into a 1-0 lead. Craig Biggio singled
home Ausmus, who hit a one-out single and moved into scoring
position on Lima's perfectly placed bunt.
</P>
<P>
   To say the Cardinals tied the score in a hurry would be an
understatement. One swing of McGwire's bat resulted in one of the
quickest home runs you'll ever see. Lima got ahead 1-2 in the count
and tried to blow an inside fastball by McGwire, whose line-drive
home run exited the confines of the playing field with warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   Everett reclaimed the Astros' lead on Stottlemyre's first pitch
of the sixth inning. The center fielder crushed Stottlemyre's
offering for his sixth homer of the season and his first at the
Astrodome in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Cardinals had an immediate response for the
Astros. Left fielder Brian Hunter led off the seventh with his
third home run. It was the 14th homer surrendered by Lima this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' eighth-inning rally started with a heady play by
veteran third baseman Gary Gaetti, who surprised the Astros with a
line-hugging bunt down the third-base line. Howard entered the game
as a pinch runner for Gaetti and moved to second on McGee's sharp
single to right.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it appeared things were going to fall apart for the
Astros, but they've gotten to be pretty good at working miracles in
the final inning.

A BIT BORING, YES, BUT WESTPHAL HAS MOXIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The most recent photograph of George Karl published in
the P-I showed the former Sonic coach standing in shorts atop a bar
in a local bistro, baseball hat backwards and beer in hand,
exhorting his fans at a self-thrown farewell bash.
</P>
<P>
   In the dozens _ maybe hundreds, if things go as Wally Walker
hopes _ of photographs the P-I will publish of Karl's successor,
Paul Westphal will never be captured in so earthy a repose.
</P>
<P>
   Pity.
</P>
<P>
   In the personality portion of the Sonics' little comparison
contest, Karl dunks all over Westphal _ just a crotch-grab away
from a full Kemp. Karl's engaging volatility was appealing as the
class clown.
</P>
<P>
   Until, of course, it's time to pass a hard test. Hearing funny
mouth noises from the back of the room is not a help.
</P>
<P>
   In the basketball portion of the comparison, Westphal matches up
a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal didn't make the NBA's list of top 50 players, but if
the list were expanded to 100, he would have. The Phoenix Suns'
leading scorer was voted to the NBA's first team three times in the
late 1970s, when he was perhaps the chief nemesis of the Sonics'
powerhouse teams. Karl as a player was a gritty sub who blew out
his body taking too many charging fouls from George McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, Westphal prepped for his current duties with three
years at teensy colleges in Arizona before spending four years as a
Suns assistant. Karl banged around the CBA and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As an NBA coach, Karl has been fired three times, Westphal once,
but he had a later start. They have each lost to the Bulls in an
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   And they have both had top-seeded playoff teams on the precipice
against eighth-seeded teams.
</P>
<P>
   Difference was, Karl lost and Westphal won.
</P>
<P>
   The year before the Sonics' suffered their ignominious
first-round loss to the Denver Nuggets _ the first and only time a
No. 1 seed has lost in the opening round _ Westphal, in his rookie
year as Suns head coach with a team that won 62 regular-season
games, lost the first two games at home to the eighth-seeded
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, Westphal pulled off one of the more stunning coaching
stunts of the '90s _ he flat-out predicted his team would sweep the
Lakers and win the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Durned if he wasn't right. They went on to the Finals, going
through San Antonio and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else was I going to do?'' Westphal said Wednesday,
grinning at the recollection. ``I heard later (his Suns' bosses)
wondered, `What is he doing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really felt we were a better team than L.A., and I
wanted my team to know it. If faced with the same situation again,
I don't think I'd do it. But it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   One good move does not a coach make. But in the thin line
between success and firing in the NBA, imagine what would have
happened had Karl finagled one more win over the Nuggets in a year
that Michael Jordan played baseball and the Houston Rockets became
champions.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is the Sonics would have won the 1994 title, Karl
would still be employed as Sonic coach and Westphal would still be
helping coach his local high school team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many ironies in coaching,'' Westphal said. ``It's
not an exact science. You do what you think is best at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is as good a reason as any to think the Sonics are in
quality hands with Westphal. The NBA remains a player's game, which
Westphal knows and is happy about. He doesn't have an unusual
defensive system, nor was his offense as Suns coach known for its
triple-post majesty.
</P>
<P>
   He's a proven manager of egos and game strategy, and is secure
in himself. That's all Walker needed, all the players want, and all
Sonic fans should worry about in qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think you'll miss Karl's passion borne of his
ultra-competitiveness, well, Westphal has been brought to agonized
tears, too.
</P>
<P>
   When they were Sonic teammates in the 1980-81 season, Walker
remembers going to dinner on the road at a Mexican restaurant with
Westphal. For no reason other than he couldn't help making a
competition out of a meal, Westphal asked Walker to buy him dinner
if he ate all the jalapeno peppers in a bowl on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Walker sampled one, felt his tongue dissolve, and said, ``You're
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Westphal knew he was in trouble, his face
turning Soviet red and sweat coming in rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he wouldn't back down,'' Walker said. ``He said he was
going to do it, and he got them all in his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a pitcher of margaritas, a tubful of sour cream and most
of the evening before the fire was put out, but not before his
tablemates exhausted themselves in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best $6 worth of entertainment I've ever had,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   You know, catching Westphal in a bar might not be so boring
after all.

WESTPHAL: `THIS IS A GREAT JOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Calm. Clean-cut. Collected.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal was every bit as what the Sonics prescribed the
day they decided to change their coaching situation.
</P>
<P>
   As Westphal was ushered in Wednesday as the Sonics' new head
coach, he sat with one leg folded across his knee. When quizzed
about the future of Sonic basketball, his dashing retorts were
accompanied by light satire and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, 47, exuded confidence in himself. He certainly wore no
signs of being intimidated by the success of his predecessor,
George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the majority of my time here won't be talking about
what George did,'' Westphal said. ``I respect the job that George
did ... but I wasn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal filled one job requirement like a waterfall would a
sand pail. Indeed, he is no George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   He will play center Jim McIlvaine more. He is looking forward to
developing young talent. It does not hurt that Westphal will never
be named to the NBA's All-Interview team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further we got into the process, the more evident it
became that Paul was the right man,'' said Walker, who satisfied
his self-imposed deadline of hiring a coach by the June 24 NBA
draft. ``His leadership, his people skills, his knowledge of the
game, the fact that he is one of the most competitive people alive,
and you combine that with the fact he's been a successful
competitor at every level, led us to this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal signed a four-year deal, with the Sonics having an
option on the fourth year. Financial terms were not disclosed, but
the contract is loaded with incentives. Sources said Westphal will
earn between $1 and $1.5 million in base salary each season.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's record as head coach of the Phoenix Suns was 191-88
(.685) in three-plus seasons. Westphal, who coached the Suns to the
1993 NBA Finals in his rookie year as coach, also has a reputation
of handling veteran and star players well.
</P>
<P>
   He was a five-time All-Star guard who has become a player's
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to coach the way that I would have liked to have been
coached,'' Westphal said. ``It's a player's game. You have to
create an environment where they can play up to their potential. As
a player, I would like a coach to listen to me, then he has to have
the last say.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is believed to have been Walker's choice all along.
Walker also interviewed Bob Hill, Paul Silas and former Karl
assistant Bob Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Walker acknowledged the Sonics waited until after the NBA Finals
were completed to make the hire. But once it became apparent the
indecisiveness of Chicago coach Phil Jackson would hold up the
process, Walker moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   He offered Westphal the job the same night the Bulls clinched
their sixth championship. Westphal, who was in San Francisco at the
time, then met with Sonic point guard Gary Payton Monday in
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's agent, Lonnie Cooper, worked out the contract details
with Walker on Tuesday. Westphal said his meeting with Payton was
purely a get-to-know-you gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like, unfairly, that it was some kind of final
judgment _ to pass Gary Payton's test or something. That wasn't it
at all,'' Westphal said of his lunch with Payton. ``... It was just
a nice time to get together and get to know the new coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal met only with Payton. He plans to talk with the rest of
the team in the coming days. Westphal will also interview assistant
coaches, including the Sonics' staff under Karl: Dwane Casey, Tim
Grgurich and Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Stotts, who was Karl's No. 1 assistant, said he would like
to follow Karl wherever he lands. Walker emphasized his desire to
retain Grgurich, who has a special relationship with Payton and was
instrumental in helping Payton become a superstar player.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Westphal is faced with two important questions: Can he keep
the Sonics as formidable as they have been?
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is known for being an offensive-minded coach. He is
taking over a team that relied heavily on defense during Karl's 6{
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that there is any one way to play basketball
in that we'll play slow ball or fast-break basketball. ... You have
to mold the system to fit the players that you have, offensively
and defensively,'' Westphal said. ``And the idea is to be ahead at
the end of the game. My style, if anything, is to figure out how to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't write some book saying this is the Paul Westphal
system on how to play basketball. ... All I'll try to do is get
this team playing as best as it can play, and see how far we can
get in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, though, did plot his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   He did not interview for many coaching jobs during his 18-month
hiatus. Westphal explored the Denver vacancy last year, didn't like
the situation and removed himself from consideration. Westphal was
up for the Dallas job after he was fired in 1996. He lost that
position to former Bulls assistant Jim Cleamons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for a great job and this is a great job. I
couldn't be happier,'' said Westphal, who seemed content living in
Phoenix and coaching a high school basketball team led by his
18-year-old son, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, there is no wonder Westphal has surfaced again on
the NBA coaching scene. Only his well-known friendship with
ultra-conservative and controversial talk-show host, Rush Limbaugh,
raises eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush is a nice guy. He's a good friend. I don't apologize for
that,'' Westphal said. ``A person's politics doesn't have anything
to do with whether I can be their friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker downplayed the fact that he and Westphal played for the
1980-81 Sonics. They have spoken at least once a year over the past
decade. Walker and Westphal spoke at least twice this past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and I have been friends,'' said Walker, who is entering
the final year of his five-year contract. ``... I just wanted to
make sure we got the best person for the job.''

COMPETITIVE, CREATIVE, WESTPHAL HAS ADMIRERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Westphal is formal yet casual. From his appearance, you
think you are being shown the living room _ only to discover it's
the family room after all.
</P>
<P>
   He is conservative yet liberal. One of his best friends is Rush
Limbaugh, the right-wing political commentator. Then you turn
around and notice that Westphal likes to draw up unconventional
plays, make boastful comments and rule his troops with leniency.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think the Sonics hired a total opposite to George
Karl, take another look. Westphal is known for being a bench coach,
a player's coach, a creative coach.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of the moves he made as an All-Star, Westphal can be
deceiving. Perhaps he wears a white collar. But he is a
button-down, suck-it-up kind of coach, expecting the most from his
players and himself. The new Sonics leader is a highly competitive
person who does not seem that way because of the smile that usually
accompanies the wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be a beard or an anguished expression on the
sidelines this season. The same energy that Karl bared from every
pore is secluded in Westphal, but raging nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul appears relaxed like Larry Bird,'' said Suns coach Danny
Ainge, who played under Westphal for three seasons in Phoenix.
``You don't know if the fire is burning. I can assure you, the fire
is burning.''
</P>
<P>
   You would know that if you have ever tried to beat Westphal at
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate losing more than I love winning,'' he said. ``If my
image is that I'm so laid-back that I don't care what happens, then
that's so far away from who I am, it's like coming out of the
Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is what that feeling drives him to do. One night in the
early 1980s, after Westphal was traded to Seattle for Dennis
Johnson, Westphal engaged in endless games of H-O-R-S-E with
then-Bellevue Community College basketball coach Ernie Woods at the
BCC gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played all night long and by the time we left, it was
daylight,'' Woods said. ``Nobody wanted to go home a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's wife, Cindy, won't play Monopoly with him anymore
because of how he acts when he loses.
</P>
<P>
   But Westphal loves games and challenges. He used to invite
friends over to his house for a Superstars-like competition, a
decathlon of events featuring basketball and volleyball in his
swimming pool, backgammon, tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, it was his own international Olympics,'' said
Keith Erickson, a former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't beat you straight-up, he will invent ways to win,
not by cheating but by innovation. This type of originality must
have been attractive to Sonics president Wally Walker. When Phoenix
and Boston met in the 1975 NBA Finals, Garfield Heard hit the
turnaround shot to force a third overtime at Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal made it possible. Phoenix trailed by one. A second
remained. The Suns had the ball under the Celtics' basket. The Suns
did not have a timeout but Westphal called one anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the penalty was a technical foul, but the offending
team kept the ball. Boston made the free throw, but Phoenix got the
ball at midcourt, resulting in a higher-percentage inbounds pass to
Heard.
</P>
<P>
   While coaching at Phoenix, Westphal's Suns were in a similar
situation. Phoenix trailed by one. Everyone knew that Charles
Barkley would get the ball, including the opponent, which swarmed
him. Westphal instructed Oliver Miller to throw the ball from
midcourt and bounce it off the glass, hoping the ricochet would end
up in the cutting Barkley's hands. The play did not work, but
Westphal scored anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul always had a feel for the game,'' said former Suns coach
Cotton Fitzsimmons. ``He thinks ahead. He's imaginative. He's like
Columbus _ he'll take chances on new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes up with things nobody else would dream of,'' Erickson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But then came a few nightmares. Expectations grew like Miller,
engulfing the Valley of the Sun. After Westphal guided the Suns to
the NBA Finals in his first season in 1992-93, they were eliminated
two years in a row by Houston in the Western Conference semifinals
_ in Game 7 both times.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of injuries and apparent player unhappiness,
Westphal was fired the next season on Jan. 16, 1996, with the Suns
languishing at 14-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfair what happened to him,'' Charles Barkley said
Wednesday from the clubhouse at Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale, Ariz.
``He didn't deserve to be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal had a different set of rules for Barkley and that
disturbed at least one player, A.C. Green. But Westphal figured it
was necessary to cater to his star player, in the same way Phil
Jackson tolerated Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul either had to alienate Charles or work with him,''
Erickson said. ``Everybody has to realize you're going to make
concessions for a superstar. Players on the team held grudges
against Charles and Paul, which was absolutely asinine.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ainge: ``Nobody can coach Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   How Westphal plans to deal with the cantankerous Gary Payton
will be critical to the Sonics' success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have to handle Gary, Gary should just do his damn
job. He's making $10 million to play,'' Barkley said. ``He should
enjoy playing for Westphal.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley did. ``Y'all got a very good coach and a great person,''
he said. ``His character is beyond reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Karl once had a non-drinking clause in his contract,
Westphal is a teetotaler. When the Suns played the Bulls in the
Finals, Ainge recalled a revealing story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us he wanted to win the championship and celebrate
with soda pop instead of champagne,'' Ainge said. ``He wanted to
set a good example.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is a religious man, but Ainge knows him better as one
who possesses patience. Undoubtedly, Barkley was his instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so easy to yell and scream, but he would deal with
things the right way because he has his life in the right
perspective,'' Ainge said. ``He never made it seem like it was
panic. He got great performances as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   You might see him smiling, even joking at the strangest times,
times when Karl would be the tormented soul on TV screens
everywhere. Westphal once mockingly gave Barkley the ``choke'' sign
after Sir Charles missed a big shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches look like death on the sidelines,'' Ainge said.
``It gets to you as a player. Paul has a tendency to laugh at a
mistake you just made. It's his way of loosening a player up. He
builds confidence in people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some players grew to disdain the treatment he gave
Barkley, Westphal originally had their support. He has a long
rotation, doling out minutes to many players.
</P>
<P>
   As with Karl, Westphal plays hunches. During the '93 Western
Conference finals against the Sonics, he started Tom Chambers, then
Cedric Ceballos, then Richard Dumas at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Paul gets up in the morning, if his dog licks his left
hand, he goes with Richard,'' Ceballos said at the time. ``If his
dog licks his right hand, he starts me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dumas: ``I'm gonna go shoot that dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal drills his teams in training camp and practices more
leisurely during the season, sparing the ailing veterans. He will
only criticize in private and crack down when vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy needs it, I'll flex my muscles or hit him with the
hammer,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   He won Barkley over with a proclamation at an astounding time.
After the Lakers took the first two games _ in Phoenix _ of their
playoff series, Westphal publicly stated that the Suns would storm
back to win the first-round series in '93.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a defining moment,'' Barkley said. ``That let me know
he had great confidence in all of us. He treated everybody like a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal has not returned to coaching mainly for two reasons _
he has been waiting for the right opportunity and his son, Michael,
to graduate from high school. They both occurred this month.
</P>
<P>
   Now he heads to Seattle for his next game of chance.

OLYMPIC CLUB HAS TOUGH REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The hearts that have been left here in past U.S.
Opens include those belonging to some of the greatest names in the
history of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson all succumbed to the
siren song that whispers from the Cyprus-lined fairways and tangled
rough of The Olympic Club Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan called this the ``longest short course in the world''
after losing the Open to unknown Jack Fleck in 1955. The course
crushed Palmer in the 1966 Open during a playoff loss to Billy
Casper, after Palmer led the final round by five strokes with five
holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   And Watson was humbled by Scott Simpson in 1987 when Simpson
played the last six holes with three birdies and three pars to
erase Watson's one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   In those three previous Opens here, only four players have
managed to break par over the duration of the tournament. All this
from a 6,826-yard course that has no water that comes into play and
only one lonely fairway bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the next victims left looking in frustration at the
stunning views of the Golden Gate and Baghdad by the Bay? Odds are
that long hitters like Tiger Woods and Fred Couples will have
difficulty avoiding the inevitable disasters that lurk around every
twist and turn. This is not a course where corners can be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you won't see many birdies,'' Couples said. ``A guy
who plays well may have three birdies, two bogeys and all pars. If
you do that for two days, and hang in there for two more, you can
win. But I don't think 5- or 6-under is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even par could even be a score to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the history of the course and the great
players it has devoured, Woods responded that a win at Olympic
would be as memorable as his 1997 Masters victory for that very
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if I could (win),'' Woods said. ``One,
because we have had some great moments that have happened here, but
I think for me more importantly is that this is near where I used
to live. I used to live 20 minutes down the road at Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   But local course knowledge isn't much of a guarantee for success
at Olympic, as witnessed by Watson, another Stanford product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there are bittersweet memories,'' said Watson, whose
loss to Simpson represented the closest he would ever get to
winning the coveted Open.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, the course is likely to be even more difficult
than in 1987. The toughest hole that year, the par four, 468-yard
17th, is 40 yards longer. It normally plays as a 522-yard par five
for members.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, according to Watson, is that the poa annua rough
is longer, deeper and more sinister than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rough is the worst rough, most difficult rough that I
have seen in the U.S. Open _ ever,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success will be out-thinking the course and avoiding
the temptation to try for heroics, said one of golf's greatest
shotmakers, Jack Nicklaus, playing in his 42nd Open. He won four of
them, but finished tied for 46th at Olympic in 1987 and third
behind Casper and Palmer in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course certainly is a formidable test,'' Nicklaus
said. ``And the ability to score on the course is going to largely
involve manipulation of the golf ball and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nicklaus, experience will be the key, which means that
players like Watson could be considered among the favorites,
especially with Watson coming off of a win May 31 at the Mastercard
Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly a golf course that most of the young kids
today will not have experienced,'' Nicklaus said. ``Certainly, some
of the more experienced guys will probably have a little bit of an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples agreed: ``I'm not saying you can't have a fluke winner,
because everyone is talented. But I think it's going to take
someone with a lot of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, 48, laughed when told that he was considered one of
those who could possibly win the event because of his experience at
Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, `possible winner' from `not a chance' is a big upgrade
for me, isn't it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson wouldn't rule out Woods' chances of another major
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tiger is a threat any time he tees it up,'' he said.
``He can play this course. He is going to have to lay up with on a
lot of holes here, but he can lay up with a 2-iron and still hit it
out as far as me with my driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one of the young players who might do well here is 1997
British Open champion Justin Leonard, who has the solid, all-around
game that Olympic requires. Leonard overcomes his inexperience with
measured precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to come in here overconfident,'' Leonard said.
``I'm a very patient player, which I really think pays off in this
kind of event.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson offered this assessment after comparing the course
conditions now with 1987: ``This year the rough is definitely
longer. I think it is as long and tough as anywhere we have played.
... Overall, the course looks pretty much like I remember. Yeah, it
is tough. It is just a tough, real fair golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how he plays this week, the course will forever be
there embedded in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has changed my life in that I always will be known as a
U.S. Open champion,'' Simpson said. ``... At least that one week, I
accomplished something incredible.''

   CZAR-BURIAL (Moscow) _ The burial next month of the

family had been planned as an occasion rich in pomp and symbolism,
but with the recent announcements that neither the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church nor President Boris Yeltsin will be there

   HEALTH-HEART (Boston) _ It's a rare but fatal danger in the
world of sports: A young athlete receives a sharp but fairly mild
blow on the chest, then collapses and dies. Researchers using pigs
to investigate this phenomenon, commotio cordis, have found that
there is a 15-millisecond period in the normal cardiac cycle where

   JAPAN-ECON-ASSESS (Tokyo) _ As currency trading resumed Thursday
morning in Asia, the central question was simply: How much has
changed? Has Japan, in making pledges Wednesday on an economic
program to strengthen its economy, really committed itself to
far-reaching changes? Do its pledges mark a turning point that will
lead to a firmer yen and to greater economic stability for Asia as
a whole? Or are they merely warmed-over promises from yesterday? If
so, will the currency intervention by the United States and Japan
be overwhelmed within a few days by market forces, leading to an
ever-cheaper yen and to greater economic turmoil around the world?
For now there are more questions than answers, but there is
evidence for both propositions. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

THIGH STYMIES YOUNG

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Eric Young says he won't need to go on the disabled
list, but his strained right thigh is not getting better. He was
scratched from Wednesday's Los Angeles Dodgers lineup with
continued soreness even though he stole a base and scored in
Tuesday's 10-6 loss to the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The thigh, first injured May 21 in Chicago, forced him out of
the next three games. He came out in the third inning of the June 9
game against Oakland and did not play the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is chronic, but it doesn't seem to be
getting better,'' Dodgers manager Bill Russell said. ``It's a
strange injury. He stole a base last night, but he has trouble
running from first to third or second to home. We hope the night
off will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Young says his condition is day-to-day, ``and I don't think I
will have to go on the D.L. But it's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is expected to play tonight against the Rockies, his
former team. His day off against Oakland preceded the
Dodgers-Colorado series at Dodger Stadium.
</P>

   __ Martinez diagnosed: Wednesday, right-hander Ramon Martinez
saw Angels orthopedist Lewis Yocum, who confirmed the cartilage

   Today, Martinez will be seen by noted orthopedist William
Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has three options: He can have surgery and miss the
rest of the season; undergo therapy and rehabilitation and attempt
to come back as he did last season when he missed two months with a
torn rotator cuff; or he can skip a start and try to pitch during
the Dodgers' next homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez underwent an MRI exam by Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe
after coming out of Sunday's game. Yocum examined the MRI and said
Martinez has the same cartilage tear that forced Todd Hollandsworth
to undergo season-ending shoulder surgery last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot tell the severity of an injury unless you go in
(surgically),'' head trainer Charlie Strasser said. ``Not everybody
sees the same things on an MRI. Ramon wanted to get as many
opinions as possible to decide what he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Johnson leaving: Catcher Charles Johnson will leave the club
after tonight's game to attend the funeral of his maternal
grandmother Ethel Watkins, who died of cancer at the age of 59.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was reared by Watkins after the age of 8 in Ft. Pierce,
Fla., an hour south of the Dodgers' spring-training base in Vero
Beach. He will rejoin the club Sunday in Colorado.

PRESSURE TO WIN IS OFF RANDOLPH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are butchers and bakers and cabinet makers
who are coming off more lucrative years than golfer Sam Randolph.
The former USC star grossed $30,434 on the Nike Tour in 1997 and
was feeling stigmatized by his failure to bring home bigger bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beginning to wonder if I wanted to do this any more,''
said Randolph, who was shaken by his inability to play his way into
last winter's PGA Tour qualifying school, stung by the ``Can't-Miss
Kid who Did'' label slapped on him by one national golf magazine
and saddened by all his so-called friends who have been going
around whispering that his best days are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took a good look around his galleries and realized there
are bankers and CEOs and other affluent Joes who would give their
first million to be able to trade places with him and he decided
that no matter what his scorecard or bank balance says, his isn't
such a bad life, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still doing my favorite thing,'' Randolph said. ``I know
people are talking behind my back and saying I'm all washed up. But
it's not like there's some script that's supposed to cover my
career and I goofed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not entirely true. Such a script does exist. Its working
title: I am Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In the bleachers behind the Olympic Club driving range Wednesday
sat patrons with clubhouse badges who would have killed to trade
places with Randolph if only because they would have been that much
closer to Woods, the latest in a long line of players earmarked for
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He was launching missiles a few spots away from Randolph, the
one who stirred the patrons' dry martinis the last time the U.S.
Open was held here, 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph will tee it up in his sixth U.S. Open today as a
prohibitive underdog, but back then he was a first-year touring pro
being touted as the next Jack Nicklaus. Somewhere along the way he
started looking like another Jack Renner. But in June of 1987 the
fogbank that would roll in and settle over his career was nowhere
on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph weathered a two-stroke penalty for slow play during the
second round at the Lake Course to finish in a tie for 43rd. Three
months later he would set a 54-hole tournament record that still
stands to win the rain-shortened Bank of Boston Classic, one of
five top-10 finishes he'd record on his way to grossing $180,378.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph, 33, would have another decent year in 1988, cracking
the $100,000 mark in earnings without the benefit of a win. He
couldn't have known it then, but the victories would dry up faster
than fresh leads in the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald
Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   The only first-place finish of any consequence Randolph has
recorded since 1987 came at the U.S. Open sectional qualifying
round in Clovernook Country Club in Cincinnati earlier this month
when he posted the low 36-hole total in the field of 69. His
breakthrough went largely unnoticed as disabled golfer Casey Martin
rolled in a 25-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole to
secure the fifth and final spot.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity suits Randolph fine. The best years of his career
might have coincided with Madonna's but, unlike her, he didn't go
out of his way to make sure you noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph was a shining star because of his talent, which carried
him to one Junior World title, 13 collegiate crowns, the 1985 U.S.
Amateur Championship and the 1985 Fred Haskins Trophy, golf's
version of the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   When Randolph revisits his past _ something he is loath to do
these days because it's like inviting jubilation to dinner and
having depression drop in for a nightcap _ he remembers mostly how
he played for the sheer pleasure of it.
</P>
<P>
   He aimed for the pins and let the putts fall where they may. It
wasn't until the first cracks appeared in his game that winning
replaced the flagstick as Randolph's focal point. That was when the
expectations that everybody else had pinned on him became his own.
</P>
<P>
   His father Sam Sr., a teaching pro in Santa Barbara who is now
retired, had bestowed upon Randolph a swing that was long on feel
and short on instruction. Randolph, in what he admits was as much
an act of rebellion as a quest for a higher (swing) plane of
consciousness, sought second, third and fourth opinions. What he
wound up with was a swing short on feel and long on instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few years of doing pretty good, I wanted to do a
little better,'' Randolph said. ``I started to take a little advice
here and there. Instead of just going out and playing, I was always
thinking about how to improve myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The more he tinkered with his swing, the less confidence he had
in it. He couldn't shake this thought: If his swing was dependable,
why was he changing it?
</P>
<P>
   As his scores soared, shoulders to lean on were harder to come
by than birdies. Players who had been his best pals in college,
guys he had grown close to his first few years on the PGA Tour,
fringe people who had attached themselves to him when he came out
of USC, virtually disappeared after Randolph lost his playing
privileges on the PGA Tour in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   That's why when Australian Steve Elkington, a college rival out
of Houston, stopped and gave Randolph a warm handshake on the
driving range Wednesday, it really meant a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Before the week's over, there could be handshakes all around.
After missing the first six cuts on the Nike Tour, Randolph has
finished in ties for 12th, eighth and sixth in his last three
events. He feels good about his game, and more important, himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I feel like I have nothing to lose,'' Randolph said. ``I'm
not worried what anybody thinks. I don't feel that pressure. I can
just go out there and play.''

WOMAN FOUND FATALLY STABBED IN HER APARTMENT IN WESTCHESTER
COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman was found fatally stabbed on Wednesday afternoon in her
apartment in a town in Westchester County, N.Y., the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the woman had not been released by the police in
Hastings-on-Hudson on Wednesday night. But Lt. Vince Schiavone, the
executive officer of the town's Police Department, said that she
was a 37-year-old lawyer who worked in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The police said on Wednesday night they wanted to question
Michael Laudor, 35, the victim's live-in boyfriend, though they
stressed that he had not been named as a suspect. Laudor is a law
school graduate who battled schizophrenia and recently sold the
rights to his life story to a Hollywood film company. He was
believed to have been in the apartment earlier Wednesday, and was
last seen driving away in a black Honda, Schiavone said.
</P>
<P>
   The police received a call at about 4:20 p.m. from someone
expressing concern about the woman's safety, Schiavone said. When
the police arrived at the woman's apartment at 19 Maple Avenue,
they found the victim, fully clothed and lying in a blood-smeared
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The homicide was the town's first since 1979. Schiavone said,
``We believe it's a homicide that occurred between people who knew
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, The New York Times published a profile of Laudor that
chronicled his impressive achievements _ graduating summa cum laude
from Yale in three years and later from Yale Law School _ and his
daunting demons _ a schizophrenic condition that warranted an
eight-month stay in a psychiatric unit at Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Laudor had struck deals to write an
autobiography, ``Laws of Madness,'' and to sell the movie rights of
that book to Los Angeles Imagine Entertainment and Universal
Pictures. The movie deal, published reports said, was worth $1.5
million. Brad Pitt has been reported to be negotiating to star in
the movie, which is to be directed by Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   News of the homicide rattled Hastings-on-Hudson, an affluent
town of 8,500 known for its picturesque views of the Hudson River.

U.S. FINDS ITSELF ON SHAKY GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There is some debate on whether the United States' loss
to Germany in its World Cup opener on Monday has left it in
precarious circumstances heading into Sunday's game with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to gain anything from the match with the Germans has
left the Americans desperate for a victory _ but is that a new
development? Their progression to the second round of the
tournament has always seemed to hinge on triumph in their second
Group F game, a fact that's been amplified by a poor performance in
Monday's 2-0 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a must-win game for us,'' said winger Frankie Hejduk, who
figures to move into the U.S. lineup after providing a spark off
the bench in the second half against Germany. ``There are no more
(playing for) ties for us. We can't afford to play for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win these next two games. That's it; that's the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not unexpected. The U.S., after analyzing its chances
before the tournament began, knew the Iran game would be important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put ourselves in the position that we pretty much
realized we were going to be in,'' goalkeeper Kasey Keller said.
``We knew going against Germany we probably weren't going to pick
up any points and we needed to accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that, really, for us the Iran game would be the first
game we truly needed to get some points in if we wanted to get to
the next round, and that's what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll also need something, perhaps just a draw, from their
first-round finale against Yugoslavia next Thursday. What will be
required to earn a second-round assignment in Montpellier or, more
likely, Toulouse, won't be known until Sunday, after the U.S.-Iran
and Germany-Yugoslavia results are in. A best-case scenario would
be a one-sided win by the U.S. coupled with a decisive German
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we have to beat (Iran) by two goals,'' Hejduk
said. ``We have to attack from the start ... pressure Iran right
from the kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans didn't do that on Monday, and once Andy Moeller's
header gave Germany an eighth-minute lead, they panicked, falling
into a conservative game plan that cost them any chance of fighting
back. Worse, it led them to second guess their strategy and
personnel in the aftermath of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Sampson questioned the performance of several of his
starters, most notably forward Eric Wynalda, who might be benched
in favor of Roy Wegerle.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, who made no impact on the match and managed no shots,
claimed he suffered from a lack of service, but Sampson wanted no
part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was in place for Eric to grasp the opportunity,''
Sampson said Wednesday. ``When Frankie got in, he got off a shot,
didn't he? Can you imagine how much work it took to get to the near
post? Tab Ramos got off a shot. Brian Maisonneuve created
situations for himself. I think it's all a matter of how badly you
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's spirits were still sagging two days after the game _
``Just about everybody was down,'' said Ramos, who will move into
the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were into their whining mode and veteran Alexi
Lalas had to snap them out of it with some strong words.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, from the time the players first walked into the
locker room, Alexi lifted their spirits and got them refocused on
the task at hand, which was playing better in the second half,''
Sampson said Wednesday. ``Today in training, he did the same kind
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran is widely seen as the weakest team in the World Cup, but it
stunned observers with a narrow 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia on Sunday.
With a roster that includes three German-based players _ forwards
Ali Daei and Khodadad Azizi and midfielder Karim Bagheri _ and
several solid youngsters, the Iranians are capable of an upset, and
there is no doubt they will be up for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to match their aggressiveness, but we're not concerned
with politics,'' Claudio Reyna said. ``Our motivation may be
different than theirs, but we both need three points (from a
victory).''
</P>
<P>
   Much, Sampson suggests, will depend on ``how we respond to
(Monday's) loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be much more demanding physically, much more
offensive-minded, much more precise in front of the goal,'' he
said. ``These are things we must do to be among the elite
soccer-playing nations. It's very important to show a good response
against Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wynalda: ``We know how to play, we just have to do it. It's
not too late; that's the good news. We have two more games to put
it right and I really believe there are better days ahead of us.''

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; ANAHEIM _ Seattle Mariners pitcher Jeff Fassero made the
Angels' Darin Erstad look foolish with two breaking balls out of
the strikezone in the seventh inning Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad swung at and missed both, falling behind in the count
1-2, when Fassero got foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero tried to sneak a fastball past Erstad, and when the
baseball finally landed in the right-field seats, the Angels had
taken a 3-2 lead on their way to a 4-2 win before 24,800 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' 15th win in their last 17 games and increased
their lead over the Texas Rangers in the AL West to 1{ games. The
Mariners, meanwhile, fell deeper into last place, 13 games behind
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's team-leading 16th home run of the season woke up the
crowd and an Angels offense that appeared to be lulled into a
trance against Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (5-4) gave up a first-inning run on Tim Salmon's RBI
single, but allowed only three hits during the next five innings as
the Mariners took a 2-1 lead. But in the seventh, after Justin
Baughman singled and took second on Gary DiSarcina's sacrifice
bunt, Erstad turned the game upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was made possible because Angels starter Omar
Olivares managed to get through some tough innings and keep the
Mariners from running away with it. Olivares (5-2) went eight
innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He has now pitched into
the seventh inning in seven consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   The key for Olivares is his sinker, which he needs to keep down
in the strikezone in order to get groundball outs. Wednesday, he
got 17 groundball outs.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Pervical pitched the ninth and earned his league-leading
22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped on Fassero early before he settled down. In
the first inning, Dave Hollins walked, went to third on a single by
Jim Edmonds and scored on a single by Salmon. The Angels, however,
got only two more hits during the next four innings. During one
stretch from the third inning to the sixth, Fassero retired nine
consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners took a 2-1 lead after Alex Rodriguez's
RBI single in the third inning and Dan Wilson's solo home run in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares got help from the defense, which turned three double
plays in the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have risen to the top of the AL West despite a rash
of injuries, particularly to their starting rotation. Sixty percent
of their rotation coming out of spring training is on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Jack McDowell, Ken Hill and Allen Watson are trying to
come back from elbow injuries, with only Watson close to returning.
And Watson is still probably two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels have been able to do better than simply hang
tough in their absence, thanks to the three pitchers they now have
in the rotation. Olivares, Jarrod Washburn and Steve Sparks went
into Tuesday's game having combined for 13 starts, and the Angels
won nine of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jarrod Washburn said `I belong here,' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``Steve Sparks said `This is my chance.' And Omar
Olivares always wanted to start. That's why I like competition in
spring training _ there's one job open and two guys are contending
for it. A guy sees a spot and sees the challenge. He says `I'm the
guy.' These guys have accepted the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   All three entered the rotation coming from different situations.
Sparks, 32, is coming off elbow surgery and did not pitch in 1997.
Washburn is a 23-year-old rookie, and Olivares is a journeyman with
a career record under .500 and started this season in the Angels'
bullpen. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

WESTPHAL: `THIS IS A GREAT JOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to identify Walker in eighth graph.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Calm. Clean-cut. Collected.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Westphal was every bit as what the Sonics prescribed the
day they decided to change their coaching situation.
</P>
<P>
   As Westphal was ushered in Wednesday as the Sonics' new head
coach, he sat with one leg folded across his knee. When quizzed
about the future of Sonic basketball, his dashing retorts were
accompanied by light satire and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, 47, exuded confidence in himself. He certainly wore no
signs of being intimidated by the success of his predecessor,
George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the majority of my time here won't be talking about
what George did,'' Westphal said. ``I respect the job that George
did ... but I wasn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal filled one job requirement like a waterfall would a
sand pail. Indeed, he is no George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   He will play center Jim McIlvaine more. He is looking forward to
developing young talent. It does not hurt that Westphal will never
be named to the NBA's All-Interview team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further we got into the process, the more evident it
became that Paul was the right man,'' said Sonics president Wally
Walker, who satisfied his self-imposed deadline of hiring a coach
by the June 24 NBA draft. ``His leadership, his people skills, his
knowledge of the game, the fact that he is one of the most
competitive people alive, and you combine that with the fact he's
been a successful competitor at every level, led us to this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal signed a four-year deal, with the Sonics having an
option on the fourth year. Financial terms were not disclosed, but
the contract is loaded with incentives. Sources said Westphal will
earn between $1 and $1.5 million in base salary each season.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's record as head coach of the Phoenix Suns was 191-88
(.685) in three-plus seasons. Westphal, who coached the Suns to the
1993 NBA Finals in his rookie year as coach, also has a reputation
of handling veteran and star players well.
</P>
<P>
   He was a five-time All-Star guard who has become a player's
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to coach the way that I would have liked to have been
coached,'' Westphal said. ``It's a player's game. You have to
create an environment where they can play up to their potential. As
a player, I would like a coach to listen to me, then he has to have
the last say.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is believed to have been Walker's choice all along.
Walker also interviewed Bob Hill, Paul Silas and former Karl
assistant Bob Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Walker acknowledged the Sonics waited until after the NBA Finals
were completed to make the hire. But once it became apparent the
indecisiveness of Chicago coach Phil Jackson would hold up the
process, Walker moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   He offered Westphal the job the same night the Bulls clinched
their sixth championship. Westphal, who was in San Francisco at the
time, then met with Sonic point guard Gary Payton Monday in
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's agent, Lonnie Cooper, worked out the contract details
with Walker on Tuesday. Westphal said his meeting with Payton was
purely a get-to-know-you gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like, unfairly, that it was some kind of final
judgment _ to pass Gary Payton's test or something. That wasn't it
at all,'' Westphal said of his lunch with Payton. ``... It was just
a nice time to get together and get to know the new coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal met only with Payton. He plans to talk with the rest of
the team in the coming days. Westphal will also interview assistant
coaches, including the Sonics' staff under Karl: Dwane Casey, Tim
Grgurich and Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Stotts, who was Karl's No. 1 assistant, said he would like
to follow Karl wherever he lands. Walker emphasized his desire to
retain Grgurich, who has a special relationship with Payton and was
instrumental in helping Payton become a superstar player.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Westphal is faced with two important questions: Can he keep
the Sonics as formidable as they have been?
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is known for being an offensive-minded coach. He is
taking over a team that relied heavily on defense during Karl's 6{
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that there is any one way to play basketball
in that we'll play slow ball or fast-break basketball. ... You have
to mold the system to fit the players that you have, offensively
and defensively,'' Westphal said. ``And the idea is to be ahead at
the end of the game. My style, if anything, is to figure out how to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't write some book saying this is the Paul Westphal
system on how to play basketball. ... All I'll try to do is get
this team playing as best as it can play, and see how far we can
get in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, though, did plot his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   He did not interview for many coaching jobs during his 18-month
hiatus. Westphal explored the Denver vacancy last year, didn't like
the situation and removed himself from consideration. Westphal was
up for the Dallas job after he was fired in 1996. He lost that
position to former Bulls assistant Jim Cleamons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for a great job and this is a great job. I
couldn't be happier,'' said Westphal, who seemed content living in
Phoenix and coaching a high school basketball team led by his
18-year-old son, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, there is no wonder Westphal has surfaced again on
the NBA coaching scene. Only his well-known friendship with
ultra-conservative and controversial talk-show host, Rush Limbaugh,
raises eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush is a nice guy. He's a good friend. I don't apologize for
that,'' Westphal said. ``A person's politics doesn't have anything
to do with whether I can be their friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker downplayed the fact that he and Westphal played for the
1980-81 Sonics. They have spoken at least once a year over the past
decade. Walker and Westphal spoke at least twice this past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and I have been friends,'' said Walker, who is entering
the final year of his five-year contract. ``... I just wanted to
make sure we got the best person for the job.''

KNIGHT KEEPS ON WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this before, but Helen Knight has won
another women's championship at El Caballero Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   That makes 36 El Cab titles for the sweet-swinging grandmother,
who learned the game from major champions Tommy Armour and Johnny
Ravolta more than a half-century ago as a University of Michigan
coed.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who moved to California after World War II, won the
first 32 women's championships played at the Tarzana course and the
last four to make it 36 of 41 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a surprise,'' Knight said Tuesday, after winning by
20 strokes and averaging 12{ strokes over par during her four
rounds on one of the most difficult courses in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, they're all getting younger, and I'm getting older.
How long can I this keep up?''
</P>
<P>
   She kept it going this year with solid ball-striking that kept
her out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't putt that well, but I kept it in play,'' said Knight,
whose 334 total earned her yet another reprinting of her name on
the club-championship trophy that is already overcrowded with Helen
Knights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll use a little Scotch tape if we have to,'' Knight said.
``We'll paste it on there somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Technology prevails: The big sigh of relief _ $2.5 billion
worth _ at this week's U.S. Open came from equipment makers
Wednesday, following the U.S. Golf Association's announcement that
``probably all'' of the hot new titanium clubs on the market would
pass a proposed new standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not uncomfortable with what we see in the market
today,'' said USGA executive director David Fay in dispelling much
anxiety by clubmakers who feared Wednesday's news conference at
Olympic Club had been called to announce technology-curbing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fay announced that the USGA has developed a test to
measure the springboard effect from golf clubs and would be sending
it to manufacturers for comment before it is implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that clubs submitted at this point have
lessened the skill to play the game at championships such as the
U.S. Open or at a recreational level,'' Fay said.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the equipment makers. Technology-fanned
repeat business helped produce $2.5 billion in wholesale sales of
clubs and balls in 1997, and future sales could increase with the
leading edge of the baby-boomer generation approaching an age of
diminished distance.
</P>
<P>
   The industry had lobbied against anticipated technology-curbing
regulations with recent full-page advertisements protesting any
changes in standards. On Wednesday, Big Bertha and her titanium
brothers prevailed, with an endorsement from a man who is sponsored
by Callaway but doesn't need much help from technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free country,'' said six-time PGA Tour driving champion
John Daly, whose 302-yard average of 1997 exceeded the tour driving
average (269) by more than 30 yards. ``I don't believe in slowing
down technology. That's what America's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Junior rates reduced: Los Angeles City courses will lower the
cost of junior green fees on July 1, from $9 to $5 on a walk-up
basis or $7 on a reservation system. The City reduction follows a
reduction at L.A. County courses, which cut junior fees from $9.50
to $4.75 this year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Names in the game: Stephanie Martin of Camarillo has earned a
berth in the July 2-5 U.S. Women's Open by virtue of her medalist
performance in a sectional qualifier at Timarron Country Club in
Dallas. She shot 74.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur Nicole Dalkas, who just completed her freshman year at
USC, also qualified with a 74 at Mission Viejo Country Club. The
Women's Open will be played at Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Kohler,
Wis....
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kinsell of Glendale, Dan Pouliot and Desi Patao of Burbank
and Victor Keesey of Palmdale have qualified for the SCGA
Championship scheduled for July 10-12 at SCGA Members Club in
Murietta, where defending champion Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys is
bidding for a record fifth title.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsell qualified with a 2-under-par round of 70 at the PGA West
Weiskopf course. Pouliot was medalist at 2-under 70 at Crystalaire,
where Patao shot 74 and Keesey 75. Don Baker, many times the club
champion at Braemar, is an alternate, as are Steve Dougherty of
Burbank, Spike Silver of Woodland Hills and state amateur qualifier
Rick Pratt of Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   __ Only three more shopping days: What do golfing dads want most
for Father's Day? According to a national telephone poll of 500
golfers, what dads really want is to play a round at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   What they have received instead in the past, according to the
survey by Golfsmith International, included exploding golf balls, a
wig, beer-holding golf clubs and clown shoes with spikes. The same
poll asked participants to name their favorite golfer and Freddie
Couples was the overwhelming winner, drawing three times as many
votes as runner-up Tiger Woods.

ERSTAD JUMPS ON FASSERO'S MISTAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Seattle Mariners pitcher Jeff Fassero made the
Anaheim Angels' Darin Erstad look foolish with two breaking balls
out of the strike zone in the seventh inning Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad swung at and missed both, falling behind in the count 1-2
when Fassero got foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero left a slider up in the strike zone, and when the
baseball finally landed in the right-field seats, the Angels had
taken a 3-2 lead on their way to a 4-2 win before 24,800 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' 15th win in their past 17 games and increased
their lead over the Texas Rangers in the AL West to 1{ games. The
Mariners, meanwhile, fell deeper into last place, 13 games behind
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's team-leading 16th home run of the season woke up the
crowd and an Angels offense that appeared to be lulled into a
trance against Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (5-4) gave up a first-inning run on Tim Salmon's RBI
single but allowed only three hits during the next five innings as
the Mariners took a 2-1 lead. But in the seventh, after Justin
Baughman singled and took second on Gary DiSarcina's sacrifice
bunt, Erstad turned the game upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that's not where he wanted to throw that ball,''
Erstad said of Fassero. ``He threw me two sliders in the dirt and I
missed both of them. He pretty much owned me the whole night. I was
fortunate to get that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the toughest lefties in the league because he's
not going to give you much to hit. So when you do get that
opportunity, you better take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out and talk to (Erstad) right now and he'll be more
frustrated because he didn't drive in the runner from third base
(in the second inning) than he is happy about the home run,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``This kid, he doesn't like to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was made possible because Angels starter Omar
Olivares managed to get through some tough innings and keep the
Mariners from running away with it. Olivares (5-2) went eight
innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He has now pitched into
the seventh inning in seven consecutive starts. The key for
Olivares is his sinker, which he needs to keep down in the strike
zone in order to get ground-ball outs. Wednesday, he got 17
ground-ball outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every spring training you sit down and go over everybody and
you say you expect this and this and this,'' Collins said. ``If
somebody surprises you, you can be a good team. (Olivares) has been
our surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares said his success is no surprise to him, even though
last year he went 6-10 with the Mariners and Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys just let me do what I do, they have confidence in
me to pitch,'' said Olivares, whose ERA fell to 2.70. ``Last year I
didn't pitch on a regular basis. I have to throw a lot or I lose my
mechanics. Last year I got skipped a couple times. I'm not blaming
nobody, it was just tough for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth and earned his league-leading
22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped on Fassero early before he settled down. In
the first inning, Dave Hollins walked, went to third on a single by
Jim Edmonds and scored on a single by Salmon. The Angels, however,
got only two more hits during the next four innings. During one
stretch from the third inning to the sixth, Fassero retired nine
consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners took a 2-1 lead after Alex Rodriguez's
RBI single in the third inning and Dan Wilson's solo home run in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares got help from the defense, which turned three double
plays in the first five innings.

OLIVARES BEATS OLD TEAMMATES AS ANGELS EDGE MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Omar Olivares pitched so poorly for the
Mariners last season, he didn't even get invited to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He got even Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares said he has no hard feelings toward the Mariners. He
simply is taking advantage of a new start in a new place. He is
pitching for a first-place team again, but instead of being along
for the ride, he's right in the middle of the Anaheim Angels'
surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the guy we traded for,'' Seattle manager Lou Piniella
said after Olivares stymied the Mariners on four hits over eight
innings in a 4-2 victory at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares looked nothing like the pitcher who had a 1-4 record
and 5.49 earned run average in 13 games with the Mariners after
being acquired from the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't go away mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood the move they made (keeping him off the
postseason roster) and it didn't bother me,'' he said. ``I knew the
way I was pitching and so did they.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliveras said the biggest difference between this year and last
is being in a rotation that allows him to pitch ``every fifth day
instead of every ninth day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he could give us innings as a spot starter,''
Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said. ``Then, after we signed
Jack (McDowell), we decided to put (Olivares) in the bullpen. We
liked his versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bavasi didn't expect Oliveras to have a 5-2 record and 2.70
ERA in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like this,'' Bavasi said, ``but sometimes you get
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares moved into the rotation when McDowell got injured and
the Angels have surged, winning 14 of their past 16 games to build
a 1{-game lead in the American League West over the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The way Mariner starter Jeff Fassero pitched Wednesday night,
even Olivares' best didn't seem good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson's fifth-inning home run, his fourth of the season and
first since May 5, presented Fassero with a lead.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted one-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Baughman led off the seventh inning with a single and
shortstop Gary DiSarcina sacrificed the runner into scoring
position. The Angels were playing for the equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero fell behind Darin Erstad 2-and-0, threw two wicked
sliders that Erstad swung on and missed badly. Wilson called for
another slider, hoping it would be in the same place with the same
swing-and-miss result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midway through my delivery I had second thoughts about
throwing another slider,'' Fassero said, ``but it was impossible to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   This slider hung over the middle of the plate and Erstad
deposited it into the right field bleachers for his 15th homer of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mad at myself for throwing that pitch,'' Fassero said.
``It's difficult throwing three good sliders like that in a row. I
hung it. He hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added another run in the inning and the Mariners went
quietly in the eighth inning against Olivares and Angel closer Troy
Percival, who collected his league-leading 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team is going good, they play for a tie by bunting and
then get a two-run homer,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are going real good.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are heading in the opposite direction, losing their
fourth straight and 24th of their past 34 games to fall a
season-high 13 games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling right now and we can't get anything going,''
said Fassero, now 5-4 after a 5-1 start. ``It's a battle. Nothing
is going right for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the first inning, scoring
when Fassero walked Dave Hollins with out and yielded back-to-back
singles to Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon. The Mariner left-hander
eluded further damage, striking out Cecil Fielder and retiring
Garret Anderson on a comebacker.

ERSTAD JUMPS ON FASSERO'S MISTAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Seattle Mariners pitcher Jeff Fassero made the
Anaheim Angels' Darin Erstad look foolish with two breaking balls
out of the strike zone in the seventh inning Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad swung at and missed both, falling behind in the count 1-2
when Fassero got foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero left a slider up in the strike zone, and when the
baseball finally landed in the right-field seats, the Angels had
taken a 3-2 lead on their way to a 4-2 win before 24,800 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' 15th win in their past 17 games and increased
their lead over the Texas Rangers in the AL West to 1{ games. The
Mariners, meanwhile, fell deeper into last place, 13 games behind
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's team-leading 16th home run of the season woke up the
crowd and an Angels offense that appeared to be lulled into a
trance against Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (5-4) gave up a first-inning run on Tim Salmon's RBI
single but allowed only three hits during the next five innings as
the Mariners took a 2-1 lead. But in the seventh, after Justin
Baughman singled and took second on Gary DiSarcina's sacrifice
bunt, Erstad turned the game upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that's not where he wanted to throw that ball,''
Erstad said of Fassero. ``He threw me two sliders in the dirt and I
missed both of them. He pretty much owned me the whole night. I was
fortunate to get that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the toughest lefties in the league because he's
not going to give you much to hit. So when you do get that
opportunity, you better take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out and talk to (Erstad) right now and he'll be more
frustrated because he didn't drive in the runner from third base
(in the second inning) than he is happy about the home run,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``This kid, he doesn't like to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was made possible because Angels starter Omar
Olivares managed to get through some tough innings and keep the
Mariners from running away with it. Olivares (5-2) went eight
innings, allowing two runs and four hits. He has now pitched into
the seventh inning in seven consecutive starts. The key for
Olivares is his sinker, which he needs to keep down in the strike
zone in order to get ground-ball outs. Wednesday, he got 17
ground-ball outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every spring training you sit down and go over everybody and
you say you expect this and this and this,'' Collins said. ``If
somebody surprises you, you can be a good team. (Olivares) has been
our surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares said his success is no surprise to him, even though
last year he went 6-10 with the Mariners and Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys just let me do what I do, they have confidence in
me to pitch,'' said Olivares, whose ERA fell to 2.70. ``Last year I
didn't pitch on a regular basis. I have to throw a lot or I lose my
mechanics. Last year I got skipped a couple times. I'm not blaming
nobody, it was just tough for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth and earned his league-leading
22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped on Fassero early before he settled down. In
the first inning, Dave Hollins walked, went to third on a single by
Jim Edmonds and scored on a single by Salmon. The Angels, however,
got only two more hits during the next four innings. During one
stretch from the third inning to the sixth, Fassero retired nine
consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners took a 2-1 lead after Alex Rodriguez's
RBI single in the third inning and Dan Wilson's solo home run in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares got help from the defense, which turned three double
plays in the first five innings.

LOTT INTERVIEWER FACES SEX HARASS SUIT BY MALE EMPLOYEE  
 BY CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   Washington 
   The talk show host who provided a forum for Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott to condemn homosexuality, and then strongly
endorsed his views, is the target of a sexual harassment suit _ by
a man.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armstrong Williams, host of a show on the America's Voice
network and a prominent pundit in Washington's conservative
circles, is accused by former employee Stephen Gregory of more than
50 incidents of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory alleges in a suit filed a year ago that Williams
repeatedly kissed him on the mouth, grabbed his buttocks and
genitals, and climbed into bed with him on business trips. After
rebuffing Williams, Gregory charges, the talk-show host retaliated
by docking his pay and ultimately firing him.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory is asking for $200,000 in damages, and now that Williams
has failed in an attempt to have the suit dismissed, the case is
expected to go to a jury trial late this year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said through a spokesman that he had no comment on the
case because it is pending in Superior Court in Washington. When
the case was originally filed, Williams called the allegations
lies, adding that it would be ``stupid'' to engage in such conduct
given his public position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is an attempt to embarrass and humiliate Mr.
Williams,'' said his attorney, Peter Axelrad. ``We deny it. We deny
all of it. We have full confidence that my client will be
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men say they are heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's attorney, Mickey Wheatley, a former lawyer with the
Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a gay civil rights group, called it
``ironic for Trent Lott to be making these offensive pronouncements
when he's sitting across from somebody who's been accused of the
most abusive kind of conduct of a homosexual nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley added that Williams ``believes that (homosexuality) to
be a sin, and so he must be in great pain over it, but he's
inflicting pain on others with his pronouncements. The way he
treated my client would be indicative of what happens when you try
to repress something as basic about yourself as your sexuality. My
advice to him would be to get a boyfriend and leave his employees
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy emerged Monday, when Lott's comments were first
made public. In a taped interview for Williams' show, Lott compared
homosexuals to alcoholics, sex addicts and kleptomaniacs. White
House press secretary Mike McCurry called Lott's statements
``backward thinking'' and ``an indicator of how difficult it is to
do rational work in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's press secretary shot back that the Clinton White House is
in no position to comment on morality, and House Majority Leader
Dick Armey had Bible passages at hand condemning homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Williams vigorously defended Lott's statements on several
television programs. He told CNN's Inside Politics, ``We all have
challenges that we need to wrestle with, that we need to pray
about. ... Sen. Lott also said during the interview that we must
love, embrace, show tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's Talk Back Live Wednesday, Williams asserted that 30
percent of the parents of gay children have slept with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
lobbying group, called the statement ``the most disgusting, vile,
reckless lie I've heard on television in quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith added, ``We have always had strong suspicions that the
most vehement anti-gay activists are suppressing latent homosexual
feelings. . . . They buy into society's prejudice and try to hide
those feelings by reacting vehemently against gay issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, raised as a Pentecostal, is believed to be about 40
years old _ his office could not confirm his exact age _ and is
unmarried. He first gained prominence in 1991 as one of Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas' most vocal defenders against charges
raised during Thomas' confirmation hearing that he had sexually
harassed Anita Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Williams compared his own travails with Thomas' in a USA Today
article in March: ``I know what it's like to work closely with
someone, bring him into your confidence, help him develop
professionally, then watch him turn on you. I know how it feels to
see those actions twisted into something just short of slander . .
. to have people smile and say `hello' while their eyes look a
little too deeply into yours for clues as to your guilt or
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory, a former trainer at the local YMCA, charges in his suit
that Williams hired him as his personal trainer in late 1994.
Shortly afterward, Gregory said, Williams engaged him as a
volunteer and then as an employee at his talk show, and less than a
year later promoted him to executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory says Williams forced him to ``spend almost all his
waking hours with him,'' driving him to the studio and accompanying
him on business trips. Gregory charges that Williams would force
them to share a room to save costs, and then attempt to get into
bed with him.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says Williams told Gregory that he loved him,
repeatedly tried to kiss him on the lips, insisted that he was not
homosexual, but ``just needed some `affection' from Gregory because
he wanted to remain celibate with women until he married.''

DUNG EXPERT JAZZED AT WHAT TYRANNOSAURUS LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Scientists have found a 15-pound mass of
dung from mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, ancient scat they say will
unlock vital mysteries about the eating habits and habitat of the
rulers of the animal world some 80 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologist Karen Chin of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo
Park _ the world's foremost expert on the fecal remains of
dinosaurs _ has long been reconstructing the dietary habits of
peaceable, plant-eating dinosaurs. By examining the fossilized
hunks, known scientifically as coprolites, she has found critical
new clues about an era of extinct life forms that lasted nearly 150
million years. The huge vegetarian beasts of the Cretaceous period
left coprolites as big as basketballs, offering evidence of many
plant species.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, Chin has now identified a king-sized
coprolite from a theropod, almost surely a Tyrannosaurus, one of
the meat-eating dinosaur group that scavenged on dead bodies or
hunted live beasts and ferociously devoured them.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published Thursday in the British scientific journal
Nature, Chin and her colleagues say they have established that the
powerful jaws of T. Rex were able to smash and crush the bones of
its prey before consuming the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil hunters discovered the coprolite recently near the fossil
bones of a T. Rex in a geological formation along the Frenchman
River near the town of Eastend in Canada's Saskatchewan province.
</P>
<P>
   The bone fragments in the massive chunk of dung were only
partially dissolved, Chin said, indicating that the stomach acids
in this theropod must have been weak at best.
</P>
<P>
   Chin first started to reconstruct dinosaur dietary habits while
fossil-hunting in Montana as a University of California graduate
student two years ago. In an interview, she said the recent
discovery ``opens up a whole new avenue of inquiry that will let us
look for patterns of feeding behavior among the theropods and the
ecology of their habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, we've always guessed that T. Rex and their
cohorts must have been able to crush the bones of the animals they
fed on, but now we have the first hard evidence that they actually
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the multitude of bone fragments that Chin and her colleagues
found inside the coprolite, they report that they have identified
the remains of a juvenile duckbilled beast called Edmontosaurus, as
well as a juvenile Triceratops, whose ferocious-looking horns
belied its plant-browsing nature.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chin's colleagues is Gregory M. Erickson, a researcher at
the Veterans Affairs Medical Center at Stanford, Calif; his
specialty is studying the bone structure of dinosaurs. He
calculates their biomechanical properties and has measured the jaw
power that creatures like T. Rex could mobilize to crack and crush
the bones.
</P>
<P>
   The beast's teeth were not equipped to chew bones, Erickson
said, but ``their enormous bite force'' left jumbled masses of bone
ranging in size from crumbs to large chunks in their dung.
</P>
<P>
   It's still impossible to tell from the coprolite whether T. Rex
was a predator or a scavenger or both, Chin and Erickson said, but
this first find of a theropod coprolite will now serve as a
``search image,'' enabling other fossil hunters to know what to
look for, they said.

GIANTS WIN 2ND STRAIGHT AS KILE, ROCKIES CRUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY SCHULMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be hard to over-hype the importance of the Giants'
four-game series against the first-place San Diego Padres this
weekend, but as reliever Steve Reed sees it, their just-completed
series against the Colorado Rockies might have been more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overlook series like these,'' Reed said after
contributing a scoreless inning to Wednesday's 6-3 victory over
Colorado in the rubber game. ``You have to win series against the
teams you're supposed to beat, the teams that are behind you,
before you go into a series like San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives you a chance to bounce back,'' he said. ``If
we dropped two of three in this series, everybody would have been
kind of demoralized.''
</P>
<P>
   After following their 11-game winning streak with five straight
losses, the Giants will take two straight wins into tonight's
series opener with San Diego. With Barry Bonds back in the lineup
Wednesday despite lingering neck pain, the Giants peppered Rockies
starter Darryl Kile and reliever Mike DeJean with 12 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Every Giants starter had a hit, and when was the last time you
read that? Following a familiar pattern for the team, Kirk Rueter
(8-3) spotted Colorado three runs in the first inning, but the
Giants tied it by the second inning and went ahead on Rich
Aurilia's two-run, opposite-field homer in the sixth to deal Kile
(5-10) his seventh straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the score is, we feel if we just pluck, pluck,
pluck, pluck, we can get back in the game,'' said Charlie Hayes,
whose first-inning single with two out brought Bill Mueller home
with the first Giants run.
</P>
<P>
   (Hayes played first base because J.T. Snow's mother, Merry
Carole, died Wednesday at age 54 after a lengthy battle with
cancer. Manager Dusty Baker said Snow would rejoin the team for
tonight's game and play until he leaves for his mother's funeral in
Southern California, on a date to be announced.)
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton contributed a two-out, two-run double in the
second inning to tie the game 3-3, a gift Rueter did not waste as
he blanked Colorado for the rest of his six-inning start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of gives you a boost back after the top of the first
when you're down 3-0,'' Rueter said. ``I felt I let the team down.
But Charlie's big hit made it 3-1, and Ham- &LR; ju  &LR; bone had a big
double to tie it. That gave us new life. As a starter you say, `All
right, let's start over and see what happens.'''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was Stan Javier leading off the sixth with a
single for his 1,000th career hit and Aurilia driving a 1-1 Kile
fastball over the wall in right to give the Giants a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Mayne added a two-out RBI hit in the seventh, and Rich
Rodriguez, Reed and Robb Nen finished the game. Nen got his 21st
save despite a wearisome ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   One key to nailing Kile might have been a tremendous at-bat by
Hayes in the third inning. After Bonds led off with a single, Hayes
built the count to 3-2. He then fouled off seven straight
fastballs, with Bonds running on every one (a little slower each
time), before finally grounding out on the 13th pitch. On a warm
afternoon, that must have taken a toll on Kile. It certainly did on
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I was running on a treadmill yesterday, or
I'd be dead,'' Bonds said.
</P>
<P>
   With their 43rd win in hand, the Giants left for a team party
and a night to prepare for the Padres, who smoked them in three
straight last weekend in San Diego. The Giants feel things will be
different this time, at 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got our momentum back,'' Aurilia said. ``We
still miss Jeff (Kent), but I think we've shown in the last couple
of days that we have guys who can contribute to the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hayes, ``When we went down there we didn't play very well.
What we relied on all year, pitching and defense, we only got half
of, the pitching. Our defense was bad. Anytime you give a team like
San Diego more than three outs an inning, you're going to lose.
Hopefully we're back on the right track.'' &QL;

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURES SUMMARY No 2456 - JUNE 18, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. THE MONSTERS OF FATHER'S DAY Just in time to mark Father's
Day, Tim Herrera provides a warm, funny and personal recollection
of two generations of fathers and sons at the movies, and explains
how his family traditions of a Father's Day trip to see a monster
movie ties his sons to their now-deceased grandfather. 900 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
SMOKING DOUBLES RISK OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Smokers may be more
than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than are people
who have never smoked, according to a new study. The findings
contradict earlier studies that suggested smoking might reduce the
risk of Alzheimer's. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service.
1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
THE JOY OF FRUIT The biggest trouble with maintaining a healthy
diet is that to most of us, the things that are good for us taste
bad, and the things that are bad for us taste good. That's why
fruit is so prized - packed with essential nutrients, it's also
delicious, either fresh and whole or as part of salads, juices or
more elaborate dishes. Ken McAlpine talks to the experts about what
fruit can and can't do for you, why adding fruit to your diet is a
good first step, but not a solution, why athletes need a lot more
fruit than non-athletes and which fruits contain which key
nutrients. From Spirit magazine. 1,400 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
``I WANT MY FEELINGS PURE'' : THE BIRTH-CONTROL PILL'S
</P>
<P>
   INVENTOR IS A VIAGRA SCEPTIC The chemist Carl Djerassi changed
the world when he developed the birth-control pill in the '60s.
Will Viagra, the impotency cure, have a similar impact on sex in
the '90s? Djerassi doubts it. He believes that when the excitement
wears off, it will simply remind women that too many men view
coitus as a mechanical act and women as sex objects. It could also
lead to the further spread of AIDS as older people have more sex.
From Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation available.) Q&AMP;A
format.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
SETTING LIMITS FOR YOUR TODDLER Testing their limits comes as
naturally to toddlers as breathing - which can be infuriating for
parents who must again and again deal with the same misbehaviour.
Margery D. Rosen explains why toddlers try your patience, what kind
of limits will be most effective and how you can make it through
the ``terrible twos'' and stay sane. From Child magazine. 1,400
words. 6. TO AVERT DISASTER, THE WEST MUST HEED WARNING
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS IN RUSSIA James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress
and author of ``The Face of Russia,'' writes of turmoil, unrest and
danger in Russia which, if not addressed by the West, could evolve
into the most serious threat to global stability since the end of
the Cold War. New York Times Op-Ed. 1,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
THE GREAT GENE ESCAPE In the future, you might be consuming foods
that include high-yield, insect-resistant breeds of corn and
herbicide-resistant soybeans. They're called ``transgenic'' crops,
and some people claim they may hold the power to increase food
production around the world. Seed companies say the plants they
have created are safe. But who's to know what will come from a romp
in the field with an untamed weed? By Josie Glausiusz. From
Discover magazine. 1,600 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
A TOUCH OF SCIENCE A growing number of scientists are discovering
that a picture just won't do for their purposes. Objects large and
small can now be represented with physical models. From a
laboratory in San Diego comes a mix of science and sculpture that
lets even microbiologists lay hands on their subjects. By Kathy A.
Svitil. From Discover magazine. 1,300 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
EUROPE'S LEADERS ARE PASSING THE BUCK TO BRUSSELS Europe is all set
for a giant new step to integration, the abandonment of national
currencies by 11 of the Union's 15 members and adoption of a
single, common legal tender. But there is little public enthusiasm
for this historic move. Much more effort is needed to sustain
public support for this great enterprise which is transforming the
history of nations. By Flora Lewis. 1,000 words. 
____________________________________________________________________
____ 10. From NEW SCIENTIST magazine (N/A Australia, Brazil, New
Zealand) A. PASTORAL SYMPHONY : Can the natural sounds of birds,
bees and waterfalls help beat the airport blues and soothe stressed
travellers? By Kevin Hilton. B. CATCHING THE TIDE : Giant
underwater turbines will soon start generating electricity from the
sea's ebb and flow. Has tidal power's time come at last? By Fred
Pearce. C. GUT REACTION - IS FOOD TO BLAME FOR AUTISM ? When his
son was diagnosed with autism, biochemist Paul Shattock devoted his
efforts to tracking down the cause. By John McCrone.

 &UR; TWO COLOR SLIDES FREE OF CHARGE &QL; 
 &UR; (2,000 words) &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH ANDERSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe, the city of Holy Faith, this year celebrates the 400th
anniversary of Spanish settlement in New Mexico, reports free-lance
travel writer Judith Anderson. But Santa Fe was already old when
the Spaniards arrived, and central to nearly 100,000 native people
living in 70 nearby adobe pueblos. What really sets this city apart
is its extensive art scene: Within a single square mile more than a
million pieces of art are concentrated, and that doesn't include
400 years of sacred images in the churches and missions. Anderson
tells where to go, what to see, where to eat and where to stay.

<P>
   Take a trip through the picturesque American West on the the
Montana Daylight excursion train with Gene and Adele Malott,
publishers of THE MATURE TRAVELER: Travel Bonanzas for 49ers-Plus.
You can't see these sights from the interstate: ``Deep gorges where
autos can't go, punctuated with scenic tunnels dug by railroad
workers before the turn of the century; children returning from
school on horses waving at the train; cattle grazing lazily on
ranges; and more.''

   It's full steam ahead in the cruise business, reports New
York-based travel writer Everett Potter. While some industry
pundits point to the film ``Titanic'' as an ironic booster of
sales, that's open to debate. Travel agents and cruise-only agents
report record bookings, sold-out sailings and inquiries many months
in advance of embarkation.

   Take a trip through the picturesque American West on the the
Montana Daylight excursion train with Gene and Adele Malott,
publishers of THE MATURE TRAVELER: Travel Bonanzas for 49ers-Plus.
You can't see these sights from the interstate: ``Deep gorges where
autos can't go, punctuated with scenic tunnels dug by railroad
workers before the turn of the century; children returning from
school on horses waving at the train; cattle grazing lazily on
ranges; and more.''

   It's full steam ahead in the cruise business, reports New
York-based travel writer Everett Potter. While some industry
pundits point to the film ``Titanic'' as an ironic booster of
sales, that's open to debate. Travel agents and cruise-only agents
report record bookings, sold-out sailings and inquiries many months
in advance of embarkation.

 By JUDITH ANDERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Santa Fe, the city of Holy Faith, this year celebrates the 400th
anniversary of Spanish settlement in New Mexico. But Santa Fe was
already old when the Spaniards arrived, and central to nearly
100,000 native people living in 70 nearby adobe pueblos.
 &HT;    This summer, the activities of the Hispanic Cuatro Centenario
blend with the calendar of Native American feast days and the flux
of all-American tourism that characterizes the City Different.
 &HT;    The streets may be crammed with trendy boutiques in faux-pueblo
architecture, but there is usually a balancing glimpse of history
nearby or a salutary view of the surrounding Jemez or Sangre de
Cristo mountains. The clear air at 7,000 feet is permeated with
sage and pinon.
 &HT;    But what really sets this city apart, besides its tripartite
Hispanic-Indian-Anglo world view, is art. All the arts.
 &HT;    Santa Fe isn't a big town _ just 67,000 residents _ yet with the
help of some 1.4 million tourists a year it supports 7 art museums,
about 250 galleries, an eight-week opera season and 10 performance
stages.
 &HT;    Within a single square mile, centered on downtown and Canyon
Road, more than a million pieces of art are concentrated, and that
doesn't include 400 years of sacred images in the churches and
missions.
 &HT;    Summer is high season, marked by abundant music, dance and
theater, by art festivals, wine festivals, mountain-men festivals,
by dozens of feast days in the pueblos, and by the annual markets
in the Plaza.
 &HT;    At Spanish Market, July 25 and 26, more than 100 vendors sell
santos and retablos, weavings and carvings _ the folk art of their
ancestors.
 &HT;    Indian Market, Aug. 22 and 23, a juried competition of more than
500 artists and craftspersons, is one of Santa Fe's most famous
events.
 &HT;    It has often been noted that in a city so steeped in history and
culture, what one most indelibly remembers is the shopping.
Certainly there are stupefying opportunities for buying, in shops
and souvenir stands and directly from the artist who made the
piece.
 &HT;    And yet, holding its own under that commercial veneer, the core
of Santa Fe is still esthetic.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The 20th annual Santa Fe Arts and Crafts Festival will fill the
Plaza with more than 200 vendors on June 20 and 21. Open 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. each day. Call (505) 988-7621.
 &HT;    On June 23 and 24, San Juan Pueblo, site of the first capital of
New Mexico in 1598, will celebrate the feast of St. John the
Baptist. Foot races and Comanche and Buffalo dances will last from
late morning to midafternoon. About 45 minutes north of town off
Route 68; (505) 852-4400. Check at the Governor's office at the
pueblo to see if photography is permitted.
 &HT;    When the Santa Fe Opera opens its 1998 season on July 3,
audiences will see major improvements to the opera house, including
a roof over all the seats, but it will keep its open-air
atmosphere.
 &HT;    ``Madame Butterfly,'' which opened the first season in 1957,
will inaugurate the renovated house, then alternate with Mozart's
``Magic Flute'' and three other operas. Tickets for the grand
opening are $50 to $200; for the rest of the season, $20 to $118.
Performances begin at 9 p.m., 8:30 starting Aug. 16.
 &HT;    The opera is about seven miles north of town on Highway 84-285;
(800) 280-4654, fax (505) 995-3030; on the Web:
www.santafeopera.org.
 &HT;    The 49th annual Rodeo de Santa Fe, July 8 to 11, will be held at
the rodeo grounds on Rodeo Road, about four miles south of town.
Some events have an admission fee. Information: (505) 471-4300.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The heart of Santa Fe is the Plaza, built in 1610 by Don Pedro
de Peralta. One side is formed by the Palace of the Governors, 105
West Palace Avenue. Built in 1610, it is the oldest public building
in the United States.
 &HT;    For decades, the portal, or front porch, has been reserved for
the Indians of New Mexico, who set out blankets and sell their
wares (pottery, jewelry and golf ball markers are in this year).
 &HT;    The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, 217 Johnson St., (505) 995-0785,
boasts a self-consciously hip gift shop and about 100 works by the
artist, who moved to New Mexico permanently in the 1940's. Open 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, until 8 on Friday.
Admission: $5 for one day, $10 for four-day pass to all branches of
the Museum of New Mexico. Free Friday 5 to 8.
 &HT;    At the Museum of International Folk Art, Aug. 29 will mark the
inauguration of the much-anticipated Neutrogena Wing of textiles
and folk art, with displays from a 3,000-piece collection ranging
from Peruvian leather to Indonesian silks.
 &HT;    One of the most delightfully unexpected museums anywhere, it has
a vast and exuberant collection, ingeniously displayed. Part of the
museum plaza at 706 Camino Lejo, (505) 827-6350. Open 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission: $5 or Museum of New Mexico
pass.
 &HT;    Open just a year, the Institute of American Indian Arts Museum,
108 Cathedral Place, (505) 988-6212, houses a national collection
of contemporary Native American art. A sculpture garden and
welcoming circle (a meditation chamber with piped-in music) invite
contemplation. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission: $4.
 &HT;    Canyon Road is two winding miles of galleries, cafes and private
homes in lovely adobes and haciendas. If you walk up it early, you
can catch the opening of most galleries, around 10 a.m., on your
way down. Or drive to a parking lot near the top of the road, just
past Camino del Monte Sol.
 &HT;    In the dust at the roadside beyond the opera house, Trader
Jack's Flea Market is an event every Friday, Saturday and Sunday
from spring through fall. Squash-blossom necklaces may be sold
right next to pickled pig's feet.
 &HT;    It's good entertainment, especially combined with lunch at the
Tesuque Village Market, (505) 988-8848, a few miles up the road.
The flea market usually runs 9 a.m. to dusk. Turn left off Highway
84 just past the opera house.
 &HT;    One way to learn about the regional cuisine _ then eat it _ is
to take a three-hour class ($35 to $57) at the Santa Fe School of
Cooking, 116 West San Francisco Street, on the upper level of the
Plaza Mercado, (505) 983-4511.
 &HT;    At a recent class on Mexican cuisine, Maurice Zeck, executive
chef at La Fonda Hotel, whipped up four courses including pork loin
with peanut mole.
 &HT;    On a mountain less than four miles north of town, Ten Thousand
Waves offers relaxation according to ancient Japanese tradition.
Spa treatments range from a half-hour massage ($35) to a Half-Day
Indulgence: an hour in a private hot tub, an herbal wrap, 90-minute
massage, facial, and a salt-glow treatment _ five hours for $296.
Open from 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 a.m. other days; closes at
midnight Friday and Saturday, 10:30 p.m. otherwise. Appointments
and directions: (505) 982-9304.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Accommodations in Santa Fe are subject to 10.25 percent tax.
 &HT;    Owned in partnership with the Picuris Pueblo, the Hotel Santa
Fe, 1501 Paseo de Peralta, (800) 825-9876, fax (505) 984-2211,
incorporates microwaves and mini-bars with Native American
storytelling at the kiva fireplace or bread-baking in the outdoor
horno. A 10-minute walk from the Plaza, the hotel runs a free
shuttle all day.
 &HT;    The 129 units, which are mostly suites, are decorated in low-key
Santa Fe style, and many have balconies and mountain views. There
is a heated outdoor pool and hot tub. Doubles, $129 to $149; the 90
suites are $159 to $209.
 &HT;    The Grant Corner Inn Bed and Breakfast, 122 Grant Ave., (505)
983-6678, fax (505) 983-1526, owes much of its popularity to its
location, two blocks from the Plaza, and its Sunday brunch. The
Colonial manor house has 10 guest rooms, some furnished with brass
bedsteads and vintage quilts; all have cable TV. Two rooms share a
bath. Doubles, $95 to $155. Children over 8 are welcome.
 &HT;    Budget: Bare-bones bed and breakfast accommodations are
available right in the heart of downtown at Plaza Resolana en Santa
Fe, 401 Old Taos Highway, (800) 821-5145, fax (505) 986-1917. A
retreat house affiliated with Ghost Ranch Conference Center in
Abiquiu, it lets seven of its 30 rooms. Simple, comfortable rooms
with full private bath have one double bed and one twin bed but no
phone or TV. Doubles, $80 with full breakfast. No smoking.
 &HT;    Two miles north of the Plaza, El Rey Inn, 1862 Cerrillos Road,
(800) 521-1349, fax (505) 989-9249, is surrounded by five acres of
gardens with courtyards, fountains, a heated pool and sunken
whirlpool next to an outdoor fireplace. There are 86 units, some
with fireplaces and kitchenettes. Doubles, $60 to $75, including
Continental breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Inn of the Anasazi, steps from the Plaza at 113
Washington Avenue, (800) 688-8100, fax (505) 988-3277, refers to
the Ancient Ones with its massive hand-carved doors and sculptured
stairways, but the 59 rooms, all with fireplaces and four-poster
beds, acknowledge every modern creature comfort. Doubles, $239 to
$419.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    For visitors who are out late, casual Il Vicino, off the Plaza
at 321 West San Francisco St., (505) 986-8700, offers a selection
of crispy individual pizzas ($4.75 to about $7) and select ales,
including Pig Tail Blonde and Slow Down Brown Ale, on draft for
about $3 a pint. Open Sunday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. until
11 p.m., Friday and Saturday 11:30 a.m. to midnight. No
reservations.
 &HT;    In the charming dining room of the Inn of the Anasazi, 113
Washington Ave., (505) 988-3236, regional cuisine tends to rely on
meat and chilies in such dishes as red deer tenderloin stuffed with
apple and spinach and served with chili-peach coulis. A
three-course dinner for two, with wine, runs about $90. Dinner
nightly; breakfast and lunch Monday through Saturday, brunch
Sunday.
 &HT;    One of the newer places in town is Jack's, 135 West Palace Ave.,
(505) 983-7220, which affects a stainless-steel swank. Grilled
salmon with citrus vinaigrette, asparagus and new potatoes can be
preceded by a more inventive appetizer such as a sweet onion tart
with arugula, goat cheese and red pears. A three-course dinner for
two with wine starts at about $70. Lunch and dinner daily.
 &HT;    The six romantic dining rooms at La Tertulia, 416 Agua Fria,
(505) 988-2769, graced by Colonial art, once were part of the
Dominican convent at the Guadalupe Mission. A steak dinner for two,
either straight up or smothered in green chilies, accompanied by
the house sangria, costs around $55. Open for lunch and dinner
every day but Monday.
 &HT;    Tia Sophia's, 210 West San Francisco St., (505) 983-9880, is the
little cafe credited with the invention in 1975 of the breakfast
burrito: bacon and potatoes rolled in a tortilla with chili and
cheese ($5.50). Lunch specialties such as blue corn enchiladas
($5.75) are equally popular today. No alcohol. Open 7 a.m. to 2
p.m., closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Afternoon tea is a treat on the verandah or in the lobby of the
Hotel St. Francis, 210 Don Gaspar Ave., (505) 983-5700. The $10 tea
consists of finger sandwiches, a scone with clotted cream and jam,
and a pastry, accompanied by a pot of tea or glass of sherry, port
or champagne. Daily from 3 to 5:30 p.m.

Tesuque Village Market, (505) 988-8848, a few miles up the road.
The flea market usually runs 9 a.m. to dusk. Turn left off Highway
84 just past the opera house.
 &HT;    One way to learn about the regional cuisine _ then eat it _ is
to take a three-hour class ($35 to $57) at the Santa Fe School of
Cooking, 116 West San Francisco Street, on the upper level of the
Plaza Mercado, (505) 983-4511.
 &HT;    At a recent class on Mexican cuisine, Maurice Zeck, executive
chef at La Fonda Hotel, whipped up four courses including pork loin
with peanut mole.
 &HT;    On a mountain less than four miles north of town, Ten Thousand
Waves offers relaxation according to ancient Japanese tradition.
Spa treatments range from a half-hour massage ($35) to a Half-Day
Indulgence: an hour in a private hot tub, an herbal wrap, 90-minute
massage, facial, and a salt-glow treatment _ five hours for $296.
Open from 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 a.m. other days; closes at
midnight Friday and Saturday, 10:30 p.m. otherwise. Appointments
and directions: (505) 982-9304.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Accommodations in Santa Fe are subject to 10.25 percent tax.
 &HT;    Owned in partnership with the Picuris Pueblo, the Hotel Santa
Fe, 1501 Paseo de Peralta, (800) 825-9876, fax (505) 984-2211,
incorporates microwaves and mini-bars with Native American
storytelling at the kiva fireplace or bread-baking in the outdoor
horno. A 10-minute walk from the Plaza, the hotel runs a free
shuttle all day.
 &HT;    The 129 units, which are mostly suites, are decorated in low-key
Santa Fe style, and many have balconies and mountain views. There
is a heated outdoor pool and hot tub. Doubles, $129 to $149; the 90
suites are $159 to $209.
 &HT;    The Grant Corner Inn Bed and Breakfast, 122 Grant Ave., (505)
983-6678, fax (505) 983-1526, owes much of its popularity to its
location, two blocks from the Plaza, and its Sunday brunch. The
Colonial manor house has 10 guest rooms, some furnished with brass
bedsteads and vintage quilts; all have cable TV. Two rooms share a
bath. Doubles, $95 to $155. Children over 8 are welcome.
 &HT;    Budget: Bare-bones bed and breakfast accommodations are
available right in the heart of downtown at Plaza Resolana en Santa
Fe, 401 Old Taos Highway, (800) 821-5145, fax (505) 986-1917. A
retreat house affiliated with Ghost Ranch Conference Center in
Abiquiu, it lets seven of its 30 rooms. Simple, comfortable rooms
with full private bath have one double bed and one twin bed but no
phone or TV. Doubles, $80 with full breakfast. No smoking.
 &HT;    Two miles north of the Plaza, El Rey Inn, 1862 Cerrillos Road,
(800) 521-1349, fax (505) 989-9249, is surrounded by five acres of
gardens with courtyards, fountains, a heated pool and sunken
whirlpool next to an outdoor fireplace. There are 86 units, some
with fireplaces and kitchenettes. Doubles, $60 to $75, including
Continental breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Inn of the Anasazi, steps from the Plaza at 113
Washington Avenue, (800) 688-8100, fax (505) 988-3277, refers to
the Ancient Ones with its massive hand-carved doors and sculptured
stairways, but the 59 rooms, all with fireplaces and four-poster
beds, acknowledge every modern creature comfort. Doubles, $239 to
$419.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    For visitors who are out late, casual Il Vicino, off the Plaza
at 321 West San Francisco St., (505) 986-8700, offers a selection
of crispy individual pizzas ($4.75 to about $7) and select ales,
including Pig Tail Blonde and Slow Down Brown Ale, on draft for
about $3 a pint. Open Sunday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. until
11 p.m., Friday and Saturday 11:30 a.m. to midnight. No
reservations.
 &HT;    In the charming dining room of the Inn of the Anasazi, 113
Washington Ave., (505) 988-3236, regional cuisine tends to rely on
meat and chilies in such dishes as red deer tenderloin stuffed with
apple and spinach and served with chili-peach coulis. A
three-course dinner for two, with wine, runs about $90. Dinner
nightly; breakfast and lunch Monday through Saturday, brunch
Sunday.
 &HT;    One of the newer places in town is Jack's, 135 West Palace Ave.,
(505) 983-7220, which affects a stainless-steel swank. Grilled
salmon with citrus vinaigrette, asparagus and new potatoes can be
preceded by a more inventive appetizer such as a sweet onion tart
with arugula, goat cheese and red pears. A three-course dinner for
two with wine starts at about $70. Lunch and dinner daily.
 &HT;    The six romantic dining rooms at La Tertulia, 416 Agua Fria,
(505) 988-2769, graced by Colonial art, once were part of the
Dominican convent at the Guadalupe Mission. A steak dinner for two,
either straight up or smothered in green chilies, accompanied by
the house sangria, costs around $55. Open for lunch and dinner
every day but Monday.
 &HT;    Tia Sophia's, 210 West San Francisco St., (505) 983-9880, is the
little cafe credited with the invention in 1975 of the breakfast
burrito: bacon and potatoes rolled in a tortilla with chili and
cheese ($5.50). Lunch specialties such as blue corn enchiladas
($5.75) are equally popular today. No alcohol. Open 7 a.m. to 2
p.m., closed Sunday.
 &HT;    Afternoon tea is a treat on the verandah or in the lobby of the
Hotel St. Francis, 210 Don Gaspar Ave., (505) 983-5700. The $10 tea
consists of finger sandwiches, a scone with clotted cream and jam,
and a pastry, accompanied by a pot of tea or glass of sherry, port
or champagne. Daily from 3 to 5:30 p.m.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Montana Daylight excursion train rambles across the
mountainous portion of Montana and upper Idaho, giving passengers
what may be their only look at the present-day American West.
 &HT;    What they see is rarely observed from the interstate: deep
gorges where autos can't go, punctuated with scenic tunnels dug by
railroad workers before the turn of the century; children returning
from school on horses waving at the train _ even some real cowboys;
cattle grazing lazily on ranges; and a network of rivers, fed by
the Bitterroots, Cabinets and other nearby mountain ranges, many of
which capped by snow, even in midsummer.
 &HT;    In fact, the view from the Montana Daylight is not that
different from printed scenes of the old American West.
 &HT;    Passengers on this rail jaunt see little-known towns defined by
white churches on one end and saloons on the other _ like bookends.
A feed store might be stuck in the middle, where ranchers sit on
rockers and debate the issues of the day.
 &HT;    This part of the country is so remote that during our train ride
a mechanic, totally unaware of the our prying eyes, tried to combat
the midday heat by working in the nude in his garage, which is
alongside the train's tracks. We and our fellow passengers laughed
and cheered as we rolled by.
 &HT;    Indeed, the Montana Daylight is touted as the only overnight
excursion train that shows off the American West, the rugged
country where Lewis and Clark _ and later the Nez Perce and Teddy
Roosevelt _ came through.
 OLD-TIME JOURNEYS  
 &HT;    Our 455-mile journey on the Daylight began at the historic depot
in Livingston, Mont., with an overnight in Missoula, and ended in
Sandpoint, Idaho, on the edge of breathtaking Lake Pend Oreille.
The ride was part of a six-day tour that took us from Salt Lake
City to Spokane.
 &HT;    Aboard the Montana Daylight, a railfan can relive many an
old-time rail journey across America. Diesel engines pull three to
five coaches, much like Santa Fe's El Capitan and the Chiefs; dome
cars like those that once served passengers on the North Coast
Limited and Great Northern's Empire Builder; a rear-end observation
car like the one from the Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio; a rebuilt diner car
from the Nickel Plate Railroad; and private cars from the Chicago &AMP;
Northwestern, outfitted for sleeping and separate dining for
high-paying passengers.
 &HT;    There are three classes of service. Most passengers choose the
``Explore'' class, which features comfortable coaches, continental
breakfasts and box lunches. Those in the ``Big Sky'' class ride in
dome cars and have sit-down lunches in the dining car.
 &HT;    A handful of ``Gold Nugget''-class passengers ride like rail
barons of old, in their wood-paneled private cars with gourmet
meals prepared in separate galleys. At night, Gold Nuggets have
their own elegant sleeping compartments aboard the train.
 &HT;    On the first day, the train crosses the Bozeman Pass (on the
return route of Lewis and Clark), enters the Missouri River
headwaters (the confluence of the Gallatin, the Jefferson and the
Madison rivers) and crosses the Continental Divide at 5,500 feet
through the Mullan Tunnel. This is tunnel-and-trestle railroading,
with steep grades and sharp curves _ great for photography buffs
riding in the open vestibules.
 &HT;    While on the observation deck, we overheard other passengers'
conversations, which were filled with typical railfan questions:
What are the origin of the cars? Why don't most trains go
``clickety-clack'' anymore?
 &HT;    The on-board narrator graciously answered peoples' queries and
talked about the gorges and wildlife we had sighted.
 CAROUSEL AT TWILIGHT  
 &HT;    We arrived in Missoula for our overnight hotel stay just as the
sun was setting and the town's famous carousel was about to close.
It's a new, full-size carousel, which was created by local
volunteers, and we had looked forward to taking a spin on it all
day.
 &HT;    About 30 of us trouped to the ride, explaining our plight _ and
stretching the truth just a bit: We had come all the way from
places like Chicago and Texas just to ride their famous
merry-go-round.
 &HT;    Fortunately, the understanding Missoulans kept it open a little
longer and charged us all the senior-discounted rate of 50 cents a
ride.
 &HT;    For the next half-hour we whirled around like kids on the 38
hand-painted horses, amid bright, blinking lights and loud
pipe-organ tunes.
 &HT;    The next day the Montana Daylight meandered along the Flathead
and Clark Fork rivers, in the rolling valley between the Cabinets
and Bitterroots, leaving the original Lewis and Clark route far to
the south.
 &HT;    Our last night was in Sandpoint, Idaho, and then we traveled by
motorcoach to Spokane, Wash.
 PACKAGED TRIPS  
 &HT;    The two-day train ride is just one part of this Montana Rockies
Rail Tour.
 &HT;    The most popular package among mature travelers begins in Salt
Lake City and includes the Tetons, Yellowstone National Park and _
new this year _ an additional few days in Glacier National Park.
 &HT;    The westbound trip begins every Thursday in Salt Lake City, so
tour-goers can visit Mormon Square and other sites by daylight and
enjoy the free Thursday-evening rehearsals of the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir.
 &HT;    The next two days are spent in a motorcoach, traveling to
Jackson Hole, Wyo., through the Tetons. Tour-goers then spend a
night in Yellowstone Park.
 &HT;    We visited the park's steamy geyser basins and watched the
beautiful wildlife _ bison, elk, moose and mule deer _ leaving the
park at Mammoth Hot Springs.
 &HT;    Those who can't handle Yellowstone's 8,500 altitude or who
choose not to walk the long, wooden pathways to the geysers or take
the mile-long walk down Mammoth's steep terraces are given other
options.
 &HT;    The itinerary is reversed for eastbound tour-goers.
 &HT;    The cost ranges from $799 in Explorer class (double occupancy)
to $1,399 in Gold Nugget. A four-day, train-only tour from Spokane
to Livingston and back costs $629 to $1,799 a person, and a two-day
sampler rail tour from Livingston to Sandpoint is $399 to $999.
 &HT;    A great add-on is the four-day extension to Glacier National
Park for an additional $540 a person.
 &HT;    This year, journeys of the Montana Daylight and its accompanying
tours run from July 9 to the end of August. Get more information
from your travel agent or Montana Rockies Rail Tours, 2660 W.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's full steam ahead in the cruise business. While some
industry pundits point to the film ``Titanic'' as an ironic booster
of sales, that's open to debate.
 &HT;    But icebergs or not, the fact is that travel agents and
cruise-only agents report record bookings, sold-out sailings and
inquiries many months in advance of embarkation.
 &HT;    ``In Europe, it's boom, boom, boom,'' says Elaine Lerner.
 &HT;    Lerner, president of National Discount Cruise Co./American
Express (1409 N. Cedar Crest Blvd., Allentown, Pa. 18104;
800-788-8108), says ``This summer, it's been difficult to get to
Europe. Hot new ships like Princess' 'Grand Princess,' Holland
America's 'Rotterdam VI' and Royal Caribbean's 'Splendor of the
seas' are sold out.''
 &HT;    That's in keeping with a classic piece of cruise wisdom: New
sells. In this business, any vessel over 18 months is considered
old. And there exists a band of well-heeled salts who will only
sail on new vessels, in some cases regardless of itinerary.
 &HT;    For those devotees, a new ship and all its marvels are the
destination.
 &HT;    Even so, there may still be some good deals for Europe in
shoulder season, which is now longer than ever.
 &HT;    In the past, the major cruise lines would move their ships
across from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean sometime in October.
 &HT;    ``This year, for the first time, we're seeing more ships in the
Mediterranean from October to December,'' says Don Lansky, vice
president of public relations for The Cruise Line (150 NW 168th
St., North Miami Beach, Fla. 33169; 800-777-0707). ``That's the
latest we've ever seen it.''
 &HT;    But while Europe has been hot, Alaska is not _ or not as hot,
anyway, according to some agents. Two-for-one deals on Alaska
sailings may not be quite as prolific as they were last summer, but
they're still around.
 &HT;    ``Alaska has been soft,'' Lerner concedes. ``There are just too
many ships up there. Next summer, there may be fewer.''
 &HT;    For those travelers looking toward the Caribbean next winter,
it's already shaping up as a boom season.
 &HT;    ``There are strong bookings and a lot of the new ships will be
there,'' Lerner says.
 &HT;    And the Caribbean season is growing as well, according to
Lansky, who adds that ``fall has traditionally been off-season, but
a lot of ships are pretty packed this year.''
 &HT;    Other destinations in South America and Asia are attracting
cruise-goers who may have done the Alaska, the Caribbean and
Europe.
 &HT;    ``I'm selling more cruises to the Orient than ever before,''
says Linda Schuller, president of Travel in Style (160 S.
Livingston Ave., Livingston, N.J. 07039; 800-255-2999).
 &HT;    Schuller, who works with such upscale cruise lines as Crystal,
Seabourn and Silversea, claims that business is brisk ``because my
clients really want to visit a destination like Vietnam but they
don't necessarily want to stay in the country. The infrastructure
isn't there yet for deluxe clients.''
 &HT;    Deluxe or not, the perennial question for consumers looking to
save money on a cruise is when to book. No one pays sticker price
for a cruise, but what a traveler ends up paying can vary
considerably depending on when they book. Even three or four months
out it can still be difficult to get a particular type of cabin.
 &HT;    ``My best clients are booking at least six to eight months
before a sailing right now,'' Schuller explains. ``The cruise lines
all offer early-booking discounts. I can't think of one cruise line
that doesn't do it. Everybody had a deal, some with discounts as
high as 30 percent.''
 &HT;    These discounts vary according to destination, cruise line, time
of sailing and cabin category.
 &HT;    Elaine Lerner voices an oft-heard equation when she says,
''There's less discounting in Europe. And on every sailing in every
destination, it's the higher-priced cabins that go fast and
first.''
 &HT;    On the West Coast, Anne Halsey-Smith, president of Halsey Tours
and Cruises (P.O. Box 2650, La Jolla, Calif. 92037; 800-459-3395),
agrees, saying ``I work harder than I did 10 years ago. My clients
are demanding and know more than ever before. If they want a
veranda and I can't get one, I can't change their mind. If it's the
same itinerary but a different ship, they're not interested.
They're booking a year to six months out at a minimum. If they're
looking for suites or hoping to sail at Christmas or New Year's,
they're booking at least one year in advance.''
 &HT;    As for the last-minute cruise market, things have changed there
too.
 &HT;    Last-minute in the cruise business has traditionally meant 30
days from sailing. But now, last-minute can mean getting space on a
cruise that sails two or even three months later.
 &HT;    Lansky admits that ``last-minute has dried up,'' with the
exception of Alaska.
 &HT;    But Schuller of Travel in Style is more optimistic, adding
``there are always cancellations. You can do three to four weeks
out occasionally. That's the minimum, especially if you need a visa
or need to make other arrangements. And there's always something in
the Caribbean.''
 &HT;    As Elaine Lerner says, ``There is a cruise for every taste and
every pocket. But they've got to invent a few more destinations.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHERE DOES GATES WANT TO GO TODAY?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 21
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Nowadays, towering construction cranes and huge
earth-moving machines loom above the sprawling Microsoft corporate
campus. The world's leading software company is rapidly running out
of office space at its Pacific northwest headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innovate or die,'' is the Microsoft's corporate slogan, coined
by co-founder Bill Gates, who dreams of putting a Microsoft-fed
personal computer in every home and on every desk.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing innovative about Microsoft's architecture.
There's no corporate program to wow visitors. Nor are there any
Disneyesque public tours _ save virtual ones on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft ``museum,'' closed to the public, houses the Altair
computer that stirred Gates so greatly when it appeared in 1975
that, at age 19, he dropped out of Harvard to write an operating
system for the machine.
</P>
<P>
   In their first year, Gates and his then-partner, Paul Allen,
earned $16,005. In 1997, Microsoft earned $11.4 billion. The value
of Gates's stock in the company exceeded $45 billion, making him
the richest man in America.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, when he bought a jet, Gates flew economy class.
Gates's office in Redmond is modest, basically no different from
thousands of others on this 296-acre campus.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate visitors are known in the trade as ``original
equipment manufacturers,'' or OEMs, but there's nothing original
about the basic software they put on their PCs. Nearly all of it
comes from Microsoft. These hardware ``partners'' from Compaq, Dell
and the like usually meet with Microsoft managers in hotel suites
on Lake Washington, a half-hour down the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   There they sign non-disclosure agreements that make them privy
to the innards of the next big Microsoft software release. Windows
2000 will come in separate home and business flavors that will rest
for the first time on a common digital kernel.
</P>
<P>
   With Windows 98 about to reach customers, the (mostly) young men
who come to work in cutoff jeans and hiking boots to write the
millions of lines of code that make up this new release have
departed as a group on vacation. As they rest up, the spotlight
falls on hundreds of (mostly) lower-paid technical support workers
who will field questions posed by phone, fax and on the Internet
from users who find themselves in a jam.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gates may be in a bit of a jam himself with the
trust-busters back in the other Washington, he shows no signs of
caving in to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is very striking is the animosity toward Gates among his
rivals,'' Ron Chernow, the biographer of John D. Rockefeller, notes
in Fortune. It's much the same, Chernow says, as what Rockefeller
generated a century ago and ``seems to be spreading to other
businesses that are not at this moment rivals but see themselves as
potential rivals.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court broke up Standard Oil, an act
that did nothing to change Rockefeller's status as the richest man
of his day. Nearly nine decades later, Gates fervently believes
that the same antitrust law was not designed to let government
regulators design his software.

 &HT;    President Clinton wisely dumped candidate Clinton's China policy
 &HT;    (ATTN: Editorial, opinion page editors)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By TOM TEEPEN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to China will be awkward for him, for
reasons he has pretty much created himself. There's poetic justice
in that, but the poetry shouldn't be allowed to cancel out the very
important prose of this visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton set himself up first when he was running for the
presidency in 1992, blasting President Bush for not reacting
strongly enough to China's brutish suppression in Tiananmen Square
of the rising democracy movement three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was true that Bush too quickly made up with Beijing, verged
on obsequiousness in doing it and was secretive about it when
openness might have kept his administration from the excesses of
its Chinese embrace. But, realpolitik being, well, real, it was
never in the cards that U.S. policy toward China could be mainly
based on the moral high dudgeon candidate Clinton seemed to
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president finds himself pleading Bush precedent for
endorsing technology sales to China that congressional Republicans
denounce. Can you say ``petard''?
</P>
<P>
   And the president belly-flopped into more hot water in a
re-election panic that was studiedly incurious despite day-glo
signs that some campaign funds were perhaps being bootlegged into
play from Chinese shadows. As a result, Clinton's mercantilist
policy toward China _ though it is of a piece with his general
mercantilism _ is vulnerable to suspicions, often politically
prodded, of taint.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, at least U.S.-Sino relations have rebounded from
their 1994 low when China was flinging missiles around the Taiwan
Strait _ supposedly testing but actually saber-rattling _ and the
United States rushed two carrier battle groups from the 7th Fleet
to the troubled waters.
</P>
<P>
   China is not the lost cause some would have us, dangerously,
treat it as. Beijing has more often than not supported U.N.
peacekeeping operations. It played a key role in corking North
Korea's nuclear-weapons program. There have been human-rights
improvements at least at the margins. The beginnings of business
law, essential as China moves into market economics, might lead to
a general rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center in Atlanta _ whose experience in such matters
gives the effort credibility _ is working with Chinese officials to
regularize China's system of village elections. There's an opening
in that for democracy to bubble up slowly into the larger political
system.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly is the key. Chinese policy does not whip around like a
kite's tail in the wind, as ours often does. Chinese fundamentals
change with geologic leisure, if at all. U.S. policy has to be
nuanced and steady, quietly _ usually quietly anyway _ pressing for
human-rights advances, crediting Beijing when it plays well with
others but firmly opposing irresponsibility, as in its recklessness
retailing of nuclear and missile knowhow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continues to put too much faith in trade's political
payoffs. (Indeed, in trade's payoff, period. China's seductive mass
market is so far mostly tease.) But he is right that the
compromises that are necessary for engaging with China are
preferable to the dangers that would grow in a self-righteous
estrangement. President Clinton was smart to ditch candidate
Clinton.

they designed by the same architect?

Field, which opened April 26, 1995. The firm Ellerbe Becket of
Minneapolis designed Turner Field, which opened March 29, 1997.
Many people think Turner Field resembles Orioles Park at Camden
Yards in Baltimore, also designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum.
Camden Yards opened April 6, 1992, sparking renewed interest in
``retro'' baseball-only stadiums.

<P>
   Q: What does the group Zero Population Growth do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The organization's goal is obvious from its name: ``to slow
population growth and achieve a sustainable balance of people,
resources and the environment,'' as its mission statement says.
Founded in 1968, Zero Population Growth says its mission is based
on the premise that the finite resources of the world cannot
support an infinite number of people. Based in Washington, it has
more than 55,000 members and 20 chapters nationwide (none in
Georgia).
</P>
<P>
   The organization advocates a variety of measures to reduce
population pressures, including adoption of a national population
policy, access to contraceptives, reproductive choice, school-based
comprehensive sexuality education and health-care services, and
international support for voluntary family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Zero Population Growth, 1400 16th St. N.W., Suite
320, Washington, DC 20036 (1-800-767-1956). Or on the Internet:

</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that conversations from a digital phone cannot be
picked up on scanners or other phones, as they can be from regular
cellular phones? If so, what's the difference in technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: The odds of a cellular telephone conversation being picked up
by a scanner are remote, whether the caller is using digital or
analog, said Jeff Battcher of BellSouth Cellular. Analog is a very
secure technology, he said, but digital is even more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is indeed different. The terminology, however, is
something only an engineer could love. Analog uses a continuously
variable electronic signal that varies in frequency over a radio
channel, Battcher explained. Digital transmission/switching
technologies employ a variety of discrete, distinct pulses to
represent information.
</P>
<P>
   Battcher pointed out that it's against the law _ ``an illegal
invasion of privacy'' _ for anyone to intentionally listen to
wireless telephone conversations. In addition, since 1994 it has
been illegal to sell or import scanners that will pick up wireless
telephone conversations. It also is illegal to modify scanners to
receive those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the ozone problems in the atmosphere, would it
help if people drove without using their vehicle's air conditioner?
</P>
<P>
   A: That wouldn't do a thing for the atmosphere. All you'll
accomplish is being hot. An air conditioner doesn't put a
significant drain on your vehicle's engine, so ground-level
pollution isn't noticeably increased by turning it on. The only
advantage you'd gain is a slight increase in fuel economy. Although
that means a slight reduction in air pollution, because you're
using less gas, it's not significant. Better, perhaps, to car pool,
take public transportation, ride a bike or walk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently listed Major League players who hit four home
runs in a single game. Didn't Atlanta pitcher Tony Cloninger hit
four grand slams in a game in the late '60s or early '70s?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you're recalling is a pair of grand slams Cloninger hit
July 3, 1966, in a game at San Francisco, giving him 9 RBIs.
Although he didn't hit four home runs in that game, his feat
nevertheless set a National League record for a pitcher, said
Braves publicist Glen Serra. Cloninger also had hit two home runs
in his previous game, but the bases weren't loaded then.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Didn't Atlanta pitcher Tony Cloninger hit four grand
slams in a game in the late '60s or early '70s?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do we know how the number 911 was chosen for a universal
emergency phone call, as compared to any other random three digits?
</P>
<P>
   A: In November 1967, officials of AT&AMP;T and the Federal
Communications Commission met to find a means of establishing a
universal emergency number that could be implemented quickly,
something done as early as 1937 in Britain, the first country to
establish such a number. The next year, AT&AMP;T announced that it
would establish the three digits 9-1-1 as the U.S. emergency code.
It was selected because it was brief, easily remembered and had
never been authorized as an official code, area code or service
code. It also met the long-range numbering plans and switching
configurations of the telephone industry. On Feb. 16, 1968, the
first 911call in the United States was successfuly placed in
Alabama. The serving company was Alabama Telephone Co., which later
became Contel Corp. That 911 system is still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can just anybody have their ashes scattered over the Grand
Canyon, or is it restricted to dignitaries? It was reported
recently that the late former Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) wanted
that done for himself. If anyone can do it, what is the procedure
for requesting permission?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spreading of ashes at the canyon is not restricted to
dignitaries. But a permit is required, according to park
spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge. Some 20-30 permits are requested and
issued each year. A person wanting to spread ashes there must apply
in writing for a permit, stating whose ashes are involved, who will
be at the canyon to spread them and the date. Permits normally are
granted so long as the location requested is not by a water source,
sacred or archaeological site or a public use area. The address:
Grand Canyon National Park, Special Use Permits Office, P.O. Box
129, Grand Canyon, AZ 86023. Information: 520-638-7841.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon isn't the only national park that permits the
spreading of ashes. It was done recently in the Everglades for
environmentalist and writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Anyone
contemplating such a request should contact the individual park's
superintendent's office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle a bet? Was the late Rep. Sonny Bono
(R-Calif.) ever the mayor of Carmel, Calif.? If so, was that his
first public office? Also, was Clint Eastwood ever elected to any
office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Q&AMP;A hopes you bet that Dirty Harry . . . er, Eastwood, and
not Bono, was Carmel's mayor. Eastwood was elected to a two-year
term April 8, 1986; he declined to run for re-election in 1988.
Bono also was a mayor, but of Palm Springs, Calif. He was elected
to a four-year term in 1988, his first public office. In 1992, when
that stint ended, he ran for the U.S. Senate, but finished a weak
third in the Republican primary. Two years later, however, he was
elected to represent California's 44th District in Congress, and he
won re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A said young men still are required to register with the
Selective Service. My son will turn 18 later this month. Where,
how, and within what time frame must he register?
</P>
<P>
   A: Men can register by completing a form available at any post
office. Some high schools also have a faculty or staff member who
serves as a Selective Service registrar. Registration is required
within 30 days of the person's 18th birthday. Failing to register
makes a person subject to prosecution and fine up to $250,000,
and/or imprisonment for up to five years. Registration also is
required to qualify for federal student aid and most federal
employment. Information: 1-847-688-6888; or, on the Internet,
www.sss.gov/ (registration also is possible on-line).

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: My son will turn 18 later this month. Where, how, and
within what time frame must he register for Selective Services?
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what year did our young men no longer have to register for
the draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. government stopped drafting males in 1973, but
registration with the Selective Service System continues for almost
all male U.S. citizens, and male non-citizens living in the United
States, who are 18 through 25. Something called the ``stand-by
draft'' was created by the government in 1973, but discontinued in
1975. In 1980, Congress passed legislation resuming registration
requirements for the draft. Men who would be classified as
conscientious objectors if they were drafted also must also
register. Registration provides the government with a list of men
who could be inducted into the armed services in the event of a
national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At one time, hurricanes were named after women only. When
were men's names included?
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of naming hurricanes solely after women came to
an end in 1978 when men's names were included in the eastern North
Pacific storm lists. In 1979, male names were included in lists for
the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know hurricanes are given names, and sometimes some of
those names, such as Andrew, are retired. Why is that done? What
others have been retired?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricane names typically are retired, says the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and replaced with new ones
when a storm associated with a particular name causes great loss of
life or property damage. The countries most affected by such a
storm can make a recommendation to the World Meteorological
Organization that a name be retired, Frank Lepore of the National
Hurricane Center in Miami told Q&AMP;A. In Andrew's case, it was the
United States that recommended scrapping it, with Alex taking its
place, starting in 1998. NOAA said such retirement isn't
necessarily permanent; the name just can't be used again for at
least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   These Atlantic Ocean storm names have been retired: Agnes,
Alicia, Allen, Andrew, Anita, Audrey, Betsy, Beulah, Bob, Camille,
Carla, Carmen, Carol, Celia, Cleo, Connie, David, Diana, Diane,
Donna, Dora, Elena, Eloise, Flora, Frederic, Gilbert, Gloria,
Hattie, Hazel, Hilda, Hugo, Ione, Inez, Janet, Joan, Klaus, Luis,
Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard recently that formaldehyde is used in the process to
decaffeinate coffee. I've also heard that it is used in processing
milk. Is that true? It sounds very bad to me.
</P>
<P>
   A: Formaldehyde is not used in the decaffeination process of
coffee, nor is it used in milk processing for human consumption,
said Chris Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association. It's sometimes used as a preservative on farms when
testing milk samples for various components in the milk, she said,
but not for processing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If formaldehyde is not used in processing decaffeinated
coffee, what is?
</P>
<P>
   A: Decaffeination agents include carbon dioxide; ethyl acetate,
a substance that occurs naturally in many fruits; methylene
chloride, a solvent; fats and oils; and water, said Chris
Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. The
Food and Drug Administration has determined that methylene chloride
is safe for use in coffee decaffeination in up to 10 parts per
million, but the coffee industry's practice results in levels 100
times lower than this amount, she said. The decaffeination process
starts with softening the green, unroasted beans in the agents,
after which they're ``agitated'' to draw the caffeine away. Then
the beans are heated and blown with steam, followed by roasting.

   Q: Monica Lewinsky has hired a new team of defense attorneys who
have been described in news reports as ``top notch, well-connected
and experienced.'' Since she is an unemployed former White House
intern, who is paying her legal bills?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reports published when the new legal team was brought on
board said Washington attorneys Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris were
recruited and hired by the Lewinsky family. Lewinsky's parents are
divorced. Her father, Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, is a radiation
oncologist in Beverly Hills, Calif. He has said that he paid the
legal bills of his daughter's former lawyer, William Ginsburg.
Monica Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, is a New York writer. Well
before the change in attorneys, Dr. Lewinsky mounted a defense fund
to help defray his daughter's legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Newspaper articles have reported that about 20 states have
high school graduation tests or ``exit exams.'' Will you list them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Education Commission of the States lists these: Alabama,
Alaska (effective Jan. 1, 2002), Arkansas, Arizona, Florida,
Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana (unless principal certifies student has
met ``Core 40'' requirements), Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts
(must pass proficiencies, but not a single exit exam), Mississippi,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico (to graduate with a diploma), New
York, North and South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Minnesota students graduating in 2000 must pass tests in
reading, math and writing to meet the requirements of the Minnesota
Graduation Rule. And Pennsylvania students must achieve 52 state
academic performance ``outcomes'' (assessments) plus locally
developed outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what is required for a baseball pitcher to be awarded
a win, besides, obviously, the team winning? Why do some relief
pitchers get the win?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winning pitcher _ the one given official credit for his
team's victory _ can be the starting pitcher or a reliever who
comes in with his team tied or behind and wins the game. A starting
pitcher must complete at least five full innings to be so credited.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jerry Lewis has been honored many times over the years for
his work with muscular dystrophy. Do you know why he became
involved with that cause?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many people speculate that the actor and comedian must have
known someone, perhaps a family member, who was stricken with a
neuromuscular disease, but Lewis has never disclosed a specific
reason for his interest and involvement, Jim Brown of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association in Phoenix told Q&AMP;A. ``We're just very
thankful he has been involved for more than four decades now,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewis has been volunteer national chairman of the
health agency for more than 40 years, it's his fund-raising
telethons each Labor Day that have kept him _ and muscular
dystrophy _ most in the public eye. These efforts have raised more
than $900 million for the search for treatments and cures for some
40 neuromuscular diseases. Lewis also makes personal appearances on
behalf of MDA that are never publicized. ``There probably has not
been a single day in the last 45 years on which Jerry has not met,
worked for, phoned or just talked about youngsters and adults
living with neuromuscular diseases, and MDA's effort in their
behalf,'' Brown said.

 &HT;    TOBACCO AND COKE STOCK MADE THIS LITTLE TOWN RICH
 &HT;    By CHERYL BLACKERBY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Fla. _ Political skirmishes notwithstanding, Tallahassee
just isn't that interesting. Go to a football game in the fall,
take a quick tour of the old Capitol building, and, suddenly, home
is looking pretty fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Not so quick.
</P>
<P>
   Just drive 20 minutes west of Tallahassee to Quincy, one of
Florida's oldest towns. Hit the brakes, park the car and hoof it.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy is the town that tobacco and Coca-Cola built. After the
turn of the century, tobacco growers invested profits in a new
company called Coca-Cola on the advice of the president of the
Quincy State Bank, and the wealthy little town got rich, rich,
rich.
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 blocks of Quincy have been designated as a
Nationally Registered Historic District. Many of the 100-plus
houses were built in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily spend a day strolling past an astounding array of
architecture _ Victorian, antebellum, Classic Revival, Creole,
Georgian _ with gardens of magnolias, camellias, daffodils and
gardenias.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 years ago, planters came here from Virginia, the
Carolinas and Georgia. They crossed Virginia tobacco with Cuban,
and then started growing the connoisseur's ``shade tobacco''
(fields were shaded with cheesecloth).
</P>
<P>
   They built lavish mansions, monuments to their success.
</P>
<P>
   The McFarlin House inn gives a close-up view of how the wealthy
lived. The magnificent Queen Anne-style mansion, built in 1895 by
tobacco planter John McFarlin, has seven fireplaces, a three-story
turret and a 42-pillar wraparound porch.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed in the third-floor octagonal room in the turret. From
the antique brass and iron bed, I had a bird's-eye view of oak
trees and the ornate J.E.A. Davidson House (built in 1859) with its
six Corinthian columns across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The McFarlin House was vacant for 20 years before Richard and
Tina Fauble bought it in 1994 and restored it with the help of his
parents. The house was in such bad shape that raccoons lived in it.
</P>
<P>
   The McFarlin House guests used to be those interested in history
and architecture, but now the owners host corporate and political
groups with business in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out they don't think Tallahassee is very interesting
either.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: Carrying the little guide book as you walk will be
your only exertion. There is lots of shade and many benches.
</P>
<P>
   Historic inn: The McFarlin House, 305 E. King St., (850)
875-2526. Weekend rates range from $75 ($65 weekdays) to $175.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hike to get there: Take I-10 west past Tallahassee to
Exit 27, which is U.S. 90. Drive 10 miles to Quincy. Turn right on
Love Street. The inn is on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Contact the Quincy Chamber of Commerce, (850)
627-9231, or drop by the office on the corner of Madison and King
streets, and pick up a walking map. Groups can arrange tours.

<P>
   A huge Coca-Cola sign downtown displays Quincy's ties with the
soft-drink company. Tobacco growers at the turn of the century
invested in Coca-Cola stock and got rich.
</P>
<P>
   The 1895 McFarlin House inn, owned by Richard Fauble and his
wife, is one of the town's opulent mansions. Quincy's historic
district covers 36 blocks and includes more than 100 homes.

 &HT;    3 PRETTY WOMEN AND A GUY WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE
 &HT;    By HAP ERSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were a guy planning to write, direct, produce, edit and
star in your own movie, you'd make it about three gorgeous women
throwing themselves at you, right?
</P>
<P>
   Rookie filmmaker Christopher Scott Cherot does exactly that with
``Hav Plenty,'' demonstrating that Mrs. Cherot didn't raise a
dummy. His amiable, low-key movie about relationships introduces us
to a talent who deserves a future in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to mind Spike Lee's ``She's Gotta Have It'' and early
Woody Allen, though such comparisons may be too much of a burden.
If you're looking for a breezy romp about an intriguing circle of
twentysomethings, ``Hav Plenty'' has plenty to recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   Cherot wears the character of novelist wannabe Lee Plenty with
casual, endearing indifference. Attracted to high-powered,
successful Havilland Savage, who is way above him on the economic
ladder, Lee is taken aback to be invited to share New Year's Eve
with her at her family home. He nonchalantly introduces himself to
her upwardly mobile friends as broke and homeless, which turns him
into an object of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Havilland, her French-spouting friend Caroline and married
sister Leigh each are drawn to Lee, and are each startled by his
unexpected indifference. In particular, Lee and Hav have an
attraction/repulsion relationship like two magnets, and they dance
around their feelings for each other for the movie's brief
hour-and-a-half. Cherot includes the audience in his character's
puzzlement over the opposite sex, addressing us directly and
winking at us over his bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Such a screwball souffle is hard to keep floating, but Cherot's
easygoing, improvisational manner proves very ingratiating, just
like his character. It works because of ``Hav Plenty's'' laid-back
style, though it requires some patience on the audience's part.
Just approach it as a shaggy dog story on contemporary love, with a
clever coda in which art reflects life reflecting art.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cherot, most of the cast is making its feature film debut,
which gives the release a documentary-like feeling with so many
unknown faces. If, as the movie insists, it is based on a true
story _ a claim we have learned to doubt ever since ``Fargo'' _ it
has surely been warped into a fiction to suit Cherot's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoa Maxwell is all poise, assurance and foul mouth as
privileged Havilland, and it is enjoyable to watch her lose her
cool in Lee's presence. Tammi Katherine Jones is similarly all
attitude, but she decides on a whim to bed Lee and is crestfallen
to find herself rejected. Convinced that he must be gay, he becomes
a project for her to crack and Jones' comic verve becomes a
highlight of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   An attention-getter at this year's Sundance Film Festival, ``Hav
Plenty'' earned a distribution deal from Miramax and, reportedly,
Cherot got a deal for future movies. If he can retain the
spontaneity and light touch he shows here, Cherot is an emerging
hyphenate well worth hearing from again.

 &HT;    `MULAN' DESIGNED TO CHARM YOUNG, OLD
 &HT;    By HAP ERSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the first delicate, dancing swirls of Asian watercolor and
ink, Disney's latest animated feature ``Mulan'' proclaims itself a
cartoon willing to be different.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Chinese legend, it ventures into new geographic and
cultural territory, even as it clings to much of the time-tested
Disney genre formula. Featuring a cast of vicious Hun warriors as
well as adorable, scene-stealing sidekick creatures, ``Mulan''
looks calculated to satisfy all tastes. If not quite on par with
the studio's classic best, it is nevertheless its most enjoyable
animated effort since ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by committee with enough messages about female
empowerment to warm the hearts of Ms. magazine's editorial board,
``Mulan'' is the fable of a young girl who joins the Chinese
imperial army to save the life of her hobbled father. Disguised as
a man, she has to learn macho soldiering ways, but it is her wily
battle tactics that prove victorious and allow her to rescue her
homeland from certain defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, Joan of Arc and G.I. Jane. Make way for Mulan.
</P>
<P>
   From our first introduction to the title lass, in a tinkly
``Flower Drum Song'' number by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel
called ``Honor To Us All,'' it is clear that Mulan _ voiced with
spunk by Ming-Na Wen (``One Night Stand'') _ is not cut out for
traditional subservience. With her mute pet cricket Cri-Kee (hardly
as parental or wise as Jiminy) and a street-smart, scrawny dragon
named Mushu (Eddie Murphy, as the funniest, most irreverent Disney
creation since Robin Williams' ``Aladdin'' genie), she joins the
rag-tag troops led by a jut-jawed hunk captain, Shang (B.D. Wong).
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has something at stake, from Mulan's family honor to
Cri-Kee's reputation for bringing good luck. Curiously, in its zeal
to focus on the heroine, the movie forgets to give Shang an
opportunity to show his bravery and military acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the story plays out well, matched nicely early on by
a handful of clever Wilder-Zippel tunes. In the movie's second
half, though, the songs disappear, giving ``Mulan'' an unbalanced
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such quibbles are more than offset by the striking
visuals contributed by Disney's Florida animation unit in its first
full feature effort. Asian art style is evoked beautifully with
elegant, spare suggestions of background landscapes. In contrast,
yet subtly complementary, are the awesome uses of
computer-generated imaging, represented by the crowd in a climactic
Imperial City sequence and a thundering battle charge down
snow-covered slopes by the Hun cavalry. (The Huns, by the way, are
depicted as bloodthirsty land-grabbers. Presumably, there is no Hun
Anti-Defamation League for Disney to fret over.)
</P>
<P>
   For the most part ``Mulan'' is a dramatic tale of a girl's
heroic war exploits. More than just fulfilling their baby-sitting
obligations, adults may enjoy the movie more than their kids do.

 &HT;    EXPLOSIVE `FILES': SCI-FI SERIES BECOMES TOP-NOTCH SUMMER FLICK
 &HT;    By KEVIN D. THOMPSON
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so you want to know the truth about The ``X-Files: Fight the
Future''?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, we can't tell you. Well, we can, but then we'd
have to kill you. Then ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter would kill
us.
</P>
<P>
   But we can tell you this: ``Fight the Future'' does reveal more
juicy details about the cloak-and-dagger government/alien
conspiracy (it dates back to a frigid North Texas in 35,000 B.C.).
You do get a good look at those nasty, up-to-no-good aliens
(they're in the movie's best scenes), and it will take a few
moments getting comfortable gawking at Mulder's humongous schnoz on
the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, ``Fight the Future'' is also a pretty darn good film.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, The X-Files have been shut down. Instead of chasing
extraterrestrials, FBI agents Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder
(David Duchovny) are investigating a mysterious bombing of a Dallas
office building and the secrets buried inside. Like most
``X-Files'' episodes, ``Fight the Future'' raises more questions
than it actually answers. That's always been the show's shrewd
selling point, however. Like a veteran best-selling novelist,
Carter always leaves viewers wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   Making the film was a tough challenge since ``Fight the Future''
had to please die-hard fans and non-X-Philes.
</P>
<P>
   Did Carter succeed?
</P>
<P>
   He did on most levels. Actually, non-fans will probably enjoy
the movie more. Screenwriter Carter and director Rob Bowman dumbed
down, if you will, the often confusing mythology. The film doesn't
explore the whereabouts of Mulder's sister, whom he believes was
abducted by aliens; it fails to address whether the evil Cigarette
Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is Mulder's father; and we never see
the shape-shifting aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Carter wisely chooses to focus on the planned alien
takeover and The Syndicate's role in it. It's really ``Independence
Day'' and ``All The President's Men'' rolled into one. And Carter
gives audiences enough background on Scully and Mulder and their
paranormal world so non-X-Files viewers can follow the plot.
</P>
<P>
   In a clever bar scene, a cursing, drunk Mulder gives five years'
worth of dossier information while explaining to a barmaid what he
does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight the Future'' does excel as a top-notch, brainy
sci-fi/conspiracy thriller and translates well to the big screen.
That's no surprise, though, since watching the eerily filmed TV
series is like watching a weekly one-hour movie. ``Fight the
Future'' doesn't skimp on all the ingredients that made ``The
X-Files'' one of TV's most popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   There's Mark Snow's sinister score, Ward Russell's ominous
cinematography and a hulking Cigarette Smoking Man puffing in the
dark. As Dr. Alvin Kurtzeil, a shadowy, Deep Throat-type character,
a wide-eyed Martin Landau is pleasingly effective while babbling
about ``silent wars'' and ``planned armageddons.''
</P>
<P>
   With a reported $60 million to spend, Carter and Bowman were
also able to create more elaborate special effects. Without giving
away anything, let's just say what we see of those ornery aliens is
pretty convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny and Anderson also had no trouble making their
characters bigger-than-life. Both actors know these characters so
well, they can speak to each other without uttering a word. For
Mulder and Scully, TV's most sexually frustrated couple, it's all
in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth.

 &HT;    THIS PARK IS FOR THE BIRDS (SCRUB JAYS, THAT IS)
 &HT;    By JOHN J. LOPINOT
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSPREY, Fla. _ Wildlife encounters.
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard the hype and seen the billboards advertising
wildlife adventures at theme parks scattered across Florida.
</P>
<P>
   You pay big bucks and are herded through man-made attractions
where you see captive animals.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a quiet place near Venice where you can encounter
wild animals including a threatened species of bird _ the scrub jay
_ so close, one might even land on your head.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small preserve called Oscar Scherer State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful scrub jay is easily distinguished from much more
common blue jays: It has no crest on its head, and its feathers are
a lighter, sky-blue color. These curious animals live only in the
scrub habitat in Florida. Spreading development and agriculture
have greatly reduced their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Scherer State Park is in the midst of a large urban area,
but careful planning and preservation has made it a fantastic place
to view wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Bald eagles, bobcats, river otters, alligators, warblers and
woodpeckers are often seen year-round.
</P>
<P>
   The park covers more than 1,000 acres of pine flatwoods and
scrubby flatwoods on the banks of a tidal creek. Both flatwood
habitats are important for a number of declining species in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The park was established in 1955 when Elsa Scherer Burrows
donated 462 acres to the state in memory of her father, Oscar
Scherer, an inventor who developed a process for dyeing leather for
shoes in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   There are 98 campsites.
</P>
<P>
   And how to find those popular scrub jays? Park at the north side
of Lake Osprey and walk into the scrubby flatwoods to the
northeast. Family groups of curious scrub jays often come close to
visitors. DO NOT FEED THE BIRDS. (They lose their fear of humans
and they don't eat their natural diet, which leads to malnutrition
and death.)
</P>
<P>
   But if you hold an open hand out, often the birds will land on
your head, looking for a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Get out the binoculars for this park
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: With a choice of hiking trails, canoeing and
swimming, the exertion level is up to you. Bird-watching takes
patience.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Scherer State Park: Oscar Scherer State Park, 1843 S.
Tamiami Trail, Osprey, FL 33559; or call (941) 483-5956
</P>
<P>
   Hours: Sunrise to Sunset, sunrise to sunset, 7 days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $3.25 per vehicle; camping is extra.

 &HT;    DON'T LET THIS REMOTE FISHING VILLAGE GET AWAY
 &HT;    By CHERYL BLACKERBY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEINHATCHEE, Fla. _ The vehicles on County Road 51, the main
street of this tiny town, are mostly long-bed trucks pulling
fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fishing boats dock next to the banks of the
Steinhatchee River before it empties 2 miles downstream into
Deadman Bay on the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Marinas offer sport fishing boats, fishing guides, fishing
equipment, ``anglers sunglasses'' and ``anglers hats.''
</P>
<P>
   There's freshwater fishing and saltwater fishing. You like to
fish? Welcome to Steinhatchee.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of weathered houses strung along the river,
Steinhatchee (pronounced STEEN-hat-chee) is in the bend of the
state _ south of Tallahassee, due west of Gainesville and squarely
in the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to do here. Just fish,'' said a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity didn't come to Steinhatchee until 1945; telephone
service in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   There are no high-rise hotels, just a half-dozen low-rise,
low-rent motels _ the kind of places where no one minds if you
store bait in the fridge and track mud across the linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one upscale resort that attracts discerning
anglers, including former President Jimmy Carter in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhatchee Landing, a group of 20 new Victorian-style and
cracker cottages built next to the river, has the amenities of a
Marriott and the low-key ambience of a cabin in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Even the tiny two-room, two-story cottages have two TVs, VCR,
modern bath, kitchen with dishwasher, telephone, and washer and
dryer.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine that the resort is a small town in the last
century as you sit on the screen porch in a big country rocker and
look at the surrounding forest and towering moss-draped oaks.
Horses trot by the cabins taking riders from the stable to trails
along the river.
</P>
<P>
   But the pool, a small fitness center, a big restaurant, nature
trails, a fleet of bikes, games including archery and volleyball,
plus free use of bright red canoes give the feeling of being at a
luxurious summer camp for grown-ups. (Steinhatchee is only a couple
of miles from the gulf, but it's a 17-mile drive to a beach.)
</P>
<P>
   During my recent stay, the resort was filled with families, some
with three generations in attendance. A grandfather took two
teenage granddaughters on a bird-watching trip up the black,
slow-moving water of the Steinhatchee.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, on this wild river, that they can appreciate the
life of the Indians who once lived, hunted and fished here. If
guests are lucky they might see manatee and alligator in the river,
or deer, wild boar and fox venturing from the woods to the muddy
banks.
</P>
<P>
   But if they're really lucky, they'll catch a big tarpon. FISHING
FOR INFO ON STEINHATCHEE
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: Steinhatchee is a no-sweat kind of vacation except
for the gulf sun burning your skin like hamburger in a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhatchee Landing: Rates range from $110 ($660 per week) per
night for the one-bedroom, two-story cottages to $225 ($1,350 per
week) for the three-bedroom Presidential Retreat where President
Carter stayed in 1994. Call (352) 498-3513., The Steinhatchee River
Inn, a modern motel, is the Landing's sister hotel a couple of
miles down the river. Rates start at about $60.
</P>
<P>
   Horse rentals are $35 per hour for one horse, $25 each for two
or more horses per hour. The trips are led by the resort's
wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   Where is it? From West Palm Beach, take Florida's Turnpike until
it ends at Interstate 75. Go north to Ocala. Exit onto U.S. 27, and
drive north, then go north on U.S. Alternate 27. Take S.R. 351 to
Steinhatchee, about 2 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Books are the best part about moving
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I like to move. Some people dread it. My running buddy gets
downright stressed out about moving. That's probably because she's
only done it about three times, and the furthest she's ever moved
is about seven miles -- from one end of town to the other.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I have moved a ridiculous number of times.
I've moved in the neighborhood of two dozen times in 25 years to
seven different towns. Luckily, this latest move is just across
town. Don't get your hopes up. I'm not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I don't much enjoy the physical act of moving, since it means
either sweating or freezing, this being East Texas where the
weather is rarely described as moderate except in chamber
brochures. What I like is re-ordering the things we own, putting
pictures in different places, getting rid of stuff we don't need,
and listening to different sounds when I step outside early in the
morning to get the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The best part is moving the books. It's also one of the most
cumbersome parts, since my collection of books seems to grow in
inverse relation to the time available to read them. I am
particular about moving the books. In a cross-town move, I don't
want any help. I don't box them up. I move them by loading them in
the back of my Explorer one armload at a time until the back of the
truck is filled. I go to the new house and put them on the shelves
so they stay in the right order.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds goofy, but it works. When you box 1,500 books or so,
you end up with about 75 boxes of books. You can't put many books
in a box and still pick it up. Then you have to lug all the boxes
to the new location, unbox them and put them up. I have eliminated
the middle step.
</P>
<P>
   I reacquaint myself with my books when moving. Titles that have
stood on the shelf since the last move jump out at me. There's the
three-volume narrative of the Civil War by Shelby Foote. I still
need to read the last volume. Here's that biography of Harry Truman
I got halfway through before moving on to a piece of light fiction
with the vow to return to the weightier work soon. I need to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my books have smoke-tinged spines, a reminder of a house
fire 14 years ago that destroyed much of what we own, including
about half my books. I never have replaced the set of Harvard
Classics that burned. Some day I'll find a set in a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   There are even a few tattered remainders from the book store I
once owned in Nacogdoches in the mid-1970s, my first venture into
small-business ownership. It wasn't successful, but I still have a
copy of ``Does it Matter'' by Alan Watts and nearly all of Herman
Hesse's novels.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the few hundred or so books of Texana, much of
which comes free and unsolicited in the mail from book publishers
looking for reviews. These include some strange little books, such
as the ``History of Texas Baptist Journalism,'' ``What's Right With
Football,'' and ``Gone With the Kudzu.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm often asked, especially by kids, if I've read all these
books. No, I haven't, I answer truthfully. I don't ever want to be
in the position of having read all my books, because then I'd have
to go out and buy a bunch more. Nothing beats the delight and
anticipation of running your fingers down a shelf of books, looking
for something to read while a thunderstorm pounds outside.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's summer and presumably you have more time to read,
here are a few new titles I came across while lugging books across
town:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Cold New World,'' by William Finnegan, a writer for The New
Yorker. Recently published with a glowing review in Time, this is a
social history of four communities, including San Augustine across
the river. The other towns include New Haven, Connecticut, a small
town in Washington state, and South Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fine social history, disturbing in many ways as it
describes a common thread of lost youth in cities of all sizes.
Finnegan is an excellent reporter, meticulous and patient. He spent
more than six months living in San Augustine and then returned
several times. This is a great read.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Underworld,'' by Don Delilo. This is a strange novel that
centers on Bobby Thompson's home run to give the Giants the pennant
in 1951 and what happened to the baseball he hit out of the park.
It meanders through 40-plus years of American cultural changes in a
journey that is sometimes hard to keep up with, but is well worth
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``In the Beauty of the Lilies,'' by John Updike. Updike is
one of America's most durable novelists, and his latest effort is a
radical departure from previous work. It's set in Massachusetts in
2020 after an atomic war has destroyed much of the country. It has
Updike's typical suburban pathos and humor.
</P>
<P>
   Pick one of these books up if you're looking for a way to while
away the hours while on the beach. And think of me lugging those
boxes around while you're sunning.
</P>

Sentinel. His e-mail address is gborderscoxnews.com.

 &HT;    TOO MUCH PRESSURE AT THE OFFICE?
 &HT;    By CAROLYN SUSMAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you feel pressured at work?
</P>
<P>
   Are you sure everyone is talking about you behind your back?
</P>
<P>
   In short, does paranoia descend when you're at your desk?
</P>
<P>
   Don't dial the nearest therapist. Rearrange your chair.
</P>
<P>
   Relief can be as quick and convenient as changing your seating
arrangement, according to ``Feng Shui at Work'' (Villard Books,
$13.95). Author Kirsten M. Lagatree has researched this ancient
Chinese art of placement that puts surroundings in harmony with
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``With proper feng shui (pronounced fung shway),'' she writes,
``you can tilt the balance in your life toward financial success,
improved relationships, enhanced creativity _ whatever goals you
may have.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, your goal at work is to feel productive.
</P>
<P>
   This begins at the desk: ``The golden rule in determining
optimal desk placement is simple: When seated behind your desk, you
must always be able to see the door.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens when you can't?
</P>
<P>
   _ You'll always be surprised by people entering your office and
(worse) by things they tell you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because your back is exposed, you may be the victim of
backstabbing and office politics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even the most easygoing person can become paranoid in this
situation and colleagues will notice.
</P>
<P>
   But don't panic. There is a solution, even if you can't move
your chair so you greet visitors. Put a mirror over your desk so
you can see who's approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to empower yourself at the office is to place your
desk with enough space to view as much of your workspace as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   And third, feng shui adherents advise, avoid an L-shaped desk.
</P>
<P>
   The ``L'' suggests an incompleteness that can undermine your
authority, cut you off from your colleagues, or cause chronic
physical maladies. But there's also a solution here. Fill in the
missing corner with a plant or floor lamp.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to create a hazard by doing this, put a fan on
your desk to keep your good energy - your ``chi'' - circulating
around you.
</P>
<P>
   Sound silly? That's OK. But don't dismiss it. Feng shui might be
the key to another worker's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not disturbing to other coworkers or the
administration and it provides the employee with a measure of
comfort, a sense of ritual or tradition, it can be enhancing to
their ability to organize their work and concentrate,'' says Palm
Beach Gardens psychologist Janet Hibel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can decrease workplace stress, then it's positive.''

 &HT;    HOW DISNEY'S ORLANDO STUDIOS CREATED A CARTOON SPECTACLE
 &HT;    By HAP ERSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Tom Bancroft remembers with a wince his days in
the fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   One of the supervising animators on Disney's new cartoon feature
``Mulan,'' Bancroft started his career as a stop on the Disney-MGM
Studios tour here. Walking through a mock-up of artists' offices,
tourists could see him and other animators sketching and doodling.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Bancroft's favorite part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we weren't drawing, people would go like, `Get back to
work,' '' he recalls. ``They wanted a better tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry never took the studio's Florida animation unit
seriously. Neither, for that matter, did Disney's top executive
Michael Eisner, who initiated the group for the sake of tours. As
he is reported to have said, ``What it actually does, I don't care
about.''
</P>
<P>
   That was nine years ago. Tomorrow, the unit's first feature, the
Chinese fable ``Mulan,'' opens nationwide. The group that the
industry once scoffed at unveils what is probably the studio's best
release in years.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives try to put a positive spin on it, but their
recent animated features, ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and
``Hercules,'' were box office disappointments. Long before they
failed to meet expectations, Disney animation executives started
searching for material that would let them move into a new realm of
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter (Schneider, president of Disney Feature Animation) and I
were talking about the idea that we needed to get out of what we
thought was a pretty conventional circle of movies,'' recalls
executive vice president Tom Schumacher. ``We referred to them as
castle and wimple movies, movies that were very Western and
European-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they looked to the East, sifting through Asian folk
tales for material to apply the Disney touch to. After rejecting
stories from Korea and Japan that lacked a universal, uplifting
appeal, they embraced the age-old ``Legend of Mulan,'' the saga of
a young Chinese woman who goes off to war disguised as a man. A
little bit ``Yentl,'' a little bit ``G.I. Jane,'' it had a strong
theme of female empowerment and an attractive parent-child bonding
message.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the core animation and production team left from
Florida for China to soak up atmosphere and immerse themselves in
the culture. The visit is typical of the care and expense lavished
on the project. Although Disney executives refuse to discuss the
cost, Variety estimates ``Mulan's'' budget at $90 million, as much
as 25 percent higher than the average animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   For the Orlando team, that's a long way from a tour exhibit. The
change came in the late 1980s, when the Florida animators produced
some cartoon shorts. By 1990, they were assigned a 10-minute
segment of ``The Rescuers Down Under.'' They delivered so well that
these support jobs continued, including the creation of 25 minutes
of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, animation president Schneider, feeling confident of the
unit, started thinking about giving them a complete movie.
``Artistically, they had proved that they could produce at a
quality far beyond what was ever intended,'' he says. ``It made
sense to challenge them further and give them a crack at a project
that was truly their own.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of ``Mulan's'' premiere, the staff is feeling bullish
about its work. ``I think we've proven ourselves already,'' says
supervising animator Mark Henn, who studied under the old guard
Disney animators and oversaw the character of Mulan. ``A lot of
people outside the studio didn't think we had it in us here to make
this kind of a movie at this quality. No matter what happens with
this film, we've already proven to them that we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the 1,400-employee Burbank animation unit, the
400-member Florida team is smaller, younger and greener, which the
group turned to its advantage. They dubbed themselves ``the little
studio that could.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was a fairly young group, fairly inexperienced, but
they were passionate about it,'' says ``Mulan's'' co-director, Tony
Bancroft. ``They wanted to prove what they could do as artists.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, ``Mulan'' looks different from other Disney
animated movies, adopting a flat, simple Asian watercolor style for
its backgrounds. It is cast _ carefully, but appropriately _ with a
host of Asian-American voices, from Min-Na Wen and B.D. Wong in the
leading roles, to George Takei, Pat Morita and James Shigeta in
supporting cameos. (But it also has Donny Osmond singing and Harvey
Fierstein as a gruff, macho soldier.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the California animators, who are currently working on a
handful of different features such as ``Tarzan,'' the new
``Fantasia'' and an original Inca story called ``Kingdom of the
Sun,'' the Florida unit concentrated all its efforts on ``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   Those with experience working on both coasts noted a different
atmosphere in Orlando. ``We tend to have a more easygoing approach,
maybe less competitive, less stressed feeling here,'' says Tom
Bancroft, brother of Tony, who supervised the animation of the
dragon character Mushu. ``In California, it's a bit more of a rat
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood could be attributed to the top Disney brass being 3,000
miles away. ``It's always fun to just be off by yourself,'' says
``Mulan'' producer Pam Coats. ``It's that old saying, `It's easier
to beg forgiveness than to get permission.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, Disney's fascination with emerging technology
and zeal for micro-management meant that the Burbank Mouse Factory
kept close tabs on Orlando. They reviewed all storyboards and
animation sequences, often tossing them away or sending them back
for revision.
</P>
<P>
   The geographic distance was minimized by a 24-hour television
link. That link has since been expanded to Disney's newest
animation unit, established in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many decentralized operations? With the current boom in
animation that has Disney Studios committed to two major releases a
year, the need for trained animators has grown. And Disney
recognizes that not everyone is willing to move to Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the top European artists quite frankly want to live
in Europe,'' says Coats. ``And a lot of people who are really good
at what they do really love Florida. They love the climate for
raising families, and they're happy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tangible evidence of Disney's commitment to the Florida unit is
its new 200,000-square-foot animation center, a state-of-the-art
office complex opened in April to replace the makeshift facilities
_ ``glorified trailers,'' as Coats describes them _ where ``Mulan''
was made. And yes, as a further reminder of the unit's roots, you
can still tour a mock-up of an animation studio at the Disney-MGM
theme park and watch artists sketching and doodling.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Florida animators are waiting for critical and
public reaction to ``Mulan,'' they haven't put down their pencils.
Some of the staff is working on a new short based on the John Henry
legend, others are toiling on a sequence for ``Kingdom of the
Sun,'' due for release in 2000. A third group is brainstorming
story concepts for the unit's next full feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we were always dependent on California to find
something for us,'' says Henn. ``They finally gave us the support,
encouraging us to come up with our own ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some post-production work, such as color
correction and print duplication, the Orlando animation unit
insists it can do anything that the California studio can.
</P>
<P>
   As Coats puts it, ``Working in Florida is the feel of working in
a mom-and-pop store, with the money of Bloomingdale's.''

 &HT;    Belongs in Smithsonian?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``You aren't going to publish that letter, are
you?'' asked the worried man at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C. Apparently, Smithsonian management loathes the
impression that its employees waste time with humorous
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   I called to check on a letter supposedly written by a
Smithsonian curator to an eccentric gentleman who sends items he
digs out of his backyard to Smithsonian experts for verification. A
reader sent a copy of the letter to me.
</P>
<P>
   The undated letter from the Smithsonian's Paleoanthropology
Division began: ``Thank you for your latest submission to the
Institute, labeled '211- D,
</P>
<P>
   layer seven, next to the clothesline post. Hominid skull.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given this specimen a careful and detailed examination
and regret to inform you that we disagree with your theory that it
</P>
<P>
   represents 'conclusive proof of the presence of Early Man in
Charleston
</P>
<P>
   County two million years ago.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, it appears that what you have found is the head of a
Barbie doll, of the variety one of our staff, who has small
children, believes to be the 'Malibu Barbie.' It is evident that
you have given a great deal of thought to the analysis of this
specimen. . . However, we do feel that there are a number of
physical attributes of the specimen which might have tipped you off
to it's modern origin:
</P>
<P>
   ``1. The material is molded plastic. Ancient hominid remains are
typically fossilized bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``2. The cranial capacity of the specimen is approximately 9
cubic centimeters, well below the threshold of even the earliest
identified proto-hominids.
</P>
<P>
   ``3. The dentition pattern evident on the 'skull' is more
consistent with the common domesticated dog than it is with the
``ravenous man-eating Pliocene clams'' you speculate roamed the
wetlands during that time. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Without going into too much detail, let us say that:
</P>
<P>
   ``A. The specimen looks like the head of a Barbie doll that a
dog has chewed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``B. Clams don't have teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with feelings tinged with melancholy that we must deny
your request to have the specimen carbon dated. This is partially
due to the
</P>
<P>
   heavy load our lab must bear . . . and partly due to carbon
dating's notorious inaccuracy in fossils of recent geologic record.
To the best
</P>
<P>
   of our knowledge, no Barbie dolls were produced prior to 1956
AD. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, we must also deny your request that we approach the
National Science Foundation's Phylogeny Department with the concept
of
</P>
<P>
   assigning your specimen the scientific name 'Australopithecus
spiff-arino.'
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we gladly accept your generous donation of this
fascinating specimen to the museum. . . You should know that our
Director has
</P>
<P>
   reserved a special shelf in his own office for the display of
the specimens you have previously submitted. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We eagerly anticipate your trip to our nation's capital that
you proposed in your last letter, and several of us are pressing
the
</P>
<P>
   Director to pay for it. We are particularly interested in
hearing you expand on your theories surrounding the
'trans-positating fillifitation of ferrous ions in a structural
matrix' that makes the excellent juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex femur
you recently discovered take on the deceptive appearance of a rusty
9-mm Sears Craftsman automotive crescent wrench.''
</P>
<P>
   It was signed, ``Yours in Science, Harvey Rowe, Curator,
Antiquities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of calls on that letter,'' said the distressed
man I had been transferred to. It's a complete fabrication. You
won't print it, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not without editing it for length and saying it wasn't really
a letter from the Smithsonian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, OK.''

 &HT;    Bargain shooping is the sport of chaotic Tangier
 &HT;    By Clara Herrera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TANGIER, Morocco _ A cobra bares its hooded head on cobblestone
streets laid in the 12th century. Men selling tea kettles and drums
made of turtle shells surround you as you saunter down streets as
narrow as a sidewalk and as winding as a maze.
</P>
<P>
   This African city, a day trip from Malaga and a ferry ride from
the Rock of Gibraltar, is a visual sensation for foreign eyes to
behold.
</P>
<P>
   Sheep graze under the gaze of a shepherd near modern homes. The
view of the city and its port is spectacular from hills above,
where the king's palace sits. (A brief ride on a camel costs about
50 cents.)
</P>
<P>
   Sound a bit like your basic tourist trap? It is. Three words to
remember in Tangier: bargain, bargain, bargain. Also remember if
you're not interested in buying something, don't look or act
interested or you' ll be swamped by friendly, but aggressive,
peddlers.
</P>
<P>
   But, amid the chaos, Tangier is worth the trip, if only for the
experience of being there.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Malaga costs about $60 including the bus ride,
ferry ride and lunch. Set aside a full day for this adventure. The
trip begins before sunrise and ends late in the evening. The travel
time is longer than the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to tour the city is with someone you know who lives
there. Since that is an option for few, the next best bet is with a
guide. Bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic,
Tangier is a mixture of the modern and the old.
</P>
<P>
   It's three major religions are Christian, Jewish and Muslim.
When you go with a guide, you'll spend the bulk of your time in the
Casbah, the older, Muslim-dominated part of the city. The tiled
restaurants and buildings you'll see are pure art. Don't stray from
the guide because it's easy to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be amazed by the closet-sized `stores'' that face the
streets where merchants sell everything from round loaves of bread
to intricate jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's customs may catch you off guard so be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Make a copy of your passport before you go. Police take up most
passports upon entry and don't return them until you leave.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wear shorts, and if you're a bit squeamish about
unsanitary food, you're best bet is to take bottled water and
something to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Once off the ferry, your guide will corral you on a bus, show
you the outsides of palaces, give you a chance to ride a camel and
then take you on the hard sell. You'll sit in huge rooms with
Oriental rugs of all sizes and colors. You'll visit what they
consider to be a pharmacy with walls lined with spices in bottles.
</P>
<P>
   A three-man band will sit on cushions and serenade you on drums,
a sitar and lute as you drink tea, eat cookies and admire tiled
walls and an upstairs view of the old Casbah market.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that you probably won't get to wander the market
of copper sellers. There's a big part of it that the tourist
doesn't see. The good news is that most of the merchants you'll
deal with speak English and aren't rudely aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to buy that silver necklace or wood-carved
statuette, you'll get a better price if you pay with any type of
currency besides the dirham _ the native money. So use anything
from dollars to pesetas.
</P>
<P>
   Also, remember that merchants will initially ask for at least
double the price they expect to get. If you pay full price, you're
a fool. Bargaining is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Take your walking shoes. Tangier's winding streets, foreign ways
and bargain treasures are an experience you won't forget.

 &HT;    Beekeeping banned in Florida town
 &HT;    By Lisa Ocker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ With more than 3 million bees in 68 hives,
Jack Rollins used to be among a few hundred state-registered
beekeepers in South Florida. Now, the semi-retired barber, who
learned beekeeping from his uncle in his native Kentucky coal
country, is one of a few dozen in the region. And he's the only bee
man in Boca.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he almost became the last.
</P>
<P>
   City codes don't allow beekeeping, Code Compliance Administrator
Ruby Childers said.
</P>
<P>
   When the city received some anonymous complaints _ bee droppings
on a neighbor's lawn, an allergic woman's fears about being stung _
the city slapped Rollins with a code violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't bother you unless you bother them,'' said Rollins,
73. ``I can't say the same for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   With a petition in support signed by most of his neighbors and
about 20 supporters in the audience, Rollins persuaded the code
enforcement board Monday to let him keep his three-banded Italian
honey bees. The vote was 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   A past code violation forced Rollins to move most of his 68
hives in 1996, but finding new homes wasn't hard.
</P>
<P>
   People who appreciate nature appreciate the little pollinators,
he says. ``Not everybody is a city slicker from Fifth and Broadway
who's never seen a tree grow in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins used to hunt quail on vacant fields just yards from his
house on Northwest 14th Avenue. His hives, each containing some
50,000-60,000 bees, produced 750 pounds of honey per hive a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are houses on those fields now and Rollins' hives have
dwindled to four, but each still draws some 50,000 bees and 750
pounds of honey per year. He keeps them on a nearby lot on
Northwest 15th Avenue, with grapefruit, orange, lime, tangelo,
papaya, banana and mulberry trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just changing. When you get people, people, people,
there's no room for anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Joyner, urban horticulturalist for the county's
agricultural extension service, agrees that increased development
has hurt the bee population.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time, people complain about their fruit trees blooming
year after year, but they never see any fruit developing,'' Joyner
said. ``That's why we encourage people, whenever they can, to keep
bees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins gives away most of his honey and pollen. He also gives
away bees to people who sting themselves to relieve symptoms of
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, he said.library
checking for legitimacy of medical treatment.. And whenever there's
a wayward swarm of bees, Rollins is the bee man; 911 operators call
him for help.

 &HT;    Two-thirds of Ohio fourth graders face repeated term
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If the state's new ``fourth grade guarantee''
were in effect today, two-thirds of the area's school districts
would be faced with retaining 40 percent or more of their
fourth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which takes effect in July 2001, requires that students
pass the reading portion of the Ohio Fourth Grade Proficiency Test
before advancing to the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   But school district report cards issued this month by the state
show a wide disparity between the number of fourth graders
currently promoted to fifth grade and the number of those students
passing the reading test. Just over half of the 60 districts in
Montgomery, Miami, Warren, Greene, Shelby, Preble and Darke
counties, Ohio, send all fourth graders to the fifth grade,
according to statistics gathered by the Ohio Department of
Education. No local district promotes less than 96 percent of
fourth graders.
</P>
<P>
   But reading passage rates range from a low of 23.8 percent for
Dayton schools to a high of 84.1 percent in Oakwood, with the bulk
of schools having passage rates of less than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although state and local school officials remain optimistic that
the gap will be narrowed by the time the law takes effect, it is
clear that educators soon will need to address the thorny issues
around forcing students to repeat a grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preponderance of research shows that retention has adverse
effects on the social, emotional and intellectual development of
children,'' said Sam Sava, executive director of the National
Association of Elementary School Principals. ``Retention is an
absolute last resort in order to help a youngster achieve in his or
her areas of skills.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2.6 million children are retained annually, Sava
said.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that children who are retained perform more poorly
on average when they go on to the next grade than if they had not
been retained, according to a summary of research data provided by
Monica Zarichny, Ohio Department of Education spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dropouts are five times more likely to have repeated a grade
than are high school graduates. Students who repeat two grades have
a probability of dropping out of nearly 100 percent,'' the research
summary stated.
</P>
<P>
   The state's law does provide some flexibility. Students are
given three chances to pass the test, rather than the current
single opportunity. And those who have failed the test may be
promoted if the school principal and reading teacher agree that the
child is academically ready for the fifth grade. Disabled children
may be exempted from the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires districts to offer intense help to
struggling students after the third grade and the state is
developing a program for schools to improve reading curriculum. The
question of who will pay for those programs has not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Connolly, director of policy and communications for the Ohio
Senate Republican Caucus, said, ``The whole purpose is to be sure
that kids know how to read because if they can't read, they can't
do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will retaining students achieve that goal?
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Johnson, a Dayton schools lead principal, said a
student's ability to gain from retention depends on many factors,
including the child's attendance history, age, communication
skills, physical size, previous retentions and intelligence level.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of the child and the parent toward retention also
is critical.
</P>
<P>
   Fairborn parent Yvette Sales, 28, protested her son's promotion
to the sixth grade this year despite a report card dotted with Fs.
The school district has now offered her a range of help, including
financial aid for summer school, and given her the final choice on
whether or not he will move up a grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before my son goes on to sixth grade I want to know he can
grasp on sixth grade material,'' said Sales, who will delay her
decision until after the 11-year-old boy completes summer school.
``I don't want him to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Retention tends not to hurt children who have good self-esteem
and social skills and those who are able to catch up easily,
according to the National Association of School Psychologists. It
also may help children who have missed school due to illness or
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Educators were unanimous in saying that each child should be
considered on an individual basis and that elementary school
retention doesn't do any good if nothing changes in the way the
child is being taught the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't identify what skills are missing in Johnny's
foundation and if holding him back in the fourth grade doesn't
directly address them and target those skills, what good is that
going to do?'' asked Debbie Slavens, executive director of Sylvan
Learning Centers of Vandalia, Piqua and Richmond, a local company
offering remedial and enrichment programs.

 &HT;    BOOKREVIEW: Greene's back with another 50 best
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1981, in Texas Monthly magazine, A.C. Greene published a
daring piece called ``The 50 Best Texas Books.'' The piece was
swiftly followed by reactions from several Texas writers, including
Texas most widely read novelist, Larry McMurtry, who has since won
a Pulitzer Prize for literature.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't talked with Mr. Greene directly about this, but I
would assume that this reaction was his aim when he wrote the
article. McMurtry's response, in effect, was that there really
weren't 50 best books by Texans. His essay was entitled, ``Ever a
Bridegroom: Reflections on the Failure of Texas Literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to that quote ``was immediate and sometimes
explosive,'' which no doubt was part of the aim of Mr. McMurtry's
reply.
</P>
<P>
   Before Texas can produce a notable share of best literature, the
thinking goes, it first must passionately discuss what's already on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   So, that was 15 years ago and the furor has since died down. Now
along comes A.C. Greene with a book entitled ``The 50 Plus Best
Books on Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to his new book, and it's mostly new, Greene
says: ``In the 16 years that ``The 50 Best Books on Texas'' has
been around it has become a kind of guidebook to Texas literature,
which embarrasses me. It was not conceived as that...the listings
are my picks... Some books have been dropped from that '50 Best'
list...Texas writing is changing. Many more Hispanic and black
writers will explore their Texas roots or relationships as
individuals. More Texas writers will pursue the peculiar puzzles of
life in the larger Texas cities, and perhaps the day will come when
there will be no need, other than for historical reasons, for lists
of best books about Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's new list includes J. Frank Dobie's ``Coronado's
Children,'' and Larry L. King's ``And Other Dirty Stories,'' a wide
range at first glimpse but not so wide after I thought about it for
a while.
</P>
<P>
   I won't attempt to put the entire list here, but some of my
special favorites include ``Horse Tradin''' by Ben K. Green and
``Blessed McGill'' by Bud Shrake. There's also John Graves
wonderful ``Goodbye to a River .''
</P>
<P>
   Greene left out one of my favorites -- Cormac McCarthy's ``All
the Pretty Horses'' -- because, he says in his introduction, ``...
while it skips across the Texas-Mexico border, it is basically a
novel of Mexico.'' I might could argue about that some, but I won't
do so here.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very interesting book, particularly for Texana
collectors by a man who knows what he's talking about, even if you
disagree with him along the way, which, as previously mentioned, is
at least partly the reason for the list in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been riding in MIR the past few decades you may not
know who A.C. Greene is. For those readers I repeat the following.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green was the book editor, editorial page editor and
columnist for the Dallas Times-Herald before being awarded the
Dobie-Paisano fellowship which resulted in his classic book, ``A
Personal Country,'' now available in trade paperback. He has
published more than 22 books, including his first novel just this
year, ``They are Ruining Ibiza,'' which was reviewed here recently.
He currently writes a column for the Dallas Morning News.

   BEIJING _ This is the city central to your China trip.
</P>
<P>
   From the chaotic alleys called hutongs to the grace of the
Forbidden City built for the emperor and his entourage, China's
capital can keep you happily occupied for five days. After that, it
gets to be work.
</P>
<P>
   An aimless stroll or float across the lake in Beihai Park will
put you in the company of Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or
try hunting down the Niujie Mosque, where tranquil gardens date
back to the 15th Century, and the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple
to see an ancient spiritual dimension of modern Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations specific to Beijing touring:
</P>
<P>
   Take care if attracted by the colorful, fun-looking pedi-cabs
whose drivers will drive you crazy with their constant pitch to
ride. They're safe enough, but at the end of the trip the peddlers
will find some reason to charge you more than the promised price.
It's unpleasant and worth avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   You will want a day trip to climb the Great Wall and can choose
one of three places to do it. Pass up Badaling if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mutianyu is a site half an hour further from the center of
Beijing, but is much less crowded and more majestic. Even further
from downtown is Simatai, which we find most impressive. Both
Mutianyu and Simatai run cable cars up the steep ridges to the
wall, but Simatai still requires a taxing half-hour climb up stone
stairs from the top of the cable. The wall itself has not been
repaired for the last couple of centuries, so walking the entire
open section is real exercise and not recommended on a wet day. Yet
the isolation of the place, small numbers of tourists, and
unspoiled mountain vistas are magnificent. Plus, the ride out gives
an intriguing glimpse of village and farm life.
</P>
<P>
   Our most important advice is to get a hotel as close to the
center as possible, which means the environs of the Forbidden City
and Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of luxury hotels string out toward the airport in the
northeast, but they are best reserved for business travelers whose
duties take them to the new high-rise office buildings also located
there. Most are a 40-minute to one-hour drive from the center, and
offer little to visit unless the Hard Rock Cafe is your top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Hotel and Palace Hotel are in the lively Wangfujing
shopping district about a 15- to 20-minute walk from the entry of
the Forbidden City. The Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza (the chain's only
hotel in the center) is in the same area, and all three are well
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   However, our favorite is the place we're living, the Beijing
Hotel. Although a Chinese government hotel, it used to be the only
place foreigners could stay. It isn't a five-star luxury hotel, but
has nearly all the amenities you could need. It is surrounded by
shops and restaurants and is within two blocks of Tiananmen Square.
The hotel's gift shops are reasonable and have a huge selection,
should you chose not to spend hours digging through Beijing's
eclectic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Its selection of foreign-language television is limited mostly
to CNN, but the view from your balcony will be much more beguiling
than any television program. When making a reservation, have your
travel agent request a room on a high floor ending in the numbers
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43 or 44, which all face the western hills.
</P>
<P>
   From these rooms, you will directly overlook the red and yellow
pitched roofs of the Forbidden City, and with binoculars can see
details of the morning flag-raising on Tiananmen Square. The scene
is unmatched.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: AMA throws up petty puff of smoke
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 21, 1998.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, on the very day that Trent
Lott and his troops were killing a politically mutated anti-tobacco
bill, chose not to condemn the U.S. Senate but to flay the Chicago
Bulls instead.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was not the $40 million the tobacco industry spent to
fight the bill but the fact that Michael Jordan, Scotty Pippen and
others of the three-in-a-row National Basketball Association
champion team lit up cigars following their victory.
</P>
<P>
   (Inasmuch as hockey is not as popular, the AMA apparently chose
to ignore the fact that Detroit Red Wings star Vladimir
Kostantinov, critically injured in an auto accident, wheelchair
bound and with severe short-term memory problems, also displayed a
cigar while celebrating his teammates' second consecutive Stanley
Cup victory Tuesday night.)
</P>
<P>
   At convention _ in Chicago, no less _ the delegates voted 474-1
(the dissenter thought it should be handled privately) to tell the
Bulls they were appalled by the cigars and to urge sports teams and
the TV industry not to show tobacco products after sports events.
</P>
<P>
   It sends a dangerous message to kids, the AMA contended. (No
mention was made of champagne, an enduring celebratory item and
speed-path to inebriety.)
</P>
<P>
   I no longer am a smoker, haven't been for some time, abhor
cigarette and cigar smoke, won't take a table in a restaurant near
a smoker, but I've got to tell you that this is what I believe is
the message sent by the Chicago Bulls:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win three straight NBA championships, when you win
six in eight years, when you come to the realization it's the
Bulls' ``last dance,'' you are entitled to light up a stogie _ no
matter how bad it may look.''
</P>
<P>
   I have the same feeling for first-time daddies, as long as it
remains a unique experience: ``It's twins! Have a cigar!''
</P>
<P>
   While I do not believe I have had a cigar in my mouth since
Fidel Castro rode into power 38 years ago, I promise I will light
one (just one) the day he leaves _ and damn the consequences,
medical or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Don't necessarily light up, but lighten up, docs.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much more on TV every day and night that can damage
kids (and adults) that a vote against a celebratory cigar just
comes across as petty piffle.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the AMA has waged a good war against tobacco, one I
certainly support. But to seize upon this moment of celebration,
this singular instant, is to devalue the legitimate struggle
against tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   I recall no such reaction toward that voyeuristic moment when
Bill Clinton, a strong supporter of the failed anti-tobacco
legislation, was caught by a long lens in his African hotel room,
ostensibly celebrating the Paula Jones case dismissal, with a cigar
in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I also wonder how many of the 474 delegates who voted against
the Bulls' public use of cigars are closet smokers, living a deceit
and supporting the tobacco industry directly.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA has very important work on its agenda, and the war
against tobacco is high on that list, as it also is a war against
cancer and heart disease. To take the time and energy to get into
an uproar over Michael Jordan with a cigar between his lips seems a
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, everyone wants to be like Michael, but I don't think his
celebrating what may be his last great victory with a cigar is the
image his admirers will try to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more to Michael Jordan than just a puff a smoke.
And the kids all know it.

   BEIJING _ If you know China, don't bother reading this. You are
already convinced that from megalopolis to mist-shrouded
mountaintop, China is an engaging place.
</P>
<P>
   This is written for the couple of hundred million other
Americans who may love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't
yet made it to the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers
spectacular travel _ riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing
thousands of years and enticing food on almost every corner of
every city.
</P>
<P>
   If the news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to
China June 25-July 3 intrigues you _ whether it's an aged peasant's
creased smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the
hook in your wanderlust _ make a plan and go for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months we've been living and working in China,
we've managed a sampling of some not-to-miss places. China is more
tourist-friendly than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also recognize that this still isn't a country
for the haphazard traveler _ except one who is very experienced,
very patient, or well-versed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist infrastructure is still building, which means the
Chinese working the taxis, trains and hotels often aren't equipped
to meet the needs of the traveler without a group or a guide.
</P>
<P>
   You will be hard-pressed to find an English speaker even at a
place as cosmopolitan as the Beijing train station. (Our lessons in
Mandarin proved critical the first night we arrived in Beijing. Our
train was two hours late, and the travel agent who was supposed to
meet us at the train station had deserted, leaving us to track down
luggage in an unmarked back room, then negotiate a little-used
customs office and find a midnight taxi at a remote corner of the
station.)
</P>
<P>
   And few cities outside Beijing and Shanghai bother to
transliterate street signs into pinyin, the Latin equivalent of
Chinese characters that enables westerners to follow a map.
</P>
<P>
   That said, even the most inexperienced tourist can select from
the huge palette of sites available in China and create a wonderful
vacation. It requires some groundwork, but then so does most
foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
   In our wanderings here, we've come up with a few tips that may
help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most relaxing aspects of touring China _ and one of
the most essential _ is reading the guidebooks. Compared to the
travel books on many parts of the world, those about China are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   These are good reads even if you're not planning a trip, but
just interested in the world's most populous nation with one of the
world's oldest cultures.
</P>
<P>
   We have four recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   -- The newly updated ``Fodor's China'' may be the best
all-around book for an American tourist, giving evocative history
and cultural notes along with hotel and restaurant listings that
you can count on to meet U.S. comfort standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Lonely Planet'' includes lower-budget listings and
information that may appeal more to the younger traveler.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Rough Guide'' presents a breezier British style, and in
addition to the typical sites and accommodations, it covers places
slightly off the well-trod western tourist track. It also has a
good section on Chinese phrases.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ``Blue Guide'' is useful for its typically exhaustive
descriptions of every tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever book you choose, you can believe their descriptions
that defy the stories travelers brought home just 10 or 15 years
ago about austere Chinese hotels and lousy restaurants. That isn't
true today.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a package tour or travelling independently may be a
harder decision in China than elsewhere. You will almost certainly
run into glitches if you go it alone. The question is how easily
you can adjust to complications.
</P>
<P>
   Your American travel agent can make bookings if you opt out of a
group trip, but normally cannot hand over to you in advance the
tickets for internal China transportation. Foreign travel agencies
must rely on the government's China International Travel Services
(CITS), which tries hard but may fall a dab short of success.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before flight time, we have been handed tickets with the
wrong return flight. We've also encountered other travelers who
either got incorrect tickets or were missing tickets when CITS
delivered them to the hotel. One obstacle is that CITS insists on
parcelling out tickets as you travel through your itinerary, rather
than issue a full set when you arrive. That leaves scant time for
fixing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is arranging transportation as you go along.
It sounds daunting, but is remarkably easy. Travel agencies have
offices in most major hotels and can write air and train tickets on
the spot, though making such late reservations carries a small
chance of your chosen flight being fully booked. One pitfall: you
will probably find the departure city and the destination written
in Chinese characters. To get around this, ask the travel agent to
give you a computer printout of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a guide to walk you through major airports, since
signs and announcements are in both Chinese and English. Flight
attendants also use both languages, but communication much beyond
``coffee'' or ``beer'' might strain the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is a confidence-building experience. Many airlines
use Boeing jets on internal routes, and all follow international
standards _ no goats on board or passengers sitting on suitcases in
the aisles, as happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is whether you can handle a flight that
gets diverted. We ran into a Canadian couple who related the
harrowing experience of making an unscheduled landing at a small
regional airport near Chongqing due to weather. No one spoke
English, and local Chinese verged on a brawl because even they
could get no information for hours on when flights might resume.
</P>
<P>
   But these chance complications are minimal and normally can be
overcome with patience. Many travelers _ us among them _ much
prefer such risks to the homogenization of group travel. We would
rather spend time harassing a CITS agent than waiting for 200
people to get on and off the buses. Travelers choose their own
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're travelling outside a tour group, you may
well find it worth the cost to stay at an internationally
recognized hotel. The guidebooks list plenty, and your travel agent
can add hundreds more now that good hotels are proliferating across
China. Outside Beijing and Shanghai, a nice room costs about $120 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   One easy pick is the Holiday Inn, which is not the priciest and
offers fully two dozen hotels in China. These are true havens when
you come back exhausted from crowded, dusty streets, having seen
one fried chicken foot too many, and find yourself longing for a
chef's salad in front of an in-house movie in English. Yet the Inns
carry a local flavor, including their Chinese restaurants that are
as savory as those on the street and have more reliable sanitation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn is so attuned to western needs that it is the
only hotel we've seen with conspicuous signs in every room warning
not to drink the tap water. Our advice: never drink tap water
anywhere, unless your hotel tells you water has been safely
purified in its own plant.
</P>
<P>
   A western hotel also can help arrange a city or museum tour,
whether they have such excursions scheduled or must ring an agent
to find you a personal guide. For the latter you may have to pout a
bit, but there usually is an English-speaking concierge who can be
convinced to help.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that staff are always willing to assist you
getting around their city. They gladly give directions. More
importantly, they will write in Chinese the address you are
seeking, so you can simply hand the paper to the taxi driver _ who
likely won't speak English _ or to a passer-by if you're lost on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   As for restaurants, 100 flowers are blooming. They're
everywhere. And we have yet to stumble across a truly bad one. Ten
years ago, tourists complained that they had to stop in Hong Kong
or San Francisco to eat good Chinese food. Not so today.
</P>
<P>
   You do, however, want to take care in ordering. Chinese cuisine
in China isn't necessarily the same as what appears on the table in
Austin, West Palm Beach, or Atlanta. (EDITORS: YOU MIGHT SUBSTITUTE
THE NAME OF YOUR CITY.) At one of our favorite places in Beijing,
the waitress jokes about bringing us snake _ and she wouldn't have
to go far because they're sitting in the window tank next to the
eels.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you read Chinese, you ought to ask if a restaurant has an
English-language menu before you sit down to dine. What you want is
a ``ying-wen de cai dan'' (pronounced ``ying wen de tsai dan'').
Otherwise you may end up with pig ears or the ubiquitous chicken
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood restaurants are usually much better, as well as
much cheaper than most hotel eateries with dumbed-down cuisines. We
usually dine out for less than $10 for two of us.
</P>
<P>
   One other tip on water: most Chinese will use a kleenex to wipe
off the little plates, rice bowls, glasses and even chopsticks set
out on restaurant tables, to sop up any rogue drops of tap water
left from washing. We do, too.
</P>
<P>
   We also try to bring along an extra paper napkin or tissue,
since the only napkins supplied at most restaurants are single-ply
paper sheets measuring about four inches square.
</P>
<P>
   We also strongly advise that you consider at least one leg of
travel by boat or train. Either will give you a close-up view of
the countryside where two-thirds of China's 1.2 billion people
live.
</P>
<P>
   Chugging through rice paddies by rail you sense the solidity and
longevity of China, watching scenes impossible to imagine from the
cityscapes of Beijing or Shanghai or Xian. Straw-hatted peasants
squat in water-logged fields or urge a water buffalo to lumber
home. How different could it have looked 1,000 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The best tourist cruise is down the Yangtze River, passing the
mystical sheer cliffs of the Three Gorges and the terraced farm
lands that generations of Chinese painstakingly built up the
mountainsides. A new dam will alter the character of this famous
landscape after the year 2003, raising the river the height of a
60-story building. The beauty will not be fully erased, but the
drama will be gone. Go soon.

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ China's movers and shakers will activate a global
re-education campaign when President Bill Clinton reaches the
country on Thursday with an entourage expected here to number more
than 1,000 aides, congressmen, journalists, industrialists and
think-tankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images of China in the United States are not yet
adequate,'' said Zhou Mingwei, director general of Shanghai's
foreign affairs department, a branch of the Chinese foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important opportunity at this moment, at the
end of this century and the beginning of the new century, for
America to have a better idea about China.''
</P>
<P>
   Image _ that was the word most-repeated by a range of Chinese
interviewed about the importance to their country of Clinton's
unprecedented nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is China's hope for blotting out the image of a
monolithic, unyielding communist power, the image freeze-framed in
millions of Western minds in the shape of a man standing defiantly
alone in the path of a tank during the bloody crackdown that ended
the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989. It happened three
months after then-U.S. President George Bush walked on Chinese
soil, but assured that nearly a decade would lapse before another
president dared to return.
</P>
<P>
   In full concert with the White House, China is orchestrating a
tour competitive with Madison Avenue's deftest ad campaigns, one
aimed at reforming Western views of China on a scale grander than
the ``re-education'' of urbanites dispatched to learn from the
peasants in the harrowing 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   From the glories of ancient culture to the high-tech marvels of
tomorrow, the president will discover China.
</P>
<P>
   But images are cast in two directions, and Chinese intellectuals
who believe America has wrongly snubbed their country for a decade
are warning Clinton to beware that the impression he leaves does
not come across as arrogant and preachy to China's 1.2 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton should not say America is the beacon of democracy in
the world, and China should follow. That's finished,'' said Yang
Jiemian, director of American studies at the Shanghai Institute of
International Studies, a think tank that advises the nation's
leaders. ``You have to have new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese business leaders expect the presidential visit to
build investor confidence, or even to yield new deals like the $4.2
billion worth of contracts announced when China's President Jiang
Zemin visited America last October.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for Clinton to ring the opening gong on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange elated Yang Guoping, general manager of the Shanghai
Dazhong Taxi Co., Ltd., a booming transportation, hotel and biotech
conglomerate listed on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. Jiang rang the opening bell at the New York Stock
Exchange, the stocks in the United States soared 20 percent,'' he
said, ``so we think this will be helpful for the stocks in
Shanghai. Though maybe not so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he joined other Chinese in assessing that deals and
communiques take a backseat to ending what one academic called
``the abnormal situation'' characterized by a decade of tension,
continuing sanctions and irregular top-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese will do their best to depict a nation that is
jumping a time warp, advancing through generations worth of
technological and economic development in an atmosphere freer than
ever before. And they are expecting to have a broad audience of
Americans who will take home the official snapshot of changing
China.
</P>
<P>
   The exact numbers in the Clinton entourage may never be added
up, but the Chinese are ready for a friendly invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total numbers that will accompany the president are
different every day,'' said Yang Jiemian, the American studies
expert. ``The minimum I think is 1,200 and the most I heard is
about 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai foreign affairs office, tasked with keeping track
of such visitors, at last count was expecting 1,400 people,
including the press corps, to arrive in the wake of the first
couple and daughter Chelsea. Another 300 aides and U.S. Secret
Service agents were due here early to finish last-minute advance
work.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House is declining to give an estimate, that
number will far exceed the body count of the official delegation.
Ancillary visitors will include aides to Cabinet officials,
journalists outside the tent of the White House press corps,
business executives eying a new locus of world economic growth and
academic China specialists drawn to the summit as a magnet that
well may set the compass of U.S.-Sino relations for coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai is the broadest stroke of the new sketch China wants to
beam out to the world via the scores of opinion-molding visitors
and through the television clips and news stories that will fill
media across the continents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will spend two days and three nights in this showcase
city of 13 million people, the metropolis that China's leaders
calculated only six years ago should become the preeminent
financial and high-tech center of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous plotting of how and where to grow the city has
created a skyline studded with skyscrapers and a smart lifestyle
totally alien to China just a decade ago. Nearly $20 billion of
infrastructure investment has produced elegant new bridges,
elevated cross-city highways and a central public square lined by
City Hall, an extraordinary Shanghai Museum and a new Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the Pudong New Area, where multinational industry
and financial institutions are enticed by liberal export policies,
helped Shanghai's gross domestic product reach $41 billion in 1997
after six years of annual double-digit growth rates. Since 1991,
retail sales have grown an average of 21.8 percent a year, and
industrial output value 17.1 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, we didn't know what the stock market is,''
said Tu Guangshao, the 40-year-old president of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange. ``The only thing we knew is that the stock market was a
product of capitalism, and that is something we must resist.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Tu said the financial community is hoping Clinton
will trail along a group of American chief executives to engage in
more ``cooperative relationships'' with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet below the surface of this new China lie some of the same old
approaches and sticky issues that have frustrated good relations
with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the soon-to-open General Motors plant, a joint
venture with Shanghai's government-run car company that will
produce a variant of the Buick Regal.
</P>
<P>
   GM tried mightily to lure Clinton to the factory, but the big
U.S. strike this month _ based largely on workers' protests against
GM's cheap, non-domestic operations, just like this one _ seems to
have sunk hopes for a presidential drop-in. Celebrated as a pride
of Shanghai, the plant is a potential embarrassment to an American
president.
</P>
<P>
   The entire super-structure of economic development here is a
different animal from Western capitalism, one carefully controlled
and still dominated by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange, in most countries the herald of free
enterprise, lists almost exclusively state-run companies. Set up to
draw capital to state enterprises, it shuts out the most daring of
China's fledgling capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies hoping to manufacture goods for sale within
China had better find a Chinese partner, and that means a
government-run company, with which they will share the profits and
more importantly the technology they are required to hand over.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the most important bases of China's new great
leap into the 21st Century: the technology Westerners are bringing
to the building of everything from cars to computers to nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction of Shanghai itself has been approached in the
typical command-plan manner of a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people living where skyscrapers should rise? One
million people were forced to move from the center city to the
suburbs. Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Mu Yao, who said another million
families have yet to be relocated, emphasized that they are moving
from substandard to bigger, better housing.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely the case, yet stories abound of Shanghai
residents awakened at 5 a.m. by construction workers who bundle
them out to a truck and start whacking down the walls.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the visions President Clinton and the attendant
world audience will absorb beginning this week.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the sharp young students, ambitious farmers
and savvy business executives Clinton will meet on his China tour
are unrepresentative. But they won't tell the whole story of a
nation still stretching out of old ways and means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance is to realize how we who have different
concepts can live together, can work together,'' said Zhou Mingwei
of the Chinese Foreign Affairs Department. ``I think China is not a
place for limited imagination. It is especially not a place for
limited imagining of China-U.S. relations.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Here is a chronology of previous presidential visits
to China and how they came about:
</P>
<P>
   April 1971 _ China used ``Ping-Pong diplomacy'' to signal
China's readiness for a thaw with Washington after two decades of
animosity following the Korean War. Premier Zhou Enlai invited 15
American table tennis players and three reporters to Beijing for
what Zhou called ``a new page'' in U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   July 9, 1971 _ President Richard Nixon's national security
adviser, Henry Kissinger, vanishing on a trip to Pakistan, secretly
flew to Beijing. Kissinger and Premier Zhou Enlai tentatively
agreed that their countries should cease being enemies. At
Kissinger's insistence, the Chinese agreed to refrain from dealings
with Nixon's political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 21, 1972 _ Nixon electrified the world by stepping off Air
Force One in Beijing and shaking hands with Premier Zhou Enlai,
thus symbolizing America's de facto recognition of the Chinese
Communist revolution of 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28, 1972 _ Nixon and Zhou Enlai issued a ``joint
communique'' in Shanghai committing the United States to
``normalization'' of relations between the U.S. and mainland China.
In it the United States accepted that ``there is but one China and
Taiwan is a part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15, 1978 _ President Jimmy Carter announced
``normalization'' of relations in Washington, carrying out Nixon's
pledge. Carter promised the withdrawal of the last 750 U.S. troops
from Taiwan. Congress responded a few months later with the Taiwan
Relations Act, which obligates the United States to defend Taiwan
in case of aggression from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   April 30, 1984 _ President Ronald Reagan ended a seemingly
symbolic six-day trip to China that turned out to be a turning
point. In the next five years, trade and security cooperation
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 25-26, 1989 _ President George Bush was glowingly received
in Beijing by Chinese Premier Li Peng. But Chinese police stopped
dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi from reaching a presidential
dinner to which he had been invited at the U.S. embassy. Bush
publicly expressed ``regret'' to Chinese leaders over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   June 4, 1989 _ Chinese troops killed 500 to 1,000 people in
Beijing while quelling a pro-democracy uprising centered on
Tiananmen Square. Appalled at the violence, Congress and the Bush
Administration imposed sanctions on trade and military cooperation
with China, some of which still remains in effect.

   BEIJING _ Here is a chronology of previous presidential visits
to China and how they came about:
</P>
<P>
   April 1971 _ China used ``Ping-Pong diplomacy'' to signal
China's readiness for a thaw with Washington after two decades of
animosity following the Korean War. Premier Zhou Enlai invited 15
American table tennis players and three reporters to Beijing for
what Zhou called ``a new page'' in U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   July 9, 1971 _ President Richard Nixon's national security
adviser, Henry Kissinger, vanishing on a trip to Pakistan, secretly
flew to Beijing. Kissinger and Premier Zhou Enlai tentatively
agreed that their countries should cease being enemies. At
Kissinger's insistence, the Chinese agreed to refrain from dealings
with Nixon's political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 21, 1972 _ Nixon electrified the world by stepping off Air
Force One in Beijing and shaking hands with Premier Zhou Enlai,
thus symbolizing America's de facto recognition of the Chinese
Communist revolution of 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28, 1972 _ Nixon and Zhou Enlai issued a ``joint
communique'' in Shanghai committing the United States to
``normalization'' of relations between the U.S. and mainland China.
In it the United States accepted that ``there is but one China and
Taiwan is a part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 15, 1978 _ President Jimmy Carter announced
``normalization'' of relations in Washington, carrying out Nixon's
pledge. Carter promised the withdrawal of the last 750 U.S. troops
from Taiwan. Congress responded a few months later with the Taiwan
Relations Act, which obligates the United States to defend Taiwan
in case of aggression from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   April 30, 1984 _ President Ronald Reagan ended a seemingly
symbolic six-day trip to China that turned out to be a turning
point. In the next five years, trade and security cooperation
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 25-26, 1989 _ President George Bush was glowingly received
in Beijing by Chinese Premier Li Peng. But Chinese police stopped
dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi from reaching a presidential
dinner to which he had been invited at the U.S. embassy. Bush
publicly expressed ``regret'' to Chinese leaders over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   June 4, 1989 _ Chinese troops killed 500 to 1,000 people in
Beijing while quelling a pro-democracy uprising centered on
Tiananmen Square. Appalled at the violence, Congress and the Bush
Administration imposed sanctions on trade and military cooperation
with China, some of which still remains in effect.

   GUANGDONG PROVINCE, China _ ``The people who run power plants
are exactly alike all over the world,'' says Jim Webber, a 39-year
Southern Co. veteran who left retirement to help knock the kinks
out of Atlanta-based utility giant's first power plant in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the same, they have the same hobbies, they are all
engineers,'' Webber said. ``China is very much like Turkey. Turkey
was very much like Italy. Italy is very much like the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk into any plant in the world. I know the equipment.
And if I know a guy's position in the plant, I basically know how
he thinks. It's basically the way I think. This is all a very large
family, if you will. We all have the same purpose in life, and that
is to produce power.''
</P>
<P>
   At 57, Webber is one of five Southern Co. engineers and
technicians assigned to monitor operations in the new Shajiao C
coal-fired power plant in Guangdong Province, about 50 miles north
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern bought the controlling share of Hong Kong
entrepreneur Gordon Wu's Asian power venture, it inherited a
32-percent interest in this 1,980-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
So far, it is Southern's only beachhead in China.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's company had built the plant for the Guangdong Province
Power Bureau, and it became Southern's contractual duty to its
Chinese joint venture partner to make sure the enormous mechanism
is tuned to deliver power at peak efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Shajiao C plant functions. But not yet at 100-percent
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   When Wu sold out to Southern, he left behind a plant still in
the start-up phase which had more than 120 mechanical,
environmental and structural shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   As of early this month, Southern engineers had managed to trim
Shajiao C's ``punch list'' to 107 flaws that needed fixing before
the Chinese would accept the plant as fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   One recurring problem has involved the three pairs of huge air
fans that blow powdered coal into the three 80-foot-tall combustion
chambers called boilers.
</P>
<P>
   Variation in the demand for power occasionally causes one the
fans to shut down. When that happens, an automatic control box is
supposed to stop some of the unit's coal pulverizing equipment so
that the unit can ``stabilize'' at a 50-percent power output.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons Southern hasn't fully diagnosed, the pulverizing
units sometimes fail to shut down. This causes one of the remaining
fans to heat up and get overloaded, until it shuts down and knocks
one of Shajiao C's three power-producing units out of production.
</P>
<P>
   Except for trying to remedy the defects, Southern has no role in
the day-by-day operations of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The control room is run by Chinese plant operators employed by
the Guangdong Province Power Bureau, who earn about 17 yuan (about
$2.10) per hour, compared to $20 an hour for a coal-fired power
plant operator in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese engineer in charge of operating Shajiao C, Zheng
Linfu, said he's pleased with Southern's progress in addressing the
plant's defects, even though the remaining problems are ``not a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time Southern took over, the relationship on the
technical level has improved greatly,'' Zheng said.

<P>
   HONG KONG, China _ The company that has called itself the ``900
pound gorilla'' of American electric utilities is finding Asia a
cruel and trackless jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thorns in the form of generator glitches continue to torment the
reliability of Southern Co.'s giant Shajiao C power plant here in
China's booming southern industrial strip.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere throughout the continent, nettles from the Asian
financial crisis have stung the prospects of four of the five
largest future power projects that Southern took on when it bought
control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been out here in times of turmoil, and if you're
sitting back in the United States, you would probably look out here
and say, `Asia is not the place where you would like to be,''' said
F.D. ``Rick'' Kuester, who was sent out from Mississippi Power to
become a top executive in Southern's Hong Kong-based Asian
subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA).
</P>
<P>
   Yet dreams about electrifying the Orient still drum loud in
Southern's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the per-capita consumption of electricity
compared to anywhere else in the world,'' Kuester said, ``you can
see tremendous opportunities for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern's fire-breathing optimism about Asia is
not without reason.
</P>
<P>
   Its shareholders have just tasted their first Asian profits,
less than two years after Southern invested $2.1 billion to buy
into a Hong Kong billionaire's Asian power enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The initial payback on one of the biggest investments in
Southern's 75-year history was something short of gargantuan. An
earnings report for January through March showed Southern collected
$15 million in Asian profits, or about one-twentieth of Southern's
worldwide earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Southern says this is a felicitous omen because its
Asian venture wasn't expected to turn profitable until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the happiest tidings have come from the Philippines.
CEPA's mid-sized Philippines plant, the 735 megawatt coal-fired
Pagbilao Power Station, has been churning out virtually all of the
Asian profits that Southern has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Shajiao C plant in China that is still hampered by
startup glitches, the Philippines' Pagbilao plant ran smoothly
enough to generate 100 percent of its contracted electrical
generating capacity from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern's much bigger 1,200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power
station in the Philippines, now under construction, is on schedule
and nearing completion on Luzon Island. Its first unit will enter
commercial operation in June 1999, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, the most painful aspect of its journey to Asia has
been its inability to expand beyond the footprint of power plant
investments that it bought from Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon Wu in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Especially frustrating has been China, which Southern viewed as
its most promising patch for building new power plants because of
the country's explosive growth and its 1.2 billion potential
electricity-users.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong office now acknowledges that the
five-year-old joint venture it inherited from Wu to build a
coal-fired plant in China's Jiangsu Province ``has been shelved for
the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly two years, no new Southern Co. power plant deals
in China have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``China obviously needs power _ a lot of it,'' mused Kuester.
``Why then is the China market so difficult to crack?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kuester and the rest of Southern's 16-member Asian
executive corps may be nearing an answer. After rattling the bamboo
in China for more than a year, Southern is reportedly close to
announcing one or two breakthrough deals _ perhaps as early as
during the June 25-July 3 visit to China by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One deal close to blossoming is for a Southern Co. investment in
a mid-sized Chinese 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant near the
mouth of a coal mine in the northern province of Shanxi, 150 miles
west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For about six months Southern has been pursuing this Shanxi
contract in partnership with former U.S. Senator J. Bennett
Johnston's Washington-based energy company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically in a joint venture with him on that one,''
said Kuester, referring to the former chairman of the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee who went into the energy business after retiring
from the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuester declined to predict when the Shanxi negotiations might
conclude, saying ``it is premature to announce anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Southern's Hong Kong-based go-getters have been
rushing to complete a significantly larger deal in China, this time
apparently without Johnston's participation and clout.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Southern dispatched a technical team to investigate
a possible investment in two existing 1200-megawatt Chinese
coal-fired power plants in coastal Shandong province, a fast-growth
region between Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a report on China's official Xinhua news agency
appeared to boost Southern's chances. It disclosed that Shanxi
Province has budgeted $8.4 billion to expand 10 coal-fired power
plants and make the province a major electricity exporter over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal is expected to continue to provide 70 percent of the
country's energy needs well into the next century as China has few
alternatives to satisfy fast-expanding demand for power,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of cheery intelligence that first attracted
Southern to open a small business development office in Hong Kong
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first three years of Southern's Asia business prospecting
yielded meager results. So in October 1996, Southern chairman A.W.
Dalhberg decided to risk a quantum leap by concluding a $2.7
billion contract to buy 80 percent of Wu's CEPA.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Southern's profits were so robust that
Dahlberg could tell shareholders that Southern was the ``900-pound
gorilla'' of the American power business, and was intent on
becoming a global ``1,800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, who needed cash to pare down debts from other heavily
leveraged ventures, received $2.1 billion from Southern, plus a
$600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Southern expected to operate CEPA indefinitely in
partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his
Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern's base of technical
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian financial crisis, starting with a tsunami wave of
Asian currency devaluations last summer, pressured Southern and Wu
to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one
seed of tension was their diverging appraisals about the future
profitability of CEPA'S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wu _ contending that Tanjung Jati B would ultimately yield $20
billion in income _ had pressed Southern to deliver a $138 million
contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7 billion
CEPA price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern said no, on grounds that the Indonesians had not
made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung
Jati B's electricity once the plant was built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Asian currency crisis was starting to explode last
July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for
$115 million in cash, plus Southern's share of the CEPA rights to
develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time.
Within weeks, Indonesia's economy was sucked into a whirlpool that
would squeeze out three-quarters of the value of the Indonesian
currency and help cause this spring's ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on
indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international
electric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle
unscathed. Indonesia's state-owned electricity distributor declared
this month that it ``has no money'' to pay foreign-based power
companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the
better of the deal in the two-stage takeover by Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sold CEPA, it was based on this principle: we already
had completed contracts and there was a whole bag of receivables on
hand,'' Wu told the South China Morning Post last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels.
At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a
happy seller. I'd be lucky to get half that price today.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong executives prefer not to publicly dispute
Wu's judgment about what CEPA was really worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, a footnote in Southern's 1997 annual report informs
stockholders that Southern's $2.1 billion net cost for acquiring
100 percent of CEPA ``exceeded the fair market value of net assets
by approximately $1.6 billion.'' The annual report explained that
the excess over market value in buying the Asian subsidiary _
$1.649 billion _ was entered onto Southern Co. books as an
``increase in goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's changing economic fortunes accounted for much of the gap
in valuations. Chances have increased that Southern may never
receive a payback on four out of the five biggest future Asian
power plant projects that were on Wu's drawing boards when he sold
his company to Southern.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shelved plant in China's Jiangsu Province and
Indonesia's Tanjung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the potential
non-performers are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in
Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant ``is basically at a standstill,''
Kuester acknowledged in an interview. ``They (the Pakistanis) don't
need any more power, they don't want any more power, and we are not
pushing ahead on that because it doesn't make sense for the country
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $5.5 billion electricity mega-plant in India.
Kuester said the new Indian government has signaled a willingness
to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India
``memorandum of agreement'' that Southern inherited from Wu was not
a fully negotiated deal. ``We still have to stand back and assess
the situation _ is that a project that makes sense for us,
economically?'' said Kuester.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern bought CEPA, it also acquired a billion tons of
coal reserves in a remote mine in Austria. Southern is weighing
construction of a coal-fired power station near the mine, which
would convert the coal into revenue-producing electricity without
today's high transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly though Southern's path has been, Kuester believes the
American utility giant is gradually becoming more comfortable in
its new Asian habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so different in Alabama or Mississippi or Georgia,''
Kuester said. ``You don't walk into somebody's office and all of a
sudden do a business deal and make friends. It takes a while to
develop a relationship ... The fact that they didn't know who we
were and didn't trust us when we walked in the door, and that it
took some time, that didn't surprise me.''

   Thorns in the form of generator glitches continue to torment the
reliability of Southern Co.'s giant Shajiao C power plant here in
China's booming southern industrial strip.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere throughout the continent, nettles from the Asian
financial crisis have stung the prospects of four of the five
largest future power projects that Southern took on when it bought
control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been out here in times of turmoil, and if you're
sitting back in the United States, you would probably look out here
and say, `Asia is not the place where you would like to be,''' said
F.D. ``Rick'' Kuester, who was sent out from Mississippi Power to
become a top executive in Southern's Hong Kong-based Asian
subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA).
</P>
<P>
   Yet dreams about electrifying the Orient still drum loud in
Southern's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the per-capita consumption of electricity
compared to anywhere else in the world,'' Kuester said, ``you can
see tremendous opportunities for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern's fire-breathing optimism about Asia is
not without reason.
</P>
<P>
   Its shareholders have just tasted their first Asian profits,
less than two years after Southern invested $2.1 billion to buy
into a Hong Kong billionaire's Asian power enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The initial payback on one of the biggest investments in
Southern's 75-year history was something short of gargantuan. An
earnings report for January through March showed Southern collected
$15 million in Asian profits, or about one-twentieth of Southern's
worldwide earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Southern says this is a felicitous omen because its
Asian venture wasn't expected to turn profitable until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the happiest tidings have come from the Philippines.
CEPA's mid-sized Philippines plant, the 735 megawatt coal-fired
Pagbilao Power Station, has been churning out virtually all of the
Asian profits that Southern has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Shajiao C plant in China that is still hampered by
startup glitches, the Philippines' Pagbilao plant ran smoothly
enough to generate 100 percent of its contracted electrical
generating capacity from January through March.
</P>
<P>
   And Southern's much bigger 1,200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power
station in the Philippines, now under construction, is on schedule
and nearing completion on Luzon Island. Its first unit will enter
commercial operation in June 1999, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, the most painful aspect of its journey to Asia has
been its inability to expand beyond the footprint of power plant
investments that it bought from Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon Wu in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Especially frustrating has been China, which Southern viewed as
its most promising patch for building new power plants because of
the country's explosive growth and its 1.2 billion potential
electricity-users.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong office now acknowledges that the
five-year-old joint venture it inherited from Wu to build a
coal-fired plant in China's Jiangsu Province ``has been shelved for
the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly two years, no new Southern Co. power plant deals
in China have been concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``China obviously needs power _ a lot of it,'' mused Kuester.
``Why then is the China market so difficult to crack?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kuester and the rest of Southern's 16-member Asian
executive corps may be nearing an answer. After rattling the bamboo
in China for more than a year, Southern is reportedly close to
announcing one or two breakthrough deals _ perhaps as early as
during the June 25-July 3 visit to China by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One deal close to blossoming is for a Southern Co. investment in
a mid-sized Chinese 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant near the
mouth of a coal mine in the northern province of Shanxi, 150 miles
west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For about six months Southern has been pursuing this Shanxi
contract in partnership with former U.S. Senator J. Bennett
Johnston's Washington-based energy company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically in a joint venture with him on that one,''
said Kuester, referring to the former chairman of the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee who went into the energy business after retiring
from the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuester declined to predict when the Shanxi negotiations might
conclude, saying ``it is premature to announce anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Southern's Hong Kong-based go-getters have been
rushing to complete a significantly larger deal in China, this time
apparently without Johnston's participation and clout.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Southern dispatched a technical team to investigate
a possible investment in two existing 1200-megawatt Chinese
coal-fired power plants in coastal Shandong province, a fast-growth
region between Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, a report on China's official Xinhua news agency
appeared to boost Southern's chances. It disclosed that Shanxi
Province has budgeted $8.4 billion to expand 10 coal-fired power
plants and make the province a major electricity exporter over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coal is expected to continue to provide 70 percent of the
country's energy needs well into the next century as China has few
alternatives to satisfy fast-expanding demand for power,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of cheery intelligence that first attracted
Southern to open a small business development office in Hong Kong
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first three years of Southern's Asia business prospecting
yielded meager results. So in October 1996, Southern chairman A.W.
Dalhberg decided to risk a quantum leap by concluding a $2.7
billion contract to buy 80 percent of Wu's CEPA.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Southern's profits were so robust that
Dahlberg could tell shareholders that Southern was the ``900-pound
gorilla'' of the American power business, and was intent on
becoming a global ``1,800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, who needed cash to pare down debts from other heavily
leveraged ventures, received $2.1 billion from Southern, plus a
$600 million one-time cash dividend from CEPA's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Southern expected to operate CEPA indefinitely in
partnership with Wu, who was counted on to add his vision and his
Rolodex of power industry contacts to Southern's base of technical
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian financial crisis, starting with a tsunami wave of
Asian currency devaluations last summer, pressured Southern and Wu
to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full story of their breakup remains tightly held, one
seed of tension was their diverging appraisals about the future
profitability of CEPA'S Tanjung Jati B power project in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Wu _ contending that Tanjung Jati B would ultimately yield $20
billion in income _ had pressed Southern to deliver a $138 million
contingency payment that had been part of the original $2.7 billion
CEPA price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern said no, on grounds that the Indonesians had not
made a binding commitment on how much they would pay for Tanjung
Jati B's electricity once the plant was built.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Asian currency crisis was starting to explode last
July, Southern bought out Wu's remaining 20 percent of CEPA for
$115 million in cash, plus Southern's share of the CEPA rights to
develop the disputed Indonesian Tanjung Jati plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Southern, this second deal with Wu came in the nick of time.
Within weeks, Indonesia's economy was sucked into a whirlpool that
would squeeze out three-quarters of the value of the Indonesian
currency and help cause this spring's ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjung Jati B plant, now back in Wu's portfolio, is on
indefinite hold, and Southern is one of the few international
electric power companies that emerged from the Indonesia debacle
unscathed. Indonesia's state-owned electricity distributor declared
this month that it ``has no money'' to pay foreign-based power
companies for contracted generating plants in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, Wu has congratulated himself on getting the
better of the deal in the two-stage takeover by Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sold CEPA, it was based on this principle: we already
had completed contracts and there was a whole bag of receivables on
hand,'' Wu told the South China Morning Post last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comment at the time was that I had sold the family jewels.
At $18.50 (the price per share Southern paid for CEPA), I was a
happy seller. I'd be lucky to get half that price today.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern's Hong Kong executives prefer not to publicly dispute
Wu's judgment about what CEPA was really worth.
</P>
<P>
   However, a footnote in Southern's 1997 annual report informs
stockholders that Southern's $2.1 billion net cost for acquiring
100 percent of CEPA ``exceeded the fair market value of net assets
by approximately $1.6 billion.'' The annual report explained that
the excess over market value in buying the Asian subsidiary _
$1.649 billion _ was entered onto Southern Co. books as an
``increase in goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Asia's changing economic fortunes accounted for much of the gap
in valuations. Chances have increased that Southern may never
receive a payback on four out of the five biggest future Asian
power plant projects that were on Wu's drawing boards when he sold
his company to Southern.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shelved plant in China's Jiangsu Province and
Indonesia's Tanjung Jati B that Wu reclaimed, the potential
non-performers are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $1.6 billion Keti Bandar coal-fired power plant in
Pakistan. This Wu-initiated plant ``is basically at a standstill,''
Kuester acknowledged in an interview. ``They (the Pakistanis) don't
need any more power, they don't want any more power, and we are not
pushing ahead on that because it doesn't make sense for the country
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A proposed $5.5 billion electricity mega-plant in India.
Kuester said the new Indian government has signaled a willingness
to proceed with some electricity mega-plants. But the India
``memorandum of agreement'' that Southern inherited from Wu was not
a fully negotiated deal. ``We still have to stand back and assess
the situation _ is that a project that makes sense for us,
economically?'' said Kuester.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern bought CEPA, it also acquired a billion tons of
coal reserves in a remote mine in Austria. Southern is weighing
construction of a coal-fired power station near the mine, which
would convert the coal into revenue-producing electricity without
today's high transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Prickly though Southern's path has been, Kuester believes the
American utility giant is gradually becoming more comfortable in
its new Asian habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so different in Alabama or Mississippi or Georgia,''
Kuester said. ``You don't walk into somebody's office and all of a
sudden do a business deal and make friends. It takes a while to
develop a relationship ... The fact that they didn't know who we
were and didn't trust us when we walked in the door, and that it
took some time, that didn't surprise me.''

A NEW DRUG BATTLES LOSS OF MEMORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   All of us have difficulty finding the right word sometimes, but
a person with Alzheimer's disease may forget simple words or
substitute inappropriate words, making sentences incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can temporarily misplace a wallet or keys. A person with
Alzheimer's may put the wallet in the freezer and forget that the
keys are needed to start the car or to open a door.
</P>
<P>
   It's normal to forget the day of the week or a destination
momentarily, but with Alzheimer's you can forget what year it is or
become lost on your own street.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine not remembering your own daughter's name.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of people each year, it's becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 4 million Americans are afflicted with Alzheimer's
disease, and that number is expected to triple as the baby boomers
age, says Dr. Susan Blue, a Fort Worth neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   Women are disproportionately affected because we live longer,
and the risk increases dramatically with advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2050, the number of Americans with Alzheimer's is
expected to hit 14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's is a disease of the brain that causes a steady
decline in memory that results in dementia _ a loss of intellectual
functions (including thinking, remembering and reasoning) severe
enough to interfere with everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Blue lists some of the early warning signs as:
</P>
<P>
   _ Persistent and increasing problems with short-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ A tendency to forget the date, including the month and year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recurring disorientation, such as repeatedly getting lost on
familiar routes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Difficulty with language skills or performing simple
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier the disease is diagnosed and treated, the better
the chances of being able to slow the progress of the disease,''
Blue says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alzheimer's is the fourth leading cause of death in the United
States. Each year we are spending $100 billion treating the
disease. What's exciting is that now we have a treatment option
that allows us to offer the patients some hope of stabilizing their
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Eisai are collaborating
on development and distribution of Aricept, a new drug to slow the
memory loss associated with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Aricept and Cognex, the only other drug approved
for the treatment of Alzheimer's, studies show estrogen replacement
therapy, ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
and vitamin E may offer some protection to nerve cells in the brain
that are destroyed by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Alzheimer's Association has launched a new campaign aimed at
educating women about the disease. For a free copy of the brochure
``Women and Alzheimer's Disease,'' with information including
warning signs, treatment options and caregiver tips, call (800)
272-3900.

<P>
   Is democracy for everyone? No _ not yet, but it certainly is for
more people now than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the single-most important political phenomenon of
the late 20th century has been the expansion of democracy in
country after country around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And by democracy I refer to electoral democracies _ which I
define as a political system whose most powerful decision makers
are selected through relatively fair, honest, periodic elections,
in which candidates can freely compete and in which virtually all
the adult population is eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the number of democracies in the world has
gone up very substantially in the past few decades, from about 40
back in 1970, to 66, according to Freedom House, in 1988, to 117
now. This expansion has, in considerable measure, been worldwide;
it has affected every part of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest concentration of democracies, obviously, is among
wealthy countries and among those who were part of, shall we say,
Western civilization. But at least one democratic regime exists in
every major civilization or culture in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, I believe, is desirable for two reasons: One, it
provides order and a mechanism for incremental change, and it
provides a way of removing from office political leaders who have
turned out to be total flops.
</P>
<P>
   Two, it is also one way _ not the only way _ of protecting
liberty in a society. And I agree that violations of liberty are
less likely if you have a democratic system of elected officials
who must face voters again to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening to democracy as it spreads around the world?
First, I think it is becoming more variegated; it is taking on
different forms and acquiring different characteristics in
different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Second, democracy, as I've defined it, is simply a way of
constituting, limiting and changing governments. There is often a
tendency, however, to see it as much more _ as, for example, to
suppose that the introduction of democracy will bring about peace,
equality, prosperity and harmony among nations, classes and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that is the case. Governments produced by
elections can be inefficient, corrupt, shortsighted or
discriminatory. They can pursue aggressive nationalistic policies
and ruinous economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy is no guarantee that other good things will happen,
although they may. People around the world may want to believe that
democracy won't have unhappy consequences. But I think we have to
confront the fact that, in this world, elections can produce
results that don't necessarily make us happy.
</P>
<P>
   Elections may produce anti-Western governments, illiberal
governments, ones that we find very difficult to deal with _
including (when they are weak and resting on fragile coalitions),
even governments that go off, as India has, and explode nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to standard rhetoric, if other countries will simply
democratize _ if we can encourage them to move in that direction _
they will not always be friendly and cooperate with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this assumption underlies the thinking of virtually
everybody on every side of the China debate. If only we could make
China democratic, the thinking goes, it would be so much more easy
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps it would be, but, on the other hand, it is not
difficult to conceive of a democratic China simultaneously being a
China that is highly nationalistic, in which politicians competing
for office find it worth their while, in terms of votes, to
denounce the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So while I am all in favor of promoting more democracies, I
think we ought to do it in a realistic way, with our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think instituting a democratic system of government is
necessarily going to guarantee greater prosperity, equality,
elimination of ethnic conflict or the solution of other social
problems and ills. I do not mean that it will be impossible for
democratic governments to do that; only that there is no guarantee.

democratize _ if we can encourage them to move in that direction _
they will not always be friendly and cooperate with us.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this assumption underlies the thinking of virtually
everybody on every side of the China debate. If only we could make
China democratic, the thinking goes, it would be so much more easy
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps it would be, but, on the other hand, it is not
difficult to conceive of a democratic China simultaneously being a
China that is highly nationalistic, in which politicians competing
for office find it worth their while, in terms of votes, to
denounce the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So while I am all in favor of promoting more democracies, I
think we ought to do it in a realistic way, with our eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think instituting a democratic system of government is
necessarily going to guarantee greater prosperity, equality,
elimination of ethnic conflict or the solution of other social
problems and ills. I do not mean that it will be impossible for
democratic governments to do that; only that there is no guarantee.

<P>
   For the first time since 1979 _ when Iranian students seized and
held American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Teheran for 444 days
_ there is the possibility of improved U.S.-Iran relations.
</P>
<P>
   President Khatami wants to promote civil society and the rule of
law. He wants to end Iran's isolation. He wants to improve the life
of the Iranian people. He is reaching out to Iran's neighbors _ and
he is reaching out to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By himself, Khatami won't be able to reverse two decades of
strident anti-Americanism. He is engaged in a fierce power struggle
inside Iran, which remains bitterly divided between hard-line
conservatives and reformers.
</P>
<P>
   I believe we need to begin a policy of engagement with Iran. It
will not be easy and it will take time to produce results, but I am
persuaded that such a policy serves the American national interest.
</P>
<P>
   No one who looks at U.S. policy toward Iran since 1979 can be
satisfied with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   First, we want changes by Iran in ``deeds, not words.'' But that
dialogue isn't happening because of a fundamental lack of trust
between us. Iranians, even those interested in dialogue, fear that
somehow the United States will use such a dialogue to humiliate or
weaken Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the policy of ``dual containment'' of Iran and Iraq is
not working, and is not sustainable. Seven years after the Persian
Gulf War, no country in the world has followed the U.S. lead in
sanctioning Iran. Our efforts to isolate and contain Iran have been
counterproductive. They have caused great strains with our allies
in Europe and in the Persian Gulf. Our policy is not isolating Iran
_ it is isolating the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should use several avenues for outreach to
Iran and its people. Just as President Khatami chose CNN to send
his message to the United States, President Clinton _ or a senior
U.S. official _ can talk directly to the Iranian people through
interviews on Iranian radio and TV, or on the Persian service of
Voice of America.
</P>
<P>
   We should end references to Iran as a ``rogue'' or ``renegade''
state. Those terms suggest a lack of interest in serious dialogue.
We should end references to Iranian ``behavior.'' This term
connotes dogs and children. We should talk about ``policies'' or
``actions.'' We should emphasize the positive. U.S. officials can
refer to Iran's great civilization. Such language makes a great
impression on a people who are proud of their rich culture and
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In official statements or speeches, we can express ``regret''
over the state of our relations. In so doing, we demonstrate a
willingness to end 20 years of mutual recrimination and
finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned about Iran's attitude toward the
Middle East peace process. But we should not simply say Iran is
totally opposed to the peace process. We are deeply concerned about
Iran's support for international terrorism. Yet as Khatami knows,
Iran too has paid a price for terrorism. It has paid in isolation
from Europe, deep suspicion from its neighbors and sanctions from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To assess whether Iran is pulling back from its support for
terrorist groups, we should ask ourselves:
</P>
<P>
   _ Is Iran imposing constraints on the military activities of
groups it has supported? Hezbollah in Lebanon has talked about
pulling back from the border with Israel if Israel withdraws from
Lebanon. We should test the Iranians' willingness to change words
into deeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have military shipments through the Damascus Airport
diminished? It may be too early to get definitive answers, but we
should be communicating to Iran specific, doable achievable steps
that we want it to accomplish, on the way toward cutting off all
support for political violence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the declaratory policy of the Organization of Islamic
Conference, which condemned terrorism by all member states, holding
and being honored by Iran, the OIC's chairman for the next three
years?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we should take up President Khatami's offer to
increase unofficial exchanges of experts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should send a USIA officer to the Swiss
Embassy, to initiate and coordinate exchange programs with Iran.
Former policymakers, professors, journalists, scientists, artists,
writers and representatives of non-profit organizations should meet
to discuss subjects of mutual interest. These will help break down
prejudices and misconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the United States should change its visa policies
for Iranians. We should end the current rules that collectively
punish Iranians through long delays for entire categories of visa
applicants. When a U.S. wrestling team traveled to Tehran in
February, they were treated respectfully by the Iranian government.
The United States reciprocated by treating Iranian wrestlers like
common criminals, delaying them for two hours at the airport so
they could be fingerprinted and photographed.
</P>
<P>
   This was humiliating to them, insulting to Iran and directly
contrary to our interest in signaling a willingness to develop
better relations.
</P>
<P>
   While we should take necessary precautions for security reasons
and for full observance of immigration laws, we should no longer
subject Iranians otherwise entitled to visas to long delays,
expenses and humiliation.

 By EDWARD J. LINCOLN  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives _ but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
</P>
<P>
   These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption _ that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario _ Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector _ is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

<P>
   Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives _ but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
</P>
<P>
   These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption _ that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario _ Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector _ is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)  
 &HT;    It's not the kind of thing you usually have to worry about.
 &HT;    But there's no mistaking the urgency in the voice of
zero-gravity test director Judy Rickard.
 &HT;    Several of us are floating upside down in the airplane cabin _
not that it's easy to tell upside from down, with gravity
temporarily suspended _ and the half-minute of weightlessness is
about to end.
 &HT;    Landing headfirst can be a real hazard on zero-G flights, even
though the floor, like the rest of our aircraft's interior, is well
padded, so Rickard and the other instructors are keeping a vigilant
eye on the suspended novices.
 &HT;    With a quick kick to the ceiling, I propel my legs back down
below head level _ just in the nick of time.
 &HT;    As ``down'' abruptly reasserts its existence, I crumple to the
floor, more or less feet first, and settle in for a couple of
minutes of double-strength gravity. Keeping track of which way the
floor lies is just one of the bewildering tasks that confront the
passengers on NASA's reduced-gravity test aircraft, otherwise known
as the ``vomit comet.''
 &HT;    There's nothing stomach-churning about the plane itself _ it's
essentially like a commercial Boeing 707 with interior padding
instead of windows _ but its two-hour flight can produce nausea in
even a seasoned sailor.
 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a
flight. It's a combination of scopolamine, to combat nausea, and
dexedrine, to counteract the drowsiness scopolamine causes. It's
optional, but everyone agrees that it drastically improves the odds
of keeping down your breakfast.
 &HT;    The students get one last stern warning about keeping track of
their feet as they move around in zero gravity. ``If you kick me, I
will kick you back,'' Williams says gruffly, ``and it will hurt.''
Then, finally, it's time to strap into the seats in the plane's
rear and prepare for the unknown.
 &HT;    The takeoff, though smooth and uneventful, already has an eerie
feel; with no windows nearby, you can't quite tell when you've left
the ground. Once in the air, the student teams scramble into
position next to their experimental apparatus, all well padded and
reinforced to protect both people and equipment against unforeseen
collisions when the gravity changes.
 &HT;    Most people, it turns out, get sick during the minutes of
increased gravity, not while floating weightless. ``I'm really not
feeling well, really not,'' says one student _ and the zero-G
hasn't even started yet.
 &HT;    Then, abruptly, the heavy weight lifts, and the students begin
to drift slowly up from their places on the floor. Yelps, whoops,
and laughter fill the cabin.
 &HT;    ``This is by far the coolest thing I've ever done,'' says one
grinning George Washington student. Some students begin right away
to experiment with the new sensation, trying aerial somersaults and
spins. Others are more cautious, just letting themselves drift a
little or grabbing straps to hold themselves down.
 &HT;    After a few parabolas of getting used to the new freedom, and
trying to get stomachs back down out of throats, the students
settle in to do what they came here for. Most of the experiments
deal with basic engineering, chemical reactions or fluid dynamics,
but a few are more offbeat.
 &HT;    One team, from the San Francisco Art Institute, is experimenting
with painting and dancing in weightlessness. As Fort explains, such
creative endeavors might be important for maintaining psychological
balance during long-duration space missions, such as a six-month
flight to Mars.
 &HT;    MIT's welding is less glamorous, though perhaps of more
practical value. The students find it's harder than they expected
to hold themselves in position while welding, but the steel welds
they complete appear smooth and strong _ potentially good news for
some future astronaut in a leaky craft.
 &HT;    And then, suddenly, it's all over; our feet are planted on the
floor again, the plane heads home, and zero-G is just a memory.
 &HT;    A few veterans of the vomit comet, inspired by the experience,
may reappear at the Johnson Space Center in years to come, perhaps
to train for missions on the shuttle, the space station, or even
the first human flight to Mars. But even those who will never
return are taking home, along with their used equipment and
hard-won research data, memories and photos of a truly exotic trip.
 &HT;    And stories they'll be telling for the rest of their lives.

 &HT;    The aircraft follows a roller-coaster flight path consisting of
40 parabolic arcs, and at the top of each curve, passengers float
weightless for 25 seconds. Then come two minutes of almost double
gravity as the plane dives, levels off and begins another climb.
 &HT;    On this flight, the 21 passengers _ 19 students and two
journalists _ are getting their first and maybe their last taste of
zero gravity. Even for the unlucky ones who are sidelined by motion
sickness, it's the ride of a lifetime. But the students all have
experiments to conduct, so after the first thrill of floating up
off the floor, most of them are knuckling down to work.
 &HT;    Two members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology team _
Mandy Chambers, an aspiring astronaut, and Onier Villarreal, a
premed student _ float over to their equipment and pull themselves
into position to start their test of weightless welding.
 &HT;    About three dozen parabolas later, though, the students realize
it's their last chance to have some gravity-free fun. One by one
they abandon their experiments and begin _ gingerly at first, then
with increasing gusto _ to attempt things they can do only in these
weightless moments, such as spinning upside down or doing midair
quadruple somersaults.
 &HT;    Chambers tries slithering ``up'' one wall, across the top, and
headfirst ``down'' the other side, and finds herself convinced that
the floor is the ceiling.
 &HT;    All too soon, the plane is rolling back into Ellington Field,
north of the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, and the sense of
letdown has begun. We stumble down the stairs into the blazing
Texas sun and line up by the plane for the obligatory group photo,
once more firmly in the grip of gravity.
 &HT;    The NASA craft went into service in 1959 to train the Mercury
Seven astronauts, and it and a successor have been used by every
U.S. astronaut since for initial training. The converted KC-135
military plane was also the stage for space scenes in ``Apollo
13,'' the first movie ever to include authentic zero-G footage
rather than simulations.
 &HT;    But this is only the second year that a shot at the unique ride
has been offered to college students across the nation, who compete
for a spot by planning zero-G research projects to be conducted on
board.
 &HT;    The program is the brainchild of NASA zero-G test director Bob
Williams, a veteran of 71,000 weightless parabolas, and University
of Texas space researcher Burke Fort. They started the program
three years ago with just a few teams from local Texas colleges,
then expanded nationwide in 1997. This year, the program flew
almost 200 students from 47 colleges and universities, and it
expects to double the number of students next year.
 &HT;    The program costs NASA about $170,000, which its managers
consider a small price for the educational benefits _ not to
mention the public-relations value of sending the students back to
their campuses full of enthusiasm.
 &HT;    For the MIT team, and most of the others, the trip to Houston
began last summer on the Internet. Some received e-mail messages
from friends or professors, others stumbled onto the NASA
zero-gravity site on their own.
 &HT;    The terms of the offer were simple: Come up with an experiment
to be carried out in weightlessness, submit a proposal to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and teams of up to
four students could test their experiments _ and their stomachs _
aboard the vomit comet.
 &HT;    For Chambers, an MIT sophomore from Dallas, the lure of zero-G
was irresistible. Since she was 5 years old, Chambers has dreamed
of becoming an astronaut _ and more than dreamed: She earned her
pilot's license at 18, has made dozens of skydives, and spent three
summers at Space Camp, a privately run facility in Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    She chose her college and her major, mechanical engineering,
with an eye to NASA's future needs, and joined the Air Force ROTC
in hopes of becoming a test-flight engineer.
 &HT;    A successful bid for the vomit comet would get her in the door
of the Johnson Space Center, and she might even meet members of the
astronaut selection committee. Best of all, she would get a taste
of what it feels like to be in space _ a few minutes of real
weightlessness.
 &HT;    In September, Chambers and three fellow students, one of whom
later dropped out, set to work planning their proposal. They
started with tedious searches of Internet and library sources,
checking what kinds of experiments others had done in zero-G and
what might be possible.
 &HT;    In the end, their inspiration came from team member Hernan
Mercado's summer job. Working in a machine shop, Mercado, a
20-year-old junior from Puerto Rico, had learned a bit about arc
welding; a search of the literature showed that it was an area ripe
for exploration.
 &HT;    It would not be just abstract research; astronauts may have to
make such repairs in space, possibly in an emergency situation like
last year's air leak on Mir, the aging Russian space station. ``I
can think of a couple of Russians last year who wouldn't have
minded having a welding torch,'' Chambers says.
 &HT;    Their experiment, Mercado explains, would examine ``the quality
of the weld _ can we weld at all? _ and the way zero-gravity
affects the melt density and surface tension.'' The MIT team put
together a formal proposal and e-mailed it to NASA. Early in
December, just before first-semester exams and winter vacation,
they got word that their project had been approved.
 &HT;    That was the easy part, compared with the task they faced after
vacation. With a March deadline looming, the team got to work on
constructing the equipment they needed.
 &HT;    But first, they had to scrounge up some money. NASA would cover
the costs of the flight, but all equipment and travel expenses were
up to the students _ and figuring out how to pay for it turned out
to be a big part of the learning experience.
 &HT;    As in many a real-world research enterprise, ``Money was the
hardest part of the whole project, by far,'' Mercado says. After
weeks of begging and bargaining, the roughly $7,000 they needed to
pay for welding equipment and two weeks in Houston was eventually
collected from various MIT offices and departments; in return, the
equipment will end up in an MIT machine shop.
 &HT;    There were logistical problems as well. None of the team members
was old enough to rent a car _ almost a requirement for getting
around Houston. They decided they'd have to make do with cabs. Then
a freight company refused to ship their tank of argon gas, a
crucial part of the welding equipment. They would have to find
another argon tank in Houston.
 &HT;    But those problems were behind them, and soon forgotten, when
they pulled into Ellington Field on March 16 and joined the other
teams in the NASA hangar, where students were setting up equipment
on a series of long tables flanked by an exotic assortment of NASA
test and training aircraft.
 &HT;    Forty-eight teams had been accepted from this year's 98
applications, and some were taking the concept of team spirit to
picturesque lengths. Several teams were decked out in matching
T-shirts, including the pessimistically named ``Team Hurl'' from
George Washington University. The Pomona College team, two men and
two women, had all dyed their hair deep blue.
 &HT;    The teams' projects were almost as various: One group was
studying the use of power tools in weightlessness _ something that
astronauts assembling the International Space Station later this
year will have to deal with. For instance, what's the best way to
anchor a power drill so that it's the bit that turns, rather than
the person holding the drill?
 &HT;    Another group was looking at ways of putting out a fire in
space, something that's trickier than you might think. In zero
gravity, water from a sprinkler system, for example, wouldn't fall
``down'' but would have to be directed at the flames under
pressure.
 &HT;    Another team would observe how goldfish in a sealed tank reacted
to the absence of gravity: Would they swim cheerfully and
omnidirectionally or fishily freak out as they lost their moorings?
 &HT;    Like commercial airline passengers, the students can't fly till
they've had their safety instructions. NASA's version, though, is a
bit more complicated than the flight attendant's memorized spiel:
It starts with a full day of lectures, attendance required, on
dealing with sudden decompression and moves on to the high-altitude
chamber for a sample of actual oxygen deprivation.
 &HT;    Decompression _ a loss of the cabin air pressure that makes
high-altitude flight survivable _ can happen in any airplane, as
passengers are reminded before every flight. But on a commercial
flight, you're strapped in inches from the oxygen mask. On the
KC-135, passengers could be anywhere in the 61-foot-long empty
cabin, far from the seats in the rear, where the oxygen masks are
stowed, if a decompression occurs. They need to know how to
recognize the confusion that signals oxygen deprivation, or
hypoxia, before it's too late to respond.
 &HT;    There are other uncomfortable effects of decompression too, the
lecturers explain: Gas will expand to several times its original
volume, so it's important to avoid gas-producing foods before the
flight _ and, in the unlikely event of a decompression, not to be
shy about relieving a sudden pressure buildup.
 &HT;    Burke Fort, the lanky and genial director of the program,
explains that the altitude chamber would simulate suddenly being
transported to a 24,000-foot mountaintop. Even experienced
mountaineers require weeks of acclimatization to function at that
altitude, so being ``transported'' rapidly to such heights is
guaranteed to make anyone black out within minutes; the brain
simply can't get enough oxygen to keep functioning.
 &HT;    The trick _ and the purpose of the training _ is to recognize
the symptoms of impending hypoxic unconsciousness in time to get
one's oxygen mask on.
 &HT;    The chamber itself _ World War II vintage, and ``older than most
of your parents,'' as one instructor points out to the students _
is a big steel cylinder that looks a bit like a used fuel tank.
 &HT;    Originally used to train pilots, since the 1950s it has been a
testing ground for every U.S. astronaut from the Mercury and Apollo
pioneers through today's space shuttlers, as well as anyone
(including Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 cast and crew)
planning to fly on the vomit comet.
 &HT;    On the morning of the flight, everyone assembles early at the
Ellington hangar, nervous, excited, and just a little scared.
First, there's a round of preflight briefings, and everyone is
issued a Scop-Dex capsule _ standard issue for astronauts before a
flight. It's a combination of scopolamine, to combat nausea, and
dexedrine, to counteract the drowsiness scopolamine causes. It's
optional, but everyone agrees that it drastically improves the odds
of keeping down your breakfast.
 &HT;    The students get one last stern warning about keeping track of
their feet as they move around in zero gravity. ``If you kick me, I
will kick you back,'' Williams says gruffly, ``and it will hurt.''
Then, finally, it's time to strap into the seats in the plane's
rear and prepare for the unknown.
 &HT;    The takeoff, though smooth and uneventful, already has an eerie
feel; with no windows nearby, you can't quite tell when you've left
the ground. Once in the air, the student teams scramble into
position next to their experimental apparatus, all well padded and
reinforced to protect both people and equipment against unforeseen
collisions when the gravity changes.
 &HT;    Most people, it turns out, get sick during the minutes of
increased gravity, not while floating weightless. ``I'm really not
feeling well, really not,'' says one student _ and the zero-G
hasn't even started yet.
 &HT;    Then, abruptly, the heavy weight lifts, and the students begin
to drift slowly up from their places on the floor. Yelps, whoops,
and laughter fill the cabin.
 &HT;    ``This is by far the coolest thing I've ever done,'' says one
grinning George Washington student. Some students begin right away
to experiment with the new sensation, trying aerial somersaults and
spins. Others are more cautious, just letting themselves drift a
little or grabbing straps to hold themselves down.
 &HT;    After a few parabolas of getting used to the new freedom, and
trying to get stomachs back down out of throats, the students
settle in to do what they came here for. Most of the experiments
deal with basic engineering, chemical reactions or fluid dynamics,
but a few are more offbeat.
 &HT;    One team, from the San Francisco Art Institute, is experimenting
with painting and dancing in weightlessness. As Fort explains, such
creative endeavors might be important for maintaining psychological
balance during long-duration space missions, such as a six-month
flight to Mars.
 &HT;    MIT's welding is less glamorous, though perhaps of more
practical value. The students find it's harder than they expected
to hold themselves in position while welding, but the steel welds
they complete appear smooth and strong _ potentially good news for
some future astronaut in a leaky craft.
 &HT;    And then, suddenly, it's all over; our feet are planted on the
floor again, the plane heads home, and zero-G is just a memory.
 &HT;    A few veterans of the vomit comet, inspired by the experience,
may reappear at the Johnson Space Center in years to come, perhaps
to train for missions on the shuttle, the space station, or even
the first human flight to Mars. But even those who will never
return are taking home, along with their used equipment and
hard-won research data, memories and photos of a truly exotic trip.
 &HT;    And stories they'll be telling for the rest of their lives.

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting
room, that something hot was for sale and a lot was at stake.
 &HT;    A dozen eager company reps _ stylish young men and women of all
races and backgrounds _ stood behind two long tables with slick
brochures and stacks of applications in English and Spanish.
 &HT;    There were balloons and potted plants everywhere, cookies,
pastries, coffee, juices and soft drinks, a room nearby to park the
children.
 &HT;    By the time Kathleen Madigan, Ed.D, began her pitch on this
April night, it was standing room only, more than 300 Jersey City
parents. One father in the audience, Robert Silberman, was struck
by how much the meeting felt like a sales presentation at the
telecommunications company where he works, while others remarked on
the speaker's evangelical tone.
 &HT;    But what was being offered was neither cell phones nor God's
salvation. The offering to this heavily minority audience in one of
the poorest school districts in New Jersey was a free, publicly
financed education for their children at a new charter school to be
opened in September by Advantage Schools Inc., a Boston-based,
for-profit company with schools in Phoenix and Rocky Mount, N.C.
 &HT;    ``As we speak,'' began Madigan, Advantage's curriculum director,
``I have kindergartners in Phoenix and North Carolina who can tell
you the three phases of matter! ... I have 5-year-olds in North
Carolina who know where the prime meridian is! ... We have 200
instructional days, 20 more than the public schools! ... We go from
8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon! Eight in the morning
until 3:30! ... We will have a phenomenal staff to make this a
reality. We get to choose our teachers ... We don't say it's the
child's fault, or they didn't have a good breakfast, or they came
from this kind of family.
 &HT;    ``This is how they're taught to walk down the hall,'' she said,
marching, her hands folded in front of her.
 &HT;    For an hour those parents sat, rapt, listening to one remarkable
story after another. She told them how Advantage ran a
direct-instruction school stressing basics, with teachers using
daily scripts to drill students. She showed them videos of young
black boys reading.
 &HT;    ``Our children on third level are reading the `Iliad'; in fifth
grade they read Homer's 'Odyssey.' ... Most children don't like to
rewrite. Oh no? Our children say, 'Give me one more chance! ... No
child will fall through the cracks in our school.''
 &HT;    And then she made an irresistible claim: ``Every single one of
our kindergartners in both schools is reading! Every single one! I
don't get up here and say it unless it's true.''
 &HT;    Kimlee Acosta, an employment agency worker and mother of two
boys in the public schools, was sold. She found a pay phone and
called her friend Christine Litaker, who was still at work. ``You
got to get down here,'' Acosta said. ``It's freakin' great! They're
going to start school at 8; they go to 3:30! My kids start school
at freakin' quarter to 9.''
 &HT;    India Sloane, a home health aide with a daughter entering
kindergarten, thought it sounded better than her local public
school. ``I'm going to apply her for this school,'' she said. ``It
have good qualifications for, you know, a child.''
 &HT;    That night, hundreds of Jersey City parents signed up their
children for a school that didn't have even a building or location
yet, run by a company whose entire track record is two schools,
each in existence for less than a year. The parents were willing to
take the plunge because while they didn't know fully what they were
getting into, they knew they weren't pleased with what their
children had.
 &HT;    Still, not everyone was converted. While Silberman liked it, his
wife Karen thought it sounded militaristic. ``I guess we're having
a disagreement,'' she said. And Sandra Oviedo has a son who's
having problems with math in a school that uses a similar method.
``It's not magic,'' she said.
 &HT;    Even many parents eagerly signing on the dotted line were
wondering if there really could be such a miraculous urban public
school where every kindergartner reads.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it
is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from
what has come before in public education, and at the same time so
much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to
deliver the best public-policy choices for us all.
 &HT;    In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to
sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what
is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district
bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the
question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what
kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises.
 &HT;    ``What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?'' Garcia
asked. ``I'm having that now, in another charter school.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we
say,'' Madigan responded. ``I don't have a good answer for you. If
this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep
in business.''
 &HT;    In short: Let the buyer beware.
 &HT;    Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is
pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991,
when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other
states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed
suit. There are currently 786 charter schools in America, with 400
to 500 more expected this fall.
 &HT;    They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural
areas too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most
are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators,
there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies,
including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by
fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8.
 &HT;    The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from
conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of
Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who
created the widely admired Central Park East public school in
Harlem in the 1970s and recently started her own charter in Boston.
 &HT;    In Jersey City alone _ where six charters have been approved _
there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League.
There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning
Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a
principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and
no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that
charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon,
dissected a fish.
 &HT;    Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one _ parents, teachers,
professors, businesspeople _ submits a plan to the state. If the
state approves, then that plan _ the charter _ becomes the
blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any
child who lives within the public-school district where the charter
school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and
a lottery is held.
 &HT;    Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition
comes in, where things turn nasty. Nearly every dollar that goes to
a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools.
 &HT;    Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from
the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens,
it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public
school loses that $7,000 per child.
 &HT;    So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close
to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to
Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand
the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at
least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Acosta's two sons were
worth a cool $14,000.
 &HT;    Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their
funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters
approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most
claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
 &HT;    Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt,
good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve.
And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools such as
P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their
school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: It's a small
school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of
brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population
whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
 &HT;    The problem with school choice is what happens to schools that
have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated
families have made their choices and moved on.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary
school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street
surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look
like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores
and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches,
many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the
principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke
out; the lunchroom was in chaos.
 &HT;    The stereotype of bad inner-city schools is overcrowded classes,
but so many parents work hard to get their children elsewhere _
whether a charter, a Catholic school or, by using a fake address, a
better public school _ that at P.S. 39 average class size is
actually small, 21.
 &HT;    At P.S. 39, in Laurie Ralph's third grade this year, a girl
named Fathema often screamed, rolled on the floor like a dog and
fought, making it impossible to accomplish anything some days.
There were times the veteran teacher broke down crying.
 &HT;    Fathema's mother, Peggy Smith, 30, says she doesn't know how to
handle her daughter either. One thing is certain: Smith won't be
signing up her five children (three of them in special education)
for a charter. She had never heard of charters. ``I don't know too
much about them,'' she says.
 &HT;    This year's Jersey City Teacher of the Year is from P.S. 39,
Jerri O'Brien-Cass. She works long hours and learns about the
personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help
them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent
home 17 notes requesting a parent conference _ with no response.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is on the losing side of the school-choice debate, and
it enrages the teacher of the year.
 &HT;    ``If my best students, my Schnelle and my Phillip, are going off
to charter schools, God bless them _ let them go if it gives them
better lives,'' she says. ``But that makes us like a prison. We'll
be the Last Stop Incarceration Public School.''
 &HT;    The answer from school choicers would be if P.S. 39 doesn't
work, get rid of it and let the children of the Duncan Avenue
projects choose among the city's best schools. In fact, Jersey City
children can leave their neighborhood school and pick another if
that other school's principal signs a waiver saying there is room.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, most Jersey City schools are overcrowded, and
schools in the more upscale neighborhoods are the most overcrowded.
Those schools, which also have the top test scores, such as P.S.
27, P.S. 38 and P.S. 6, average 30 students in first grade. And
Jersey City's mayor, Bret Schundler, who is a national leader of
the school-choice movement and regularly disparages his city's
public schools (''They're a failure,'' he said), is not much help.
 &HT;    While the state has tripled its annual aid to Jersey City
schools in the last decade, the city's contribution has shrunk from
$91 million in 1990 to $72 million this year. Schundler recently
used his political clout ($34 million in city bonding power) not
for public schools but to finance six new buildings to be occupied
by charter schools. This diversion of resources is public
educators' worst fear.
 &HT;    Yet the school-choice debate is most importantly about how to
design an effective public system to educate poor children, as
Meier, the progressive educator, argues in ``The Power of Their
Ideas.'' The middle and upper classes, she points out, have always
enjoyed school choice. If they don't like their public school, they
can choose a private school or move to a suburb.
 &HT;    Indeed, in the 1960s and '70s, thousands of white ethnic Jersey
City families exercised choice by moving to suburbia. Today, Jersey
City, the state's second largest district, has 32,000 mainly
minority children _ a mix of Hispanics (38 percent) and
African-Americans (41 percent), along with immigrants.
 &HT;    In 1989, the state took over Jersey City's public schools and
still controls them, the longest-running takeover of a failing
system in the nation. Of 39 charters approved in New Jersey since
1996, when the Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, won
passage of enabling legislation, Jersey City has 6, second only to
Trenton.
 &HT;    Jersey City's Schundler has been a vocal school-choice advocate.
He is a popular Republican in a Democratic city, a 39-year-old
Harvard-educated bond salesman turned politician with a reputation
as an urban reformer. The shift in Schundler's focus in recent
years from vouchers to charters reflects a national switch by
Republicans that has helped bring the choice movement into the
mainstream.
 &HT;    The Clinton administration, always quick to jump on a popular
Republican idea, has been giving grants of up to $100,000 to
charters to hire community outreach staffs to attract students.
 &HT;    But even in the glow of newness, problems have surfaced in
Jersey City. Significantly, after nine years of state takeover
there, with all the innovations, if you look at the test results
for the 27 elementary schools, the school with the most
middle-class kids, P.S. 27 (63 percent free lunches), is at the
top, and the poorest school, P.S. 39 (94 percent free lunches), is
at the bottom.
 &HT;    And there is considerable correlation: The more free lunches,
the lower the test scores. The exceptions are schools such as P.S.
16 (84 percent free lunches) dominated by immigrants. While poor in
this country, they often came from middle-class backgrounds in
their homelands.
 &HT;    When I asked to meet a top eighth grader at P.S. 39 _ a
predominantly African-American school with many second-generation
welfare families _ the guidance counselor introduced me to Edward
Adu Jr.
 &HT;    Edward's family immigrated to Jersey City two years ago from
Africa. He is the P.S. 39 valedictorian and the only child accepted
to attend Academic High next year, Jersey City's elite high school.
 &HT;    In Ghana, his father was a skilled mechanic, and Edward attended
a private school where he took 13 subjects a day, learning English
and several other languages on top of his native Twi. He knows
little of America beyond P.S. 39. While he has stood on Jersey
City's docks and looked across the Hudson to Manhattan's
skyscrapers, he has never visited there.
 &HT;    When asked what has surprised him about America, he says, ``It
seems the schools in Africa are better than here.''

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting
room, that something hot was for sale and a lot was at stake.
 &HT;    A dozen eager company reps _ stylish young men and women of all
races and backgrounds _ stood behind two long tables with slick
brochures and stacks of applications in English and Spanish.
 &HT;    There were balloons and potted plants everywhere, cookies,
pastries, coffee, juices and soft drinks, a room nearby to park the
children.
 &HT;    By the time Kathleen Madigan, Ed.D, began her pitch on this
April night, it was standing room only, more than 300 Jersey City
parents. One father in the audience, Robert Silberman, was struck
by how much the meeting felt like a sales presentation at the
telecommunications company where he works, while others remarked on
the speaker's evangelical tone.
 &HT;    But what was being offered was neither cell phones nor God's
salvation. The offering to this heavily minority audience in one of
the poorest school districts in New Jersey was a free, publicly
financed education for their children at a new charter school to be
opened in September by Advantage Schools Inc., a Boston-based,
for-profit company with schools in Phoenix and Rocky Mount, N.C.
 &HT;    ``As we speak,'' began Madigan, Advantage's curriculum director,
``I have kindergartners in Phoenix and North Carolina who can tell
you the three phases of matter! ... I have 5-year-olds in North
Carolina who know where the prime meridian is! ... We have 200
instructional days, 20 more than the public schools! ... We go from
8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon! Eight in the morning
until 3:30! ... We will have a phenomenal staff to make this a
reality. We get to choose our teachers ... We don't say it's the
child's fault, or they didn't have a good breakfast, or they came
from this kind of family.
 &HT;    ``This is how they're taught to walk down the hall,'' she said,
marching, her hands folded in front of her.
 &HT;    For an hour those parents sat, rapt, listening to one remarkable
story after another. She told them how Advantage ran a
direct-instruction school stressing basics, with teachers using
daily scripts to drill students. She showed them videos of young
black boys reading.
 &HT;    ``Our children on third level are reading the `Iliad'; in fifth
grade they read Homer's 'Odyssey.' ... Most children don't like to
rewrite. Oh no? Our children say, 'Give me one more chance! ... No
child will fall through the cracks in our school.''
 &HT;    And then she made an irresistible claim: ``Every single one of
our kindergartners in both schools is reading! Every single one! I
don't get up here and say it unless it's true.''
 &HT;    Kimlee Acosta, an employment agency worker and mother of two
boys in the public schools, was sold. She found a pay phone and
called her friend Christine Litaker, who was still at work. ``You
got to get down here,'' Acosta said. ``It's freakin' great! They're
going to start school at 8; they go to 3:30! My kids start school
at freakin' quarter to 9.''
 &HT;    India Sloane, a home health aide with a daughter entering
kindergarten, thought it sounded better than her local public
school. ``I'm oing to apply her for this school,'' she said. ``It
have good qualifications for, you know, a child.''
 &HT;    That night, hundreds of Jersey City parents signed up their
children for a school that didn't have even a building or location
yet, run by a company whose entire track record is two schools,
each in existence for less than a year. The parents were willing to
take the plunge because while they didn't know fully what they were
getting into, they knew they weren't pleased with what their
children had.
 &HT;    Still, not everyone was converted. While Silberman liked it, his
wife Karen thought it sounded militaristic. ``I guess we're having
a disagreement,'' she said. And Sandra Oviedo has a son who's
having problems with math in a school that uses a similar method.
``It's not magic,'' she said.
 &HT;    Even many parents eagerly signing on the dotted line were
wondering if there really could be such a miraculous urban public
school where every kindergartner reads.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it
is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from
what has come before in public education, and at the same time so
much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to
deliver the best public-policy choices for us all.
 &HT;    In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to
sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what
is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district
bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the
question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what
kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises.
 &HT;    ``What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?'' Garcia
asked. ``I'm having that now, in another charter school.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we
say,'' Madigan responded. ``I don't have a good answer for you. If
this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep
in business.''
 &HT;    In short: Let the buyer beware.
 &HT;    Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is
pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991,
when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other
states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed
suit. There are currently 786 charter schools in America, with 400
to 500 more expected this fall.
 &HT;    They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural
areas too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most
are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators,
there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies,
including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by
fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8.
 &HT;    The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from
conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of
Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who
created the widely admired Central Park East public school in
Harlem in the 1970s and recently started her own charter in Boston.
 &HT;    In Jersey City alone _ where six charters have been approved _
there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League.
There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning
Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a
principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and
no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that
charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon,
dissected a fish.
 &HT;    Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one _ parents, teachers,
professors, businesspeople _ submits a plan to the state. If the
state approves, then that plan _ the charter _ becomes the
blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any
child who lives within the public-school district where the charter
school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and
a lottery is held.
 &HT;    Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition
comes in, where things turn nasty. Nearly every dollar that goes to
a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools.
 &HT;    Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from
the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens,
it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public
school loses that $7,000 per child.
 &HT;    So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close
to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to
Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand
the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at
least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Acosta's two sons were
worth a cool $14,000.
 &HT;    Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their
funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters
approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most
claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
 &HT;    Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt,
good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve.
And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools such as
P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their
school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: It's a small
school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of
brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population
whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
 &HT;    The problem with school choice is what happens to schools that
have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated
families have made their choices and moved on.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary
school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street
surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look
like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores
and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches,
many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the
principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke
out; the lunchroom was in chaos.
 &HT;    The stereotype of bad inner-city schools is overcrowded classes,
but so many parents work hard to get their children elsewhere _
whether a charter, a Catholic school or, by using a fake address, a
better public school _ that at P.S. 39 average class size is
actually small, 21.
 &HT;    At P.S. 39, in Laurie Ralph's third grade this year, a girl
named Fathema often screamed, rolled on the floor like a dog and
fought, making it impossible to accomplish anything some days.
There were times the veteran teacher broke down crying.
 &HT;    Fathema's mother, Peggy Smith, 30, says she doesn't know how to
handle her daughter either. One thing is certain: Smith won't be
signing up her five children (three of them in special education)
for a charter. She had never heard of charters. ``I don't know too
much about them,'' she says.
 &HT;    This year's Jersey City Teacher of the Year is from P.S. 39,
Jerri O'Brien-Cass. She works long hours and learns about the
personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help
them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent
home 17 notes requesting a parent conference _ with no response.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is on the losing side of the school-choice debate, and
it enrages the teacher of the year.
 &HT;    ``If my best students, my Schnelle and my Phillip, are going off
to charter schools, God bless them _ let them go if it gives them
better lives,'' she says. ``But that makes us like a prison. We'll
be the Last Stop Incarceration Public School.''
 &HT;    The answer from school choicers would be if P.S. 39 doesn't
work, get rid of it and let the children of the Duncan Avenue
projects choose among the city's best schools. In fact, Jersey City
children can leave their neighborhood school and pick another if
that other school's principal signs a waiver saying there is room.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, most Jersey City schools are overcrowded, and
schools in the more upscale neighborhoods are the most overcrowded.
Those schools, which also have the top test scores, such as P.S.
27, P.S. 38 and P.S. 6, average 30 students in first grade. And
Jersey City's mayor, Bret Schundler, who is a national leader of
the school-choice movement and regularly disparages his city's
public schools (''They're a failure,'' he said), is not much help.
 &HT;    While the state has tripled its annual aid to Jersey City
schools in the last decade, the city's contribution has shrunk from
$91 million in 1990 to $72 million this year. Schundler recently
used his political clout ($34 million in city bonding power) not
for public schools but to finance six new buildings to be occupied
by charter schools. This diversion of resources is public
educators' worst fear.
 &HT;    Yet the school-choice debate is most importantly about how to
design an effective public system to educate poor children, as
Meier, the progressive educator, argues in ``The Power of Their
Ideas.'' The middle and upper classes, she points out, have always
enjoyed school choice. If they don't like their public school, they
can choose a private school or move to a suburb.
 &HT;    Indeed, in the 1960s and '70s, thousands of white ethnic Jersey
City families exercised choice by moving to suburbia. Today, Jersey
City, the state's second largest district, has 32,000 mainly
minority children _ a mix of Hispanics (38 percent) and
African-Americans (41 percent), along with immigrants.
 &HT;    In 1989, the state took over Jersey City's public schools and
still controls them, the longest-running takeover of a failing
system in the nation. Of 39 charters approved in New Jersey since
1996, when the Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, won
passage of enabling legislation, Jersey City has 6, second only to
Trenton.
 &HT;    Jersey City's Schundler has been a vocal school-choice advocate.
He is a popular Republican in a Democratic city, a 39-year-old
Harvard-educated bond salesman turned politician with a reputation
as an urban reformer. The shift in Schundler's focus in recent
years from vouchers to charters reflects a national switch by
Republicans that has helped bring the choice movement into the
mainstream.
 &HT;    The Clinton administration, always quick to jump on a popular
Republican idea, has been giving grants of up to $100,000 to
charters to hire community outreach staffs to attract students.
 &HT;    But even in the glow of newness, problems have surfaced in
Jersey City. Significantly, after nine years of state takeover
there, with all the innovations, if you look at the test results
for the 27 elementary schools, the school with the most
middle-class kids, P.S. 27 (63 percent free lunches), is at the
top, and the poorest school, P.S. 39 (94 percent free lunches), is
at the bottom.
 &HT;    And there is considerable correlation: The more free lunches,
the lower the test scores. The exceptions are schools such as P.S.
16 (84 percent free lunches) dominated by immigrants. While poor in
this country, they often came from middle-class backgrounds in
their homelands.
 &HT;    When I asked to meet a top eighth grader at P.S. 39 _ a
predominantly African-American school with many second-generation
welfare families _ the guidance counselor introduced me to Edward
Adu Jr.
 &HT;    Edward's family immigrated to Jersey City two years ago from
Africa. He is the P.S. 39 valedictorian and the only child accepted
to attend Academic High next year, Jersey City's elite high school.
 &HT;    In Ghana, his father was a skilled mechanic, and Edward attended
a private school where he took 13 subjects a day, learning English
and several other languages on top of his native Twi. He knows
little of America beyond P.S. 39. While he has stood on Jersey
City's docks and looked across the Hudson to Manhattan's
skyscrapers, he has never visited there.
 &HT;    When asked what has surprised him about America, he says, ``It
seems the schools in Africa are better than here.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``One of the neat things about being a commander,'' says Lt.
Col. Curtis L. Brown Jr., ``is when you take rookies into space and
you see their face after the main engine shutdown and you're in
orbit. You never forget that.''
 &HT;    In October, if all goes as planned, Brown will fly his fifth
shuttle mission with one crew member who may have that same look,
not from the novelty of the experience but from distant memory.
 &HT;    If Charles Lindbergh had climbed into a cockpit two years before
Ronald Reagan became president, he would have been 77, the age John
Glenn will be when he makes his second spaceflight. Indeed, to
understand the peculiarity of this flight, it helps to do one more
piece of math: We are now further away in time from Glenn's first
mission than that mission was from Lindbergh's solo flight across
the Atlantic.
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch.
 &HT;    The record store down the street from the possibly segregated
hotel had yet to stock a Beatles album. Had the astronaut possessed
a more powerful periscope than he did, he still could not have
picked out a St. Louis arch or a World Trade Center to serve as a
guidepost below.
 &HT;    Not even Telstar, the early communications satellite, was in the
heavens to block his path. The capsule's progress through the skies
was relayed by teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride.
 &HT;    When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there was actual
ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A middle-age visitor to John Glenn's Senate office - one who
remembers Feb. 20, 1962, as a 10-year-old, and whose
elementary-school autograph book still bears the entry ``My hero is
John Glenn'' on a prefatory page _ finds it difficult even to ask
the question, Is this shuttle flight perhaps a reward for the
senator's unexpectedly partisan behavior during last year's
campaign-finance hearings?
 &HT;    After all, Bill Clinton is not without a say in NASA affairs,
and more than one observer saw Glenn acting as ``White House
defense counsel'' against the probings of Sen. Fred Thompson and
the Republican majority.
 &HT;    ``It's not true,'' Glenn says. ``I had not one single
conversation with the president or the vice president or any of the
people from the White House.'' The idea of sending an older person
into space has so much scientific validity that ``even if I wasn't
involved, I would be backing that,'' he insists, adding that he
would urge that they ``send somebody else.''
 &HT;    For all its public-relations value to NASA _ this is the biggest
manned-space story in years _ Glenn sticks resolutely to
medical-research terms in discussing his mission's origin and
meaning. His wife Annie says that ``he's always wanted to go'' back
into space.
 &HT;    But after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his own interest, and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    For 10 weightless days, Glenn will subject himself to a marathon
of geriatric experimentation. He will take pills to measure his
protein production, receive injections to calibrate the atrophy of
muscle and swallow miniature thermometers to help measure
temperature fluctuations during sleep.
 &HT;    He gives every sign of approaching these tests with the same
studiousness he exhibited toward all the esoteric physical
humiliations (the feet-in-ice-water test, for example) that
accompanied the first astronaut selections at the Wright Air
Development Center in Ohio 40 years ago.
 &HT;    His quick, soft speech betrays no diminished alertness. It is
only when you walk behind him, or fix your gaze on his right eye,
slightly more hooded than the left, that you can credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70.
 &HT;    It's a good thing he is, too, or he might not have got his new
assignment. Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in
1997 at age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of
Glenn's going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the
space program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went
into politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    When asked about Glenn's impending return to space, his close
Project Mercury friend Scott Carpenter, a lean and very fit 73,
smiles and says: ''I told him I'm going to be his backup again. And
this time he's going to come down with something.''
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition.
 &HT;    ``If World War II hadn't come along,'' Annie Glenn says, ``he
was either going to be a medical doctor or go into medical
research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way, comes his
chance.

 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings; some 1960's rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case.
 &HT;    When most of the Original Seven (Glenn was the oldest) were
flying their missions, the center was still under construction for
space personnel being transferred from Langley Research Center in
Virginia.
 &HT;    The new seven among whom Glenn spends time these days are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``They're better educated, and they're deeper into science.''
They're certainly a more diverse lot than the brush-cut,
all-Protestant test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along
with Pedro Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the
STS-95 crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years
ago became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out from the six other astronauts _ famously
raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men thought
they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is doing his
best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's ``John,''
not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    On a Friday afternoon in April, wearing the same blue knit shirt
as everyone else, he sits down at a conference-room table and, when
a visitor starts asking questions, easily defers to Brown.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago, and Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    With his busy senatorial schedule, Glenn will be in Houston for
some long weekends, spent 10 days there around Memorial Day and
will spend another 10 there around the Fourth of July, the whole
month of August and then most of the five or six weeks before the
flight.
 &HT;    Christopher Kraft, the retired but still no-nonsense flight
director of Project Mercury, who counts Glenn a close friend, says
that with all his obligations, Glenn's problem now is time: ``He
doesn't want to make a fool of himself. He's got to spend enough
time on it to know what the emergency procedures are.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, even if Discovery goes through a fraction of the
catastrophes that controllers keep simulating for Brown and his
cockpit crew, Glenn won't be part of the emergency improvisations.
In fact, he won't be on the flight deck at all. He'll be below, on
Discovery's middeck.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that it
is already being fitted with, and he knows that 10 days of
weightlessness, some of it free-floating, may induce not only a
loss of muscle and bone but also nausea _ certainly more of it than
he ever had the chance to experience during five hours strapped
into the seat of Friendship 7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return only adds to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral are already booked solid
for Oct. 29, and Brown, who says his mother usually greets his
mission assignments with quiet resignation, got a very different
reaction when he telephoned in February to tell her about this one:
``Is that the flight with Senator Glenn on it?''
 &HT;    ``Well, yeah.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, great!''
 &HT;    Whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's flight will also
begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the movement of
civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger, the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''
 &HT;    This fall, when the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the
science and public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the
shuttle's rocket boosters. This is especially so for the minority
of Americans old enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those
oldest citizens whose physical needs are the official justification
for Glenn's place on the flight.
 &HT;    At launch, emotion will trump all the mission's other meanings,
and anyone who has made the last 36 trips around the Sun with Glenn
will care about this aging astronaut for the same reason we cared
about Everest and the Moon: because he's there.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Pretend for a minute that you're an alien, sent to Earth to
assess its suitability for takeover.
 &HT;    Right away you'd notice that the black earthlings and the white
earthlings tend to live apart; that they both worship particularly
large earthlings in open-air stadiums and that earthlings residing
outside the crowded urban centers broil sacrificial meats on little
outdoor altars.
 &HT;    Eventually you'd pick up on smaller, possibly more significant
things _ Sunday evening, for example, and how in many households as
the hour of 9 approaches, the eating utensils are quickly and
ceremoniously cleansed and stored and the younger offspring are
clothed in loose-fitting cotton garments and then made to lie
dormant in darkened chambers, while the elders and the proto-elders
(many of them adorned with bits of metal on their teeth) drift into
their communications centers, as if in answer to the eerie
whistling music now emanating from their cathode-ray scopes, and
for the next 60 minutes or so remain motionless, enraptured, while
contemplating images of other earthlings engaged in negotiations
with ... aliens just like you, with the same long spatulate
fingers, the same greenish ichor coursing through their cooling
systems!
 &HT;    In such a case, you'd probably conclude that you had arrived too
late, and that the earthlings had already been colonized.
 &HT;    Such a weekly visitation does in fact take place in 90-odd
countries all over the globe. The force behind it is the Fox-TV
network and the producers of ``The X-Files.'' In five seasons, this
offbeat sci-fi series has more than doubled its ratings, and is now
watched by almost 20 million households (making it television's
third most popular drama), not counting those who also tune in to
the nightly reruns of old episodes.
 &HT;    But mere television-watching isn't the half of it. As Andy
Meisler, author of Volume 3 of ``The Official Guide to the
X-Files,'' one of a half-dozen or so reference books spawned by the
show, has said, ``You sometimes get the feeling that the actual
show is just an excuse for all the other stuff.''
 &HT;    The other stuff is the stuff that cults are made of. There are
now more than a thousand Web sites devoted to ``The X-Files,'' many
of them emitting the ozone whiff of spaciness that pervades the
show _ which is essentially about a shadowy department of the FBI
devoted to investigating extraterrestrials and paranormal
occurrences.
 &HT;    Among the sites are dozens specializing in ``fan fiction'' _
short stories that invent new plots and scenes for the show's two
main characters, the FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder _ and
even a feverish subgroup preoccupied with getting these two, whose
relationship on screen is famously platonic, into bed together.
 &HT;    There is also a Web site that collects sound files from the show
that, when played backward, turn out to reveal hidden meaning.
``Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?'' for example, in
reverse becomes: ``Sky of fruit baskets with the
8-year-little-old'' _ an unmistakable reference, if you go in for
this sort of thing, to Mulder's younger sister, Samantha, who, in
one of the show's key events, is mysteriously abducted.
 &HT;    The show's creators, meanwhile, have not neglected to churn out
paperback novels, a series of young-adult books, CD-ROMs, posters,
postcards and assorted tchotchkes. And they hope to extend the
franchise still further with a feature-length film (opening later
this week) that will supposedly expand on plot developments
introduced in this season's last televised episode but also make
perfect sense to first-time viewers _ if there are any left.
 &HT;    For 13 weeks this spring, the X-Files expo, a sort of roadshow
and revival meeting, wended its way across the country, drawing
throngs of the faithful and, not incidentally, priming them with
clips from the film in a portable, Dolby-equipped theater. The
atmosphere was more than a little reminiscent of the fervor
surrounding ``Star Trek'' and its many conventions and big-screen
spinoffs.
 &HT;    Yet unlike ``Star Trek,'' ``The X-Files'' has accomplished the
transition to cultdom while the show itself is still being shown in
prime time _ it's a cult without any apparent tinge of campiness or
rerun quaintness.
 &HT;    Almost from the beginning, a good deal of critical ink has been
spilled in an effort to account for the popularity of ``The
X-Files,'' which began simply as a chiller in the tradition of
Darren McGavin's old supernatural detective story, ``Kolchak: The
Night Stalker.'' Much of the attention has centered on the
so-called ``mythology'' of ``The X-Files'' _ roughly a fifth of the
117 episodes so far, which constitute an intricate and
ever-evolving serial tale of UFOs, alien abduction, unsavory
biological experimentation and government conspiracy and cover-up
at the very highest levels.
 &HT;    The secret of ``The X-Files,'' or so the argument goes, is that
the mythology taps into the most authentically anxious parts of our
post-modern Zeitgeist _ our fear of government and cancer (which
are practically interchangeable), along with our ongoing
fascination with the notion of extraterrestrial entities.
 &HT;    The program's creator, Chris Carter, has said: ``The show's
original spirit has become kind of the spirit of the country _ if
not the world. There is a growing paranoia. With the Berlin Wall
down, with the global nuclear threat gone, with Russia trying to be
a market economy, there is a growing paranoia because, as somebody
once said, there are no easy villains anymore.''
 &HT;    For the very same reasons, however, you could make a compelling
case that at no time in recent years have Americans been less
paranoid, especially about their own government. We're fearful
these days not so much of political plots as of random evil _ the
sort of unpredictable violence perpetrated by rogue states, by
weapon-toting militias with only a handful of members, by our
children even.
 &HT;    The show touches on these threats, but only glancingly, and then
to suggest that they're really manifestations of some vast
metaforce.
 &HT;    Rather than probing our deepest fears, ``The X-Files'' cleverly
reintroduces into our lives something like the feeling of paranoia
without the content, a pleasantly creepy frisson that awakens us to
all those thready webs of coincidence; they don't mean anything
exactly but they're pretty cool all the same.
 &HT;    If ``The X-Files'' is about anything, it's really about
nostalgia _ for a time (which may never have existed, really) when
a belief in global conspiracy held out the promise of a universe
that could be comprehended.
 &HT;    That the ``The X-Files'' culties themselves don't necessarily
believe that life is one dark plot was reinforced for me when I
caught up to the X-Files Expo in Miami. ``Please,'' one visitor to
the expo, a middle-aged airline pilot, said when I asked him if he
believed in government conspiracies. ``Just look at what's going on
in Washington now. What makes you think they could get their acts
together sufficiently to accomplish anything?''
 &HT;    This was in April, at the expo's halfway point. The publicity
material had promised sites that were appropriately spooky _
airplane hangars, abandoned military bases and the like _ but the
Miami expo took place in the Coconut Grove Convention Center, a
windowless, nondescript hall that more often plays host to
gatherings of gun and knife sellers and people taking the postal
exam.
 &HT;    For atmosphere there was a dry-ice machine pumping out fog, and
a sound system loudly recycling Mark Snow's ``Twilight
Zone''-inspired ``X-Files'' theme song: woo woo woo woo WOO woo.
The exhibits consisted of a pretty skimpy prop museum (wardrobe
items mostly: Scully's trench coat, Mulder's sleeveless
sweatshirt), and a number of stations where you could have your
picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background,
so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement
office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop
and experiencing an interval of what the show calls ``lost time.''
 &HT;    I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo
_ a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to
be a fetus in a jar _ and I spoke to a University of Miami
undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the governments
in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade
Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered ``X-Files'' cap
of his own design.
 &HT;    ``This is a show I can relate to,'' he told me. ``Sometimes I'll
just see an episode and I'll be saying, `That's me!' Like the
episode about the cockroaches _ anybody who knows my character
knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I
used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist _ that was when I
was watching `MacGyver' _ but now I think I might want to join the
FBI.''
 &HT;    Most of the crowd _ a preponderance of high-school and
college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too _ was clean-cut and
normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing
setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their
detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of ``X-Files'' mythology.
 &HT;    They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example _
that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in
effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form
of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the
show's Sophoclean subtext _ the vexed question of Mulder's true
parentage.
 &HT;    In truth, the ``X-Files'' mythology, which has evolved
accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies
(Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity
leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers
fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as
it is forward, continually revisiting old themes _ Samantha's
disappearance, UFO sightings, government experiments with tissue
obtained from smallpox vaccinations _ and uncovering additional
layers of duplicity.
 &HT;    You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That
icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing
gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have
worked only temporarily. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded
a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back
in Washington, plying his evil trade.
 &HT;    The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose
threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not
hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own
material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new
programs.
 &HT;    And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at
the heart of things anyway. The true ``X-Files'' conspiracy is not
about who will rule the world. It's conspiracy for its own sake _ a
Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself
_ and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much
more weird and interesting.
 &HT;    Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before
getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among
his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies,
programs such as ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Night Stalker''
and the televised Watergate hearings. We probably could have
guessed. ``The X-Files'' is in a way a melding of '70s politics and
special effects. Carter's genius has been to show us what paranoia
looks like, and it turns out to be the best-looking thing on
television. Rain-slicked blacktop, looming trees, lots of ice and
fog and mist.
 &HT;    ``The X-Files'' spends more on production values than do most
other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and
inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual
angles than most movies, let alone TV shows.
 &HT;    Even the villains, those nameless middle-age men who not only
manipulate our government but also in effect run the solar system
from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks
a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are
revealed as much by how they look as by what they do. The better
the haberdashery (as in the case of Well-Manicured Man, as he's
known), the more heinous the deeds. They all have a faintly jowly,
Nixonian cast to them, come to think of it _ even the possibly
well-intentioned fellow known as Deep Throat.
 &HT;    And it should be noted that originally, the most creepy of them
all, the deeply vile Cigarette-Smoking Man, didn't speak. He didn't
need to. The sight of him taking a drag on one of his ever-present
Morley's, inhaling so deeply that his eyes squinted, and then
letting the smoke leak from the corner of his mouth in snaky
gray-blue tendrils, was proof enough of his cancerous soul.
 &HT;    He lit up for the first time, we discovered last year, in a
self-congratulatory moment after successfully engineering the
assassination of JFK. (He was also, not surprisingly, behind the
death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King riots.) And
after kicking the habit for a while, he went back to the weed when
his attempt at making a legitimate go as a freelance writer, under
the nom de plume Raul Bloodworth, predictably came to naught.
 &HT;    What ``The X-Files'' really demonstrates, you might say, is what
the world would be like if global politics were more like office
politics, where the bad guys are always the suits, and if the
cosmic set designer had been the sort of person who watched a lot
of '70s television and read a lot of Whitley Strieber.
 &HT;    It's a darkly beautiful world, lighted by periodic explosions
and fireballs, where even the bees and the trees and the ground
underfoot may be less than benign, and it's a world that seems to
fairly thrum with energy, however unearthly, and possibility.
 &HT;    For all its hipness, though, ``The X-Files'' also has an
old-fashioned noirish quality. The gadgets are far from
cutting-edge, and the sci-fi elements _ flying saucers,
poltergeists, giant sewer-dwelling worms and the like _ are the
stuff of drive-in movies. The show transports us out of our
confused post-Cold War era to a time when the various ills of the
world come from somewhere else, and are so large and so pervasive
and so vague that they defy understanding.
 &HT;    In this mythic realm, conspiracies and government evildoing
become not the object of outrage, except among a chosen few, but
merely a fact of life, no more alterable than the weather.
 &HT;    If the world of ``the X-Files,'' with its all-encompassing
conspiracies, is strangely comforting, it is also enervating. Many
of the people you encounter literally have no wills of their own.
They respond robotically to signals received by mysterious bits of
metal implanted in their necks.
 &HT;    Others are animated not by passion, for the most part, but
simply by power or the quest for knowledge. Scully and Mulder
aren't just cool; they tend to operate at a lower emotional
temperature than any characters I can remember, either on
television or in movies and books.
 &HT;    It's not simply, as has so often been noted, that they have
shown no sexual interest in each other, Scully and Mulder don't
seem lastingly keen on anyone else either, and their relations with
everyone tend to be almost clinically flat and empty of affect.
Mulder is practically a zombie (Scully has lately, in response to a
cancer scare, manifested an occasional semblance of an inner life),
and he leaves us with the uncomfortable feeling that this is the
price that being a believer exacts.
 &HT;    It's a little like becoming an artist _ you have to give up
everything else. Think of the sexless, pasty-skinned Lone Gunmen,
the obsessive conspiracy theorists who turn up occasionally to
furnish Mulder with a crucial bit of microfilm: they seldom go out
except at night. This theme of loneliness and disconnection may be
the hidden message of ``The X-Files,'' in fact _ the show's real
secret: that true belief, of whatever sort, requires too much
self-surrender, and chances are that any belief will be mistaken
anyway.
 &HT;    The truth is not, as Mulder would have it, ``out there,'' but
rather right here, on our TV screens. ``The X-Files'' has taught us
that it's more entertaining, and probably more epistemologically
sound, to believe in everything and in nothing at all.

that, when played backward, turn out to reveal hidden meaning.
``Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?'' for example, in
reverse becomes: ``Sky of fruit baskets with the
8-year-little-old'' _ an unmistakable reference, if you go in for
this sort of thing, to Mulder's younger sister, Samantha, who, in
one of the show's key events, is mysteriously abducted.
 &HT;    The show's creators, meanwhile, have not neglected to churn out
paperback novels, a series of young-adult books, CD-ROMs, posters,
postcards and assorted tchotchkes. And they hope to extend the
franchise still further with a feature-length film (opening later
this week) that will supposedly expand on plot developments
introduced in this season's last televised episode but also make
perfect sense to first-time viewers _ if there are any left.
 &HT;    For 13 weeks this spring, the X-Files expo, a sort of roadshow
and revival meeting, wended its way across the country, drawing
throngs of the faithful and, not incidentally, priming them with
clips from the film in a portable, Dolby-equipped theater. The
atmosphere was more than a little reminiscent of the fervor
surrounding ``Star Trek'' and its many conventions and big-screen
spinoffs.
 &HT;    Yet unlike ``Star Trek,'' ``The X-Files'' has accomplished the
transition to cultdom while the show itself is still being shown in
prime time _ it's a cult without any apparent tinge of campiness or
rerun quaintness.
 &HT;    Almost from the beginning, a good deal of critical ink has been
spilled in an effort to account for the popularity of ``The
X-Files,'' which began simply as a chiller in the tradition of
Darren McGavin's old supernatural detective story, ``Kolchak: The
Night Stalker.'' Much of the attention has centered on the
so-called ``mythology'' of ``The X-Files'' _ roughly a fifth of the
117 episodes so far, which constitute an intricate and
ever-evolving serial tale of UFOs, alien abduction, unsavory
biological experimentation and government conspiracy and cover-up
at the very highest levels.
 &HT;    The secret of ``The X-Files,'' or so the argument goes, is that
the mythology taps into the most authentically anxious parts of our
post-modern Zeitgeist _ our fear of government and cancer (which
are practically interchangeable), along with our ongoing
fascination with the notion of extraterrestrial entities.
 &HT;    The program's creator, Chris Carter, has said: ``The show's
original spirit has become kind of the spirit of the country _ if
not the world. There is a growing paranoia. With the Berlin Wall
down, with the global nuclear threat gone, with Russia trying to be
a market economy, there is a growing paranoia because, as somebody
once said, there are no easy villains anymore.''
 &HT;    For the very same reasons, however, you could make a compelling
case that at no time in recent years have Americans been less
paranoid, especially about their own government. We're fearful
these days not so much of political plots as of random evil _ the
sort of unpredictable violence perpetrated by rogue states, by
weapon-toting militias with only a handful of members, by our
children even.
 &HT;    The show touches on these threats, but only glancingly, and then
to suggest that they're really manifestations of some vast
metaforce.
 &HT;    Rather than probing our deepest fears, ``The X-Files'' cleverly
reintroduces into our lives something like the feeling of paranoia
without the content, a pleasantly creepy frisson that awakens us to
all those thready webs of coincidence; they don't mean anything
exactly but they're pretty cool all the same.
 &HT;    If ``The X-Files'' is about anything, it's really about
nostalgia _ for a time (which may never have existed, really) when
a belief in global conspiracy held out the promise of a universe
that could be comprehended.
 &HT;    That the ``The X-Files'' culties themselves don't necessarily
believe that life is one dark plot was reinforced for me when I
caught up to the X-Files Expo in Miami. ``Please,'' one visitor to
the expo, a middle-aged airline pilot, said when I asked him if he
believed in government conspiracies. ``Just look at what's going on
in Washington now. What makes you think they could get their acts
together sufficiently to accomplish anything?''
 &HT;    This was in April, at the expo's halfway point. The publicity
material had promised sites that were appropriately spooky _
airplane hangars, abandoned military bases and the like _ but the
Miami expo took place in the Coconut Grove Convention Center, a
windowless, nondescript hall that more often plays host to
gatherings of gun and knife sellers and people taking the postal
exam.
 &HT;    For atmosphere there was a dry-ice machine pumping out fog, and
a sound system loudly recycling Mark Snow's ``Twilight
Zone''-inspired ``X-Files'' theme song: woo woo woo woo WOO woo.
The exhibits consisted of a pretty skimpy prop museum (wardrobe
items mostly: Scully's trench coat, Mulder's sleeveless
sweatshirt), and a number of stations where you could have your
picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background,
so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement
office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop
and experiencing an interval of what the show calls ``lost time.''
 &HT;    I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo
_ a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to
be a fetus in a jar _ and I spoke to a University of Miami
undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the governments
in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade
Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered ``X-Files'' cap
of his own design.
 &HT;    ``This is a show I can relate to,'' he told me. ``Sometimes I'll
just see an episode and I'll be saying, `That's me!' Like the
episode about the cockroaches _ anybody who knows my character
knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I
used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist _ that was when I
was watching `MacGyver' _ but now I think I might want to join the
FBI.''
 &HT;    Most of the crowd _ a preponderance of high-school and
college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too _ was clean-cut and
normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing
setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their
detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of ``X-Files'' mythology.
 &HT;    They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example _
that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in
effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form
of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the
show's Sophoclean subtext _ the vexed question of Mulder's true
parentage.
 &HT;    In truth, the ``X-Files'' mythology, which has evolved
accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies
(Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity
leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers
fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as
it is forward, continually revisiting old themes _ Samantha's
disappearance, UFO sightings, government experiments with tissue
obtained from smallpox vaccinations _ and uncovering additional
layers of duplicity.
 &HT;    You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That
icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing
gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have
worked only temporarily. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded
a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back
in Washington, plying his evil trade.
 &HT;    The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose
threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not
hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own
material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new
programs.
 &HT;    And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at
the heart of things anyway. The true ``X-Files'' conspiracy is not
about who will rule the world. It's conspiracy for its own sake _ a
Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself
_ and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much
more weird and interesting.
 &HT;    Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before
getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among
his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies,
programs such as ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Night Stalker''
and the televised Watergate hearings. We probably could have
guessed. ``The X-Files'' is in a way a melding of '70s politics and
special effects. Carter's genius has been to show us what paranoia
looks like, and it turns out to be the best-looking thing on
television. Rain-slicked blacktop, looming trees, lots of ice and
fog and mist.
 &HT;    ``The X-Files'' spends more on production values than do most
other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and
inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual
angles than most movies, let alone TV shows.
 &HT;    Even the villains, those nameless middle-age men who not only
manipulate our government but also in effect run the solar system
from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks
a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are
revealed as much by how they look as by what they do. The better
the haberdashery (as in the case of Well-Manicured Man, as he's
known), the more heinous the deeds. They all have a faintly jowly,
Nixonian cast to them, come to think of it _ even the possibly
well-intentioned fellow known as Deep Throat.
 &HT;    And it should be noted that originally, the most creepy of them
all, the deeply vile Cigarette-Smoking Man, didn't speak. He didn't
need to. The sight of him taking a drag on one of his ever-present
Morley's, inhaling so deeply that his eyes squinted, and then
letting the smoke leak from the corner of his mouth in snaky
gray-blue tendrils, was proof enough of his cancerous soul.
 &HT;    He lit up for the first time, we discovered last year, in a
self-congratulatory moment after successfully engineering the
assassination of JFK. (He was also, not surprisingly, behind the
death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King riots.) And
after kicking the habit for a while, he went back to the weed when
his attempt at making a legitimate go as a freelance writer, under
the nom de plume Raul Bloodworth, predictably came to naught.
 &HT;    What ``The X-Files'' really demonstrates, you might say, is what
the world would be like if global politics were more like office
politics, where the bad guys are always the suits, and if the
cosmic set designer had been the sort of person who watched a lot
of '70s television and read a lot of Whitley Strieber.
 &HT;    It's a darkly beautiful world, lighted by periodic explosions
and fireballs, where even the bees and the trees and the ground
underfoot may be less than benign, and it's a world that seems to
fairly thrum with energy, however unearthly, and possibility.
 &HT;    For all its hipness, though, ``The X-Files'' also has an
old-fashioned noirish quality. The gadgets are far from
cutting-edge, and the sci-fi elements _ flying saucers,
poltergeists, giant sewer-dwelling worms and the like _ are the
stuff of drive-in movies. The show transports us out of our
confused post-Cold War era to a time when the various ills of the
world come from somewhere else, and are so large and so pervasive
and so vague that they defy understanding.
 &HT;    In this mythic realm, conspiracies and government evildoing
become not the object of outrage, except among a chosen few, but
merely a fact of life, no more alterable than the weather.
 &HT;    If the world of ``the X-Files,'' with its all-encompassing
conspiracies, is strangely comforting, it is also enervating. Many
of the people you encounter literally have no wills of their own.
They respond robotically to signals received by mysterious bits of
metal implanted in their necks.
 &HT;    Others are animated not by passion, for the most part, but
simply by power or the quest for knowledge. Scully and Mulder
aren't just cool; they tend to operate at a lower emotional
temperature than any characters I can remember, either on
television or in movies and books.
 &HT;    It's not simply, as has so often been noted, that they have
shown no sexual interest in each other, Scully and Mulder don't
seem lastingly keen on anyone else either, and their relations with
everyone tend to be almost clinically flat and empty of affect.
Mulder is practically a zombie (Scully has lately, in response to a
cancer scare, manifested an occasional semblance of an inner life),
and he leaves us with the uncomfortable feeling that this is the
price that being a believer exacts.
 &HT;    It's a little like becoming an artist _ you have to give up
everything else. Think of the sexless, pasty-skinned Lone Gunmen,
the obsessive conspiracy theorists who turn up occasionally to
furnish Mulder with a crucial bit of microfilm: they seldom go out
except at night. This theme of loneliness and disconnection may be
the hidden message of ``The X-Files,'' in fact _ the show's real
secret: that true belief, of whatever sort, requires too much
self-surrender, and chances are that any belief will be mistaken
anyway.
 &HT;    The truth is not, as Mulder would have it, ``out there,'' but
rather right here, on our TV screens. ``The X-Files'' has taught us
that it's more entertaining, and probably more epistemologically
sound, to believe in everything and in nothing at all.

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Jody Williams opened the door of her office and looked in at an
alarming scene.
 &HT;    Everything from the furniture to Rolodexes, Coke bottles, coffee
cups, and spoons was missing, and holes had been punched in the
walls and ceiling. It was November 1989, and rebel forces in El
Salvador had launched their most serious offensive on the capital
in 10 years of civil war.
 &HT;    Williams' San Salvador office at Medical Aid for El Salvador was
among several humanitarian agencies that were sacked and robbed.
 &HT;    Williams, an intense and determined Vermont native, had no doubt
about who was responsible for the looting. Government forces had
long suspected that humanitarian groups were sympathetic to the
rebel cause, and Williams believed they had used the rebel
offensive as an opportunity to search the offices for propaganda
and weapons. When the fighting in the capital eased, she drove to
the headquarters of the Salvadoran military's high command, a drab,
cement-block building atop a man-made hill, overlooking a
shantytown of cardboard shacks.
 &HT;    Escorted into a sparsely furnished room, she stood face to face
with six colonels in camouflage, the leaders of the armed forces in
El Salvador.
 &HT;    ``I remember clearly thinking that if they could kill me, then
and there, for what I represented or for what they believed I
represented, they would,'' Williams recalls.
 &HT;    Williams wanted restitution for the damages and a written
apology. She left without getting either, but a few days later, the
chief of staff of the Salvadoran defense forces, Col. Rene Emilio
Ponce, did the unthinkable: He wrote a letter of apology, in effect
admitting that the government had sacked the office and noting his
support for Medical Aid for El Salvador's work.
 &HT;    ``You have no idea how important that letter was to us,''
recalls Mario Velasquez, Williams' boss at Medical Aid. ``We used
to call it the Golden Letter. With this letter, we gained the
respect of the military, so they were no longer messing with us.''
No one else in El Salvador had the courage to confront the
colonels, Velasquez says. ``Jody Williams did.''
 &HT;    Since her days as a young girl, when she defended her deaf and
schizophrenic brother from the tin cans and taunts of neighborhood
kids, Williams has cast herself as a foe of bullies and a Lone
Ranger for peace.
 &HT;    For years, she toiled in obscurity: first, trying to alleviate
the suffering caused by the ``Reagan-Bush wars,'' as she called the
conflicts in the '80s in Central America; later, in the job that
would win her world renown, as a top organizer of an international
coalition dedicated to the elimination of land mines around the
world.
 &HT;    In six years, the coalition that Williams helped assemble grew
from a handful of humanitarian groups into a campaign that
encompassed more than 1,000 organizations. It enlisted the support
of mine victims and mine-clearance experts, peace and disarmament
groups, sympathetic politicians, diplomats, four-star generals and,
most famously, the late Princess Diana.
 &HT;    To recognize this extraordinary effort, the Nobel committee in
Oslo, Norway, bestowed its Peace Prize last year jointly on
Williams and on the coalition that she helped build, the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines. Two months after the
prize announcement, 122 nations signed an international treaty in
Ottawa banning the production, sale and use of anti-personnel land
mines.
 &HT;    ``Jody acted as the nerve center of the campaign,'' says
Susannah Sirkin, of Physicians for Human Rights, in Boston, one of
the six founding organizations of the campaign. ``She was driven by
a single-minded focus to keep this thing going, literally staring
down those who would stand in the way.''
 &HT;    But the same character traits that catapulted the now
47-year-old Williams to Nobel glory _ her brashness, bluntness and
lone-wolf style of leadership _ have made her a lightning rod for
controversy.
 &HT;    She has been attacked in the press by former colleagues as an
imperious self-promoter and as an out-of-control employee who
hogged all of the credit and half of the prize money. She's been
accused of betraying the ideals of the land-mine campaign and
flouting the wishes of the campaign's steering committee by putting
herself forward for the peace prize.
 &HT;    At the center of this unhappy drama is Williams' rift with her
former employer, Robert O. Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that hired
her to coordinate the land-mine campaign. Muller, whom Williams had
at one time described as her best friend and mentor, fired Williams
three days before the prize was announced. The dismissal was the
culmination of months of mounting tension between the activists.
 &HT;    ``Jody is the ultimate loner,'' Muller says. ``You can only go
so far by yourself. That's part of the problem. She doesn't work
well at all with a team.''
 &HT;    Williams, lashing back, accuses her former colleagues of
jealousy and sexism, because, as she told one reporter, ``girls do
all the work, boys want the recognition.''
 &HT;    One of the unspoken commandments of humanitarian and peace work
is: Thou shalt not seek celebrity. And if fame comes, renounce it
quickly. Otherwise, beware thy colleagues' wrath.
 &HT;    U.N. mediator Ralph Bunche understood the importance of humility
when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his efforts
to bring an end to the war between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. ``I
am one man working for the United Nations,'' he said, firmly
rebuffing suggestions that he was a hero. ``Without the U.N., I am
nothing.''
 &HT;    Williams, critics say, has failed the Bunche test miserably.
They say she drove to Vermont from her apartment in suburban
Virginia just before the Nobel recipients were announced, so that
she could greet the international press corps alone, far from her
Washington, D.C., colleagues. Williams, who notes that she'd been
fired three days before the Nobel announcement, says that she drove
to Vermont to celebrate her birthday.
 &HT;    Whatever her intentions, the choice of location made for
brilliant theater: She stood alone in her grassy yard near a beaver
pond, barefoot and wearing a black tank top, blasting the president
of the United States as a ``weenie'' for refusing to buck the
Pentagon and support a land-mine ban.
 &HT;    Many of the articles that ran in the next day's newspapers
portrayed Williams as a hard-charging, backwoods hero who, by
tapping into the Internet from her ``rustic farmhouse,'' had
single-handedly galvanized citizens to rise up against an insidious
weapon _ all in defiance of the United States, the world's sole
remaining superpower.
 &HT;    The story made good copy, but it was, at best, misleading. Many
people played critical roles in the success of the campaign,
including Thomas Gebauer, of the German group Medico International
and Muller, of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, who
conceived the idea; sympathetic politicians such as U.S. Sen.
Patrick Leahy, of Vermont and Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign
minister; Princess Diana, who focused international attention on
the cause; and hundreds of mine victims and mine-clearance experts
around the world.
 &HT;    But Williams _ who was an employee of Muller's foundation, which
paid her $70,000-a-year salary and travel expenses _ sees herself
as the key figure in the effort. ``It started with me,'' she
asserts, ``and five years later, there were 1,200 non-government
organizations in 60 countries involved.''
 &HT;    Williams also angered many colleagues by keeping her $500,000
share of the prize money, thereby violating another activists'
commandment: Thou shalt not get rich. And Williams' public
complaints about the $230,000 tax bill she faced struck a sour
note.
 &HT;    Critics say she could have donated her share of the prize to the
campaign or to land-mine victims. Instead, almost half of her prize
money will go to the U.S. Treasury and much of it will be spent by
the Pentagon, which has opposed the land-mine treaty from the
outset.
 &HT;    Muller, a former Marine lieutenant, who was determined to rid
the world of land mines, had been paralyzed below the waist in
1969, while shot through the chest, charging a hill in South
Vietnam. His anger and activist fire were forged during his
rehabilitation at the Veterans Administration medical center in the
Bronx, where he was appalled at the filthy conditions and despair.
 &HT;    He joined the antiwar movement and was thrown out of the 1972
Republican National Convention for attempting to shout down
President Richard M. Nixon. He led the campaign to secure financial
restitution for U.S. soldiers who were victims of Agent Orange and
headed the first delegation of American veterans to return to
Vietnam, in 1981.
 &HT;    He was the hero of the 1975 Vietnam documentary ``Hearts and
Minds'' and a real-life inspiration for the ``cool rockin' daddy''
of Bruce Springsteen's anthem, ``Born in the U.S.A.'' A man of
almost messianic charisma, Muller inspires fierce devotion among
his staff.
 &HT;    During visits to Cambodia in the 1980s, Muller was stunned by
the number of land-mine victims _ according to one recent estimate,
one out every 236 people in that country is an amputee _ and by the
appalling lack of care. Muller's organization, the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, which he founded in 1980, set up a
prosthetics clinic in Cambodia, but the catastrophic toll exacted
by hidden mines convinced him that victim assistance was only a
Band-Aid for a problem that demanded much more.
 &HT;    All over the world, workers from humanitarian groups were
reaching similar conclusions. The Red Cross estimates that 24,000
people are killed or maimed by land mines each year, most of them
civilians and many of them children. According to the U.S. State
Department, there are between 80 million and 110 million land mines
buried in 71 countries around the world, most in developing
countries.
 &HT;    In October 1991, Muller and Thomas Gebauer, of the German aid
group Medico International, decided to try to unite numerous
humanitarian, development, and peace groups under the banner of an
international campaign. The goal, as framed by Muller and Gebauer,
was an international ban on antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    A month later, impressed by Williams' intensity and organizing
track record at Medical Aid for El Salvador, Muller asked her to
come on board as the campaign coordinator.
 &HT;    Within a year of the hiring of Williams, four other
non-governmental organizations _ Human Rights Watch, Handicap
International, the Mines Advisory Group and Physicians for Human
Rights _ joined the campaign. Together with Medico International
and Muller's veterans foundation, these organizations formed a
steering committee to provide direction to the effort to ban land
mines.
 &HT;    Volatile and self-assured, Williams had a famous exchange during
the Ottawa Conference, in 1996, a strategy session for banning land
mines that brought together representatives from 70 governments.
The head of the French delegation, Michel Declos, an Old
World-style diplomat, told the conference that France supported a
ban but reserved the right to use land mines when militarily
necessary.
 &HT;    Several delegates signaled for Williams to stand up and rebut
him. Leaning toward the microphone, Williams said that the
``distinguished representative'' of the French delegation could not
have it both ways: supporting a ban in peacetime but using mines in
wartime. His proposal, she said, was ``better than a stick in the
eye, but not much.''
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary moment: a member of a non-governmental
organization lecturing a diplomat. With Williams leading the
charge, other participants at the conference began denouncing the
French proposal. On the last day of the conference, Lloyd Axworthy,
the Canadian foreign minister, astonished everyone with a heady
challenge: He called on the nations of the world to return to
Ottawa in 14 months to sign an international treaty outlawing land
mines.
 &HT;    However, once close friends, Muller and Williams were barely
speaking during 1997, and the gulf between their strategies was
widening.
 &HT;    The two had very different world views. Muller believed that a
treaty to ban land mines would be a hollow victory without American
support, because the United States was the only country in the
world with the clout and credibility to persuade nations such as
Russia and China to sign on and to ensure adherence to the treaty.
Williams disagreed. The most important countries to have on board,
she believed, were nations that used mines: the Angolas and
Cambodias of the world. The United States could sign later if it
wanted.
 &HT;    The two also disagreed about tactics. Muller had hired a
lobbying team of pollsters and media experts, headed by former
White House aide Patrick Griffin. Williams called the group ``the
sleaze team.'' The campaign, she felt, was being cited as a new
model of diplomacy, one in which average citizens and
non-governmental organizations forced governments to agree to a
weapons ban. She did not think it needed a Beltway PR machine.
 &HT;    Muller thought Williams and her allies were naive about the way
Washington worked. Conservative members of Congress and Army
generals were not going to be swayed by grass-roots campaigning.
Still, he agreed that Griffin's work should be kept as low-profile
as possible.
 &HT;    On Oct. 7, 1997, Muller fired Williams officially. Three days
later, at 4 a.m., the phones at her Vermont home started ringing.
Williams and the campaign had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
In December, the historic Ottawa treaty was signed by 122 nations,
banning the use of antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    In May, in an important policy shift, the Clinton administration
announced that the United States will sign the Ottawa treaty as
soon as it finds alternatives to its mixed landmine systems. It has
set a goal of the year 2006.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, since the controversy over the landmine campaign and
the Nobel Prize hit the pages of the Los Angeles Times, the
Washington Post and The New York Times, Williams has been besieged
with requests for interviews. This is the last personal interview
she will be granting for a while, Williams promises; she will not
further indulge a ``media story gone amok.''
 &HT;    ``I'm not interested in talking about me,'' she says. ``Contrary
to what some in the campaign think, I'm not into being a famous
person.''
 &HT;    Williams says she will spend her time working as one of the
campaign's official unpaid ambassadors, formulating political
strategies and giving speeches to ensure that the treaty signed in
Ottawa is ratified, implemented and enforced.

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Watch Quania's eyes.
 &HT;    Dark beneath her broad forehead and furrows of braid, they
reveal nothing. She keeps them distant.
 &HT;    As the bus called ``the 28'' rumbles along Blue Hill Avenue
toward Grove Hall, Quania looks straight ahead. She does not watch
the chattering groups of other teen-age girls, doesn't look at
anyone's clothes or face, certainly doesn't cast a glance at any
boy sitting with a girl.
 &HT;    Later at Grove Hall, where a building of squat shops curves
around a corner, two girls face each other in a darkened doorway,
their backs to the doorposts. Quania's glance in their direction is
too stealthy to be seen: ``I almost looked over at them, but I
looked right back away,'' she says, her tone almost apologetic.
 &HT;    At 15, Quania Daniel, a sophomore at Boston English High School,
already has learned the danger of a misinterpreted glance _ a
glance mistaken for superiority or haughtiness, for a sneer at
another girl's appearance or for flirting with someone's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Here in Grove Hall, behind the Beulah Holmes Holiness Center, a
girl pulled a knife on Quania one night a few months back. It was a
confrontation sparked by a glance Quania might have cast _ though
she doesn't remember it _ at the Chez Vous roller rink up the
avenue.
 &HT;    When the knife came out, she walked away. Chicken, some girls
called her. Smart, she calls herself.
 &HT;    But the next night, she happened to run into the girl again at
Grove Hall, and this time they did fight, fist-to-fist _ ``up and
up,'' as Quania says, distinguishing it from fights with weapons or
fights where a group of girls jumps a lone victim. ``I didn't lose
that fight'' is all she will say about it.
 &HT;    She was lucky to have a fight end so cleanly. One of her
friends, tied by rumor to another girl's boyfriend, had her face
slashed with a box cutter just a block down from Doyle's, the
Jamaica Plain tavern where warm friendships and conviviality
abound.
 &HT;    Until about 10 years ago, teen-age girls seldom fought each
other _ even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors and
box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks.
 &HT;    Today they do. And that has made the world of many girls like
Quania a terrain of fear, a place where caution is essential. The
threat is not just in the cores of cities. It exists in
Massachusetts at the Quincy Center MBTA stop; at a trailer park in
Concord, N.H.; at a school in York, Maine.
 &HT;    Violence by teen-age girls is not yet a deluge, but its steady
escalation, even as overall crime rates in the nation are falling,
is troubling.
 &HT;    Consider these recent crimes by girls:
 &HT;    In Roxbury, Mass., two 15-year-olds use razors to slice the arms
and forehead of a 16-year-old girl.
 &HT;    In Concord, N.H., four girls surround a 14-year-old girl as she
gets off a school bus at the mobile-home park where she lives and
beat her with baseball bats.
 &HT;    In Revere, Mass., a state trooper is brought down by a
15-year-old girl who jumps him from behind after he stops her
father for a minor traffic violation.
 &HT;    In Cromwell, Conn., two 18-year-olds are charged with using box
cutters to slash the necks of two other teen-age girls.
 &HT;    In Rhode Island, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing is
sentenced to 45 years in prison for the murder of a 23-year-old
single mother she shot in the head in a fight over a man.
 &HT;    And in Springfield, Mass., a teen-age girl holds up a young
mother at gunpoint, then beats her victim's 18-month-old child with
the pistol.
 &HT;    Kathleen M. O'Toole, the state's secretary of public safety,
recalls that when she was a Boston street cop in the 1970s and
'80s, girls were arrested rarely, and then only for nonviolent
crimes such as shoplifting. In the mid-1980s, however, that began
to change, and the rise in violence has been steady.
 &HT;    Since 1987, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes
committed annually by boys under 18 has risen from 51,653 to 78,853
_ a 53 percent increase. But that is less than half the percentage
increase among girls during the same period: Violent crime by girls
under 18 climbed 118 percent, from 6,418 incidents to 13,995.
Aggravated assaults were up 124 percent; robberies, 117 percent.
 &HT;    Guns are rarely the weapon of choice for girls _ at least for
now. They opt for less deadly weapons, such as razors, box- and
carpet-cutting knives, sticks, bats, fists. Before teen-age boys
turned to guns, sometime in the mid-1980s, they too used knives and
razors, and that leaves open the question of whether girls will
also turn to guns as the taboo on violent female behavior fades.
 &HT;    Still, the total number of girls committing violent crimes is
small compared with boys. Meda Chesney-Lind, professor of women's
studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and co-author of the
recent book ``Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice,'' cautions
that the perceived increase in teen-age female violence may be
partly a result of greater attention to the problem by police and
the news media.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the shift has been perceptible enough that
educators, social workers, judges and police are worried that if
the trend continues, girls might achieve a perverse equality in
crime, an achievement nobody would cheer.
 &HT;    Now Quania is in a program trying to stay out of violence and
help other kids do the same. But she knows it's not easy.
 &HT;    Time was, a teen-age girl living in bad circumstances did one of
two things: She either retreated into herself, becoming the
hollow-eyed waif who said little in school and maybe even quit
altogether, walking through the days full of pain and
submissiveness; or she got pregnant, because pregnancy meant escape
and, with another life dependent on her, a vestige of power.
 &HT;    Today, girls have a third way to go wrong: by striking out in
violence.
 &HT;    The triggers can seem trivial. A girl might attack someone she
thinks looks down on her clothes, her hair, her family. Somebody
sizes up her boyfriend, maybe. Or somebody looks as if she wants to
rise above their shared lot, by dressing well, studying hard,
refusing to hang in the neighborhood or joyride on the streets or
country roads.
 &HT;    Most girls who turn to violence are reacting to the same
circumstances that have long been blamed for breeding violence
among boys. They come from dysfunctional families, learning at home
about abuse: of their bodies, of drugs and alcohol, of their own
esteem. What they don't learn there they pick up on the streets.
They form cliques that a decade ago might have been merely vocally
abusive but today are assault squads.
 &HT;    This generation of girls spends many hours after school without
parental supervision. But what is new is that they do it in the
company of boys, and as the equals of those boys. Just as some boys
and girls hang together today in positive ways, as groups of
friends, not couples, so others hang together in destructive
pursuits.
 &HT;    ``They're acting like they do because of the way the boys
behave. They don't want the boys to have one up on them,'' says Joe
Mascaritolo, the assistant director at Madison Park
Vocational-Technical High School, in Boston. ``You see it more in
groups of boys and girls all being together, all trying to be
equals.''
 &HT;    But there is irony in this, says Sibylle Artz, a professor of
children and youth care at the University of Victoria, in British
Columbia. The girls who become violent and so feel they are
achieving power do it not by becoming powerful young girls but by
stepping out of gender, by acting like violent young men.
 &HT;    Part of the influence on girls is the music that many listen to,
as well as the movies, television shows, fashion ads and news
programs that emphasize power and violence. Artz points
specifically to music videos, which entered the culture shortly
before the first increase in violence among girls was noted.
Perhaps significantly, many videos portray women as powerful by
virtue of their potential violence.
 &HT;    Complaints about the effects of pop culture are not new, but the
level of violence among girls is rising just as girls are tuning in
to this culture in record numbers. In 1997, for the first time,
more girls bought CDs, records and tapes than boys. Li'l Kim, the
rap singer, calls herself the Queen Bitch and sings of sex and
excess _ to the sound of a gun being cocked.
 &HT;    Quania recalls a number with the refrain ``slice you up'' and
marvels that one song she loved by Master P turned out, once she
got past the beat and heard the lyrics, to be a recipe for
producing crack cocaine.
 &HT;    ``These girls are not becoming violent out of thin air,'' says
Martha P. Grace, chief justice for the Massachusetts juvenile-court
system. They emerge from ``a constellation of parental neglect,'' a
world where they have ``either witnessed violence endlessly on TV,
in their home, or they have been violated by a parent or someone
else.''
 &HT;    ``Women judges may sometimes be the first women they encounter
who are not powerless,'' Grace notes. This is so even though women
today are more powerful than ever in business, medicine, the law,
the trades, sports and many other realms. Women in these roles
often exist beyond the ken of troubled teen-age girls. But a shadow
of that social shift has fallen across their world: Girls now see
they can rise in the world of violent crime.
 &HT;    Frenia learned most of her bad ways on the street, or in classes
where she wasn't always paying attention. Like Quania, she is
working hard to keep her own life in order and help others at the
same time.
 &HT;    To that end, eight teen-age girls are at ease, sitting around a
make-believe living room. Bone-Net, played by Charlene Johnson, has
invited her girlfriends in to watch TV, and they're finger-flicking
through the channels. The flashing images trigger memory and
reaction in each of the girls.
 &HT;    One by one, they rise on the makeshift stage in the cafeteria of
the Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, in Charlestown, Mass. Each
has a lesson in danger to present to an audience of her peers.
 &HT;    A young woman named Precious stands to tell of her dilemma: Her
friends Trisha and Toya are at each other, she says, and she is
worried that their vocal dispute will turn violently physical. Toya
has already threatened Trisha: ``You're that girl who was talking
bad trash about me,'' and ``I'm going to beat your behind,'' with
eight other girls to help.
 &HT;    Caught in the middle of impending violence between two friends,
Precious asks the audience what she should do. ``I don't want to
get cut up over nobody.''
 &HT;    Several hands shoot up immediately. Talk to your friends, one
student suggests. Tell them violence is no way to go, remind them
that they are friends. Get them to sit down and talk this out.
 &HT;    Precious's real name is La 'Toshia Leathers; she's a member of a
traveling troupe of high school students. The group puts on skits
illustrating some of the dangers teen-age girls face, then invites
the audience to talk about avoiding such pitfalls. Called teen-age
Girls InFormed, the troupe was put together by the Massachusetts
Prevention Center, at the Medical Foundation in Boston, and is
supported by the public school system.
 &HT;    A discussion such as this is one of several ways in which
schools and public officials are beginning to confront the problem
of escalating violence among adolescent girls. Some programs are
aimed specifically at them, while others that once targeted boys
have been expanded to include girls.
 &HT;    In some communities, teen-agers are recruited as peer leaders in
their schools; in others, officials have set up downtown drop-in
centers for troubled youths. Still other programs, such as teen-age
Girls InFormed, hope their cautionary tales will reach young people
before violence happens.
 &HT;    The audience on this afternoon, at least, appears to be engaged
in Precious' story. Later, other characters rise: Blue, whose real
name is Marilyn Jean, acts the part of a drunk, telling how she
forced a girl who didn't drink to slug down some liquor. ``It's not
my fault she choked on her vomit,'' she says. ``It's not my fault
she died.'' The audience groans in disapproval.
 &HT;    As the session continues, actors come forward to talk of date
rape, of more drinking, of more violence. They ask the audience to
respond: Who was at fault in the date rape? Should a drunken mother
be reported to the social service department? How do you stop
drinking? How do you stop fighting?
 &HT;    Today, Frenia is a peer leader for Teen Empowerment, a South
End-based outreach program with offices in three Boston high
schools: Madison Park, English and Dorchester. Peer leaders try to
help steer troubled youngsters away from violence by teaching them
to express their anger and frustrations in ways that are vocal, not
violent.
 &HT;    ``They learn violence at home,'' Frenia says. ``They aren't
respected and they end up not respecting themselves. And how are
you going to respect anybody else if you can't respect yourself?''
 &HT;    Teen Empowerment tries to teach self-respect by encouraging kids
to talk about what is troubling them, in casual gatherings after
school, without dictating solutions. Instead, a peer leader, such
as Frenia or Quania, uses her own experience to help peers work out
answers for themselves.
 &HT;    While programs such as these seem promising, no one is sure yet
what will work best. Yet the studies that Artz and others have
done, in both Canada and the United States, offer some clues to
what might work. It seems the skits presented by teen-age Girls
InFormed are useful because they present tangible problems, inspire
discussion and propose nonviolent options.
 &HT;    The issue is critical, because the question that logically
follows the surge in violence among girls is frightening: Will the
trend continue, mimicking the level of mayhem among boys?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. Moreover, girls appear to learn from one another
in ways that boys, long ingrained with the notion that
aggressiveness is natural, do not. Many are hoping this will be a
key to the battle.

have been expanded to include girls.
 &HT;    In some communities, teen-agers are recruited as peer leaders in
their schools; in others, officials have set up downtown drop-in
centers for troubled youths. Still other programs, such as teen-age
Girls InFormed, hope their cautionary tales will reach young people
before violence happens.
 &HT;    The audience on this afternoon, at least, appears to be engaged
in Precious' story. Later, other characters rise: Blue, whose real
name is Marilyn Jean, acts the part of a drunk, telling how she
forced a girl who didn't drink to slug down some liquor. ``It's not
my fault she choked on her vomit,'' she says. ``It's not my fault
she died.'' The audience groans in disapproval.
 &HT;    As the session continues, actors come forward to talk of date
rape, of more drinking, of more violence. They ask the audience to
respond: Who was at fault in the date rape? Should a drunken mother
be reported to the social service department? How do you stop
drinking? How do you stop fighting?
 &HT;    Today, Frenia is a peer leader for Teen Empowerment, a South
End-based outreach program with offices in three Boston high
schools: Madison Park, English and Dorchester. Peer leaders try to
help steer troubled youngsters away from violence by teaching them
to express their anger and frustrations in ways that are vocal, not
violent.
 &HT;    ``They learn violence at home,'' Frenia says. ``They aren't
respected and they end up not respecting themselves. And how are
you going to respect anybody else if you can't respect yourself?''
 &HT;    Teen Empowerment tries to teach self-respect by encouraging kids
to talk about what is troubling them, in casual gatherings after
school, without dictating solutions. Instead, a peer leader, such
as Frenia or Quania, uses her own experience to help peers work out
answers for themselves.
 &HT;    While programs such as these seem promising, no one is sure yet
what will work best. Yet the studies that Artz and others have
done, in both Canada and the United States, offer some clues to
what might work. It seems the skits presented by teen-age Girls
InFormed are useful because they present tangible problems, inspire
discussion and propose nonviolent options.
 &HT;    The issue is critical, because the question that logically
follows the surge in violence among girls is frightening: Will the
trend continue, mimicking the level of mayhem among boys?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. Moreover, girls appear to learn from one another
in ways that boys, long ingrained with the notion that
aggressiveness is natural, do not. Many are hoping this will be a
key to the battle.

   (1,500 words) EDITORS: For the opposing view, see Mortimer
Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-
TOPS. The current sense that the United States is on top of the
world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few
good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will
not record that the 21st century belonged to America.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (1,500 words) EDITORS: For the opposing view, see Mortimer
Zuckerman's ``America Will Remain No. 1'' _ BC-PRO-AMERICA-IS-
TOPS. The current sense that the United States is on top of the
world is based on a huge exaggeration of the implications of a few
good years here and a few bad years elsewhere. In no sense is the
United States on the verge of crisis. But future historians will
not record that the 21st century belonged to America.

</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) It is presumptuous to think the Asian financial
crisis foretells Asian acceptance of American ways. The Asian
economies holding up the best may be those with the most political
freedom, but the real key may be competent government. East Asia is
changing, but not Americanizing.

<P>
   (1,450 words) The French always seem to be opposing the United
states on some issue or another. Why is France so difficult to deal
with? It is, quite simply, in a bad mood, unsure of its place and

seems to run the world; afraid of globalization; and ambivalent
about European unity.

COMPANY PLANS FUEL CELLS FOR THE HOME BY 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHAN, N.Y. _ Plug Power LLC says it has developed a cleaner,
cheaper and more reliable way of getting electricity into the
average home.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power announced it expects to bring a $3,000
dishwasher-sized power source that can supply all the electricity
needed to run the average home by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and government energy-policy architects
attending Wednesday's announcement agreed the fuel-cell technology
is a good idea. They like the way fuel cells can produce
electricity in a clean, contained process that doesn't generate air
pollution the way coal-fired plants do, and that is also more
efficient in generating power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very interested in promoting this technology not only
to consumers, but to municipalities around the state,'' said Daniel
R. Mackay, representative of the New York Conservation Education
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind fuel-cell technology is to take a common fuel,
such as natural gas or propane and convert that into hydrogen gas.
Early models are starting with hydrogen gas.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen molecules are actually split into electrons and
protons, with the electrons providing the power that can be
converted into electricity for the home. The protons left over
react with oxygen in the air and create water, which is emitted
from the fuel cell as exhaust. Thin membranes are used as a sort of
staging for the whole process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never stops to boggle my mind that a little Saran Wrap-type
material can give you 300 to 400 amps of power, and your average
toaster uses 15 amps of power,'' said William Ernst, vice president
and technical director of the Latham, N.Y.-based Plug Power.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells are manufactured to match the specific energy needs
of different categories of consumers. Plug Power's first product
will produce 7,000 watts of power, more than enough to handle the
energy demands of a 2,000 square-foot home, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a modest brick-faced ranch belonging to a company
employee is using a demonstration model fuel cell now.
</P>
<P>
   Company employees admitted visitors to the home Wednesday to
show how computers, televisions, kitchen appliances, lights and air
conditioners can all be powered at the same time from the fuel
cell.
</P>
<P>
   Because the electricity is actually produced right on the home
site with a delivered fuel such as natural gas or propane from a
home tank, it doesn't have to be transmitted through power lines
and poles that can be felled in storms.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power said the power produced by a fuel cell could be 20
percent cheaper than that provided by major utility companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, heat expended by the fuel cell can be used to heat
water in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power President Gary Mittleman said he expected utility
companies to distribute the systems to residential customers when
the first product, the Plug Power 7000, comes onto the market in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Utility companies may own the product, install it on customer
premises and charge for the electricity produced, he said. As the
market evolves, customers might buy their own models, perhaps even
from appliance dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also are trying to produce this technology and
to get into related markets. Some companies, for instance, are
focused solely on fuel cells for cars.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut-based Onsi Corp. produces fuel cells for commercial
buildings that require more power.
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems distributes power-generation units for small
industrial units, and so goes after a different segment of the
power market, according to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Plug Power is well-positioned to be the leader in the
U.S. residential market, said Jean M. Redfield, president of DTE
Edison Electric, which is one of Plug Power's two corporate
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power also has its eye on markets in China, Latin America
and other countries where some regions lack extensive power-grid
systems, executives said, as well as industrialized nations that
are grappling with air-pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power is a joint venture between DTE and Mechanical
Technology Inc. of Latham, an early developer of fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power was formed a year ago, and soon after one of its fuel
cells was used to convert electricity to gasoline for cars. The New
York State Energy Research and Development Authority helped the
company with a $1.2 million grant for early research.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to increase payroll from 125 to 300 when
it gets to the manufacturing phase.

SECURE IN MY OWN IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laziness is a vice, but a mighty useful one. Time and again,
it's led people to invent truly clever ways of doing things, simply
to avoid physical or mental labor. In fact, some of the most
interesting recent developments in computer security were created
to cope with the temptation to let things slide.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer security systems depend at least in part on
passwords, a notoriously risky method because of the weaknesses of
human memory. Most of us pick obvious words that are easy for some
vandal to guess. Or we end up using the same password over and over
for different purposes _ logging onto the office network, for
instance, and getting our electronic mail, and signing on to
America Online. It's all because we're too busy or too lazy to
memorize a couple dozen different passwords, or to pick words like,
say, syzygy, that you don't see every day.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Holy Grail of data security is the creation of
systems that can let authorized individuals get control of a
computer without having to memorize anything.
</P>
<P>
   Now the solution is at hand, thanks to a technology you'll be
hearing a lot about in the next few years. It's called biometrics,
and it's about letting people use their own physical
characteristics as a password. In essence, we're teaching computers
to recognize an individual by his glance, his touch or the sound of
his voice.
</P>
<P>
   It works, too. Several Boston-area firms, including Miros Inc.
of Wellesley, Viisage Technology Inc. of Littleton and Polaroid
Corp. of Cambridge, sell security systems that let companies
identify people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is presently beyond the reach of small businesses or
individuals, but other biometric products aim for the paranoiac on
a budget. Voiceprint software, for instance, doesn't require any
special hardware _ just a computer with a sound card and a
microphone, which is standard issue these days.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago company called Veritel offers a voiceprint product for
locking up your most sensitive computer files. Its $59.95
VoiceCrypt system is available for Windows 95, 98 and NT systems.
It lets you do drag-and-drop encryption of any files on your
computer, making them unreadable by nosy colleagues. Nothing new
there _ products like Norton Your Eyes Only have offered this
capability for quite a while. What makes VoiceCrypt especially cool
is that you get access to the files by reciting a password into a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Most speech-recognition programs, like Dragon Systems Inc.'s
Naturally Speaking and IBM's ViaVoice, are designed for dictating
memos into a word processor. You must spend a couple of hours
training these programs to recognize your voice. But VoiceCrypt
only needs a minute or so to analyze the characteristics of your
voice. You also type in answers to test questions that serve as a
backup password _ for instance, what color was your first car? If
you ever lose your voice, you can still type your way into the
system, without having to memorize yet another password.

   During a test of VoiceCrypt, I sometimes had to repeat myself
several times before the software could identify me. I also found
that it isn't too choosy about passwords. I could say any word that
came to mind, and VoiceCrypt would let me in if it recognized my
voice. But VoiceCrypt passed the most important test: Several of my
colleagues have tried to talk their way past it, to no avail.

   There are other biometric possibilities for those willing to buy
extra hardware. The Canadian firm American Biometric Co. sells
BioMouse, a $299 device that plugs into a parallel port and reads
your fingerprints. Just press a digit against the BioMouse and
you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Some caution is in order. Biometric systems raise an important
privacy concern. You don't want firms sharing your faceprint,
fingerprint or voiceprint data with other firms, or the government,
without your permission. And they ought to store the data in an
encrypted format so nobody can steal it. I foresee the need for a
federal biometric privacy law before we'll feel entirely safe
around these gadgets. But imagine being able to read your e-mail by
saying ``open sesame,'' or getting money out of an ATM simply by
staring at it. It's a lazy man's dream.

EXPERTS PONDER CONVICTED AU PAIR'S RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Louise Woodward, convicted in the killing of
eight-month-old Matthew Eappen, likely is free to cash in on her
notoriety, but the Eappen family also has a good legal basis to
seize any money their former au pair might get for telling her
story, attorneys said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Woodward traveled home to England Wednesday, US District
Court Judge William G. Young issued a temporary order requiring
her, and those who represent her, to notify the court and Eappen
family attorneys if she signs a contract to earn money from her
story. Young also ordered Woodward not to spend any money she might
get under any such arrangement with a United States firm for at
least 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Young said he would review First Amendment law and also the
only case in Massachusetts where the issue of a criminal profiting
from a crime was addressed by the Supreme Judicial Court. The SJC
ruled that Katherine A. Power, who admitted participating in a bank
robbery and the murder of a Boston police officer in 1970, was
properly banned by a judge from making money from her crime. The
judge made the ban a condition of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Most people interviewed in downtown Boston Wednesday said they
wouldn't support a book on the trial, and that Woodward shouldn't
make money from one. But Eliza N. Coady of Allston said she thinks
it would receive wide support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tabloid story,'' the 18-year-old office assistant said.
``It's like slowing down to see a car accident ... It's one of
those things where a lot of people will say that they won't read
it, but when it comes out, it's a best-seller.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys who specialize in First Amendment law split on whether
Woodward can successfully argue that Young's order is a violation
of her constitutional rights, which are protected in American
courts.
</P>
<P>
   John ``Ike'' Williams, of Palmer&AMP;Dodge, said that the last time
the US Supreme Court looked at the issue, it ruled that a New York
State law, known as the ``Son of Sam'' law, was unconstitutional.
The 1991 decision made it clear that a criminal cannot
automatically be barred from profiting by telling his or her story,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Power case, the SJC ruled that she could be kept from
profiting as a condition of her probation after she pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the death of Officer Walter Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Young's order ``tiptoed'' between those two legal standards,
said Williams, who added that he believed the First Amendment could
derail any legal limitation on Woodward's financial benefit from
her notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a real chilling effect on speech,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Albano, a First Amendment lawyer with Bingham,
Dana&AMP;Gould who also represents the Globe, said that his reading of
the same cases leads him to a different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Eappens are only seeking money Woodward would earn
from signing a contract, they are not blocking her from exercising
her First Amendment right to free speech, he said. Moreover, since
the Eappens have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit, courts routinely
put financial strings on defendants to ensure any judgment is
eventually paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you happen to be an author, and they happen to want to
collect a debt from money you've made from your writing, then I
really don't see that raising any First Amendment concern,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Son of Sam'' law was dangerously overbroad and banned all
criminals from profiting, Albano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say that anybody convicted of a crime can't write books
and make money from their experiences, then people like Martin
Luther King, who gets convicted of civil disobedience, is subject
to that statute,'' Albano said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Woodward flew back to England Wednesday, attorneys said
the wrongful-death suit could follow in her wake. They also said
that while she does not have to be in federal court on Oct. 1, when
the trial is now scheduled to begin, from a legal strategy
standpoint, it would wise for her to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys say jurors in the civil case might look upon her
absence negatively, as if she doesn't care about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Greco, a Boston attorney with Hill and Barlow, said
nations extend ``comity'' to each other under which a judgment from
one country can be enforced in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vast differences among foreign countries,'' Greco
said, ``but England is pretty much easier because of the same
Anglo-American legal tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``it's not a slam dunk'' that the Eappens
would be able to convince an English court to back up any judgment
if a jury concludes they deserve money in their wrongful-death
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court there could again look at the facts leading up to
the entry of a judgment and could find ways to refuse to honor the
judgment on some basis,'' Greco said.

WEATHER STINGS NEW YORK APPLE CROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GOTTLIEB  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When temperatures soared into the 80s the last
week of March, the public frolicked, but farmers fretted. Apple
growers like Jerry Knight of Ballston, N.Y., knew the unusually
warm weather would jumpstart by two to three weeks the blooms on
the apple trees, leaving them susceptible to frost.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, temperatures dipped into the 30s. Knight
estimates he lost nearly a third of the crop on his 100-acre farm
in northeastern New York.
</P>
<P>
   Every season, a checklist of factors determines whether apples,
New York's largest cash crop, will prove a bumper or a bust in the
fall. This year's fate was sealed earlier than most experts can
recall. The state Department of Agriculture and Markets estimates
that 30 percent of apples _ though in places it was two or three
times that amount _ were lost because of the unseasonable
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Using last year's record yield of 1.2 billion pounds of apples,
the damage statewide translates into about 400 million pounds _
close to $50 million based on last year's prices. ``I would say
this year is the worst as far as the frost injury,'' said Kevin
Iungerman, Cooperative Extension's fruit specialist for northeast
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has requested federal aid for 11 counties,
including Saratoga and Schenectady, a designation making farmers
eligible for low-interest loans of up to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have warm weather that early you're concerned,''
said Malta apple grower David Bowman, who lost up to 80 percent of
his apples to frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my apples are the size of golf balls, some of my trees
have none at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent deluge of rain also destroyed his cherries and kept
customers away from his farmstand.``I don't think I did everything
wrong,'' he sighed. ``Someone else must have _ we're being hit one
thing after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Any help is welcomed by Bowman, who is struggling to make
payroll thanks to a springtime that has made it too wet to even get
in to thin the fruits or put in his vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the diminished crop, Bowman and others caution that it
is too early to know what effect it will leave. Bowman, for
instance, wonders if the larger size of surviving apples might help
make up for lighter crop.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said a consistently low output could raise prices. This
would contrast last year's bumper crop, which produced enough
apples to last many farmers well into this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard year to sell. Everyone has a large crop,''
said Knight. ``If everyone lost, I think we'll make more money in
the end _ as long you're not the only one in the situation.''

WHAT THE MEDIA DON'T ADMIT: GUNS MAKE US SAFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlton Heston was elected president of the National Rifle
Association, and the national media promptly unloosed a cannonade
of antigun, antigun-owner rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times rolled out an editorial slamming Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott for having ``marched to the (NRA)
convention and vowed to oppose any effort to tighten gun-control
laws.'' The Washington Post harrumphed that Heston and the NRA
``dismiss even the most reasonable proposals'' for more gun
control, such as ``banning the purchase by one person of more than
one handgun a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the rounds of the morning TV shows, Heston was grilled at
each stop for his failure to hold the enlightened opinion that guns
are evil. Katie Couric's questions and colloquy on the NBC show
``Today'' were typical:
</P>
<P>
   _``As you well know ... there has been a spate of school
shootings recently .... Given the fact that these seem to be
happening with greater frequency, has it caused you to rethink your
philosophy about children and guns and the accessibility of guns
for children?''
</P>
<P>
   _``But, Mr. Heston, don't you think that if children are deeply
disturbed, there might be another way for them to deal with
conflict if guns were not so readily available to them?''
</P>
<P>
   _``Getting back to kids and guns, if you will indulge me for a
moment _ you cannot think of any other position the NRA could take
in terms of trying to decrease the number of school shootings? You
feel like this is not your bailiwick, this is not your problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Heston: ``Not at all. As I told you the NRA spends more money,
more time ...''
</P>
<P>
   Couric (interrupting): (itals)``Other(unitals) than education.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston: ``What would you suggest?''
</P>
<P>
   Couric: ``I don't know, perhaps greater restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to say which is odder _ the media's conviction,
against all evidence and logic, that ``greater restrictions'' on
gun ownership will protect the public from armed criminals, or
their serene belief that most Americans agree with them.
</P>
<P>
   Would more and stricter gun control laws have an impact?
Absolutely _ on people who obey laws. But they aren't the people
who commit drive-by shootings, rape women at gunpoint, or hold up
convenience stores. (itals)Those(unitals) people will get firearms
no matter how stiff the laws are. They'll steal them, buy them on
the street, transport them illegally across state lines. Violent
felons will always have weapons. The question is whether honest
citizens _ read: potential victims _ will. The one thing more gun
control ensures is less protection for the innocent. Which explains
why cities with hyper-stringent gun regulations are often
hyper-deadly as well.
</P>
<P>
   How does Big Media, with all the money it spends on survey
research, manage to keep missing the fact that its implacable
antigun stance is shared by only a fringe of the American
mainstream? There are guns in half the households in this country.
Civilians own more than 220 million firearms. One-third of those
are handguns. Unlike Katie Couric and The Washington Post
editorialists, Americans don't demonize gun owners. They
(itals)are(unitals) gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't demonize the NRA, either. In April 1997, the
respected John Zogby polling firm put this question to a national
sample of voters: ``If the National Rifle Association were to tell
you that a candidate for Congress was going to work to take away
your right to own a gun, would that make you more likely or less
likely to support that candidate?'' Result: 18.5 percent more
likely, 48.4 percent less likely. Even among Democrats, 44.6
percent would be less likely to vote for a candidate the NRA
disapproved of.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Guns make us safer.
</P>
<P>
   As gun ownership rises, violent crime drops. The more likely
that a victim may be armed, the less likely that he _ or she _ will
be attacked. And when victims are attacked, guns tilt the odds in
their favor. Government data show that women who don't resist when
confronted by an attacker end up seriously hurt 2.5 times more
often than women who resist with a gun. For men, it's 1.4 times
more often.
</P>
<P>
   In an exhaustive marathon of research, University of Chicago Law
School Professor John Lott and economist David Mustard analyzed FBI
crime records from all 3,054 US counties over a 19-year period
(1977-1995). Nothing, they found, had a more decisive impact in
lowering violent crime rates than the adoption of ``shall-issue''
laws _ i.e., laws giving adults with no criminal record the right
to carry concealed handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws are now in force in 31 states. ``Our most conservative
estimates,'' writes Lott, ``show that by adopting shall-issue laws,
states reduced murders by 8.5 percent, rapes by 5 percent,
aggravated assaults by 7 percent, and robbery by 3 percent.'' The
effect is especially pronounced in big cities. ``In counties with
populations of more than 200,000, concealed-handgun laws produced
an average drop in murder rates of more than 13 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Mustard used multiple-regression checks to correct
their data for arrest and conviction rates, for prison sentences,
and for new gun-control laws. The results were unambiguous: More
concealed handguns, and increased gun ownership generally, drives
down murder, robbery, and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has detailed his findings in a new book, ``More Guns, Less
Crime'' (University of Chicago Press). The title tells the story.
Somebody send Katie Couric a copy, please.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   YORK, Maine _ Elizabeth Perkins knew her own mind, and because
she had ample funds, she could have her own way. By the time she
died &UR;  &LR; in 1952 at the age of 83, she was a certifiable grande dame
and all-around local character. She thought nothing of driving her
old Buick &UR;  &LR; across your field if that was the shortest way home.
Mention her name in York and people would collapse in anger or
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Without Perkins, &UR;  &LR; the village called Old York would look
considerably different. She and her family had become summer people
here in 1898, just as the historic preservation movement was
getting under way. Anybody could save a lovely old house or church
and many did; and coastal Maine is famous for its stately homes.
But the always contrary Elizabeth Bishop Perkins (together with her
mother, Mary Sowles Perkins) chose to befriend sad old buildings
that were destined for certain demolition in the name of progress.
They saved the schoolhouse and a tavern. On a hunch, they saved a
shed, its origins all but lost to history. This proved to be the
village jail, and this Old Gaol is, moreover, the oldest surviving
British Colonial public building in America. Thanks to the
Perkinses, Old York is rich in aspects of village life that go
beyond the beautiful and the good.
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that the certifiably ancient
and historic Perkins residence is not all that it appears. True, it
sits on land settled in 1631 and the oldest part of the house may
date from 1686. But enter the house and it's pure 1952. Room after
room is decorated in the oft-despised ``American Colonial Revival''
style. Even if she had lived to know historically correct
restoration, it's by no means certain Elizabeth Perkins would have
wanted to live with it. This was a woman who so loved dotted Swiss
curtains with ball fringe that every window had them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sleuthing out curtains
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty pairs of curtains!'' says an amused Tom Johnson. As
curator of collections for the Old York Historical Society, it was
his job to help with the restoration of Elizabeth Perkins's old
home. Like everybody else, he just assumed he could buy dotted
Swiss at the local Joanne Fabrics. Not so. After many a phone call
to fabric shops, he happened on the William Ginsberg Co., a
manufacturer of fabric trim in New York City. ``They sleuthed it
out for us and located absolutely the last dotted Swiss of that
type in upstate New York and we bought the lot.'' Stashed away in a
Long Island warehouse was the last of the small elegant ball fringe
of Perkins's day. Historic restoration is like that, says Johnson.
``What you think are the easiest things are complicated, and the
complicated things are a snap.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to restore the Perkins house was not easily made.
Other properties maintained by the society are considered more
important historically, among them the John Hancock Warehouse and
Jefferds' Tavern. With more than 30 period rooms and galleries,
some contents dating from 1719, the society did not lack for
outstanding examples of regional furniture, ceramics, glassware,
and paintings. Not just students of Colonial upholstery seek out
the Bulman bed hangings made in York in the 1740s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Colonial restoration
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the Elizabeth Perkins House was something of an
embarrassment can be inferred from the society's decision to
restore it in 1954, two years after her death. Scholars were
beginning to revisit so-called period rooms and toss out all those
inventive ``decorator touches'' that made house museums look
livable _ and worth emulating at home. You can't blame Old York.
Based on what was then known, the 1954 restoration intended to make
the Elizabeth Perkins house more authentically Colonial. And so in
the name of history, the Perkins interiors got a new paint job,
with colors of the Williamsburg persuasion. The rich deep-chocolate
woodwork in her maple sitting room disappeared under a corn yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Williamsburg wasn't the real Elizabeth Perkins and it wasn't
what her house represents in the history of American decorative
art. ``American Colonial Revival'' has its own pedigree. Some
people think of Colonial revival as a village within the Arts &AMP;
Crafts movement and, like it, a reaction to Industrial Age mass
production. Maybe so, but Perkins was not a purist. Funky could be
her middle name. Take the centerpiece on the dining-room table.
Antiques lovers will recognize the big dish as a Chinese Export
blue and white charger. But the four white china swans guarding it?
``Irish Beleek,'' says curator Johnson.

RUSSELL REBALANCING GOOD FOR SOME, BAD FOR OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hundreds of smaller companies riding the dizzying ups and downs
of this year's stock market are about the run into another
complication.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small and midsize stocks is about to
go through its annual ``reconstitution,'' throwing out some
companies and adding others to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for Massachusetts companies like investment
firm Affiliated Managers Group in Boston and upholstry fabric
manufacturer Quaker Fabric Corp. of Fall River that are probably
joining. It's a headache for companies like software company Inso
Corp. of Boston or sneaker-maker Converse Inc. of North Reading
that are likely to fall off the list.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers invest tens of billions of dollars in small
stocks, indexed to the Russell benchmark, just as others invest in
larger stocks to match the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. They will
buy or sell thousands of small-company shares based on changes in
the index.
</P>
<P>
   The same annual reconstitution is also taking place in the
Russell 1000 index, a grouping of the market's 1,000 largest
companies. The Russell 2000 tracks the next 2,000 companies by
size, and the two lists combined make up a third index known as the
Russell 3000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Russell Co., the company that manages the indexes,
announced the preliminary list of stocks that would be added or
subtracted from the combined Russell 3000. That list of
adjustments, revealed last Friday, is subject to modest change and
doesn't provide information about the smaller Russell 1000 or
Russell 2000 indexes.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts estimate nearly 500 stocks will be added to
the Russell 2000 and more than 300 will be deleted in this year's
rebalancing. There are more additions than deletions because some
stocks disappear from the index in the course of a year due to
mergers and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Investment managers are much more interested in those stocks
than changes in the big-stock Russell 1000. The smaller stocks tend
to be much less liquid, and big swings in investor interest will
have more dramatic effects on prices, moving up or down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more money following the Russell 2000 in proportion to
their market capitalization,'' said Arlene Rockefeller, a principal
at State Street Global Advisors, which manages more than $15
billion in various Russell indexes.
</P>
<P>
   A study by ITG Research found that stocks added to the Russell
2000 outperformed those eliminated from the index by 18 percent
during a two-month period around the time of last year's index
rebalancing. It was the fourth straight year ITG Reserach had
measured the effect, which has become more pronounced each year.
The studies give all the stocks equal weighting and the performance
gap usually evens out over time.
</P>
<P>
   But money managers following the index can't wait for
small-stock prices to settle down over a period of months, so they
begin to buy and sell now based on Russell's list of preliminary
changes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rockefeller and others said, prices of those stocks
will move up or down between now and June 30, when final Russell
index lists will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   A warning to investors looking to make a quick score buying
expected Russell additions now or shorting stocks to be elminated:
it's a dangerous game.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price advances and declines are uneven and don't
happen in every instance, said Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to look at the entire group of stocks and it
continues all the way through June,'' she said. ``You wouldn't see
the full impact yet, but prices have already started to move.''
</P>
<P>
   We sampled a handful of local stocks and could not find any
clear pattern. Brookline Bancorp., which is expected to be added to
the Russell 2000, finished at 15 1/2 Wednesday, slightly lower than
its price before the preliminary good news was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Videoserver Inc. of Burlington, a tentative deletion
from the Russell list, has actually gained a sliver of value since
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Maybe research scientist Changnian Liu should have stayed in the
lab.
</P>
<P>
   The US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Liu with
insider trading Wednesday, allegations stemming from the 1996
purchase of stock in his former employer, Immunogen Inc. of
Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Liu was a lead author of a paper documenting a new Immunogen
drug's ability to eradicate human colon tumors grown in mice, work
that was published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Liu bought 30,000 shares of Immunogen a week before the
scheduled appearance of the article. Publication sent Immunogen
stock soaring by 65 percent
</P>
<P>
   Liu has agreed to disgorge $41,700 of trading profits, a civil
penalty of $41,700, and interest payments of $6,653, the SEC said.

BOTANY PROFESSOR, DAY LILY AN ITEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny thing happened to James Brennan on his career path: A
passing research acquaintance blossomed into full romance.
</P>
<P>
   Not his wife, with whom he raised seven children, leading to 17
grandchildren, but day lilies.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, a professor of botany at Bridgewater (Mass.) State
College, over the course of a long career has gone from looking at
day lilies as a convenient research subject to serving as president
of the American Hemerocallis Society. His seduction by the
ubiquitous plant _ I grow it, you grow it, we all grow it _
redefined his career and his life, and next, with Brennan
contemplating retiring in December 1999, day lilies may light his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, four years out of graduate school at Virginia Tech and
the University of Maryland, from which he received a doctorate in
plant morphology, Brennan was looking for a research interest. He
had chosen to teach at Bridgewater State College because it was
about to construct a new science building and intended to stock it
with research equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At an institute in Tennessee that summer, Brennan found that
interest on a side trip to a botanic garden that was holding a day
lily exhibition. ``I was intrigued by the form and color of these
members of the lily family, and I knew at first glance that there
was great potential for this plant as the subject of a research
program,'' he wrote in the Bridgewater Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are easily propagated, Hemerocallis species would
be perfect for research. Brennan bought his first three plants that
summer; he still has them, somewhere. But his research plans did
not work out. Budget cuts meant Bridgewater State would not get the
X-ray unit he counted on, and he switched to research with members
of the genus Tradescantia. (Many of these are houseplants, and
outdoors, spiderwort, T. virginiana, is a wonderful plant; my rubra
cultivar is now in bloom under an ornamental plum.)
</P>
<P>
   Brennan explored the development of plant cell shapes, aided
largely by the college's purchase of an electron microscope,
treating tiny hairs on Tradescantia with various chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years passed. Then his wife introduced him to Tranquil
Lake Nursery in Rehoboth. This is an outstanding source of day
lilies. ``My wife started going over there, and I went a few times
and got bitten by the day lily bug,'' he told me recently.
</P>
<P>
   He switched his research to day lily structures, particularly
those involving color. Chloroplasts inside interior cells were
loaded with fat-soluble anthocyanins providing yellow and orange
colors. Cells nearer the surface contained water-soluble red,
lavender, and purple pigments.
</P>
<P>
   He also began breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan was captivated by the shapes and colors and forms of
these plants (each flower really does bloom for but a day). ``Man,
there's everything out there except blue, but I gave up trying to
hybridize for blue,'' he said. He doubts there will ever be a blue
day lily.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's been breeding for browns. He is intrigued by
chocolate brown flowers. His love of research and love of day
lilies combined, and in the pursuit of brown flowers, he discovered
something unexpected: brown, crystalline globs inside the surface
cells of brown petals. Holding concentrated purple pigments, these
have been the subject of much research by Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Brennan received membership in the American
Hemerocallis Society as a birthday present. His involvement has
grown steadily. Now, as president, he finds himself strapped for
time, between research, teaching, growing and breeding day lilies,
and the demands of the society.
</P>
<P>
   He recently returned from the group's annual convention in
Louisiana. He was enthused, which seems to be Brennan's normal
state, about the plants he saw down South. ``We grow what are
called dormants here, and they grow evergreens, and here they lose
their leaves.'' Brennan has a microclimate in his yard that allows
him to grow some semi-evergreen day lilies.
</P>
<P>
   The society, which functions as the international naming
authority for day lilies, has 11,000 members. ``There's everyone
from little old lady gardeners to big hybridizers to PhDs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps Brennan occupied. There are 15 regions. In July, he
goes to the regional meeting on Long Island. Aug. 29 brings the
annual plant sale at the University of Massachusetts field station
in Waltham, ``and it's a biggie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the national convention will be held in Newton, and
that will showcase local day lily breeders and marketers. One of
those is Brennan. ``I've registered five or six,'' he said, adding
that ``there's some 40,000 registered cultivars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bee Gee,'' ``Carnival Lady,'' ``Grandma Jean,'' ``Hee Hee''
and ``Sturdy Son'' are Brennan developments being sold by Greene
Acre Sales, a small nursery at owner Steve Green's Sudbury home.
``He's a schoolteacher up there,'' Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan loves the variety and growth in popularity of day
lilies, though he is bothered that some cultivars cost $150. His go
for $7.50 to $25. He jokes about how they are not selling, but they
are beautiful. ``Sturdy Son'' stands 34 inches tall and has dark
ruby red flowers 6 inches in diameter. ``Bee Gee'' is 32 inches
tall with 6-inch flowers in soft pink and light vein lines running
through delicately pinched petals.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan talks dreamily of journeying to Sakhalin Island, a
Russian property near Japan, to view some rare day lilies. He
refers to being at the close of his career, but he brims with
energy for continued research and grows excited at the prospect of
the 2001 convention.
</P>
<P>
   And will that convention show off the culinary delights of day
lilies (they are tasty raw and sautee well)?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Brennan cried. ``That's cannibalism.''

EXPERTS PONDER CONVICTED AU PAIR'S RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Louise Woodward, convicted in the killing of
eight-month-old Matthew Eappen, likely is free to cash in on her
notoriety, but the Eappen family also has a good legal basis to
seize any money their former au pair might get for telling her
story, attorneys said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Woodward traveled home to England Wednesday, US District
Court Judge William G. Young issued a temporary order requiring
her, and those who represent her, to notify the court and Eappen
family attorneys if she signs a contract to earn money from her
story. Young also ordered Woodward not to spend any money she might
get under any such arrangement with a United States firm for at
least 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Young said he would review First Amendment law and also the
only case in Massachusetts where the issue of a criminal profiting
from a crime was addressed by the Supreme Judicial Court. The SJC
ruled that Katherine A. Power, who admitted participating in a bank
robbery and the murder of a Boston police officer in 1970, was
properly banned by a judge from making money from her crime. The
judge made the ban a condition of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Most people interviewed in downtown Boston Wednesday said they
wouldn't support a book on the trial, and that Woodward shouldn't
make money from one. But Eliza N. Coady of Allston said she thinks
it would receive wide support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tabloid story,'' the 18-year-old office assistant said.
``It's like slowing down to see a car accident ... It's one of
those things where a lot of people will say that they won't read
it, but when it comes out, it's a best-seller.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys who specialize in First Amendment law split on whether
Woodward can successfully argue that Young's order is a violation
of her constitutional rights, which are protected in American
courts.
</P>
<P>
   John ``Ike'' Williams, of Palmer&AMP;Dodge, said that the last time
the US Supreme Court looked at the issue, it ruled that a New York
State law, known as the ``Son of Sam'' law, was unconstitutional.
The 1991 decision made it clear that a criminal cannot
automatically be barred from profiting by telling his or her story,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Power case, the SJC ruled that she could be kept from
profiting as a condition of her probation after she pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the death of Officer Walter Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Young's order ``tiptoed'' between those two legal standards,
said Williams, who added that he believed the First Amendment could
derail any legal limitation on Woodward's financial benefit from
her notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a real chilling effect on speech,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jon Albano, a First Amendment lawyer with Bingham,
Dana&AMP;Gould who also represents the Globe, said that his reading of
the same cases leads him to a different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Eappens are only seeking money Woodward would earn
from signing a contract, they are not blocking her from exercising
her First Amendment right to free speech, he said. Moreover, since
the Eappens have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit, courts routinely
put financial strings on defendants to ensure any judgment is
eventually paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you happen to be an author, and they happen to want to
collect a debt from money you've made from your writing, then I
really don't see that raising any First Amendment concern,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Son of Sam'' law was dangerously overbroad and banned all
criminals from profiting, Albano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say that anybody convicted of a crime can't write books
and make money from their experiences, then people like Martin
Luther King, who gets convicted of civil disobedience, is subject
to that statute,'' Albano said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Woodward flew back to England Wednesday, attorneys said
the wrongful-death suit could follow in her wake. They also said
that while she does not have to be in federal court on Oct. 1, when
the trial is now scheduled to begin, from a legal strategy
standpoint, it would wise for her to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys say jurors in the civil case might look upon her
absence negatively, as if she doesn't care about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Greco, a Boston attorney with Hill and Barlow, said
nations extend ``comity'' to each other under which a judgment from
one country can be enforced in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are vast differences among foreign countries,'' Greco
said, ``but England is pretty much easier because of the same
Anglo-American legal tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``it's not a slam dunk'' that the Eappens
would be able to convince an English court to back up any judgment
if a jury concludes they deserve money in their wrongful-death
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court there could again look at the facts leading up to
the entry of a judgment and could find ways to refuse to honor the
judgment on some basis,'' Greco said.

SACCO, VANZETTI ORDEAL HAUNTS LONGTIME ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Rev. Donald G. Lothrop looked back on a life of 92
years Wednesday, one regret stands out. On Aug. 29, 1927, six days
after Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were electrocuted, a
funeral honoring the pair and decrying the trial that had convicted
them passed through the North End of Boston. And Lothrop was not
among the thousands of mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a college kid, I suppose I didn't know any better. But
it would have been right to be there,'' recalled Lothrop, who would
later become the pastor of the Community Church of Boston and an
ardent player in the effort after the fact to find out whether
justice played fair in the trial of the Italian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The procession was to Forest Hills and the cemetery that had
agreed to cremate the remains of controversy, but wasn't bold
enough to bury the ashes. A young man from Lexington wasn't there,
and he has held the grudge against himself for the past 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the passion Donald G. Lothrop still holds, indeed
nurtures, for what many consider the mistrial of Sacco and
Vanzetti, convicted in 1923 for a pair of murders during an armed
robbery. To this day, many defenders claim that the only ``crimes''
committed by Sacco and Vanzetti, whose alibis placed them far from
the robbery, were being immigrants and avowed anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Wednesday, Lothrop drove down from his farm in Alna, Maine,
(``got passed by just about everything except the toll booths'') to
participate in a symposium about the Sacco-Vanzetti trial. Held at
the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, the
symposium was slated to follow a sceening of Court TV's newest
documentary on Sacco and Vanzetti. Other scheduled participants
included former governor Michael S. Dukakis and Judge Peter Agnes,
First Justice of Charlestown District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted and executed for the 1920
murders of a paymaster and his guard in Braintree. Citizens from
all walks of life joined in a protest about the way the trial was
handled for the men, who were politically controversial because of
their anarchistic views and support of labor.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help when Judge Webster Thayer was quoted outside the
Dedham courtroom saying, ``Did you see what I did with those
anarchistic bastards the other day?''
</P>
<P>
   Lothrop vaguely recalls the arrests, but as the trial got under
way in the spring of 1923, the young Lothrop, son of a florist, was
preparing to begin college at Tufts, paying his tuition with
earnings from road construction jobs. At Tufts he studied under the
late Clarence Skinner, a theologian and 1920 founder of the
Community Church of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The church, based in Copley Square, still exists, but in its
formative days decades ago it would fill such places as Symphony
Hall with speeches calling for tolerance _ often tolerance for
political causes veering sharply left of center.
</P>
<P>
   When Lothrop served as minister from 1936 to 1973, for example,
he made Globe headlines for opposing the Spanish regime of General
Francisco Franco, and much later, for getting punched by Cuban
exiles for allowing an advocate of Fidel Castro to speak at his
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sometimes isn't easy standing firm for what you believe,''
Lothrop explained Wednesday, seated in a Holiday Inn room which he
almost couldn't enter because of the ``new-fangled entry cards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to keys?'' he asked, unpacking belongings
from a battered leather suitcase that had traveled to Poland a
half-century ago with his late wife, Helena.
</P>
<P>
   It was at college under Skinner's tutelage that Lothrop became
aware of a nation polarized by the Sacco and Vanzetti trial. After
the executions, when Lothrop took over the Community Church, he met
one Aldino Felicani, a printer in the North End whom Lothrop paid
to produce weekly church bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   Felicani, he would learn, had led the fund-raising efforts to
defend Sacco and Vanzetti, and would become a frequent speaker at
the weekly Wednesday night church dinners hosted by Lothrop.
</P>
<P>
   Another church member was one Sara Ehrmann, whose husband,
Herbert, attempted, but failed, to get Sacco and Vanzetti a new
trial. Herbert Ehrmann dug up a sales receipt that placed one of
the defendants in Plymouth buying eels at the time of the murders,
Lothrop said. Another member was Tom O'Connor, a reporter who
unearthed evidence indicating that some eyewitness testimony was
withheld from the trial by the prosecution, Lothrop said.
</P>
<P>
   These men would all be frequent speakers at Lothrop's church _
and when they died, the last in the late 1970s, Lothrop gave their
eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, following the electrocutions, Gutzon Borglum, a
sculptor best known for his carvings on Mount Rushmore, created a
bas relief of Sacco and Vanzetti that took 50 years for Boston to
accept. But last August, Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced that the
piece will be installed in a yet-to-be announced location in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture will be cast from an aluminum copy that sits in
the Boston Community Church, according to Carol Adams, a church
spokeswoman. And the fact that the church has a copy of the Borglum
sculpture suitable for reproduction, she added, is thanks to the
Rev. Donald G. Lothrop.

<P>
   Contemplating world hunger from the vantage point of a
well-laden breakfast table is certainly comfortable, if odd.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last January, executives of Iowa-based Pioneer
Hi-Bred International, the ``world's largest developer, producer
and marketer of genetically improved seed,'' gathered at a cafe in
downtown Manhattan for a discussion about global food security.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we're in is ensuring that the world has the
capacity to have the food it needs to survive,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer makes some of its seeds conventionally, by creating
hybrids. Back in the 1920s, though, the conventional was radical,
and the typical farmer looked upon the newfangled seeds, in
Johnson's words, as ``witchcraft and Satanism _ until he got his
first taste of the yield.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's vice president for marketing, Mary McBride, then
chimed in, claiming that these ``transgenic'' crops have the power
to increase food production in the developing world with minimal
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, as McBride put it, is creating ``virtual acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments _ including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
</P>
<P>
   Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Crops engineered to carry Bt-toxin genes might trigger the
evolution of ever adaptive Bt-resistant bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Genes in one population of plants (crops, for example) can thus
seep into another population (neighboring weeds).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
</P>
<P>
   One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this possibility hinged on how likely it was for crops and
weeds to hybridize, and for the transgenic genes to establish
themselves in the wild population.
</P>
<P>
   Ellstrand decided therefore to measure the likelihood, and in
1996 he reported that domesticated sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, could
readily form hybrids with a weed called Johnsongrass, Sorghum
halepense.
</P>
<P>
   (Domesticated crops are often surrounded by their close weedy
relatives, since both flourish under the same conditions.)
</P>
<P>
   Using harmless gene markers rather than actual transgenes,
Ellstrand found that wind-carried pollen could create hybrid seeds
over 300 feet away from the original crop.
</P>
<P>
   These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments with actual transgenic crops also show
that inserted genes can move between species.
</P>
<P>
   Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these results, Jorgensen and others remain sanguine
about the prospects of transgenic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put in genes that give the plant itself a better
resistance, for instance, to fungal pathogens or to insect pests,
then you can minimize your use of pesticides, and that would be
beneficial to the environment,'' Jorgensen says. And she believes
that as long as transgenic oilseed rape is carefully managed, it
can be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray very early, before the campestris flowers, you
minimize its potential to hybridize,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what you'll have is Brassica campestris plants with
multiresistance in very few generations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech companies, since they make the herbicides, don't
see it as a big problem, because it forces them to make a new
herbicide,'' says botanist Hugh Wilson of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no weeds related to maize in Europe,'' says French
cytogeneticist Anne-Marie Chevre of the national Institute of
Agronomic Research at Le Rheu. ``But we have a lot of wild species
more or less related to oilseed rape in the field everywhere.''
Therefore France has permitted transgenic corn to be grown on its
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
</P>
<P>
   And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows _ maybe those witchcraft and Satanism theories are
indeed wrong ...

over 300 feet away from the original crop.
</P>
<P>
   These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments with actual transgenic crops also show
that inserted genes can move between species.
</P>
<P>
   Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these results, Jorgensen and others remain sanguine
about the prospects of transgenic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put in genes that give the plant itself a better
resistance, for instance, to fungal pathogens or to insect pests,
then you can minimize your use of pesticides, and that would be
beneficial to the environment,'' Jorgensen says. And she believes
that as long as transgenic oilseed rape is carefully managed, it
can be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray very early, before the campestris flowers, you
minimize its potential to hybridize,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what you'll have is Brassica campestris plants with
multiresistance in very few generations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech companies, since they make the herbicides, don't
see it as a big problem, because it forces them to make a new
herbicide,'' says botanist Hugh Wilson of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no weeds related to maize in Europe,'' says French
cytogeneticist Anne-Marie Chevre of the national Institute of
Agronomic Research at Le Rheu. ``But we have a lot of wild species
more or less related to oilseed rape in the field everywhere.''
Therefore France has permitted transgenic corn to be grown on its
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
</P>
<P>
   And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows _ maybe those witchcraft and Satanism theories are
indeed wrong ...

   The night sky seldom offers a ``first'' _ an event never before
seen, even by the most grizzled observer.
</P>
<P>
   This past January featured one of those rare spectacles, when
the asteroid-observing spacecraft NEAR became the first
interplanetary craft visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four decades, some 7,000 satellites have been
launched into orbit around Earth. They deliver weather images,
monitor ground resources, provide telecommunications and
navigational aid.
</P>
<P>
   More often they're used by the military _ to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
</P>
<P>
   Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest satellites orbit Earth in 90 minutes and take nine
minutes to cross the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites sometimes appear to zigzag, but that's an optical
illusion resulting from imperceptible eye-muscle movements.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous _ the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumling. And if they're tumbling _ and most do _ they're
no longer functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this space junk was always junk. Last October we passed
the 40th anniversary of the first shiny, useless, basketball-size
artificial satellite, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Today over 22,000 pieces of unrecyclable debris clutter the
skies, garbage masquerading as fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help tracking the major satellites, the Web site
http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/spacecraft.html
provides current passages.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Moby Dick started to founder, Tom Sheridan, a 68-year-old
MIT professor on vacation with his wife, grabbed the boat's rail as
dishes began crashing down and passengers started screaming.
</P>
<P>
   It took only three seconds for the 70-foot Ecuadorian boat,
chartered by Boston-based Elderhostel, to capsize last Wednesday,
plunging 15 American vacationers and eight crew members into the
seas of the Galapagos archipelago, 600 miles off the coast of South
America.
</P>
<P>
   In the three hours that followed, two passengers died. Two
others remain missing, and one is recovering from severe injuries.
The surviving 11 passengers and eight crew members clung to a
dinghy, rafts, or life rings as waves crested 15 feet over their
heads and currents pulled them apart. An investigation as to the
exact cause of the accident is underway. ``All of a sudden, an
exceptionally big swell picked our boat up and tilted it on its
side,'' recalls Mary Jo Cannarella, 62, of Nashua, N.H., one of
four New Englanders on the Moby Dick. ``We expected it to right
itself, but it didn't. It hung on the balance at a 30-degree angle,
and another wave gave it a push and knocked it over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The water was rising very, very fast,'' she added. ``I knew I
had to get out of the (cabin), or I would be trapped and drown. In
the first few moments, I was thinking `This can't be real.' Yet I
was swimming for my life. Then as I was clinging to the ring buoy,
I thought, `This might be my moment of death.' However, I didn't
give up my determination at any moment. I had a brief thought about
sharks, but I didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster occurred in the early evening of the third day of a
seven-day cruise of the Miami-built ship's maiden voyage, shortly
after the tourists set sail under a double rainbow bound from
Espanola (Hood) Island to Puerto Ayora. Out of sight of land,
amidst scattered islands famed for their unique plants and animals,
cocaptains Carlos and Freddy Penaherrera, natives of the Galapagos
with 26 combined years of sea experience, were trying to control
the vessel in unexpectedly heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers weren't especially concerned. Most were engaged in
recreational activities when the boat ran into trouble, survivors
recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were heavy swells,'' Cannarella says. ``The captain was
going at a slower pace than usual, but he wasn't having problems
navigating. We were assured that this was quite normal for that
part of the channel. Other than a few people being seasick,
everything was going along okay. We weren't worried.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Freddy Penaherrera: ``A large wave lifted the rear
of the yacht, the bow dove steeply, just as a gust of wind caught
the vessel broadside, knocking it partly over. Then a second wave
hit, knocking it down completely. Furniture and people were tossed
about inside and outside the vessel. In just a few seconds, our
boat was sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 15 minutes before the vessel was completely submerged,
the crew worked frantically to free as much lifesaving equipment as
possible. Passengers thrown into the sea were yelling to find each
other in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan and his wife, Rachel, 70, had been on the bow area of
the second deck talking with Joe Cannarella, 64, Mary Jo's husband.
After the boat tipped, the three were dragged under the hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept trying to surface, but our heads kept striking the
hull, then the boat passed over us and we emerged at the stern,''
Sheridan says. ``Joe's arm was lacerated by the propeller as it
went by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew across the lounge,'' says Mary Jo Cannarella, who was
inside the boat when it tipped over. ``Within three breaths, the
water was up to my neck. Five breaths and it was over my head. I
refused to die and rammed my head repeatedly against the glass
window now above me. The window popped and I scrambled through to
the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Martha Brooks of Corvallis, Ore., who is
nearly blind, followed the light through the now open window,
escaping to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Brewer of Florida found herself pinned by furniture and a
window. ``Until the water reached my nose, I was yelling to others
not to panic. Then the water went over my head. The man pinned next
to me was dead, but I felt it wasn't my time to die. I heard the
glass shatter, felt I had a chance, wriggled under the furniture,
found a hole in the glass, and I was free. At the age of 70, I held
my breath for more than two minutes for the first time in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was the last out of the boat alive.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside, Mary Jo Cannarella said: ``Five of us were
clinging to that one ring buoy. One person was trying to climb up
on it and kept pulling us under water. We could have died on that
small ring. Then two of the women caught a glimpse of a dinghy and
decided to swim for it to save the rest of us. Amazingly, they made
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others drifted and swam to join us,'' she added. ``Then
Richard Sayer, who couldn't find his wife, said, `I'll go. I'm
ready to go.' We said, `No, hold on,' but he said `good-bye,' let
go, and went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Drifting about half a mile away, the Sheridans and Joe
Cannarella managed to make it to what became a small flotilla of
life rafts tied to a dinghy. Passengers and crew huddled together.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, those in the dinghy spotted a small boat in
the distance and fired two flares. The boat didn't respond. Soon
after, a larger boat, the Angelino II, appeared on the horizon. It
had spotted the flares.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Cannarella, Vera Brower, and the others on the buoy ring
also saw the boat responding, but realized they could easily be
overlooked. They gathered strength to paddle directly into the path
of the oncoming ship.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean seas were rough. Johnny Fong, 24, a crew member aboard
the Angelito II, jumped in and swam out wearing a life vest and
carrying a ring attached by a rope to his vessel. One by one, he
accompanied each passenger as they were towed to the boat and
hoisted in, taking 20 minutes for each rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors arrived at Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz, at 2 a.m.,
more than seven hours after the Moby Dick sank. The entire village
turned out to take them to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Sheridan rushed to contact her four children and her
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, those well enough to travel flew home, the
Cannarellas and the Sheridans taking the same plane to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Neither couple blames Elderhostel, which sends 33,000 older
travelers overseas every year. This was the travel agency's first
fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Cannarellas have already planned another trip. Their
destination: the Galapagos Islands. Says Mary Jo, ``We definitely
want to go back again and finish what we started.''
</P>

in Ecuador at the time of the accident, contributed to this

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Seekh kabobs, made with a mix of ground beef and
spices, and nan, a flat bread, are common Pakistani dishes. The
spices are available at Indian and Pakistani stores.
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes, courtesy of Suraiya and Sabir Siddiqui's
Siddiqui Kitchen, which caters mainly to the Pakistani and Indian
communities in the Albany area:

<P>
   Two pounds lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   Two tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   One medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   One tablespoon, garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   One tablespoon fresh ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   One tablespoon crushed, unripened papaya or meat tenderizer
</P>
<P>
   One-half bunch chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Two green peppers, chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup gram flour (chickpea flour)
</P>
<P>
   One tablespoon cumin powder
</P>
<P>
   One tablespoon poppy seeds
</P>
<P>
   One teaspoon garam masala (allspice)
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   One teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Two tablespoons plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   One teaspoon mace powder
</P>
<P>
   One teaspoon nutmeg powder
</P>
<P>
   In a frying pan, roast the gram flour over low heat for about
three to five minutes, or until you can smell the flour's aroma.
Similarly, roast the cumin powder.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef and remaining
ingredients and mix well with your hands. Cover and refrigerate for
three to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 or preheat the grill. Brush skewers with
oil. Shape ground beef mixture into small balls, then spread evenly
on the skewers to form kabobs. Bake or grill for about 10 to 15
minutes, lightly brushing with oil every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NAN
</P>
<P>
   (Makes 15, serving 10 to 12 people)
</P>
<P>
   One packet of yeast
</P>
<P>
   One cup unbleached, all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Two and one-half pounds unbleached, all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup vegetable shortening, melted
</P>
<P>
   Two eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarter cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   Two or three crushed green cardamom pods
</P>
<P>
   Two drops kewra essence
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, dilute the rest with the warm water. Mix in one cup
of flour until a paste forms. Cover and store overnight at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, add the remaining ingredients, except the flour,
into the paste and mix with an electric mixer. Slowly sift in the
flour and mix.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dough onto a working surface and knead for about 10
minutes or until smooth. If the dough appears tough, add a little
milk to maintain a soft consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Place dough in a large bowl, cover and let stand for three hours
until dough rises. Preheat the oven to 500. Once the dough has
doubled in size, knead it again.
</P>
<P>
   Shape dough into small balls, about the size of your palm,
keeping the dough covered while you work to prevent it from drying.
Roll each ball out to about 6 to 8 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Place nan on a greased baking sheet and pierce, multiple times,
with a fork. Bake about five to seven minutes on the top rack.
Spread unsalted butter on each side of nan as you take each from
the oven.

NOT IN THE CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG BAILEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite signs that Apple Computer Inc. is making a comeback _
analysts suggest the company will grow faster in the next nine
months than it has in the past two years _ software developers are
still wary about supporting the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the evidence is anecdo-tal: A sales rep at an Oregon
company called Mentor Plus, which makes the only flight planning
software available for the Mac, advised me last week to buy the
Windows version because his company may soon abandon the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Other instances prove to be temporary: Intuit Inc., maker of the
best-selling Quicken financial management package, said earlier
this year it would no longer support the Mac, but reversed itself
within days after Apple revealed its new retail strategy, which
included bundling Quicken on its new computers.
</P>
<P>
   As Apple fans, we've learned to live with the uncertainty about
the future of our software. But it's infuriating when the company
folding the tent on Apple products is Apple itself.
</P>
<P>
   I've written before about the strange saga of the Apple PC
Compatibility Card, a plug-in device that puts a Pentium processor
under the Apple hood, allowing you to switch between operating
systems. Apple unveiled the card not too long ago, saying it was
100 percent compatible with Windows 95. But the card, which cost
about $900, could barely run Windows 95 and then could only run
about half of the programs written for it. The problem was it came
with 16-bit drivers that did not support many of the new features
in Windows 95, including long file names. Compared with
compatibility software solutions made by Connectix Corp. (Virtual
PC) and Insignia Co. (SoftWindows), Apple's expensive hardware
device was only marginally better in some areas and much worse in
others.
</P>
<P>
   When card owners complained, Apple hinted it would update the
card with 32-bit drivers. But suddenly, late last year, Apple
abandoned support for the card altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Mark Fonnemann, a Boston College student who, like me, was
stuck with a barely usable PC card for his Mac. Fonnemann started
an Internet campaign to reverse Apple's decision. Failing that, he
tried for months to persuade another company, Orange Micro Inc.,
which also makes PC compatibility cards for the Mac, to produce
32-bit drivers for the Apple card.
</P>
<P>
   Fonnemann, with the help of thousands of Mac users stuck in a
similar situation, almost succeeded. Orange agreed to help rescue
buyers of Apple's card but needed cooperation from Apple to get at
its proprietary software code. Apple refused.
</P>
<P>
   The story doesn't end there, though. Orange last week released a
new 32-bit version of its PC compatibility card and offered it to
owners of the Apple cards for just $399 (the product lists for
$549). By offering the new card, Orange believes Apple card owners
will be able to salvage some of their original investment _ the
Windows 95 operating system ($129) and possibly the extra RAM
bought for the card. However, Orange's card comes with just 16
megabytes of the new SDRAM, just barely enough to run Windows 95
plus some other programs. Adding more SDRAM will bring the price of
the card into the $500 to $800 range.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the response to Orange's program, which lasts
until August, has been so overwhelming the company was unable to
send me a card for evaluation in time for this column. But
Fonnemann has one and his review, along with his lengthy
correspondence with Apple and Orange, can be viewed on his Web site
at www2.bc.edu/(tilde)fonneman/apple.html.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, anyone want to buy an Apple PC Compatibility
card? Cheap.

KIND OF BLAH? TRY SOME BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is it: The end of another school year.
</P>
<P>
   On this dreaded occasion, parents annually go crazy with the
anticipation of filling the hours of each day between now and
September when relief comes up the road in the form of a yellow
bus. The bellowing begins immediately, with kids constantly
screaming, ``I'm bored. There's nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To assist in dealing with these little ... (I'm sorry. I
apologize for the momentary brain-lock that caused me to start
typing the truth) who sit around and eat so much junk they will
resemble Monica Lewinsky by July 4, allow me to present a novel
idea: No pun intended, but how about buying a bunch of books and
have your kids read, say, two per month, and then, perhaps, pay
them to provide you with an oral or written report.
</P>
<P>
   I mean it beats buying a gun and having them clip half the kids
they go to camp with, doesn't it? Plus, they might actually enjoy
it _ reading, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   You might start with ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' by Harper Lee.
This is a story that stands up to time.
</P>
<P>
   Add ``The Big Sleep,'' by Raymond Chandler to the list. It's a
detective tale set years ago, yet it holds up well. No swears. No
sex.
</P>
<P>
   And you cannot go wrong with ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' by John
Steinbeck. One of America's all-time great novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoeless Joe'' and ``The Thrill of Grass,'' both by W. P.
Kinsella, ``The Great Escape,'' by Paul Brickhill, ``A Night to
Remember,'' by Walter Lord and ``The Golden Compass,'' by Philip
Pullman and you'll actually have enough time as parents to sit down
and read something yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Freedomland,'' by Richard Price. This is positively one
of the best books of the decade, never mind the year. It is an
incredible trip to places few ever see; existence in a housing
project where expectations never exceed the boundaries of a sunset,
where a catastrophic lie takes on a life all its own and comes to
define a whole culture invisible to so many outside the brick
buildings where hope is a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to Hunt,'' by Stephen Hunter. The man can tell a story.
He's done it before with ``Black Light'' and ``Point of Impact''
and he's done it again here with a book that will give you a
sunburn because you won't leave the beach until the very last page.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Monk Swimming,'' by Malachy McCourt. He's Frank's brother,
part of ``Angela's Ashes,'' and he's brought us his own
recollections but you might want to give Malachy's work a good
leaving alone unless you're willing to have others gawk at you as
you laugh out loud at the world he offers up as well as the life he
has lived, loaded down with fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead,'' by Joe Connelly. It is amazing that a
guy who drove an ambulance for a living can write as well as
Connelly. He could make an accident report read like a song. This
is a terrific piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Children,'' by David Halberstam. Perhaps the finest
reporter in the country, Halberstam takes you on a trip back to the
origins of the civil rights movement and re-introduces readers to
the true best and brightest among us: the children who changed a
whole culture, an entire nation, our politics and the life we lead
today with the simple steps forward taken when much of society cast
a blind eye on a vicious inequity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Prayer for the City,'' by Buzz Bissinger. There has never
been a better portrait of how a big city _ Philadelphia _ functions
and how one mayor _ Ed Rendell _ operates to push, pull and prod
the cement of bureaucracy as well as the souls of individual
citizens toward a better place. This is actually more of a novel
than it is current history, filled with insight and anecdotes that
make you feel good about politics and people, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkansas Mischief,'' by Curtis Wilkie. This is Jim McDougal's
amazing story about the guy who sits this morning in the White
House and when you read it all you can think is: Bill Clinton is
actually Joey Buttafucco with a Yale diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Official Negligence,'' by Lou Cannon. Don't buy this book if
you think the LAPD was entirely at fault for the beating of Rodney
King. Cannon presents the truth and it is not a pretty picture for
those with pre-set minds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for fun, go get these paperbacks: ``Reading in the Dark,''
by Seamus Deane, a novel about Ireland. ``An Albany Trio,'' by the
great William Kennedy. ``Wait Till Next Year,'' by Doris Kearns
Goodwin. ``The Congressman Who Loved Flaubert,'' by Ward Just.
``Winter's Tale,'' by Mark Helprin. ``Compulsion,'' by Myer Levin
and ``Nobody's Angel,'' by Tom McGuane.
</P>
<P>
   Call me Labor Day. Let me know how things worked out.

THE PEOPLE SPEAK, WITH GOOD IDEAS AND PIZAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People are wonderful. People are funny. Some people are
critical, usually in a friendly manner. People are helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Why this rhapsody about people? Because the people referred to
are readers who respond to the handyman's column that pontificates
about all things bright and beautiful around the house.
</P>
<P>
   We recently wrote about new products that manufacturers send in
the hopes of some free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the free publicity (as if they need it!) goes to
those readers who respond to the handyman with their own ideas.
They are very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Driveway sealing
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with driveway sealers. The handyman wrote recently
that driveway sealing was mostly cosmetic, and that you can't make
a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
</P>
<P>
   One brickbat came in by return mail.
</P>
<P>
   George E. Mariani Jr., executive vice president of the E.A.
Mariani Asphalt Co. of Tampa, Fla., begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of over simplification, asphalt pavements lose
their strengh and flexibility as the asphalt binder (the glue that
holds the rock together) ages. The aging process accelerates in the
presence of sunlight and moisture. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper application of maintenance techniques (sealing) can
extend the service life of the pavement by at least 50 percent and
typically much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. I will concede the point that sealing is good in
southern climates, where the sunlight and moisture are more intense
than in northern climes, and I appreciate the observations. I will
also observe that Mariani sells asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Another letter on sealing, but this one is not a brickbat:
Nicholas Ratti Jr. of Bristol, R.I. did some research:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sealing may extend life. The range of many `promises' I
received is 25 to 33 percent. I've personally received no promise
of double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise is always stated to be contingent on the sealer
being reapplied no less often than every three years, and this
routine must begin before the pavement is one year old, or any
promise is void.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost is about 15 percent of the cost of repaving. If done
every three years, it adds 5 percent to the cost of pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do the math yourself to see that it probably is not
cost effective. ... My unsealed driveway is 22 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes a ball game!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; More about mildew &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mildew is old hat to many people, but one reader had a problem
of some green stuff, like dusty green spots, that appeared on his
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Jack Forbes of Wakefield: ``It sounds similar to something
I had. A trip to the libary suggested this: Mildew can also occur
in a green and _ rarely _ a reddish hue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dealt with the problem with a one-to-three bleach-to-water
mixture, plus more ventilation, and the problem has not returned in
a good five years.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Mike Davis of Roslindale, Mass.: ``I suggest it is mold,
as on bread. Source: probably shoes brought it in. A mild bleach
solution brushed on might stop it. Try it in the closet first so
not to fade the rug.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Warped doors
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a reader asked how to straighten out warped French doors,
she mentioned that the makers of the doors, the Atrium Door Co.,
had gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, wrote Joel Kessel of Lynn (Mass.) Lumber. ``We are the
Boston supplier for Atrium. We stock screens, track, weatherstrip,
and hardware for this brand. We can also get old style panels.''
</P>
<P>
   The handyman should have known that Lynn Lumber is one of the
last bastions of the super lumber store that carry a vast inventory
of unusual things.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Galloping windows
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reader told the handyman that when he replaced the ropes in
his weight-balanced window, using the original weights, everything
worked except that the bottom sash dropped down after it was
raised. What's wrong, he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman offered the opinion that maybe the paint on the
sash was sanded and scraped off, making the sash looser in its
grooves. The solution was to take off the side stops and reinstall
them tighter against the bottom sash, so the friction would help
keep the sash up where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, wrote Donald Michaud of Salem, Mass., who suggested
that the bottom sash weighs more than the weights, and is therefore
not counterbalanced.
</P>
<P>
   But why, he asked, offering these reasons: The bottom sash may
have had the glass replaced with heavier glass. The bottom sash may
have an overload of paint. The weights might have been too light in
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to buy or get heavier weights, said Michaud.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Michaud offered, is to shorten the sash cords. They may
be too long, and when the sash is up, the weights hit bottom,
unable to hold up the sash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Hand nailing roofing shingles
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a brickbat about the handyman's suggestion to hand nail
roofing shingles instead of using staples or a power nail gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found your ignorance in this matter overwhelming,'' wrote
Gary Cassiday of Danville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Cassiday wrote that air nailers (power nail guns) do have
advantages, and can be used without failures in roofing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now because of your ignorance in this matter all roofers will
have to defend the use of air nailers. I am sure in the future
roofers will be asked about this article and we will be criticized
because of your stupidity. Maybe you should transfer to the cooking
section because you don't know (expletive deleted) about roofing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this letter won't be published because you would have
to admit being wrong. However, it is your responsibility to tell
your readers that the staples are a cheap way out for the roofer
but that the nail coils (power nail guns) are just as good if not
better than hand nailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee whiz, Mr. Cassiday, it was an opinion.

HOW TO SUCCEED AS A STEPFATHER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When psychologist Larry Ganong's stepson came home from college
one vacation, he left a note in the kitchen: ``Mom and Larry, back
at 10.'' As short as the note was, Ganong got stuck on the first
three words. He had been Stuart's stepfather for eight years. This
was the first time a note included him.
</P>
<P>
   The story drives home a dramatic but discouraging fact for
stepfathers: It can take a long time for children to accept you.
</P>
<P>
   How attachments do or don't develop depends a lot on what
happens when you first move in. Even though children may like you,
indeed perhaps because they do, assume you have to start over once
you live on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a tremendous loss for them. Access to their
mother is changed,'' says psychololgist Emily Visher, cofounder of
the Stepfamily Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling their mother has been ``stolen'' (one 8-year-old's word)
makes children jealous and resentful. Feeling their father's place
is being usurped makes them feel guilty: ``If I like this man, then
I'm being disloyal to my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinical psychologist Sam Osherson tells stepfathers not to see
a child's anger as a sign of failure. ``They have to be angry at
you in order to grieve what they have lost, which is the intact
family,'' he says. ``No matter how long ago their father lived with
them, even if those years were awful, this is a concrete reminder
of what was and what will never be again,'' and it affects children
of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   What can further get things off to a bad start is if a
stepfather immediately assumes a disciplinary role.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Discipline issue
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is very common. Whether a mother seeks his
help with discipline or the stepfather wants to ``shape those kids
up,'' the result is disaster, says University of Missouri
researcher Marilyn Coleman, who is married to Ganong. They are well
known for their studies on stepfamilies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't successfully discipline children you don't have an
emotional bond with,'' says Coleman. ``The older the child, the
truer that is. It ticks them off: `Who's he to tell me?''' An only
slightly exaggerated rule of thumb, she says, is that it takes as
many years to bond as the number of years you haven't lived
together.
</P>
<P>
   For most stepfathers, it's hard not to involve yourself in
discipline if the kids are bratty to you or their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning to keep your mouth shut is difficult,'' sympathizes
Cambridge and Newton psychologist Patricia Papernow, who
specializes in stepfamilies. ``If you have to say something, make
it an `I' statement _ `I have a hard time hearing you talk to your
mother that way' _ rather than a directive: `Don't you talk that
way to your mother!''' Papernow is author of ``Becoming a
Stepfamily'' (Analytic Press).
</P>
<P>
   It's not that you can't have input, just that it needs to be
behind-the-scenes with your wife, not in front of her children.
``It's the Golden Rule of stepfathering,'' says University of Miami
psychologist Margaret Crosbie-Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   She says stepfathers who try to discipline or expect too much
too soon from their stepchildren end up feeling inadequate,
frustrated, and disappointed. ``You start to think, `I don't need
this grief,' and disengage from the kids,'' says Crosbie-Burnett,
whose area of research is stepfamilies' adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   As human a reaction as that is, it creates more trouble. ``When
you withdraw,'' she says, ``a kid says to himself, `I knew he
didn't really care about me.' Then he feels justified to pay less
attention to you or give you an even harder time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Realistic expectations
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can't eliminate children's negative reactions but you can
mitigate against them by having minimal expectations. Advises
Crosbie-Burnett: ``Make the goal to have a friendly, respectful
relationship. To have fun together. Maybe love will come from that,
maybe it won't. Don't look for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinicians say closeness is more likely if stepfathers:
</P>
<P>
   _Talk with stepchildren of all ages about their father. Whether
he's dead or alive, involved or not, Papernow advises,
``Acknowledge his presence, real or emotional. Tell her, `I'm not
trying to replace your dad.' Acknowledge his role: `You have a
strong pitching arm, you must get that from your dad.''' Such
comments not only give a stepchild permission to think about Dad
without guilt, but establish you as someone she can talk to about
Dad. Mom may get too angry.
</P>
<P>
   _Create one-to-one time with each child. ``This is the sure way
to form a bond as long as you do it on the child's agenda,'' says
Coleman. She tells of one man who took his 10-year-old stepson
hunting ``to make him a man.'' ``The kid went along _ he didn't
want to get his mother mad _ but he hated it and hated his
stepfather more,'' says Coleman. Another man she knows offered to
take his 11-year-stepdaughter shopping because mother and daughter
fought over clothes. ``He could give his opinion without being
emotional. It brought them closer,'' Coleman says.

YOU CAN'T TELL A BOOK BY ITS TITLE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Had F. Scott Fitzgerald had his way, ``The Great Gatsby'' would
have been ``Trimalchio at West Egg.'' Would it still be an American
classic under that title? (``Robert Redford IS &UR;  &LR; `Trimalchio at West
Egg'!'') And Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' would we
love it as ``Pansy''? Because that's what Mitchell planned to call
it, after Pansy O'Hara, its feisty heroine.
</P>
<P>
   I've always assumed that once the book was written, coming up
with a title would be easy. This is not necessarily the case,
according to Andre Bernard's ``Now All We Need Is A Title.''
Bernard notes in the introduction that his book was originally
called ``Untitled.'' He thanks his editor at W.W. Norton for
discarding his ``lousy'' original and coming up with the new one.
Obviously editors do not always know best, Trimalchio and Pansy
notwithstanding. The same goes for authors. And publishers. ``I am
trying to think up a good title for you to want me to change,''
Raymond Chandler once wrote to his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler had an ear for a good title, and kept long lists of
possibilities in his notebooks, among them ``All Guns Are Loaded,''
``Lament But No Tears,'' ``Too Late to Sleep.'' Not all writers
have the knack, as Bernard's book makes clear. The great Charles
Dickens was to a large extent title-deaf. He very nearly called
``Bleak House,'' his ninth novel, ``Tom-All-Alone's Factory That
Got into Chancery and Never Got Out.'' He agonized over titles and
inundated his editor with suggestions, some of which were odd
indeed. ``Hard Heads and Soft Hearts'' was one title he put forward
for the novel that eventually was published as ``Hard Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Some writers admit they can't come up with good titles. Eudora
Welty has said she's just no good at them. Ann Beattie used to
submit her stories untitled to The New Yorker. As a schoolboy,
George Plimpton amused himself by inventing titles. But once he
started writing books he came up dry. His original title for
``Paper Lion'' was ``Where Are You, Dink Stover?''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard's little book is an eccentric collection of anecdotes
meant to amuse, and it does. He includes some wonderful stories.
Jean Stafford, Robert Lowell's first wife, claimed he revised his
work so extensively that a poem originally titled ``To Jean: On Her
Confirmation'' ended up called ``To a Whore in the Brooklyn Navy
Yard.'' Dylan Thomas titled a play ``Llareggub,'' a Welsh-looking
word that, read backward, expressed his feelings for his audience.
A friend persuaded him to change it to ``Under Milk Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard leaves readers wanting to know more about certain
authors and titles. What, exactly, was the thinking that went into
changing Jacqueline Susann's working title ``They Don't Build
Statues to Businessmen'' to ``The Valley of the Dolls''? Who argued
for ``At This Point in Time'' over ``All the President's Men''?
</P>
<P>
   He sheds light on some odd titles, among them ``Naked Lunch,''
which the author, William Burroughs, said means exactly what the
words say: ``a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end
of every fork.'' Anthony Burgess's ``A Clockwork Orange'' comes
from a Cockney expression, ``queer as a clockwork orange,'' i.e.,
something that doesn't exist. It wasn't, as some thought, a
reference to a hand grenade, ``a cheaper kind of explosive
pineapple,'' as Burgess once put it.
</P>
<P>
   Somerset Maugham explained that ``The Moon and Sixpence'' means
``reaching for the moon and missing the sixpence at one's feet.''
Maugham, Bernard writes, was proud of his titles, and liked to say,
``A good title is the title of a book that's successful.'' Which
makes one wonder all the more about what might have happened to
``Trimalchio at West Egg'' and ``Pansy.''  &QL;

POLLUTION WON'T STOP BY ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was on a talk show the other day with Jan Schlichtmann, the
lawyer whose fight against corporate polluters in Woburn, Mass. is
described in the book ``A Civil Action.'' We'd agreed to go on the
radio in Boston to share some stories about the effectiveness of
citizen activism, but before we got a chance, the male host
challenged the very premises we were working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``These big corporations have deep pockets,'' he insisted.
``Don't they look at all these suits and protests as just the cost
of doing business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynicism isn't an excuse for not taking action,'' Schlichtmann
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Later the host turned to me. ``I know you've got an active group
in Marblehead, but we have a lot of blue-collar listeners who are
struggling to survive. How are they going to organize citizen
committees?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that hard,'' I remember saying. ``I put a press
release in the paper and 72 people showed up, every one of them
ready to pitch in and work. People finally realize that pollution
is putting their health in jeopardy and all over the country
they're responding to a call to action.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the conviction in my voice, I realized how far I've
come.
</P>
<P>
   Just six months ago, I was the one putting down the newspaper
with a sigh of hopelessness. Bad news about the environment filled
me with such despair that it was hard not to picture my
grandchildren dying from famine on a ruined planet. Now here I was,
more hopeful than I've been in years, exhorting someone else to
have faith.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it strange? I am probably more aware than ever of the
dangers posed to my community by pesticides, poorly maintained
school buildings, and the plume of poisonous particulates drifting
over from the Salem Power Plant, yet because I'm working with
others who care as deeply as I do, I feel passionately optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Let me share a few inspiring stories.
</P>
<P>
   Last week our Board of Health, working with the Marblehead
(Mass.) Pesticide Awareness Committee, issued a statement
committing itself to the reduction and eventual phaseout of
pesticide use, on both public and private property. In addition,
every schoolchild will be bringing home a handout explaining that
warning flags on lawns indicate the presence of poisons that can
cause serious acute and long-term health problems.
</P>
<P>
   It was citizen action _ public presentations, organic gardening
workshops for landscapers, letters to the editor _ that created the
context in which our elected officials were able to act quickly and
decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, by a 2 to 1 landslide, our town passed a Proposition
2 1/2 override for funds to renovate our ``sick'' school buildings.
At the same time, our School Department began offering an
EPA-sponsored program called ``Indoor Air Quality Tools for
Schools'' to parent teams committed to clean up every one of our
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   It was citizen action _ a public forum, meetings of PTAs, a
massive telephone effort _ that educated parents and helped school
officials to respond promptly to the health risks of poorly
maintained schools.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another group has been sharing its concerns about the
Salem (Mass.) Power Plant with federal and state officials, and
with officers of the company about to purchase it. Though members
of the Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project will be joining others
on the June 21 Cancer Walk in Salem, those working to ensure the
conversion of the power plant to a cleaner fuel will be holding up
signs outside the plant, pointing out to the 17,500 walkers why we
should no longer tolerate the release of arsenic, cadmium, lead,
mercury, and uranium into our air.
</P>
<P>
   An aware and active citizenry sends a powerful message to those
who will have the responsibility for cleaning up one of the
dirtiest power plants in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism isolates, while coming together in a shared undertaking
energizes. It's as if, riding on the Titanic, we finally feel the
great ship of state shifting its direction. The peril is still
straight ahead, but every hand on the wheel exerts a tiny bit more
pressure in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics, stand aside.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of you, come add your strength to ours.

   Q. Water comes through my roof, which is about 20 years old,
during heavy rain, starting under the flashing around the chimney
and telegraphing down the rafters. I know I need a new roof, and
called for bids. There are two layers of shingles there now.
</P>
<P>
   One roofer said he would put down Ice &AMP; Water Shield, roofing
felt, and then organic shingles, adding that hand nailing would
cost $300 more. Another said he would put down felt. A third would
put down nothing under the shingles. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   RONALD SHEA, Haverhill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your roof died before its time (25 years), but it can't be
helped. You will certainly get no satisfaction from the
manufacturer, even if you can determine who made the shingles. And
any warrantee payment (on shingles only) would be prorated for the
20 years and would not amount to a hill of beans anwyay.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the point. I'd pick the man who wants to put
down the Ice &AMP; Water Shield and the felt, plus organics (shingles
with a saturated felt core instead of fiberglass). Charging extra
for hand nailing is his way of discouraging it, but hand nailing is
better than anything else, so go along with the extra cost (it
should be a part of the bid, rather than extra).
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of this, however, is not even addressed
by the roofers: and that is the flashing. Since the two layers of
old shingles must be removed, it will make it easier to either fix
the flashing so it does not leak or put in new flashing, which is
the proper way. Roofers know the proper way, and should do it.

   Q. How can I get a smoke odor out of an upholstered sofa?
</P>
<P>
   JUDITH MAYER, Halifax, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Dampen the upholstery with a wet sponge, then sprinkle a
whole bunch of baking soda on the damp surface. Leave it for an
hour, then sweep up and throw away. You can use instead carpet
freshener, which is perfumed baking soda. You could mound up salt
over the damp surface, let dry, and throw away.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you wet or dampen the upholstery: Baking soda will
not absorb dry materials very well, but will do a good job of
pulling dampness out, thereby pulling the smoke odor out too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of black paint chipped off my grill; maybe it even wore
off. How can I refurbish it, to make it look good, and resistant to
the high heat of a charcoal burner.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM MORRISON, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Use a wire brush to remove as much of the paint as you can.
Then buy high heat resistant (HHR) paint. Spray it on the grill and
any other part of the barbecue. It's the best you can do. The HHR,
made by Rustoleum, is sold in aerosol spray cans in hardware,
paint, and other building stores. While aerosol sprays are
expensive as paints go, there is not a large area you have to
cover.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My kitchen linoleum is 25 to 30 years old and is still in
good shape, except that a small section is missing, about half an
inch, near a metal edging. What can I fill that section with?
</P>
<P>
   VERA GROPPER, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have a spare piece of the linoluem (actually it is
sheet vinyl), you can cut a piece to fit and glue it in with an
adhesive caulk. If the linoleum normally goes under a flange on the
metal, make sure the patch piece does too. If it doesn't, and just
butts up against the edging, make sure it is well glued down
because that's probably where the break occurred when someone
tripped on the uneven surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   If the metal edging is in a doorway, you may not even have to
put in the patch if you cover the opening and the edging with an
oak threshold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My front steps are made of brick with bluestone treads, about
eight years old. The steps are in good shape, but there is a white
powder coming out of the bricks where they form the front of the
steps. What is that white powder and what can I do about it? Does
it hurt anything?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN VARRON, Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That white powder is efflorescence, and it is harmless. From
the Latin word ``to flower,'' it is lime leached out of the mortar
(usually not the bricks, which contain no lime) by water. Scrub it
off with a dry, stiff-bristled brush. Or, scrub with detergent and
water and rinse. Or, make a dilute solution of muriatic acid and
water (1 part acid to 5 parts water _ always pour the acid into the
water) and paint this on the brick riser, which is the front part
of the step. Rinse. It probably will come back, but you can't keep
it from coming back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I installed a wood stove last fall. The chimney man said he
would paint the chimney with two coats of a sealer called Chimney
Saver that is 100 percent breathable, to keep the chimney from
leaking, at a cost of $225. The man told me that the sealer, being
breathable, will not trap moisture in the brick. Is all this worth
it?
</P>
<P>
   BERT BOUCHARD, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the chimney is not leaking, there is no need for the
sealer. If rainwater is entering at the top of the chimney and is
dripping on the stovepipe, sealing will not work; you need a
chimney cap. The sealer helps only if the water is making its way
through the brick; that can happen and it can cause all sorts of
mysterious leaks.

NEW MEDIA JOURNAL FILLED WITH SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to think of any magazine _ with the possible exception
of John Kennedy Jr.'s star-soaked George _ that got a splashier
launch than Steve Brill's Content. Even before the monthly journal
of media criticism from Court TV founder Brill hit the newsstands,
his story accusing independent counsel Ken Starr of improper media
leaks became the talk of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has since sent Brill a letter saying the article bordered
on ``libelous,'' and Brill has asked Starr to release a log of his
contacts with reporters. Whatever Nieman Foundation curator Bill
Kovach is earning as Brill's ombudsman, he already looks like the
most underpaid man in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is whether Brill can sell media to the
masses. The magazine is claiming a 225,000 initial circulation, but
Brill is aiming for about 500,000. Two other respected media
monitors, the Columbia Journalism Review and the American
Journalism Review, have circulations of about 27,000 and 25,000,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the 152-page debut issue, Content is a different
animal. It is attractive and ambitious, with stories running the
gamut from the bookers of guests for TV news shows to the
authenticity of letters that fill teen magazines. And unlike AJR
and CJR, its tone is more that of detective than academic.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue does a number of smart things _ aside from
selling itself with the Starr ``Pressgate'' story. It covers the
good as well as the bad: the triumphs of the Chicago magazine
writer who unmasked the inflated investment claims of the
Beardstown Ladies and the New York Times team that tracked down
corruption at the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine's best moments come with the tidbits that shed
light on how journalism really works. Pieces on how Stephen Glass's
fabricated stories made it past the New Republic fact-checkers and
on the meaning of the term ``off the record'' illuminate how basic
standards can vary from news outlet to news outlet. And the hubris
of today's media celebrity is illustrated in the story about the
television bookers. A letter trying to persuade Louise Woodward's
attorneys to put their client on ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' declares,
``Please know that Diane (Sawyer) is eager to personally meet with
you.'' Doesn't that sound a little like ``Her majesty will see you
now''?
</P>
<P>
   Editorial director Michael Kramer writes that Brill's Content
vows allegiance not to the journalistic fraternity, but to the
media consumer. The problem is a statistic on the last page of the
magazine: Only 7 percent of Americans believe ``journalists are
more honest than most people.'' Brill's gamble is that a lot of
those media consumers are going to pay to read about people they
hold in such meager esteem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have long said that the Washington press corps is
infected with liberal bias. And surveys like the Freedom Forum
study revealing that 89 percent of those journalists voted for Bill
Clinton in 1992 provide some evidence. But a new poll of Beltway
journalists commissioned by the liberal media watchdog Fairness &AMP;
Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) indicates that the Washington press
corps is ``more conservative than the general public on a range of
economic issues from taxes to ... Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveyed were 141 Washington bureau chiefs, editors, and
reporters; 66 percent of them are male and 89 percent white. But
the most enlightening number was household income: 52 percent have
annual household incomes of over $100,000 and only 5 percent are
below the $50,000 mark. The study solicited their views on economic
issues and compared them with what FAIR says are benchmark polls
administered by other pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two percent of the journalists surveyed characterized the
economy as ``excellent'' and ``good,'' as compared with only 66
percent of the general public; 57 percent of the journalists said
``too much power is concentrated in the hands of a few large
companies,'' compared with 77 percent of the public; 65 percent of
the journalists said NAFTA has had a positive impact on the US,
while only 32 percent of the public agrees; 39 percent of the press
corps saw protecting Social Security and Medicare from major cuts
as a top priority, compared with 59 percent of the public; 32
percent of the media respondents felt requiring employers to
provide health insurance is a top priority, as opposed to 47
percent of the public; and 43 percent of the journalists favored
government-guaranteed health care, compared with 64 percent of the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   Although FAIR assails what it calls the ``liberal media myth,''
the study concludes that ``painting journalists as the core of the
`conservative media' does not do justice to the complexity of the
situation. Like many profit-sector professionals, journalists tend
to hold `liberal' social views and `conservative' economic views.
Most of all, they can broadly be described as centrists.'' And
well-heeled centrists at that.

ON TRUTH, JUSTICE AND THE CULT OF OSCAR WILDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
OSCAR WILDE'S LAST STAND 
By Philip Hoare 
Arcade, 256 pp., illustrated, $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar Wilde had been dead for 18 years in 1918, but his case and
cause remained vivid in the public imagination when an adventurous
theater company sought to give the British premiere of his play
``Salome.'' To add to the attraction, Richard Strauss's opera based
on the play had taken the world by storm a decade before,
reawakening interest in its source.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Pemberton Billing, a member of Parliament and a
self-appointed protector of the public morals, was outraged. In his
newspaper ``The Vigilante,'' he published an attack on Maud Allan,
the American dancer who was cast in the title role. Billing
denounced Allan as the leader of a ``cult of the clitoris,'' and
strongly suggested that the subscription list for the private
performance would yield the names of some of the 47,000 members of
the British establishment who, according to Billing, shared Wilde's
perverse sexual inclinations and therefore became susceptible to
blackmail by German agents.
</P>
<P>
   Allan had no choice but to retaliate by suing for libel, and for
five days the sensational trial monopolized the attention of the
nation, and indeed the English-speaking world. There was a
prominent cast of characters, including the King's former mistress,
who was in the courtroom fearing to be called to the stand;
Billing's mistress, eager to testify; the director of Naval
Intelligence; Lord Alfred Douglas, whose affair with Wilde was the
cause of the writer's downfall and who was now ``reformed''; not to
mention the exotic danseuse herself, sister of an executed
murderer, a favorite guest at No.10 Downing Street, and center of
controversies throughout her career. Allan was famed for the
illusion of near-nudity she created in her dance, ``The Vision of
Salome'' (though in later years she remarked, ``That costume today
would take me to the North Pole and back and keep me cozy and
warm'').
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom was the scene of bizarre, even incredible displays
of arrogance, ignorance, chicanery, prejudice, and duplicity. The
subtitle of Philip Hoare's ``Oscar Wilde's Last Stand'' calls this
``the most outrageous trial of the century,'' but there are too
many other claimants for that position; it was certainly one of the
most preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Hoare, author of lively biographies of Stephen Tennant and Noel
Coward, devotes about half of his book to gavel-to-gavel coverage
of the trial in all of its Alice-in-Wonderland absurdity. The trial
was being used by both sides to advance political and social
agendas, and both sides were capable of dishonorable behavior _
Billing would stop at nothing, and liberal politicians, rightly
fearful of his demagoguery, financed a plot to engineer his fall.
The judge, Charles Darling, repeatedly lost control of the
courtroom; neither defense or prosecution focused on facts.
Ignorance about sexual matters and a philistine approach to
literary and aesthetic issues led to repeated explosions of
hilarity and displays of partisan support or disapproval. Eight
decades later, one reads some of the courtroom exchanges with
comparable hilarity, incredulous, but streaked with an uneasiness
because of what was at stake _ and because of the further
atrocities ignorance and intolerance have led to in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of Hoare's book traces the biographies of its
principal participants, before and after, and thoroughly and
admirably investigates the context of the trial _ sexual,
psychological, artistic, historical, political, and sociological
(the trial pitted middle-class values against upper-class
irresponsibilities and lower-class realities).
</P>
<P>
   Wilde had been an avatar of the modern world, as Hoare notes:
``He exemplified the coming age; the cult of the personality, the
new, incestuous ties between the media and culture.'' The Billing
trial addressed the cult of Wilde and, in essence, the century that
was defining itself, and in doing so it raised issues of truth,
justice, and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Hoare proves a learned, witty, intelligent guide to significant
aspects of subcultural history that have not been very thoroughly
explored; quite deftly he fits the pieces of the known and the
unknown together. He has an eye for the memorable detail (Goering,
at his final arrest, was wearing red nail polish, and his toes were
painted too) and the telling quip. That the Germans maintained a
list of Britons susceptible to blackmail is probable; the British
certainly maintained comparable lists of Germans. (In the Second
World War, the Nazis had a list of Englishmen scheduled for
extermination, and the list became public. Rebecca West wrote to
Noel Coward, ``My dear, the people we should have been seen dead
with.'')
</P>
<P>
   Hoare, of course, is as partisan as any participant in the trial
he is covering _ it shows in observations like, ``Unlike racism,
anti-Semitism and homophobia play on the fear of the superior,
rather than the inferior.'' But he is an intelligent and generous
partisan. (His final verdict on Billing is, ``His campaign was
ridiculous, prejudiced, laughable even; yet Billing believed it,
believed that society was threatened by perversion and that it was
his duty to fight it. In that he was an honourable man, for all his
dishonourable ways.'') At the end of the trial there was a swift
verdict in favor of Billing, but as Hoare points out, the
aftershocks would be felt for decades, long after the trial itself
and its personalities had been forgotten. Some of those same issues
still arise in courtrooms and newspapers today, and they are not
funny.

RICCI OPTS FOR THE `OPPOSITE' PATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of actresses my age only do that because they
think people will think they're stupid if they don't. It's like
their way of proving to people that they're smart, and I don't feel
like I need to prove myself to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Her strappy platform sandals kicked off, Christina Ricci is
curled up on a couch in her Boston hotel suite, explaining why she
has no intention of attending college. Jodie Foster did it nearly
two decades ago, and Claire Danes plans to do so in the fall, and
Ricci, at her family's insistence, sent out applications, and was
accepted into Columbia University. But come September, she won't be
swapping soundstages for lecture halls, or movie scripts for
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like (actresses who attend college) think everyone will
say, `She went to college for four years, what a smart girl she is,
she knows acting is a silly job.' It's like, are you serious? I owe
so much to acting,'' she said. ``For me to go to college would be
like admitting actresses are stupid, and I especially think it's
horrible to go to school just because you think other people will
think better of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to go, but then I realized why I was going, and
that I really didn't want to go,'' Ricci said. ``If people think
I'm stupid then ... let them think I'm stupid. I don't feel like
going to college.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, had she attended Columbia she would have studied
creative writing, not drama since ``that would be a true waste of
time to go and study something I've been doing for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, for more than half of her 18 years, has been a
professional actress, perhaps best known for her morbidly hilarious
turn as Wednesday in ``The Addams Family'' films. Yet, if it
doesn't seem as if Ricci has grown up before our eyes, perhaps that
is because she has never quite seemed just another child actress.
Perhaps it is her world-weary eyes or the refreshingly candidness
that would make most publicists faint. She is an old soul wrapped
in the increasingly voluptuous body of a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Addams Family'' to Ang Lee's wrenching family drama,
``The Ice Storm,'' Ricci has always brought an unsettling maturity
and tangy flavor to her roles. With her world-weary eyes and
deadpan delivery, she is making a far smoother transition from
child to adult roles than, say, Macaulay Culkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played parts that were happy, adorable little kids.
Even in movies where I probably should have been happy and
adorable, I wasn't,'' said Ricci, releasing a long stream of smoke
from an ever-present Parliament. ``I guess that helped me be seen
as more than just a cute kid.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing cute nor childlike about Ricci's latest
character in ``The Opposite of Sex,'' which opens Thursday. Ricci
plays Dedee Truitt, a nasty bit of Southern discomfort who wreaks
havoc in the lives of just about everyone she encounters. Within
the movie's first half-hour, she trashes her stepfather's funeral,
steals her half-brother's hunky boyfriend, and fingers him as the
father of her unborn child. The film also stars Martin Donovan,
Lisa Krudow, Ivan Sergei, Johnny Galecki, and Lyle Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci received the script from her mother, and was immediately
interested in playing Dedee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough for adult women to find strong characters,''
said Ricci, between sips of Coke. ``But for teen-age girls, you're
always either someone's daughter or someone's girlfriend or the
whiny pain-in-the-ass victim or the bitch who's totally out to ruin
people's lives. Dedee isn't out to ruin people's lives, she just
happens to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With her Lolita pout and soulless eyes, Dedee is the kind of
unholy creation who walks into a room, opens her mouth, and sucks
out all the oxygen. Politically incorrect to a fault _ few groups
emerge unscathed by her barbed observations _ Dedee would have
Wednesday Addams running for the rosary beads and holy water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so nice to be able to say things you're never allowed
to say in movies. You think they'd never ever allow a script like
this to be made,'' Ricci said. ``It was really nice, and really
fun, and this movie totally reflects a unique sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Roos, who both wrote and directed the film, did not create
Dedee with Ricci in mind. In fact, Roos, who makes his directorial
debut with the film, but has such screenwriting credits as ``Single
White Female'' and ``Boys on the Side,'' wasn't sure Ricci was
right for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was too young. I thought of her as this little
freaky Wednesday,'' he said. ``But once we flew to New York to meet
her, she was very compelling. I instantly felt, `This is who the
character is.'''
</P>
<P>
   After auditioning 50 actresses for the role, Roos was attracted
to Ricci's vulnerability, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a lot going on behind whatever it is she's
doing or saying. It's her eyes, her face, and her talent that make
you believe this is a real person and not just a collections of
words, gestures, and attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Ricci, who recently moved from New York to Los
Angeles, has worked on seven films including Terry Gilliam's take
on Hunter S. Thompson's ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.'' (As a
14-year-old runaway who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand, Ricci
was the best thing in that misfire of a movie.) She recently
completed ``200 Cigarettes,'' with Courtney Love and Ben Affleck;
``Buffalo 66,'' which sauntered out of this year's Sundance Film
Festival with big buzz, opens next month month, and she's also in
the new John Waters's film ``Pecker.''
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating from high school, Ricci has worked virtually
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got kind of panicked, like, `Wow, now I really need to make
money so I better take this seriously,''' she said.``In the past
year, everything I've done I've done because I liked the script,
and I liked the role. I really thought those where good movies, and
they were like my sense of humor, so I really enjoyed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that Ricci has ever been anything less than a
serious actress. A native of Santa Monica, Calif., Ricci grew up in
Montclair, N.J. She appeared in a school play, and by age 8, was
traveling to New York regularly to appear in television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came really naturally to me, it was really fun for me,''
she said. ``I was getting paid, I didn't have to go to school for a
while, and I got lots of attention which is all I ever wanted when
I was little.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ricci is still getting lots of attention in the onl career
she has ever known. Ricci is content to work at the only job she's
ever known. While most of her recent films could be classified as
independent, she's not adverse to big-budget films _ after all
``The Addams Family'' movies garnered hundreds of millions. But as
with most aspects of her life, Ricci won't adhere to popular logic,
whether it concerns the ivy-covered halls of academia or Hollywood
success. And if anyone has a problem with that, well, Ricci, really
couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wouldn't scoff at $21 million, but I would hate to do a
big movie that was cheesy and awful,'' she said. ``It's much more
important that I could live with myself. I don't need any more
self-loathing in my life, you know?''

   _Get feelings out in the open, including your own. Visher tells
every stepfather to have an early conversation, something like
this: ``I know this feels strange, having me live here, and it may
take time to figure out how to live together, but I know we will.
You may feel like we never will and that's OK. If you ever want to
talk, just ask.'' Visher is co-author of ``How to Win as a
Stepfamily'' (Brunner Mazel).
</P>
<P>
   _Look for family activities that include the stepfather. ``If
Mom and the kids are great skiiers and the stepdad isn't, it's a
lousy activity because it perpetuates him as an outsider,'' says
Papernow. ``But if Mom's the outsider _ she's the one who can't ski
_ that connects the kids and stepfather.''
</P>

 &QL; 
Dealing with rejection
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Children under 8 are typically more open to overtures but a
child of any age may reject them and be downright nasty to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't eat the toast because you made it?'' says Osherson.
``Leave it on the table, tell him it's there if he wants it, and
get to the heart of the issue: `I know this is hard, getting used
to each other. But that's what we have to do: get used to each
other. It will take time.'''
</P>
<P>
   That lets him know three things, says Osherson: You aren't going
to let yourself be the object of abuse, you aren't going to strike
back, and you aren't going away. Visher adds that behind most
nastiness is another ``n'' word: neediness.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you are respectful and kind to your stepchildren
doesn't mean they will be. Don't overlook that the problem may be
lack of communication or miscommunication. ``If you want them to be
civil, spell out exactly what that means,'' says Papernow. ``Does
it refer to a tone of voice or a greeting in the morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Ganong says that with teenagers, the going can be tough and have
nothing to do with you as a stepfather. ``When Stuart and his
brother, Jay, were 15 and 16, they didn't have a decent
relationship with any adult,'' he says, ``including their
biological father, who they were close to.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Think of yourself as a consultant to your stepchildren. Try to
find one way in which you can be a hero because you can teach them
something they want to learn that nobody else can.
</P>
<P>
   _Children's jealousy and resentment of a stepdad typically
diminish if they still have time alone with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   _Mothers play a large role in easing their husband's transition
into the family: Talk with your children about what will change and
what will stay the same. Don't undermine his efforts. (Psychologist
Coleman tells of one mother who insisted on tucking her children
into bed after the stepfather because he ``didn't do it good
enough.'') Set reasonable expectations: ``You don't have to love
him but you have to treat him with respect as you would any other
adult.'' Pat him on the back in front of the kids: ``Thanks for
helping. I appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   _Stepdaughters and teens are most resistant to physical
affection from a stepfather. If she pushes you away or freezes up
when you offer a hug, back off but do try again after some time
passes. Otherwise, she'll think you don't care anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _The warmer you are toward their biological dad, the easier it
is for children of any age.
</P>
<P>
   _With several children in a family, the oldest is likely to
resist most because he feels the loyalty bind the most. In general,
9- to 13-year-olds are the most resistant; they're very opinionated
and have preconceived ideas of what a family should be. &UR;  &LR; Kids under
6 are the most open; they tend to want the family to succeed. Teens
often don't care because they've developed support groups outside
the family.
</P>
<P>
   _Food can make children resentful of a stepfather, especially if
Mom changes what she cooks to please him. A good antidote: Let
everyone take turns choosing menus.
</P>
<P>
   _Stepfathers who have their own children shouldn't expect or
pretend to love their stepchildren the same.
</P>
<P>
   _Men who become stepfathers because the biological father died
may have a hard time because kids idealize a dead father and make
constant comparisons. A good comment to make: ``I can't do this the
same way your dad did but I'm doing my best.''

<P>
   Picked-up pieces gathered while watching futbol and pumping out
the basement ...
</P>
<P>
   --When the Red Sox are done with old Fenway, why not make it the
permanent site of the Baseball Hall of Fame? This radical idea was
first mentioned to me by George Will last month. He said he wasn't
sure where he'd heard it first, but the more you think about it,
the more sense it makes. We reluctantly concede that the Red Sox,
(itals)someday(unitals), are going to build a park rather than
refurbish Fenway. The old yard won't be allowed to stand empty
because real estate in the Fens is valuable. So why not bring
Cooperstown's shrine to Boston?
</P>
<P>
   Hardball historians have conceded that Cooperstown has nothing
to do with the birth of baseball. Since it's stripped of that
mythology, there's really no sense to keep the Hall there. It's
difficult for fans to find and too small to accommodate the masses
who want to tour the Hall. Sure, much of the small-town charm would
be lost, but bringing the Hall to Fenway, to
(itals)Boston(unitals), would make it accessible to millions of
tourists and fans passing through the Hub without losing the
nostalgic feel of Cooperstown. And it would enable Fenway to live
with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   --It is contemptible, self-important, and embarrassing that Sox
general manager Dan Duquette has issued an order that none of his
minor league people be allowed to give interviews without first
getting clearance from Boston. This is the kind of arrogance that
makes other teams root against the Red Sox. Any team in baseball
should be happy that the press cares enough to talk to minor league
people. In the scheme of life, it's just not that important, Dan.
It's only baseball, and you should remember what it was like in
Montreal and be happy anybody cares.
</P>
<P>
   --The National Hockey League just completed its fourth
consecutive 4-0 Stanley Cup finals. It is as if the sport is cursed
since the 1994 strike. It's been all downhill since the Rangers won
the Cup in '94. Since 1995, the NHL has had as many four-game
finals sweeps as the NBA has had in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   --David Stern was no doubt happy to have hundreds of European
press at the NBA Finals, but they did clutter the press
conferences, making Ahmad Rashad sound like Mike Wallace (we're
still not sure if it was a European or an American who asked
Scottie Pippen after Game 5, ``Scottie, would you rather win this
in six games or in seven?''). It was definitely the ``B'' team of
chain-smoking Euro writers at the NBA Finals this year because any
European sportswriter who's any good would be watching futbol in
France. Oui?
</P>
<P>
   --It's beginning to look like the Red Sox might hang in there
throughout the summer. By now, most of you have given up the ghost
of chasing the Yankees. Keep an eye on the Rangers and Angels. One
will win the West and the other will battle the Red Sox for the
wild card. Unless Baltimore or Toronto makes a move, that's the way
it's shaping up as we near the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   --Here it comes: Jose Canseco missed Tuesday's game with back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   --Like most of us, Jack McCallum of Sports Illustrated has a
favorite Larry Bird story. He traveled with the Cetlics to Spain in
1988 for the McDonald's Open. The Celtics were scheduled to meet
with King Juan Carlos, and when McCallum tried to arrange a brief
interview with Bird, Larry told him, ``Maybe we can do it tomorrow
after we do that king thing.'' (itals)That king thing.(unitals)
Love it.
</P>
<P>
   --Erik Hanson? No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   --Happily, it's not news anymore when John Hirschbeck works home
plate for an Orioles game. Roberto Alomar went 1 for 5 against the
Yankees when Hirschbeck worked the plate in Baltimore Monday.
</P>
<P>
   --Pats fans who can't make the trip should drink Coronas when
the Bob Kraft AC plays Dallas at Mexico City Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   --Apocalypse Now or Serenity Now? There haven't been many years
when both the Red Sox and Cubs have had a chance at postseason
play. A Red Sox-Cubs World Series would almost certainly bring out
the ``end of the world'' cult. The Sox haven't won since 1918, the
Cubs since '08, and the Sox' last Series win was against the Cubs.
Stephen King has already predicted that a Cubs-BoSox World Series
could only end with an atomic bomb detonating after it got to 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   --Is Luc Longley the worst player to start for an NBA champion,
or did Marc Iavaroni retire the trophy with the 1983 Sixers? Send
your entries to Bob Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   --How did ``The Babe Ruth Story'' miss the Top 400 list?
</P>
<P>
   --Don't trade Jim Leyritz. Happy or not, he'll produce.
</P>
<P>
   --Too often, we write about ``all-time greats'' on these pages,
but we lost one for sure June 4 when the Washington Post's
92-year-old Shirley Povich died at his home in Washington. A native
of Bar Harbor, Maine (where there were a lot of boys named
Shirley), Povich went to Washington when he was 17 and caddied for
President Warren Harding. His first Post story about the Washington
Senators ran in 1924. He was named sports editor in '26 and wrote
more than 15,000 columns over seven decades. He covered Babe Ruth's
alleged ``called shot'' in the 1932 World Series. He and his wife,
Ethyl, were married for 66 years. Asked about the secret of their
marriage, Povich said, ``We take it one decade at a time.''

WINGS HELD UP FOR THE LONG SKATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, they turned out to be marathon men. If the New
Jersey Devils of 1994-95 were the NHL's best sprinters, winning the
Stanley Cup in a lockout-shortened season, the 1997-98 edition of
the Detroit Red Wings proved their mettle over the very long haul.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP Tuesday
night at MCI Center in Washington in the wake of Detroit's 4-0
sweep of the Capitals in the finals, Wings captain Steve Yzerman
said he said he couldn't wait to get his uniform off and crash.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL season began Oct. 1, a full 30 days before the NBA
season, yet the finals ended two days later than the NBA's _ and
that's only because they were wrapped up in the minimum number of
games. When most people were firing up their gas grills and shorts
and tank tops had become the fashion order of the day, hockey
players were still suiting up for a winter sport that was
threatening to last practically until July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's really over. The season that wouldn't end finally has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been difficult with the Olympic Games in the middle
of the season _ there were so many games, and I think every player
felt the same way,'' said Yzerman, who looked spent as well as
elated. ``We were playing four games a week, and it just seemed
like once the season started, it never stopped and you never got a
chance to catch your breath. We had the Olympics, came right back
and started playing again, and the playoffs are just incredibly
draining. So you just haven't had a chance to just sit at home for
a night on the couch and do nothing and watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much exhausted, so I'm just looking forward to
taking it easy for a while because it's just been one day after
another, just preparing for a game nonstop since September. It's
been a draining year, but obviously a really enjoyable year. It's
just time to slow down for a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Chicago Bulls added to their legend and dynasty, the
Red Wings became the first back-to-back Cup champions since the
1991 and '92 Penguins. So what is next for the Wings, besides some
well-deserved rest? It remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Scotty Bowman, who has won eight Stanley Cups as a coach
and another as director of player development with the Penguins,
could go for No. 9 behind the bench next year, which would break
the record he now shares with Toe Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said he would sit down with his family and make a
decision in the next couple of weeks once the emotion has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I hope he comes back for another year,'' said
Yzerman. ``He's in charge of this team. The players have grown
extremely fond of him. We know what Scotty and the staff wants us
to do. They kind of know what to expect from us, so we have a
pretty good relationship. But he's the guy who drives the team and
he puts the fire on the team and he doesn't allow the players to
get big egos or get overconfident or get too comfortable. He keeps
you motivated. He keeps you a little on edge. He's had a tremendous
coaching career. We've got a good thing going and we'd like to
continue it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly possible they could. For the most part, the core
of the team will remain intact, and there is plenty of young
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our forwards apart from myself and Igor
Larionov are all within the ages of 22, 23-29, so that group is
going to be together for a number of years, and that will keep the
team competitive,'' said Yzerman. ``We really didn't look toward
winning the Cup until the playoffs started this year. We didn't
talk about it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the NHL, no one was talking about it much at
the end. Sunday's TV rating for the final NBA game was 17.6.
Saturday's Game 3 of the NHL finals did only a 3.1. Consider that
the golf ratings for Sunday were 5.9.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this is golf season. One Detroit writer said you
know the NHL season is too long when it ends as the US Open is
about to start. The Red Wings made it to the finish line. The
marathon is finally over.

   TAKE-BOS  
 YORK, Maine: ... curator Johnson.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he never met Perkins, Johnson can claim to know her
mind better than most. As a graduate student, he lived in the
house. ``When you've living in someone else's house, you absorb a
lot about them.'' A sure guide to Perkins's taste was the pile of
magazines whose pages she marked for ideas. If her house resembles
any other, says Johnson, it would be Beauport, Henry Davis
Sleeper's cottage on Gloucester's Eastern Point, now maintained by
the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities.
Sometimes to the point of camp, Sleeper was the master of interior
vistas and vignettes composed of a miscellany of decorative
objects, some rare or valuable and others merely entertaining but
all companionable. ``I can't find any documentation that Elizabeth
Perkins and Sleeper met but they had to,'' says Johnson. A tour of
such ``decorator Colonial'' houses would also have to include Bert
and Nina Little's Cogswell Grant in Essex, Mass.; restored by SPNEA
to showcase the couple's collection of Americana, it will open in
August.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Perkins family
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old house was falling down when the Perkinses bought the
property for $1,300 a century ago. A Vermont family, they had
migrated to New York City and bought farmland just north of where
Central Park would be built following the Civil War. Farming didn't
pay nearly as well as land development and on their acres the
Perkinses put up houses and apartments. A formal photograph of the
young Elizabeth Perkins shows her in debutante white satin, an
heiress on offer. In the event, she never married. The various York
villages had their own social sets and Johnson says snobby York
Harbor considered the Perkinses' summer place, despite its now
enviable location on the York River, on the wrong side of the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Perkinses began by enlarging the house, a simple four room
and ell structure. No architect guided them as they incorporated
bits of neo-Palladian, Georgian, and Federal elements from old
Maine houses. In 1904, the Perkinses added a one-story kitchen wing
and a big porch off the dining room. The following year, it seemed
the friendly thing to throw a tea party for delegates to the peace
conference in Portsmouth, N.H., ending the Russo-Japanese War.
There have been other improvements over the years; 1920 saw a
``period'' garage and upstairs a modern bathroom for Perkins. When
a parlor wall blocked the river view, the windows were
reconfigured. The rooms filled with antiques and Americana; a
French Aubusson carpet was sent up from the New York apartment.
Trinkets followed Perkins home from her South American holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Every room has a story or two to tell. Perkins stripped the
dining room of its 18th-century horsehair plaster and paneled it in
dark wood to make it older and more rustic. The room was lit only
by candles. Perkins obviously loved the centuries-old trick of
insinuating light into murky places. Almost every surface in her
dining room is freighted with silver, either shining metal or
lustrous china, and when the candles are lit, light winks back.
</P>
<P>
   The 1954 restoration banished much of this sleight of hand to
the attic. ``It took away her decorative intent,'' says Johnson. As
a result, the interiors looked uncertain, lacking in personality.
Perkins was in danger of being restored out of her own home. There
had been a serious side to her. Johnson says Perkins can stand in
preservation circles with the Wells family who created Old
Sturbridge or William Sumner Appleton, founder of SPNEA. She was
remarkable, moreover, as a lone woman doing preservation work in a
field dominated by male antiquarians. ``Men looked at her
bemused,'' says Johnson. ``She was strong willed: She did what she
had to do to get things done. Old York would not be what it is
without her.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
House comes alive
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the attic treasures came downstairs and, with the
help of old photos, took their rightful places, the house came
alive. Rather than a historical document, the Perkins House ``is a
stage set set up for entertaining,'' says Johnson. There is a
little more work to do. The cast-iron furniture will go back on the
porch. There are plans to restore the 1935 boat house in which
Perkins staged theatricals. Something of that flavor will be
conveyed when the Old York Historical Society throws a gala party
on Saturday between 4 and 7 p.m. to celebrate the four-year
restoration of the house. It will be 1910 again, with music of the
day and servants to pass the Champagne. Strolling the lawn that
goes down to the York River will be people costumed as Perkins's
friends and visitors, among them humorist Mark Twain, actress Ethel
Barrymore, modern dancer Ruth St. Denis, and novelist Sarah Orne
Jewett. Perkins herself may make a cameo appearance. Will she wear
one of the soignee gowns that hangs in her upstairs dressing room
with her Red Cross uniform?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
INFORMATION FOR VISITORS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabeth Perkins House, one of seven Old York Historical
Society museum buildings, is open to the public Tuesdays through
Sundays through September. For information about admission and
about the decorator show house benefiting the society July 18-Aug.

HEJDUK LEADS THE NEW WAVE IN US SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN d'ARDIERES, France _ Frankie Hejduk isn't supposed to
be here. He's supposed to be paddling belly down on a surfboard
somewhere near La Jolla, waiting for a phat set.
</P>
<P>
   ``My buddies are always giving me stick for doing what I'm doing
now,'' says the man who brought the US soccer team out of its coma
with one mad dash in its World Cup opener against Germany Monday.
``They're home playing in the waves. But I'll have plenty of time
for that when I'm retired _ and they're working.''
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk has enough to do on dry land here. With the Americans
facing an early trip home if they can't beat Iran in Lyon Sunday,
the 23-year-old Hejduk (pronounced HAY-duck) will be off the bench
and into the starting lineup as coach Steve Sampson's favorite set
of jumper cables.
</P>
<P>
   With his shoulder-length locks, wraparound shades, and beach
cultcha approach, Hejduk seems an unlikely candidate to crank up
his side's juiceless battery. But he has exactly the qualities
Sampson knows the Americans need if they're to make it out of the
first round here next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``His complete lack of concern as to who's on the other side,''
says Sampson. ``His free spirit and wonderful attacking
personality. And his great speed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yanks were trailing the Germans by a goal at halftime
in Paris and looking timid and tentative, Sampson sent Hejduk onto
the pitch at the Parc des Princes and told him to get something
going.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes, Hejduk got hung with a yellow card for a
senseless trip. But a couple of minutes later, he came sprinting
through the German defense and launched a diving header that keeper
Andreas Koepke barely got his gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how much trouble it took for him to go from that wide
midfield position to the near post,'' marvels Sampson, whose team
wound up losing to Germany, 2-0. ``That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more so because Hejduk had his shorts on backward. Hoping
to get his mates moving, he'd turned the shorts around in the
dressing room at halftime. ``Rally cap, bro,'' Hejduk proclaimed.
``Rally cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk (``Last time I try that trick'') hadn't figured he'd be
going in for Mike Burns when play resumed. Six months ago, he
hadn't figured he'd be here at all after oversleeping and blowing a
team trip to China a year ago January. ``I set my watch alarm but I
didn't hear it,'' Hejduk says. ``Slept right through. I was in a
panic state. By the time I called Steve, the plane was almost in
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant curtains for Hejduk on the national team. ``He was
done for, and justifiably so,'' says Sampson. So Hejduk went back
to the Tampa Bay Mutiny, his Major League Soccer club, and took
stock. ``I didn't know whether I wanted to do this for a living or
not,'' he says. ``Then I realized what an opportunity I was
missing. Here I was letting it slip away. Missing that trip woke me
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk had always drifted with the time and tide. Now he began
putting down roots. He proposed to his girlfriend, Kim (knee-deep
in the Pacific surf, fiancee in one arm, surfboard in the other),
got married, and had a son in February. ``I was always carefree,
had money, didn't worry about anything,'' Hejduk says. ``Now I had
someone to support and be a role model for.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he'd cleared the air with Sampson (``I admitted my
stupidity'') and gotten another chance with the national team.
Sampson, a Southern Californian himself, figured that anybody who
could drop off the edge of a 20-foot wall of water could probably
handle himself against the German midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever been bodysurfing? I have,'' says Sampson. ``I've been
crushed by a 5-footer. I'm not even thinking about 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk planned on being a pro surfer like his buddies. ``I'd get
up at 5, go surfing, go to school, then play soccer at 4,'' he
says. ``It was like that until I was 18.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA offered him a soccer scholarship, but Hejduk, who'd won the
state high school surfing championship, wanted to shoot the pier at
Huntington Beach. ``My parents weren't happy about that,'' he says.
``They wanted me to do the school and soccer thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hejduk did, and ended up making the 1996 Olympic team and
getting a shot with the national squad. Nobody else had his
flat-out speed and his unusual mix of daring and nonchalance.
That's why Sampson gave him a second shot and stuck with him after
Hejduk pulled a hamstring this year. Hejduk was the first man he
went to when the Yanks needed reanimation against the Germans, and
he was an obvious choice (along with Tab Ramos) when Sampson
decided to sic a couple of attack dogs on the Iranians this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This time there's no flight to China to worry about. Lyon is
only 45 minutes down Route A6, the match is at 9 p.m., and Hejduk
has his wake-up call wired. ``Alarm clocks,'' Frankie Hejduk says.
``Now I set like six of them.''

EMANCIPATION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Many folks are familiar with African-American
History Month in February, Kwanza in December, Martin Luther King's
birthday, Malcolm X's birthday and Uhuru Day (which commemorates
the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   Juneteenth predates them all. It commemorates the end of
slavery, the seminal event in African-American history.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous versions about how this holiday began.
</P>
<P>
   But first, some background history. The Emancipation
Proclamation took effect on Jan. 1, 1863, while the Civil War was
raging. In theory, it freed the slaves in all states which were
``in rebellion against the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, President Abraham Lincoln knew it would have little
effect, but he wanted to gain the support of abolitionist groups.
According to one version of how the holiday began, the Emancipation
Proclamation was read to slaves in Houston on June 19, 1863, more
than five months after the effective date. As word of the end of
slavery spread, Juneteenth was coined to commemorate the freedom
day.
</P>
<P>
   Another version has Gen. Gordon Granger, the Union Army's
commander in Texas, landing in Galveston on June 19, 1865, and
issuing a proclamation about the end of slavery _ as well as the
end of the Civil War, which had actually ended two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another version, which makes little sense, has Juneteenth as
a celebration of the Thirteenth Amendment. Enacted on Dec. 18,
1865, it abolished all slavery and involuntary servitude.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about Juneteenth about 15 years ago, I heard
that many African Americans in Texas, where the holiday originated,
do not celebrate July 4 as Independence Day, but Juneteenth. There
are several folklore stories about why the news of freedom took so
long to spread.
</P>
<P>
   One version is that slaves were intentionally kept ignorant
about their freedom in order to allow the crops to be harvested.
Another version has one messenger traveling by mule from the date
of the Emancipation Proclamation to deliver the news and it simply
took more than five months to arrive from Washington. And another
version has the messenger being murdered before he could deliver
the message.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it has been a state holiday in Texas since 1980.
It's called ``Emancipation Day'' and is celebrated on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's celebrated in most of the states as the date when
slavery ended in the United States. Although primarily an
African-American holiday, it has now evolved into an acknowledgment
of the past and celebration of the cessation of slavery by all
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Juneteenth.

MARTIN STORY FITS NBC TO A TEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plenty of drama in this year's US Open. The main story line is
the competition between some of the hottest pros: Ernie Els, Mark
O'Meara, David Duval, Tiger Woods, Colin Montgomery, and Tom
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the subplot involving Casey Martin has received most
of the media attention and will command at least initial face-time
from NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll defintely be covering Casey's opening tee shot,'' said
NBC analyst Roger Maltbie. ``We feel it's a special occasion. It's
newsworthy and we want the viewing public to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Martin is one of overcoming huge obstacles. He was
born with a circulatory disorder that has whithered his right leg
and causes him to walk with a pronounced limp.
</P>
<P>
   Casey sued the PGA and won the right to use a motorized cart on
the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But even that decision was not a panacea. Martin has had trouble
with a single-passenger cart issued to him for practice rounds at
the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the USGA announced that it had decided to
allow him to use a standard cart.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow Martin use of a cart was not well-received
by a significant portion of the golfing world.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson has been the latest to express disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough position the Tour has taken, but I think the Tour
is right in the sense that the game should be played walking,''
Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maltbie took exception to those who snickered about walking
being a part of golf. ``No one is questioning Casey's need for a
cart,'' Maltbie said. ``But to portray the other golfers as
non-athletes was unfair. Whether you have played for fun or
competitively, everyone knows that if you had to play 36 holes on a
hot, humid day on a hilly course, your game will be affected. Your
legs become tired and it will defintely affect your swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maltbie and NBC's Johnny Miller agree that the network will
cover the Martin story as long as it's relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll focus on who is shooting the scores,'' Maltbie said.
``If Casey is 6-over, his coverage is over.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC plans live coverage thursday and Friday from 2 to 6 p.m. The
third and fourth rounds will air Saturday and Sunday from 2 to 8
p.m.

GOLF MANUFACTURERS NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the US Golf Association announced Wednesday that it will
continue to study advances in club and ball design and construction
before imposing new _ and much feared _ restrictions, golf
equipment manufacturers proclaimed themselves relieved and pleased.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, major equipment makers in the $2.5 billion
industry, including Titleist and Spalding in Massachusetts, had
mounted a public relations offensive. They feared that the USGA,
the governing body of professional and recreational golf, was
poised to adopt Draconian restrictions that would even ban clubs
currently used on the professional tours and at the local country
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking a more conservative and rational approach and
they've done a good job of listening to the manufacturers and the
consumers,'' said Scott Kreelman, executive vice president of
Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers feared that the USGA would use the eve of the
US Open in San Francisco to announce new rules that would ban
several new clubs and balls and sharply curtail future research and
design.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of new technologies and the impact on the game is
being played out amid enormous stakes for the manufacturers and the
USGA alike.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of clubs earned $1.7 billion in wholesale business
in 1997, an increase of 74 percent in just four years, according to
the National Golf Foundation, an industry-supported research group.
Manufacturers of golf balls made $667 million in wholesale business
last year, an increase of 23 percent from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   New USGA rules would strike at the heart of the industry, which
relies heavily on major advancements in technology to market new
products every few years. But when top USGA officials took the
microphones at The Olympic Club golf course in San Francisco
Wednesday, they were anything but confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not uncomfortable with what we see on the market
today,'' said David Fay, USGA executive director. ``We don't
believe that clubs submitted at this point have lessened the skill
to play the game at championships such as the US Open or at a
recreational level.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay and other USGA officials outlined a plan to establish a
formula to measure the ``spring-like effect'' that occurs when a
club face hits a ball. What the officials, and many golfers, are
concerned about is that new technology may be artificially putting
more power into shots.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for determining the maximum allowable effect will be
sent to manufacturers in a proposed protocol within the next few
weeks, Fay said. The companies will then be allowed the rest of the
summer to comment on the proposal, before meeting formally with the
USGA to discuss the issue further in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Fay also said that the USGA continues to examine golf balls in
an attempt to determine an acceptable level of design advancements.
He said no restrictions are currently contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers, though, remain concerned that the USGA may
eventually seek to halt the enormous strides in technology that
have made clubs lighter, more accurate, and capable of striking a
ball farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USGA still feels it needs to protect the game from
equipment manufacturers, and I strongly disagree with that,'' said
Donald Dye, chief executive of Callaway Golf Co., the Carlsbad,
Calif., manufacturer that has led the way in club designs. ``But,
at least now, consumers will feel comfortable buying what we have
in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA's concern is that younger, stronger players, combined
with space-age technology and materials, will overwhelm courses.
The association has already turned down a bid by the Merion Golf
Club outside of Philadelphia to host its fifth US Open because the
course is not long enough. Perhaps most alarmingly, the famed Old
Course at St. Andrews in Scotland is planning to lengthen its
layout, a massive bit of construction and landscaping that some in
the sport consider to be sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   And, on June 9, the Augusta National course, which annually
hosts the Masters tournament, announced plans to lengthen a few
holes and to add trees to counter the game's big hitters. Just a
year ago, Augusta said it would never consider such changes.
</P>
<P>
   The average drive on the PGA Tour has increased from 260 yards
to 269 yards in five years. In that time, several companies have
introduced clubs and balls, each promising to deliver easier,
longer, more accurate play. Perhaps the major factor in the
increase of sales of clubs is this repeated introduction of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist, a division of Fortune Brands in Fairhaven, and
Spalding, in Chicopee, control 70 percent of the market in golf
balls. Both companies have been fighting a continual war for market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the battle is waged in company laboratories, where as
many as 50 research and design workers compete. New balls with new
promises of longer, more accurate flight are introduced virtually
every other year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spalding and Titleist are in a tong war right now,'' said
Richard Haskell, the retired executive director of the
Massachusetts Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the companies are highly motivated by the bottom line
in terms of what they make and whatever advancements they can get
out on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway is a strong example of how new designs lead to greater
sales. In 1989, the year before its revolutionary club, the Big
Bertha, was launched, the company reported sales of $20 million.
Last year, after consecutive progeny of Big Bertha were brought to
market, the company was reporting sales of $842 million. Sales now
surpass that of its four next rivals combined; before the birth of
Big Bertha, it was the sixth-largest club maker.
</P>
<P>
   And when it appeared that the USGA might eliminate the
large-headed clubs, Callaway's stock plunged, falling 54 percent in
the first quarter of this year. Wednesday, with the encouraging
announcement by the USGA, Callaway stock rose by 1 1/4, closing at
19 13/16.

CASEY MARTIN DEBATE ROLLS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was late Wednesday afternoon and Casey Martin
had just tapped his last stroke for fun before the start of the US
Open today. A downhill putt from directly above the hole on the
18th green of The Olympic Club, a seeming simple putt, but one that
snaked left, right, and left once again _ three breaks within 10
feet _ and then Martin walked away from his practice round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey?'' a media member approached Martin just above the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got one question,'' said Martin, not in petulance, not
in anger, but not in any need to practice for the media anymore,
either, ``so make it good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the basic ``how do you feel heading into your first
Open?'' question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' replied Martin, the words pouring out
quickly. ``People have treated me great ... the USGA has treated me
great ... I'm just overwhelmed ... it's wonderful ... OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer wasn't much better than the question, but at least it
was finished in 10 seconds. Martin then headed up the steep hill
from the 18th green to the clubhouse. Here Martin was so much more
at home, stopping to autograph an Olympic pin for this boy, a
charcoal drawing of the Olympic clubhouse for this woman, an
Olympic hat for that man, a golf ball for this boy, and a US Open
program for that girl. From one side and to other of the gallery
ropes Martin alternated, signing everything, answering every call
of ``Casey?'' with his attention and then his pen.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, Martin had walked the 30 yards the
clubhouse. His limp had not seemed as pronounced on the uphill walk
as it had on the golf course, but his wide smile was as warm as
this Pacific day itself. It had been just as wide on the golf
course, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin teed off on the 11th hole, for instance, Mark
Cunningham, a 33-year-old from Sacramento, was waiting below the
tee. Cunningham recently had cancer surgery and he made a point to
head out to Olympic ``just so I could see Casey.'' The club and
USGA had provided Cunningham with a one-person cart _ exactly like
the one that misfired for Martin during an earlier practice round _
so he could get around the hilly course.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham motored his cart from hole to hole just as Martin,
now with a regulation two-person cart, motored from hole to hole,
parking it at spots USGA official Jerry Waterman suggested, leaving
it behind a green here or off to the side of a green there.
Cunningham, though, knew he had parked his cart at exactly the
right spot there just below the 11th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey?'' shouted Cunningham to Martin. ``Casey?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin spotted him and came over to Cunningham. Martin gave his
autograph to an ecstatic Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger who?'' shouted Cunningham. ``There's only one golfer,
it's Casey.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went, time and again and again and again, Martin's
popularity immense. Indeed, the whole debate over the bedrock
principle of sport _ competition is not competition unless all
compete under the same rules _ and whether Martin and his cart have
violated that principle can be conducted in the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   To little avail, though.
</P>
<P>
   That's because with Martin limping so painfully once he steps
from his cart and moves to his ball, the debate seems to melt away
as it moves so vividly from abstract to reality. And, after a hole
or two, the cart seems barely noticed. Except when Martin is about
to park it near a green and needs to consult wih USGA officials
about where to park it, or what's the best route to the next tee.
</P>
<P>
   But, for those who have not seen Martin, who have not seen his
long and powerful drives, his irons flying on a string to the
green, and then his limp, the principle of sport _ the same rules
for all _ is more compelling. Jack Nicklaus typifies this opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Nicklaus said earlier this week. ``I met Casey
a long time ago and I said hello to him. But I don't know him at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But golf's legend once again repeated his opinion that a court
of law should not be fiddling with the bedrock principle of sport.
``I don't like the (court ruling) as it relates to the game of
golf,'' said Nicklaus, pointedly distguishing between what the
ruling did for Martin and what Nicklaus believes the ruling will do
for golf. ``But I understand the ruling and, from Casey's
standpoint, I am delighted for him as an individual. But I worry
what its ramifications are for the game of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is now a celebrity and celebrity now means more than
substance in America. Americans with disabilities have rights.
Courts have now intervened in sports through the Americans with
Disabilities Act. But for Nicklaus, there is a law stronger than
any court ruling, stronger than any President's order, stronger
than any act of Congress that worries him _ the Law of Unintended
Consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not questioning what Casey Martin the individual is,''
said Nicklaus. ``I am just questioning what is really the ultimate
question, what is happening to the game of golf. But somebody else
along the line is going to use (the court's ruling), I promise you.
I promise you it's going to happen, that somebody's going to come
in and say he sprained his ankle. `I sprained my ankle; I need to
have something.'''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, said Nicklaus, some other golfer not so clearly
disabled as Martin is going to demand a cart ``and you are going to
have a mess someplace. I promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson agrees with Nicklaus. ``The compassion must go to
Casey,'' said Watson. ``I wish him well. It's a tough position the
Tour has taken, but I think the Tour is right in the sense that the
game should be played walking. The compassion goes from me to
Casey. He's got a powerful golf swing and it's a shame that he has
that affliction. That creates a problem for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Switch now to golfers who know Martin, to those who know the
person as much as the principle of sport. The abstract melts so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that Casey qualified,'' said Tiger Woods, a
teammate of Martin's at Stanford. ``He earned his way out here. I
think it's great. And I think it showed a lot of courage on his
part to deal with all the things he had to deal with, with the
lawsuit and all the distractions of trying to play golf. Casey
shows a lot of guts. This is what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are others, who tread the diplomat's path. Colin
Montgomerie typifies that group. ``I think it's great for him to
qualify the way he did,'' said the Scot. ``I wish him all the
success because none of us would like to be in the position that
he's in.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you feel about Martin's riding a cart?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not for me to discuss,'' replied Montgomerie. ``That
is for the USGA and R&AMP;A (Royal and Ancient) to discuss. That is not
for me to comment on. I just wish him every success.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, for his part, said earlier in the week that he
understood the comments from Nicklaus and Watson ``and I don't hold
anything against them. I just don't agree with them.'' As much as
anything, said Martin, this week of his first Open, is one in which
``I'm just trying to relax and have fun and, you know, enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bedrock principle of sport conflicted with a golfer's desire
to golf. As Casey Martin played his final practice round Wednesday,
snippets of debate could be heard on virtually every hole from the
gallery, such as this from the seventh hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for him. He has a right to play,'' argued one man.
Only to be countered by his companion, ``But carry it all the way
through. Say a guy's handicapped and wants to play in the NBA and
says he has a right to play in the NBA and if he weren't
handicapped, he'd be good enough to be in the NBA. Should a court
allow him to play in the NBA in a wheelchair?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin may or may have heard this, but he already has heard all
the words. ``I am a Christian,'' said Martin. ``I have been
trusting Jesus with my life and He has been a faithful friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Abstract principle, human courage, a clash open for all to see
this week in San Francisco.

IT'S A GIVEN: THE 17TH IS A KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A gallery surrounding a green at a United States
Open will cheer anything, much like parents at a nursery school
recital. Even the mere fact of putter meeting ball. Anything to
justify seven hours of forced whispering, $7 hamburgers, and $5
croissants.
</P>
<P>
   But what reverberates loudest in the memory banks from the 1987
US Open at the Olympic Club is the silence of the gallery at the
17th green day after day. The sounds of silence. It was gruesome,
golfer after golfer trudging off the 17th tee to the 18th green, a
few ``tsk-tsks'' heard but so little applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally do not like the 17th hole,'' Bernhard Langer said
back then, a few minutes after walking off the green in a cloak of
silence, not even perfunctory applause. ``It is the worst golf hole
I've ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogeys do not garner applause and double bogeys generate averted
eyes and maybe a tactful glance away from the golfer and toward the
streets of San Francisco, which run by the 17th hole. Golf
galleries are polite, if anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what they can do with this hole,'' Dave
Eichelberger said 11 years ago after smudging his score card on the
17th. ``They can take a stick of dynamite to it and blow it up.
Matter of fact, they should.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17th symbolizes the Olympic Club; all three Opens played
here have had their destinies decided on the final holes, destinies
that have swatted three golf greats _ Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, and
Tom Watson _ and elevated one total unknown, Jack Fleck, one near
anonymity, Scott Simpson, and one other, Billy Casper.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the 17th that caused angst for virtually every golfer
on virtually every day of the three Opens played at Olympic, a
course as baroque as San Francisco itself. The course has 40,000
trees, is held hostage by winds off the Pacific Ocean, and, while
very short for an Open course _ only 6,800 yards _ is fickle and
subtle and nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th, Olympic's toughest hole, once was a 520-yard par-5 but
was shortened by some anonymous USGA Director of Masochism to a
428-yard par-4 for the three Opens played here. More recently, it
has been lengthened again.
</P>
<P>
   Still, golfers feel Olympic has tinkered with God's master plan.
The 17th is a dogleg left that slopes right; even in San Francisco,
a dogleg left that slopes right is deviancy.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1987, Bob Gilder was so exasperated by his bogey on the
17th that he approached a USGA official off to the side of the
green and said he wouldn't move from that spot unless the USGA did
something about the hole. Gilder had driven his ball not simply to
Position A of the 17th fairway but to Position A-Plus, cutting the
dogleg perfectly and the having the ball land on the fairway near
the edge of the left rough.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder then watched in fury as his ball was caught by the right
downslope of the fairway and began rolling ... and rolling ... and
rolling ... until it rolled all the way off the right edge of the
fairway into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, has it been mentioned that in the landing area the fairway
was all of 21 yards wide?
</P>
<P>
   And has it been mentioned that Gilder and virtually all the
golfers who had hit perfect drives but still ended up in the rough
now had a side-hill lie as they tried to hit a 3- or 4-iron from
the rough to an elevated green?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could really question whether the 17th should be a par-4
or a par-5,'' Roger Maltbie said the last time the Open was played
at Olympic. ``But the green is really designed for a par-5. It's a
very severe green to begin with, and it's designed to receive short
shots. But when you're blasting a 2-iron or 3-iron to the green
from the rough uphill to that green, well, you're thrilled if
you're just on the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, for the record, Gilder isn't still standing on that
spot next to the 17th green. He finally consented to move after the
USGA official he accosted promised that the grounds crew would not
use its Triplex mowers, which many courses use on greens _ for the
final two days of '87 Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a green on this course as fast as the fairway on
17,'' Jack Nicklaus said in 1987. ``There was a joke going around
that the Stimpmeter (a device that measures the speed of greens)
measures the speed of a ball on linoleum at 12, the green at 9, but
it reads the 17th fairway at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But the USGA, once meanies who bent no ear to criticism, have
listened to the complaints of the golfers. This 1998 US Open at
Olympic will have an altered 17th hole, as the USGA tries to show
its softer side.
</P>
<P>
   The solution?
</P>
<P>
   Make the 17th a par-5 again, as it was designed?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, no.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the USGA has kept the 17th a par-4 but has moved the
tee back 40 yards, so that it is now a 468-yard par-4 and golfers
will have to hit even longer irons into a green built to receive
soft wedges. And, yes, it is still a dogleg left that slopes right,
but the slope in the new landing area is not as severe as in the
old one.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA may have gone soft, but the pros are not conned. They
know only one golfer will be atop Olympic heights late Sunday; the
rest will have wallowed in Olympic depths.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fog billows and wind often bellows over the Lake Course of
Olympic, which Bobby Jones once described as ``the best in the
West'' and Ben Hogan said was his favorite Open course. Of course,
this being San Francisco _ where the normal can be abnormal _
eyebrows are not raised over there being not a single lake on the
Lake Course. But there is much else.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a flat lie on this course. When Mac
O'Grady finished his tour of Olympic in 1987, he sat in the
clubhouse, tapped a table in front of him, and said he was relieved
to find something _ anything _ at Olympic that was flat. Side-hill
lies are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers face shots at Olympic that they seldom, if ever, face
elsewhere. That's because so many of the fairways, not just the
17th, are reverse-banked, which means they are banked in the
opposite direction of their slope. Modern golf architects never
would dare attempt to get away with a hole such as the 17th or the
fourth, both reverse-banked dog-legs left.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic's galleries often wear parkas and mittens in June,
reminding one of Mark Twain: ``The longest winter in my life was
the summer I spent in San Francisco.'' Olympic is an evening-gowned
vampire, every fairway lush but sloped, every rough so
innocent-looking from afar but so inescapable when found.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Olympic's greens are minuscule and tiered. ``Olympic is
such a hard course,'' said Johnny Miller, a San Franciscan who grew
up playing the layout. ``Olympic's greens would be difficult to
approach from flat lies.'' But there are no flat lies, so golfers
must hit from those side-hill lies, said Miller, ``to the smallest
greens you'll ever see.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the weather is nice, Olympic can be nice. Despite all the
griping from the pros, there were 24 sub-par rounds on the Friday
of the 1987 Open, trying a tournament record. And more golfers made
the cut in that Open than had made the cut in any previous Open ...
despite the slope of the fairways and despite the greens of
postage-stamp size.
</P>
<P>
   For Tiger Woods, the Olympic experience may be mind-fraying.
Woods has said that ``the most difficult courses for me are where
they've narrowed the fairways in the landing area'' _ which is par
for all Open courses, of course, but at Olympic, the landing areas
in the fairways seem all the more narrow because of the sloping
fairways.
</P>
<P>
   And Woods would not be the first ``name'' to have been humbled
by Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Ben Hogan thought he had won a record fifth US Open
when Fleck, an unknown club pro, birdied the 18th hole and forced a
Monday playoff, which Fleck won. That was the end of the Ben Hogan
era of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, Arnold Palmer was up by seven strokes with a
mere nine holes to play when he decided _ the Open victory clearly
his _ to go for Hogan's scoring Open record. To this day, the 1966
Open is a touchy and sensitive subject with Palmer, as Casper
caught him on the 18th, forcing a playoff, which Casper easily won
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th hole on that Sunday is still etched in the memories of
Olympic members and golf fans. On the 18th tee, Casper listened to
his intuition and, instead of the iron he had used in three
previous rounds, chose a driver which he used to put the ball
squarely in the middle of the fairway. Palmer, with that so-quick
and so-flat swing that could so easily cause trouble, hit one of
his common shots, a hook into the left rough. Instead of thinking
about Hogan's record, Palmer was left thinking of how Hogan had
been caught by Fleck. Which Palmer was.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 Open was the end of the Arnold Palmer era of golf.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Tom Watson took a one-stroke lead into the final round,
but Simpson birdied 14, 15, and the 609-yard 16th _ a truly
memorable series of consecutive birdies _ to edge Watson by a
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   That 1987 Open was the end of the Tom Watson era of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Three of golf's all-time greats saw their careers turn on
Olympic's slopes and begin their slides downhill, faster ... and
faster ... and faster.

   CHINA-MOTOROLA _ BEIJING _ Motorola, determined to grow into a
$2.5 billion business in China by the year 2000, on Thursday held a
festive grand opening for the 1,000 headquarters employees who
moved into the company's 18-story North Asia Center headquarters at
one of the most prestigious spots in downtown Beijing. And on June
29, with President Clinton in town, Motorola will take one more
step toward that goal when it signs a $225 million agreement in the
Great Hall of the People to expand a semiconductor component plant
that already makes 1.4 billion components a year. One of the
striking features of the new building is a mockup, about 10 feet
tallk of a Chinese Long March rocket that launches Motorola's
Iridium satellites. The rocket mockup stands in the center of the
Motorola's mini-museum on the first floor of the Asia center.
Reporters weren't allowed to enter the building officially and
weren't invited to the opening. A corporate PR vice president
assures in an interview afterword that the expansion in China isn't
linked to the cutback of 15,000 Motorola jobs elsewhere in the
word. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News Service).

THESE FAT CATS AREN'T AFRAID TO SHARE THE WEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 100 years ago, Andrew Carnegie implored
his megarich compadres to give away a good chunk of their fortunes
so that they might accomplish two goals: Even out the imbalance
between them and the have-nots, and escape the ``condemnation of
the selfish millionaire's unworthy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the midst of millionaire-lousy America, Carnegie's
plea might be in the nascent stages of resurrection. Despite the
obscene (and growing) gap between the very rich and the destitute,
all kinds of well-off and just-plain-comfortable folks are
beginning to think about someone besides themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, an organization of fairly radical fat cats called
``Responsible Wealth'' will meet in Oakland, Calif., to discuss
ways in which they can ``take action to create a fairer economy and
shared prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new group of about 250 wealthy but low-profile
individuals, Responsible Wealth isn't satisfied just to give away
money. No, the organization is founded on the belief that there is
something very wrong with just 1 percent of the population owning
40 percent of the nation's wealth while one in four children lives
in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Responsible Wealth say that rich people benefited
disproportionately from the amassing of the national debt, so rich
people ought to carry the biggest share of the burden in reduction
of the debt. They think it is wrong that debt reduction is
happening instead through welfare and social service cuts to
children, the poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable but true, they're for serious campaign reform, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you're rich or if you know a rich person, you can contact
Responsible Wealth at 617-423-2148 or by e-mail at rw(at)stw.org.
</P>
<P>
   Another national group, Leave A Legacy, aims to raise the
charity consciousness of just about everyone who isn't on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to generous tax breaks for charitable trusts, bequests
and other gifts, most people in the middle classes and above can
make a lasting difference with their dough. And it doesn't have to
hurt. The trick is to build the giving into a last will and
testament.
</P>
<P>
   Some significant numbers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning with the wealthy, at least eight in 10 Americans who
earn $1 million or more each year leave not a penny to charity in
their wills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Americans, age 60 and older, have amassed a collective
personal fortune of $10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among estates that are worth at least $600,000, only 17
percent bother to leave anything to charity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer than half of adult Americans even have a will or legal
plan for their estate. Only 6 percent of those who do have a plan
have included something for a charity.
</P>
<P>
   _ While 70 percent of the population donates something each year
to religious institutions, nonprofit organizations or sundry causes
_ for a total of $130 billion _ more than half of all charitable
giving comes from people whose annual earnings are $50,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you don't have to be rich to be a
philanthropist. You just have to think about giving after you're
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Among possible ways to make your money do posthumous good: Buy a
new life insurance policy and name your favorite cause as
beneficiary; change the beneficiary on an existing policy, or name
a charity as the beneficiary of an IRA or pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Leave A Legacy has lots of other helpful (and free) ideas and
information. Call 888-747-0454 or visit the website,
www.leavealegacy.org.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, remember Andrew Carnegie. You don't have to be a
millionaire to escape the condemnation of a selfish, unworthy life.

   BEIJING _ Multi-colored confetti fluttered in the breeze as
Motorola's board chairman led a grand opening party Thursday for
the proud tower that is an emblem of the company's growing $1.1
billion investment in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China and Motorola _ Reaching For the Sky,'' read a red and
white banner draped on a wall outside.
</P>
<P>
   The striking new 18-story Motorola North Asia Center, a curved
sky blue glass tower in the heart of Beijing's most prestigious
business district, will house 1,000 of Motorola's 10,000 employees
in China. The occupants, many of whom moved into their offices
Thursday, include beeper sales managers, trademark piracy lawyers
and Iridium satellite engineers.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the high-tech theme, Motorola also opened the
doors on a museum inside the headquarters that features a
10-foot-tall mock-up of a Chinese Long March 2C rocket. The display
depicts launching a pair of Motorola communications satellites for
the company's nearly-completed Iridium global satellite phone
network.
</P>
<P>
   China has already launched six of the 72 satellites for Iridium
and is due to shoot up two more Iridium satellites within a month,
Motorola officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building is a reflection of the distance that Motorola
has traveled in China in a relatively short time, just over 10
years,'' Motorola chairman Gary Tooker told his Chinese employees.
The session was closed to reporters, but his remarks were later
quoted by two corporate spokespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Though the year-long Asian financial crisis has whacked
Motorola's profits and forced the company to cut its worldwide
payroll by 15,000 jobs, Tooker's presence symbolized the company's
bullish outlook on this technology-crazed nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Tooker plans to host a second grand opening, to which
Motorola customers and Chinese government officials are invited.
Then, in 10 days, Motorola plans a third high-profile appearance,
this time during the forthcoming visit of President Bill Clinton to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Either Tooker or another top Motorola executive will participate
in a June 29 deal-signing ceremony with Chinese officials at the
Great Hall of the People, Motorola officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One of at least two Motorola deals set to be signed is the
ratification of a $225 million investment disclosed last November
in Motorola's Leshan-Phoenix joint venture in Sichuan Province.
That's where Chinese workers already manufacture 1.4 billion
semiconductor components per year, said Motorola Semiconductors
spokesman Steve Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Vice President Shelagh Lester-Smith, chief spokesperson
for the Asia-Pacific region, said Motorola's employment in China
has been rising, at the same time the company has ``reduced its
head count'' in the Philippines and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be totally inaccurate to think we are building up our
numbers in China at the expense of employment elsewhere in the
world,'' she said. ``What we are doing is looking to serve our
markets in the way they need to be served.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the company arrived in China 11 years ago, Motorola
(China) Electronics Ltd. has established ventures in provinces
around the country and grown into China's largest wholly-owned
American corporate subsidiary. The Wall Street Journal has reported
that China generated $3.5 billion in revenue for the Motorola
parent company last year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has created seven joint ventures and four cooperative
projects, ranging from the production of automotive electronics in
Shanghai to software development at Beijing's Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more favorable tariff reductions on imported equipment
for high tech manufacturing and other indicators of long-term
growth, Motorola expects to have invested (in China) a total of
$2.5 billion by 2000,'' the company declared in an annual report on
its China operations passed out on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's major manufacturing site comprises eight operations
in the Tianjin Economic Development Area, about 60 miles southeast
of Beijing, where it is building a $750 million high-tech
semiconductor wafer-fabrication plant. It already has plans for a
$250 million upgrade of that facility, which isn't even finished
yet.
</P>
<P>
   And that is at a time of sour news, as the Asian economic crisis
beats down its semiconductor exports from China.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Motorola Cellular telephone orders from Thailand have
been reported sharply reduced, and South Korea's pager business has
been trounced. The money woes putting a damper on Asian buying has
put the squeeze on Motorola, which had been exporting half its
cellular-telephone production from Tianjin to other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also has suffered from its long domination of the
analog mobile phone market. In China, European competitors recently
moved faster into the global system for mobile communications, or
GSM, a digital technology that has grabbed the attention of China's
huge mobile phone market.

   Even if you haven't seen ``The Truman Show'' _ and you should,
it's an oddly beautiful and intricately multi-layered fantasy _ you
probably know the trick of the movie is that Jim Carrey's whole
life is an orchestrated TV show taking place inside a gigantic
studio masquerading as a Florida seacoast town, with Carrey the
only one in the world who's not in on the secret.
</P>
<P>
   It's Voyeur TV.
</P>
<P>
   The main character's name is Truman Burbank. He's a true man,
get it? As for the surname, ``beautiful downtown Burbank,'' as
Johnny Carson used to call it, is home to countless TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Logic tells us nothing like ``The Truman Show'' could happen in
the real world _ that Truman Burbank would never make it to age 30
without figuring out he's living inside television. And the second
he realized it was all a charade, he'd demand to be released from
the studio-prison.
</P>
<P>
   Or would he? One of the alternate endings considered for ``The
Truman Show'' had the hero opting to remain inside the blissful
biosphere, where the days were sunny and bright and the people were
kind and considerate, and his own disposition was so optimistic and
worry-free he greeted the neighbors each day with: ``Good morning!
And if I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good
night!''
</P>
<P>
   Why give up a comforting bubble for the frightening unknown?
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there's a growing subculture of people who are living
in a kind of ``Truman Show'' of their own making _ the key
difference being that these human beings are volunteering to live
in a video fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, a woman Elizabeth gave birth while her husband, her
three children, a cameraman, a producer, a play-by-play announcer
and an online audience looked on. The event was billed as the
world's first Internet delivery, and viewers caused an online
traffic jam in their rush to have a virtual front-row seat in the
delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   Most amusing to me was that Elizabeth, 40, didn't want the media
to use her last name. Privacy concerns, don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the practice on ``The Real World,'' the long-running
``documentary'' on MTV in which seven young people, selected from
thousands of auditioning hopefuls, live together for three months
while film crews record their every waking moments _ outside of the
bathroom and bedroom, that is.
</P>
<P>
   This year's edition was filmed in Seattle. They've already done
New York, L.A., San Francisco, London, Miami and Boston. Sooner or
later they're going to come to Chicago, whether we want them to or
not.
</P>
<P>
   They never use last names on ``The Real World,'' either. They
have, however, shown a young woman named Tami as she went through
an abortion and also had her jaws wired shut in a sad effort to
lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   These women are saying: Film me as I deliver a child, record me
as I battle an eating disorder and go through an abortion _ but no
last names, please!
</P>
<P>
   Interesting where some people draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   Starring in their own personal ``Truman Show'' adventures _
though once again it's the subjects, and not some unseen
megalomaniacal artiste, who are initiating the filming process _
are the hundreds of ``personal cam'' and ``live cam'' websites
popping up all over the Internet. All you have to do is click on
these sites and you can watch real-time photos or in some cases
videos of people living their lives in stultifying detail.
</P>
<P>
   There's a guy in New England who has a camera looking out his
window at his backyard, all time.
</P>
<P>
   Another man in Las Vegas keeps a camera focused on himself as he
works all day. He types, he drinks coffee, he taps away at his
computer, he answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman in downstate Illinois keeps a camera in her
bedroom _ but don't get any ideas, the footage is strictly G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Several college students have set up dorm cams. Watch 'em drink!
See 'em study! Wait for Friday night and see if the boyfriend gets
to stay over!
</P>
<P>
   The most famous personal cam website is operated by a
21-year-old woman named Jennifer (http://www.jennicam.org), who has
been featured in numerous magazine and newspaper articles,
discussing the ``jennicam'' way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Each day hundreds of visitors to the website can view
continually-updated images of Jennifer combing her hair, Jennifer
talking on the phone, Jennifer kissing her boyfriend, Jennifer
eating dinner, Jennifer taking a nap, and yes, Jennifer taking off
her clothes in a very non-sexual kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not about Peeping Tomism, it's much deeper and weirder
than even that. Jennifer is a New Age exhibitionist who delights in
sharing her world, all of it, with thousands of strangers. She is
the spiritual godchild of Andy Warhol; she likes to be watched, all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the wannabe-stars on ``The Real World,'' Jennifer seems
completely oblivious of the camera _ yet we know that's not true.
The camera is the center of her being. As a child of the multimedia
age, Jennifer seems to believe her very ordinary life will somehow
take on greater importance and weight if it's broadcast on the
Internet, and as long as people keep visiting her website, how can
we tell her she's sadly mistaken?

   Even if you haven't seen ``The Truman Show'' _ and you should,
it's an oddly beautiful and intricately multi-layered fantasy _ you
probably know the trick of the movie is that Jim Carrey's whole
life is an orchestrated TV show taking place inside a gigantic
studio masquerading as a Florida seacoast town, with Carrey the
only one in the world who's not in on the secret.
</P>
<P>
   It's Voyeur TV.
</P>
<P>
   The main character's name is Truman Burbank. He's a true man,
get it? As for the surname, ``beautiful downtown Burbank,'' as
Johnny Carson used to call it, is home to countless TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Logic tells us nothing like ``The Truman Show'' could happen in
the real world _ that Truman Burbank would never make it to age 30
without figuring out he's living inside television. And the second
he realized it was all a charade, he'd demand to be released from
the studio-prison.
</P>
<P>
   Or would he? One of the alternate endings considered for ``The
Truman Show'' had the hero opting to remain inside the blissful
biosphere, where the days were sunny and bright and the people were
kind and considerate, and his own disposition was so optimistic and
worry-free he greeted the neighbors each day with: ``Good morning!
And if I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good
night!''
</P>
<P>
   Why give up a comforting bubble for the frightening unknown?
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there's a growing subculture of people who are living
in a kind of ``Truman Show'' of their own making _ the key
difference being that these human beings are volunteering to live
in a video fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, a woman Elizabeth gave birth while her husband, her
three children, a cameraman, a producer, a play-by-play announcer
and an online audience looked on. The event was billed as the
world's first Internet delivery, and viewers caused an online
traffic jam in their rush to have a virtual front-row seat in the
delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   Most amusing to me was that Elizabeth, 40, didn't want the media
to use her last name. Privacy concerns, don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the practice on ``The Real World,'' the long-running
``documentary'' on MTV in which seven young people, selected from
thousands of auditioning hopefuls, live together for three months
while film crews record their every waking moments _ outside of the
bathroom and bedroom, that is.
</P>
<P>
   This year's edition was filmed in Seattle. They've already done
New York, L.A., San Francisco, London, Miami and Boston. Sooner or
later they're going to come to Chicago, whether we want them to or
not.
</P>
<P>
   They never use last names on ``The Real World,'' either. They
have, however, shown a young woman named Tami as she went through
an abortion and also had her jaws wired shut in a sad effort to
lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   These women are saying: Film me as I deliver a child, record me
as I battle an eating disorder and go through an abortion _ but no
last names, please!
</P>
<P>
   Interesting where some people draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   Starring in their own personal ``Truman Show'' adventures _
though once again it's the subjects, and not some unseen
megalomaniacal artiste, who are initiating the filming process _
are the hundreds of ``personal cam'' and ``live cam'' websites
popping up all over the Internet. All you have to do is click on
these sites and you can watch real-time photos or in some cases
videos of people living their lives in stultifying detail.
</P>
<P>
   There's a guy in New England who has a camera looking out his
window at his backyard, all time.
</P>
<P>
   Another man in Las Vegas keeps a camera focused on himself as he
works all day. He types, he drinks coffee, he taps away at his
computer, he answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman in downstate Illinois keeps a camera in her
bedroom _ but don't get any ideas, the footage is strictly G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Several college students have set up dorm cams. Watch 'em drink!
See 'em study! Wait for Friday night and see if the boyfriend gets
to stay over!
</P>
<P>
   The most famous personal cam website is operated by a
21-year-old woman named Jennifer (http://www.jennicam.org), who has
been featured in numerous magazine and newspaper articles,
discussing the ``jennicam'' way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Each day hundreds of visitors to the website can view
continually-updated images of Jennifer combing her hair, Jennifer
talking on the phone, Jennifer kissing her boyfriend, Jennifer
eating dinner, Jennifer taking a nap, and yes, Jennifer taking off
her clothes in a very non-sexual kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not about Peeping Tomism, it's much deeper and weirder
than even that. Jennifer is a New Age exhibitionist who delights in
sharing her world, all of it, with thousands of strangers. She is
the spiritual godchild of Andy Warhol; she likes to be watched, all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the wannabe-stars on ``The Real World,'' Jennifer seems
completely oblivious of the camera _ yet we know that's not true.
The camera is the center of her being. As a child of the multimedia
age, Jennifer seems to believe her very ordinary life will somehow
take on greater importance and weight if it's broadcast on the
Internet, and as long as people keep visiting her website, how can
we tell her she's sadly mistaken?

`THE X-FILES' STICKS WITH FORMULA OF SUCCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The truth is . . . out there on the big screen. ``The X-Files''
is selling the same thing it sells on television. Selling it very
well.
</P>
<P>
   The packaging is bigger, brighter and a lot more expensive, but
creator/producer/writer Chris Carter has wisely stuck with the
formula that has been so successful for him and his
weirdness-besieged FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   That means lots of dark lighting, clandestine meetings in
alleys, gross, yucky dead bodies, strange things only half-seen
and, of course, the emotionally-intimate teamwork of agents Scully
and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even the title, ``The X-Files,'' is the same. ``Fight the
future'' is just an advertising slogan.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to a wider audience, Carter has thrown a few scenes of
background information into the movie. He's added some light jokes
that are more accessible than the dark humor of the show. The
heroes, FBI agents Scully and Mulder, play a running game of
``gotcha.'' When Mulder can't find a restroom in a bar, he seeks
relief in an alley on a poster of ``Independence Day''.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie is complicated and can only explain so much.
So, in what follows, there is some basic background information.
</P>
<P>
   Plot? Oh come on, you didn't really expect us to tell you that,
did you? Well, maybe a few tips, off the record, but nothing
classified.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David
Duchovny) have spent the last five years investigating X-files
cases, strange phenomena relating to space aliens and other
mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, who saw his sister Samantha abducted by what he believed
were aliens when he was young, tends to accept anything as
possible. Scully, a doctor, is a skeptic, assigned to Mulder to
keep him grounded in reality. Or maybe she's just there to make
sure his investigations don't get too near (ominous drum roll) The
Truth.
</P>
<P>
   After all that time together, Scully and Mulder still see most
things differently, yet they have a very close relationship.
Strictly professional, but close.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have obstructed their investigations. This includes
a mysterious international syndicate of elderly men who have some
connection to the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   As the fifth season of the TV series closed, several weeks ago,
the X-files were shut down. Mulder and Scully were re-assigned to
the FBI terrorism detail.
</P>
<P>
   When we first see them in the movie, they are investigating a
bomb threat at a federal office building in Dallas. Mulder finds
the bomb, but too late to prevent catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   (The image of the bombed-out building is a coldly manipulative
recreation of the Oklahoma City bombing, meant to give the movie
resonance by playing off reality and our emotions. It's tasteless
and disturbing.)
</P>
<P>
   The bombing is just a cover-up. North of Dallas, some kids (one
of whom is now grossly dead) recently discovered an ancient cave
where something very inhuman is living in the form of an oozing
black oil. The boy's remains were in the bombed building.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder is tipped off to the cover-up by Dr. Kurtzweil, a
gynecologist who moonlights as a conspiracy nut. Martin Landau, in
the movie's best performance, is perfectly cast as the haunted and
hunted Kurtzweil.
</P>
<P>
   How far out are Kurtzweil's theories? When he explains them to
Mulder in a dark alley behind a bar, Mulder says, ``They call me
paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI holds hearings to blame the Dallas explosion on
Mulder and Scully, Mulder gets drunk in a bar and briefly explains
the premise of the series to a bartender. The scene plays as an
inside joke for fans and a catch-up for non-fans.
</P>
<P>
   Between hearings, Scully and Mulder flit around the country,
following trains, hiding in corn fields, groping through a morgue
(an ``X-Files'' staple) and meeting in dark alleys. The mysterious
syndicate, which we see quite a bit in this movie, tries to keep
the aliens and its relationship to the aliens secret.
</P>
<P>
   How serious is the alien threat to humanity? Here's a hint from
a member of the syndicate: ``We are nothing but digestives for a
new race of alien life forms.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we're pulling for Scully and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   The climax finds Mulder trying to locate Scully in the vast
emptiness of Antarctica. At least, it appears to be a vast
emptiness. It is here that some of the series' Big Questions are
answered, sort of. And much of the movie's big budget is expended.
</P>
<P>
   How good is the movie? If you are a fan, it's pretty darn good.
</P>
<P>
   But also aggravating if you are expecting answers to all your
questions. Why on earth would Carter want to give us that? The
thing that keeps ``The X-Files'' interesting is NOT knowing the
answers. (Besides, Carter hasn't made them all up yet.) A few
questions are answered, and a few suspected answers are clarified.
</P>
<P>
   The movie looks very good, still dark and moody but with some
big action scenes and special effects. But if you are expecting
total disclosure, or ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' meets James Bond,
you are doomed to disappointment. ``The X-Files'' on screen is just
a good, big-budget episode of ``The X-Files'' on TV. Expect that
going in and you will be pleased, not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The movie could not incorporate all the characters or plot
elements from the show. Significantly missing is the sister
Samantha story line. Carter actually wrote a few sentences about
Samantha into the show, but cut them out as confusing to non-fans.
Maybe next season.
</P>
<P>
   Also absent: the little chess-playing boy from the last TV
episode, agent Krycek, the alien bounty-hunter and many more. You
will, however, see plenty of cigarette-smoking man, well-manicured
man, the syndicate, bees, black oil and . . . but that's telling
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now the big question for some fans: Do Scully and Mulder kiss?
If you haven't heard this on the grapevine or internet yet, why
should we spoil it? Let's just say Carter manages to have his
little joke twice in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not a fan already, it's pretty hard to imagine what
this movie can offer you. You'll be able to follow the story and
action well enough, even if some of the ``X-Files'' mumbo-jumbo is
blurry. But you won't have the investment in Scully and Mulder to
make it seem important.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Bowman, who often directs the TV show, has done a
good if not spectacular job of giving the show a movie size. The
pace is rapid but not frenetic. And the look by Bowman and director
of photography Ward Russell is dark and shadowy when needed, but
makes use of budgets and sets that let them open up to more light
and scale.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a special effects story, but when effects are
needed, they are convincing enough.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is all solid, though only Landau really grabs our
attention. Armin Mueller-Stahl and Blythe Danner are seen only
briefly as new characters.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Duchovny essential come off as they do on TV, not
exactly knocking us over on screen, but sufficient. Anderson's
intensity sometimes overwhelms Duchovny. There's even a joke in the
movie about Mulder's stone face being not much different from his
worried or scared face.
</P>
<P>
   As on the show, Mulder usually gets the best lines and most
action, while Scully tags along saying, ``Mulder, wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Will you need to see the movie to understand the show next
season? No, not really. A few things change, a character or two
dies (or seems to). But by the end, we're pretty much back where we
started. Just like on TV.

   NY-CENTENNIAL-FESTIVAL (New York) _ New York's music is the
world's music, the sound of every group to arrive since the Dutch
were met by the Indians. To commemorate the centennial of the
annexation of Brooklyn and the consolidation of the five boroughs
into one city, the musical celebration will be as varied, scattered

American punta music to jazz, oldies and alternative rock, the

   BONNARD-RETROSPECTIVE (New York) _ When Pierre Bonnard died in
1947, at 79, Cahiers d'Art published an editorial by Christian
Zervos, one of Picasso's mouthpieces. Picasso called Bonnard a
piddler. He said: ``Don't talk to me about Bonnard, that's not
painting, what he does.'' And worse: ``He is not really a modern
painter.'' Zervos parroted Picasso's view, and since Cahiers d'Art
was the most influential art magazine, his opinion spread. The
Bonnard retrospective opening on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art
should change some minds. By Michael Kimmelman.

PRINCESS DIANA WAS, IS FASHION ICON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 10 months since the accident that took the life of
Britain's Diana, Princess of Wales, much has been made of her
reputation as a fashion icon.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rush to enshrine her in an international hall of the
fashionably famous. Although no such honor exists in reality, in
the public consciousness it is as real as the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter half of this century, such a fashion honor has
been awarded to a handful of other notables _ Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, Eva
Peron, Princess Grace of Monaco. The mention of each name conjures
an instant image.
</P>
<P>
   What sets these women apart from the others named annually to
New York publicist Eleanor Lambert's International Best Dressed
List?
</P>
<P>
   Basically, these women would have been famous regardless of what
they wore. Yet each learned to use clothing to add luster to her
aura, becoming a symbol of fashion confidence and independence.
Each became an icon to whom other women looked for inspiration and
validation.
</P>
<P>
   But icons are made, not born. None of these famous women sprang
fashionably attired into the international spotlight without first
making some major mistakes _ unfortunately, not always in the
privacy of their own homes, palaces or Hollywood movie lots.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Princess Diana's birthday, the publication of a new
book may help us understand how a fashion icon is created, or
creates herself, as the case may be. Titled ``Dressing Diana''
(Welcome Rain, $40) the book examines her transformation from the
almost unknown ``Shy Di'' and Sloane Ranger to a svelte and stylish
beauty, albeit one not known for cutting-edge fashion.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 200 pages of photographs by Tim Graham and text
by Tamsin Blanchard, the book chronicles Diana's wardrobe from her
first tentative experiments with color, cut and pattern to the bold
fashion statements she made almost weekly in the months before her
death.
</P>
<P>
   The book also takes a look at the details of her wardrobe _ the
handmade shoes and bags, the beading and froufrou, her decolletage
(to show or not to show was endlessly debated in the media) and her
penchant for remaking dresses and hats in order to wear them again.
</P>
<P>
   It was Graham who made the photographs of Diana's dresses sold
at Christie's charity auction shortly before her death, and Graham
who photographed her many couturiers, their sketches and finished
garments.
</P>
<P>
   With unfailing British understatement, author Blanchard resists
pointing a sharp finger at mistakes and excesses, such as the early
poufed skirts and socks with high heels. But the real story is in
the pictures. Graham's photographs are invaluable eyewitness
accounts of the process of one woman's achievement of fashion
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question, what is fashion maturity?
</P>
<P>
   Joan Wilson, regional fashion manager for Neiman Marcus stores,
said it is a good name for the evolution a woman goes through to
realize her own style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `fashion maturity' sounds stodgy,'' said image
consultant Cathy Fitzpatrick. ``Diana was never stodgy. True, she
went from little girl innocence and fashion ignorance to fashion
icon, but in the beginning her hair was all wrong, and so was her
posture. She needed to be refined _ elegant and sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said Fitzpatrick, she knew that she was required to fulfill
a royal image.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, the clothes wore her,'' said style
consultant Gayla Silva Bentley, ``but as she gained confidence and
poise, she wore the clothes. She became the center of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   While it sounds simple, identifying one's personal style can be
a difficult and depressing task. The tendency is to fight reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that only comes when a person learns what to
expect from herself, when she knows her own body,'' said Judy Pryor
Otto, owner of Pryorities boutique.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your head, you may think you're 6 feet tall, but in
reality, you're only 5 foot 3,'' said Otto. ``I know.''
</P>
<P>
   While a woman might wish she were someone else, the fashionably
mature woman accepts what she cannot change and makes the best of
it. But personality also enters in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might put on something totally outrageous and look
gorgeous in it,'' said Otto, ``but unless you are comfortable, it's
a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Even women constantly exposed to the latest fashion trends can
suffer from fashion insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally learned that my style was pants, a crew-neck
sweater, a jacket and low heels,'' said Wilson. ``I feel
comfortable, I look good, and these are clothes I can work in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GROWING PAINS
</P>
<P>
   As a royal, Princess Diana did not have the luxury of a classics
wardrobe. ``But whether she was in Africa seeing babies or in New
York at an exhibition, she was always elegant,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   That elegance was the result of years of trial and error: overly
detailed clothes, absurd hats, styles all wrong for her age, too
many patterns, too little confidence. She battled eating disorders,
depression, diets and exercise regimens to achieve what finally
looked easy. And all painfully within the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a lesson in Diana's fashion transformation, it is
this: It takes hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Women may have to fight not only the stereotypes that others
apply to them, but their own hopes for a look that can never be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Rutan, owner of Leonard Rutan boutique, said he sees two
types of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One type wants to look covered and sophisticated, always with
sleeves that come down to at least her elbows, although she might
wear something strapless in the evening. The other is so confident
of herself she wants to show off her body, to maximize its impact,
even at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman,'' said Rutan, ``wants to take her place in a room
without turning heads. The other wants to have all eyes on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana, said Rutan, crossed the line: ``She was an example to
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Men rarely become fashion icons, he said. ``Maybe (Giorgio)
Armani. Men like his looks, the simple T-shirts under jackets.
Maybe Cary Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutan said he is amazed at the number of women who are
interested in improving the way they look, whether through
wardrobe, diet, exercise or even surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Not being afraid of making fashion mistakes, said Otto, is one
route to deciphering your own style, and for that reason she is
much in favor of teens experimenting with fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good thing. They are reaching out for something,
to make their own niche. It's never bad not to be a cookie-cutter
image of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Do women need fashion icons?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said Fitzpatrick, ``it's how they learn. Diana, as an
example, had a little bit of something for everyone _ clothes,
personality, walk, posture.''
</P>
<P>
   British subject Christine Lee-Smith, who now lives in Houston,
said she hopes Diana's influence will continue. ``Most British
women seem to dress for the weather instead of for fashion. They
never seem to wear enough color.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana learned well the lesson of using clothes.
</P>
<P>
   For political reasons, she seldom chose the top designers for
her wardrobe, even though two of the names at the top of fashion
charts these days _ John Galliano and Alexander McQueen _ were
Londoners. Instead, she turned most often to Catherine Walker,
Jacques Azagury, Victor Edelstein, Murray Arbeid, milliner Philip
Somerville and shoe designer Jimmy Choo for her handmade, size-6{
pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she put the seal of approval on the new quilted Miss Dior
tote bag with its dangling gold-toned letters, given to her by
Madame Chirac. But most often she carried small, nondescript
envelope bags made to match her evening dresses.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, there were the princesslike dresses of
Elizabeth and David Emanuel, who designed her wedding gown, and
David Sassoon of the house of Bellville Sassoon. She had been
introduced to Sassoon by her mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, and would
later take the young Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, daughter of
Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, for her first evening dress.
</P>
<P>
   After her divorce from Prince Charles, Diana added the slink of
an occasional Gianni Versace design (although not the sexier
pinned-together versions worn by Elizabeth Hurley). She added the
snap of Chanel suits and other designs from Valentino, Emanuel
Ungaro, Christian Lacroix, Louis Feraud, Cerrutti and Moschino.
</P>
<P>
   How does a woman know when she has achieved fashion maturity?
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said it may be when all the ultratrendy things she would
have purchased before become less interesting.
</P>
<P>
   As a woman settles into her own style, she is able to
accommodate fashion without going overboard, Bentley said. As women
around the world were paring down their looks in the '90s and
gaining confidence, so was Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The night of Charles' interview on BBC television, when he
admitted his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, Diana donned an
off-the-shoulder, ruched black chiffon with a neckline that dipped
low into her cleavage and a hem that began above her knees and
hiked well up one thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Was this fashion maturity, in effect showing off what Charles
was missing? Perhaps not, but it makes for a fascinating read.

ROSALYNN CARTER HAS OWN PROJECT: BATTLING STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LESLIE SOWERS 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For nearly 15 years, Rosalynn Carter has pounded nails
with Jimmy at his annual Habitat for Humanity Work Project. This
year, she's not hammering. She's got a medical excuse, and it isn't
the Houston heat.
</P>
<P>
   The former first lady has carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands.
She flexes her right wrist, demonstrating therapeutic exercises
she's been doing since last fall. She'd like to give hammering a
try, but she's afraid to risk the small, hard-won improvement she's
made.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years with Habitat, Carter lays claim to being a
pretty fair carpenter, and has worked on almost every aspect of
home construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get on the roof,'' she said, with a hint of
confession. But on the first day of the weeklong project here, she
has worked as a carpenter's helper alongside her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Not 10 minutes after concluding her interviews in a small,
trying-to-be-air-conditioned press trailer, which is as close to
cool as it gets at the Houston site, Rosalynn is back on the job,
ready to hand a section of 2-by-4 to Jimmy who's nailing in a
window header. It's 5 o'clock, but it isn't quitting time until the
tar paper and roof sheeting go up, and the face of the 39th
president of the United States has a four-alarm flush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about him,'' said LeRoy Troyer, an Indiana
architect who volunteers each year, coordinating the work at the
house Jimmy and Rosalynn help build. ``It isn't any hotter than it
was in Charlotte, but he's older. I won't put him on the roof
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Their days of roofing may be behind them, but the Carters make
few other concessions to age. Actively using the influence,
knowledge and connections of the presidency for a wide variety of
humanitarian causes, they are the pacesetters for a new,
appealingly vigorous style of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalynn's publicity tour on behalf of her most recent book,
``Helping Someone with Mental Illness'' (Times Books, $24),
included appearances on ``Good Morning, America'' and ``The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno.'' At all her media stops, Carter heard personal
stories of depression or bipolar disorder or other illnesses from
the famous and not-famous alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad when somebody speaks out about mental illness,''
Carter said. ``And that they feel like I'll understand.''
</P>
<P>
   She subtitled the book, ``A Compassionate Guide for Family,
Friends and Caregivers.'' The voice of compassion warms her prose
as it softens her air of friendly reserve. And a hint of
indignation peppers her expression of surprise that stigma about
mental illness persists so tenaciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why we keep having this stigma I don't know,'' Carter said.
``I guess it's just too close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Combatting stigma has been her personal campaign since she first
began her work on behalf of those with mental illness during the
years when her husband was governor of Georgia. In the intervening
years, her efforts on behalf of better treatment for the mentally
ill at the White House and through the Carter Center at Atlanta
always emphasize reducing the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   She believes the shame and secretiveness about mental illness
persist because they arose in an era when no one understood it or
knew what to do about it. The myths about mental illness melt away,
she said, once you understand the facts about its biologic
underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering suggestions and resources, Carter
updates readers on the newest theories arising from the research of
the past 10 years, a period designated by George Bush as the Decade
of the Brain.
</P>
<P>
   She warns readers that it takes a Ph.D. in biology to understand
the workings of the brain, and concludes her introduction to the
breakthroughs by wishing the reader luck.
</P>
<P>
   Every time an editor sent back a draft with ``Good Luck''
erased, Carter said she penciled it back in. If she were writing
her 92-year-old mother, she'd no doubt encourage her the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Researching the workings of the brain challenged her, and
finding a way to express them in simple rather than technical
language was even harder. But understanding the role of
neurotransmitters is crucial to current medical knowledge about
these complex illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   So Carter persevered in her research. And prevailed with her
editors. The ``Good Luck'' stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting time,'' Carter said. ``Now we know so much,
and there are so many new medications being developed.''
</P>
<P>
   She brings readers out of the dark ages when it was believed
mental illness was a curse, and dispels the notion that
neurobiologic illnesses like schizophrenia have their origins in
poor parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Poor parenting can make a child's life more difficult, but
modern brain research outlined in the book explains how genetic
vulnerability and environmental stress interact to induce biologic
diseases like depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and
schizophrenia. In explaining the difference between the sad moods
we all fall into and the illness, the book points out that
depression is a physical disease. It affects more than mood; it can
alter sleeping and eating patterns, energy levels and more.
</P>
<P>
   Carter believes these facts help decrease the shroud of stigma
that still prevents people from getting effective treatment for
depression. But she's not prepared to leave it at that. Currently,
she is brainstorming with others to create a national anti-stigma
campaign that might feature prominent figures speaking out about
their personal experiences with depression.
</P>
<P>
   The book makes a start with human sagas from Rod Steiger, who
has lived with major depression, and from Margot Kidder who talks
about her nationally publicized episode with bipolar disorder.
</P>
<P>
   While Carter's book offers resources, including the chapters on
treatment, and advice for caregivers, it is the people stories that
reveal mental illness for the ordinary experience it truly is.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary does not mean painless, and the losses are chronicled.
But there's something almost reassuring in Carter's conversations
with her neighbor from Plains when they meet up in the town
drugstore. Or her support of a friend in seeking medication to help
him return to the work he still wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has begun to expand her work on mental illness beyond
this country. A leader in the World Federation for Mental Health,
Carter is involved in raising awareness of mental health issues in
developing countries that have no information about the diseases
and a high prevalence
</P>
<P>
   While traveling in Africa in her role as the vice-chair of the
Carter Center, Carter visited an orphanage in Liberia being run
with no help by two women who cooked gruel for the children in a
can on a brick in the back yard. The mentally ill children received
no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the worst things I've ever seen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her work at the Carter Center encompasses many issues in
addition to mental health, from inner city poverty to election
monitoring in developing countries. She co-founded a national
vaccination program for toddlers. But everywhere, including today
amid the pounding of thousands of hammers, people find her to talk
about mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   A woman told her about her daughter's recent diagnosis of
bipolar disorder and the doctor's recommendation that she read
Carter's new book.
</P>
<P>
   For all her straightforward, down-to-earth qualities, you can't
miss a little bit of thrill in her voice. Being an author can be a
vulnerable experience. Even for a first lady.

<P>
   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ This time around, Japan may have actually
put some teeth into the effort to clean up the nation's debt-ridden
banks. In trading Thursday, the yen held its gains against the
dollar and Asian stock prices soared, jumping 4.4 percent in Tokyo
and 6.4 percent in Hong Kong. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   DOLLAR-ASSESS (Washington) _ The United States has embarked on a
risky strategy to prevent a broader meltdown of economies around
the globe, from Russia to Latin America. The problem, Clinton aides
readily admit, is that the huge currency intervention the United
States launched Wednesday actually takes some of the pressure off
Japan to act _ and unless Japan acts, the temporary effects of
buying yen will be washed away. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The trade deficit in goods and
services jumped in April as exports tumbled because of Asia's deep
downturn. The higher-than-expected trade gap suggested that
economic growth in the United States is slowing, easing inflation
fears but underscoring American vulnerability to the worsening
situation across the Pacific. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-ECON (Undated) _ South Korea's Financial Supervisory
Commission, the new regulatory watchdog for the nation's ailing
financial system, signs a virtual death warrants for 55 companies

<P>
   NY-CENTENNIAL-FESTIVAL (New York) _ New York's music is the
world's music, the sound of every group to arrive since the Dutch
were met by the Indians. To commemorate the centennial of the
annexation of Brooklyn and the consolidation of the five boroughs
into one city, the musical celebration will be as varied, scattered
and unpredictable as the city itself. From brass bands to Central
American punta music to jazz, oldies and alternative rock, the
centennial offers glimpses of New York's many musical worlds. By
Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   BONNARD-RETROSPECTIVE (New York) _ When Pierre Bonnard died in
1947, at 79, Cahiers d'Art published an editorial by Christian
Zervos, one of Picasso's mouthpieces. Picasso called Bonnard a
piddler. He said: ``Don't talk to me about Bonnard, that's not
painting, what he does.'' And worse: ``He is not really a modern
painter.'' Zervos parroted Picasso's view, and since Cahiers d'Art
was the most influential art magazine, his opinion spread. The
Bonnard retrospective opening on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art
should change some minds. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   BRADY-PORTRAIT-EXHIBIT (New York) _ ``Mathew Brady's Portraits:
Images as History, Photography as Art,'' at the International
Center of Photography Midtown, is billed as ``the first time since
his studio closed over a century ago that the full range of his
work is gathered together in one place.'' Mary Panzer, curator of
photographs at the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian
Institution, which organized the exhibition, selected more than 100
images for this show, including Civil War photographs. She also
wrote the accompanying book, ``Mathew Brady and the Image of
History'' (Smithsonian Institution Press). By Vicki Goldberg.

QUIRKY DESIGNER IGNORES CRITICISM TO PURSUE HER OWN VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Playful designer Betsey Johnson's April runway
show in New York took a very bad hit from the fashion press. Trashy
and irrelevant. Tasteless. Over-the-top. Unsalable.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Johnson, the 55-year-old sprite who started her career 30
years ago designing for the ultra-hip Paraphernalia and Betsey
Bunky Nini stores, thought her show was a shot in the arm. ``It
turned out phenomenally for us. The press just didn't understand
it. I wanted to establish myself more as: Me. Special. Cool. Hip.
Hot. I had to go to extremes. I felt that I was losing my creative
designer personality on the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shows are so much more unrealistic,'' chimes in Lulu
Johnson, Betsey's 23-year-old daughter and design partner.
Johnson-the-Younger is in charge of the new, pricier Ultra line.
``Still, Betsey can't stand to see a model dressed head-to-toe
properly like you'd be on the street. With Betsey, you have to use
your imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a regular fixture in San Francisco in 1987 when her
first boutique went in and she was painting Pippi
Longstocking-on-speed self-portraits on Pepto Bismol-pink walls.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't changed all that much since then. Her quirky style
remains the same: She dresses like a rich hippie with a combination
of flash (real diamonds combined with rhinestone rocks) and trash
(a slip dress designed to show off her black lace bra).
</P>
<P>
   She does her signature cartwheels on the runway at the close of
her shows in cut-offs. And in her gold and orange hair, she has
more extensions than the telephone company. She got married last
August to Brian Reynolds, a Briton, and, for the last year, she has
flown into the San Francisco area almost every weekend to stay with
Brian and his teen-agers at their home in Atherton.
</P>
<P>
   On her way to London, she decided on this recent pass-through to
do some press and press the flesh of the society kids.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is: They're not Johnson's core customer _ women who are
not afraid to rock 'n' roll and show some copious breastage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when the rock stars and hip-hop girls come into the
store,'' Johnson enthused over caviar and Champagne at the Balboa
Cafe last week. Her current hit list includes Drew Barrymore,
Madonna, Salt-N-Pepa, 'Lil Kim, Minnie Driver and Helena Bonham
Carter. Closer to home, novelist Danielle Steel shops for her
teen-agers at Betsey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The new collection, called ``Starlet,'' is
Fredericks-of-Hollywood-meets-Coolio. Models frowned down the
runway wearing long bicolored and platinum blond wigs, scanty
lingerie, burn-out velvet slip dresses cut so close you could read
their DNA, hipbone-skimming pants and puffy, quilted lame coats
lined in fake fur, the latter an obvious steal from hip-hop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, always fascinated with old-fashioned tattoo ``flash''
art, features denims with red, gold and blue flash patterns
translated to bustiers, bra tops, muscle T's and scanty bikinis
(for men), and women's bikini's (shown on Victoria's Secret
supermodel Stephanie Seymour, wearing little more than panties, a
monkey fur coat and a black-lipsticked scowl).
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as this show really helped me re-establish my energy
and where I'm going in terms of extreme fashion,'' says Johnson,
``it is not a true reflection of what is salable.''
</P>
<P>
   She explains that she designs 40 to 50 new pieces for her 23
boutiques each month. ``Our best customer is in the store two to
three times a week and we always want to have something fresh and
new for them.''
</P>
<P>
   She listens to her store managers and her salespeople about what
her ``girls'' want.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Betsey customer has more of a choice. With ``Starlet,''
she has established the genesis of a lingerie line. Also, in the
New York and Los Angeles boutiques, what was seen on the runway is
available, like couture, for custom customers, women like Madonna,
who will come in and drop $3,000 on tulle bras or gold-mesh dresses
_ reconfigured with nude slips or linings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a look. Definitely a look, this Betsey Johnson thing. Not
just cute dimity-patterned dresses, which are really Liberty of
London silks over-dyed in tropical colors just like the
lavender-and-turquoise slip dresses worn by Johnson and Johnson
over lunch, but a full range: from uber-Goth, fully covered dresses
and skirts that were so popular last season to this year's
body-revealing designs that have taken their cue from Johnson's
love affair with hip-hop culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom seems to be getting younger and younger,'' jokes Lulu
who, like her mother, sports a lightening bolt tattoo over her left
breast. Lulu is the one who tells her mom to cool it, that
sometimes she's getting too far out.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the time, Betsey listens.

 HER FATHER'S DAUGHTER   (For release Sun., June 21)   By SUSAN SWARTZ    
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was thinking about my dad while I was stuck in high grass with
a mulish lawn mower, cursing each unsuccessful yank of the cord and
sneezing my head off.
</P>
<P>
   I inherited his allergies. Also, his impatience and probably an
instinct to verbally abuse machines that don't go.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, teach me how to mow the lawn. That was his
Saturday morning chore. He'd be mowing like a maniac in the air
thick with pollen and dust and exploding with ferocious sneezes
that were louder than the mower. Eventually, with a red and wet
face, he'd appear at the kitchen door, announce that it was
``hotter than the hub of Hades'' and go for his reward, one of his
Genesee beers kept at room temperature in the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of my allergy attack, I smiled thinking how much my
father would have cringed over my free-form mowing style. He always
started at the same corner by the garage and finished at the other
corner, near the creek, making perfect right angle turns.
</P>
<P>
   Often, when I indulge in haphazardness or do something
spontaneous or lavish I think of him. He was a man of such
exactness and economy that it caused my sister and I to grow up and
commit small rebellions. These include tipping more than the
standard amount and jumping fully clothed into swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't until my epiphany in high grass that I saw I
owe more to him than I'd been crediting.
</P>
<P>
   I think my dad helped give me a voice. I didn't realize that
before because my memory is full of him keeping the peace at the
dinner table. If anyone would start to say something disagreeable,
his classic warning was ``don't go upsetting your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this I used to say that my father liked to stifle
free speech, but I wasn't being altogether fair. Maybe he felt a
need to protect my mother. Maybe he'd been taught by his own father
to not upset his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, my father was open to debate, as long as my mother
wasn't in the room. The two of us haggled. We stormed. Over
household rules and who I could or couldn't date. I can't remember
many topics that were all that engaging, except for our furies over
Nixon and Watergate. But we enjoyed the sparring.
</P>
<P>
   To go even further, I could probably say my father made it OK to
stand up for my opinions. His was the first authority I challenged
and because I wasn't punished or resented for expressing myself I
kind of kept on.
</P>
<P>
   While I never heard him exclaim that women should have the same
rights, advantages and opportunities as men, he never advised me to
be quiet and submit graciously to a man's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible my dad encouraged me to be a feminist. Isn't that
something?
</P>
<P>
   I was always my mother's daughter. I have no trouble coming up
with what I get from her, including some aspects of her looks and
personality. In the special way children romanticize their parents
after they're gone, I think of my mother when I see sunsets and
hear certain piano tunes and walk in the garden in bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   As for my father, I know I can't stand owing people even a cup
of coffee because of how he'd go on about moochers. I know he liked
hot peppers and couldn't abide a limp handshake but I didn't know
his yearnings or where he looked for magic.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know him like I knew my mother because he was an old
style dad. Mothers were everyday. Fathers were weekends and
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't spend a lot of time with him. Most of the time his nose
was to the grindstone because that's what his generation of dads
did. He was the bread winner, the head of the family, the king of
his castle. Those are roles that don't allow much intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Some who worry about the breakdown of the American family blame
it on fathers abdicating their rightful rule. They want to restore
control to dads, but I think they would be taking something
precious away if they did that.
</P>
<P>
   The way it is now with many families, both parents have to work.
Indeed, both often desire to work. But, no matter the motivation,
both workers also have to be parents.
</P>
<P>
   When moms work late, dads have to leave early to drive to ballet
school. Dads as well as moms take lunch hours to go see the
principal. Dads, too, know the names and phone numbers of their
kid's friends and stay home when the third grader has a stomach
ache.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would return us to the Fifties Dad forget that heads
of households were pretty clueless on what was going on at home.
Fathers checked in to administer punishment, pat you on the head
and ask how school was going. Many of today's fathers know more
about family matters than their own dads ever guessed at.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that dads cook and grocery shop and know when it's
time to buy vitamins, they're also accessible. If that's because
Mom isn't there for the time being, the kids still win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's important to honor your father. But you get to
know him better if he's in the kitchen and not on some throne.
</P>

DAUGHTER GAVE DAD A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITOR'S NOTE: In an annual ritual, Jim Loftus is celebrating
Father's Day by writing a column in place of his wife, Mary Loftus,
a columnist for The Ledger in Lakeland, Fla. Here are his
reflections on fatherhood:) (JT)  
 By JIM LOFTUS    
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sonogram was inconclusive. The doctor vague. ``Could be a
girl,'' he told me, ``but don't paint the baby's room pink just
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't need to be told that. In almost half a century, the
number of women in my immediate family numbered exactly one: my
mother. Of four siblings and six cousins, all but one were male. My
father had sons. I had a son. My brothers had sons.
</P>
<P>
   These were my thoughts in the days just prior to my second
child's birth. During that wait, I performed the daddy equivalent
of ``nesting'' _ wandering the toy section of department stores.
Since I was anticipating another boy, I was standing in a deserted
aisle admiring the latest MicroMachine playset when something
bumped my shoulder from behind. I turned around to find a Barbie
doll that had fallen off a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   It was an omen.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later I was the father of Sarah, an 8-pound, 2-ounce
baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   Having had no sisters, I was befuddled by a daughter. My son and
I bonded immediately, and to this day, I need only lose my adult
veneer to enter his world of action figures, miniature cars and
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after this Father's Day, Sarah will be 2 years old. I
have yet to overcome my confused wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Since Adam was a toddler, we would tussle and pillow fight on
the bed until we were exhausted. When I roughhouse with Sarah, she
tries to figure out the game but ends up bewildered more often than
not.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Godzilla toy frightens her.
</P>
<P>
   Building with blocks and knocking them down bores her.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided Sarah has taken it upon herself to teach me about
daughters. I am learning to play with dolls.
</P>
<P>
   I am learning that stuffed, cuddly animals may not be used as
handy missiles in a playroom battle.
</P>
<P>
   I am learning the names of Winnie the Pooh's playmates. (I am a
softer Dad. A low-volume Dad. A now-I-have-a-daughter Dad.)
</P>
<P>
   When my father visited last month, he spent hours sitting in his
favorite over-stuffed chair with Sarah on his lap. The patriarch of
five boys, my dad knows nothing of daughters, or granddaughters,
but his relationship with Sarah is one of enchantment. He simply
delights in her and the novelty of her gender.
</P>
<P>
   I envy that.
</P>
<P>
   But being her dad is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has made me an ardent feminist. To have a daughter is to
never look at women the same way again. It's impossible to imagine
her being anything but the best person for the job ... any job she
wants.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dad thing, I guess.
</P>

OPERA GOWNS: SPARE THE FIGURE BUT NOT THE POCKETBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For women searching for the perfect gown for the
opera this fall, be warned. You'd better have the perfect figure
and be at least 5-feet-8-inches. And have a very hefty checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the main message at the Nordstrom opera gown
show given in conjunction with the San Francisco Opera Guild last
week. In the main, it was: minimalist, pared down, body-hugging and
figure-revealing stuff with no sleeves, low or no backs, glamorous
but inconvenient trains, and decolletage for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   With one proviso: If you have any kind of breasts at all, save
them for Michael Casey, who still respects a womanly anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom did away with the usual stark white ramp and allowed
the models to pose in constructed, froufrou vignettes of rococo
chairs and crystal chandeliers that dotted the store's fifth-floor
corporate dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Nordstrom stylist decided to gild the lily on
a large number of gowns by copying Dolce and Gabbana's silk floral
corsages and plopping huge globs of live flowers onto the
shoulders, waists and lower backs of gowns, obscuring the lines. It
was garish and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 80 dresses shown, several were drop-dead sizzlers,
including a powder blue lace John Galliano for Christian Dior. It
was frilly, quite Parisian, and would look smashing on a tall,
toned person of the blond persuasion. Melinda Eng, a Seattle-based
designer, is probably the find of the show. Her pared-down clothing
with the (fairly) reasonable price tags were youthful, without
being too girlish, and almost Vera Wang-ish in their simplicity.
And Randolph Duke-for-Halston's gowns are glamour personified.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom showed the sleek-as-paint cranberry jersey that Minnie
Driver wore to the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wang's long, bronze coat with the jeweled cuffs over
a self-gown of silk charmeuse was absolutely traffic stopping.
Michael Casey's fairy princess gown with a dropped waist bodice of
gold and silver embroidery and huge silver tulle skirt was the
prettiest full-on ball gown of the entire collection, although
Tomasz Strazewski's black strapless with the black velvet bodice,
black satin skirt and pale satin lavender inserts was a close
second.
</P>
<P>
   For those women who cannot wear your basic slip dress, there
were gowns by Katherine Regehr, Mary McFadden, Chris Kole, San
Carlin and Stephen Yearick, whose designs are fairly standard, have
their devotees and smack of conservatism. They also have sleeves
and big skirts.
</P>
<P>
   For consistently beautiful dresses, however, the design team of
Mark Badgley and James Mischka have honed their skills and are
turning out some of the most beautiful gowns anywhere. Nordstrom
showed burn-out velvets, gold sequins and beaded lace gowns in the
neutral palette the team specializes in, with one exception, and it
is a sensational departure: a black-and-burgundy beaded, devore
velvet that could stay in the wardrobe of a truly fashionable woman
for years.

`X FILES' FILM TRANSLATES WELL FROM TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years back, when a hit television show like ``Dragnet,'' ``Peter
Gunn'' or even ``Star Trek'' tried to make the big transition to
feature motion picture, the inevitable question was: Can it rise to
the level of the superior medium?
</P>
<P>
   But in the '90s, as movies seek ever broader demographics and
film writing becomes increasingly infantile, the question a critic
must ask is the reverse: Will the series lower its standards to the
crass demands of the big screen?
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Fox's feature version of its own TV show,
``The X-Files,'' seems amazingly true to itself. At least, it's
shadowy, straight-faced, labyrinthine in structure, as paranoid as
Oliver Stone in a dark alley. And the producers haven't written in
a part for Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone not a regular viewer, however, it involves a certain
culture shock. Though the exposition is handled neatly (mostly in
one barroom confession), the film is quite happy to leave many of
its conventions (and recurring characters) unexplained. And its
lack of a neat resolution (which fans expect) may leave the
uninitiated feeling numbly unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a takeoff on the old ``2001'' premise, with aliens
landing here in pre-historic times and leaving not a sentinel this
time but a virus, which they intend to use as a weapon when the
time is right to help them take over and colonize the Planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the present day and some Texas kids stumble upon the
virus-storage site (or whatever it is) and pretty soon Agents
Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) are trying to
foil a 50-year-old plot between the virus-carrying aliens and a
band of high-placed human collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   As written by series creator Chris Carter, the script is more
complex and challenging that we're accustomed in our summer
blockbusters. So much so that I'm not sure I even understand its
premise, the whole alien-virus dynamic, who is trying to do what to
whom and why. Just who the heck is that monster the caveman is
fighting in the opening sequence anyway?
</P>
<P>
   And its James Bondian last act, with Mulder popping down to
Antarctia to save the world, is too long, too drawn-out, too
absurd. Other scenes are just as silly. As when Scully flies to
D.C. after a rough night in the Texas desert but doesn't think to
brush the dust off her shoulders _ or notice a bumblebee in her
hair _ until she goes into an investigative hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the film's brooding, sci-fi noir style is ultimately so
powerful and so overwhelming that the voluminous incongruities of
the script do not sink the ship. The magic of the piece is that it
so thoroughly sweeps us away in the intensity of its paranoid
delusion that we end up accepting everything the writers throw at
us.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the series stars _ Duchovny and Anderson _ also
comes across intact. It's hard to imagine either ever breaking
through to become authentic movie stars, but their restrained
yuppie dullness (which is almost broken here with a first kiss) is
curiously comfortable and appealing. They definitely work in these
roles.
</P>
<P>
   The producers also fulfill the mandate of the ``X-Files''
journey to the multiplexes: they make good use of the big screen.
The several effects sequences _ an Oklahoma City-like bombing, a
pursuit by thousands of bees, a flight across the Antarctic snows
as a gigantic mothership rises from under the heroes' feet _ are
impressively mounted and well integrated into the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files: Fight the Future. Directed by Rob Bowman.
Screenplay by Chris Carter. Cast: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson,
Martin Landau, Blythe Danner, Armin Mueller-Stahl. 20th
Century-Fox. 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.

`MULAN' IS A MASTERPIECE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART ANIMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news about `Mulan,'' this summer's cartoon musical from
Disney, is that it's a masterpiece of animation that defines the
current state of the art. Several of its scenes are so epic _ and
so stunning _ that they're genuinely thrilling. Visually, the movie
just takes your breath away.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Lion King'' was a staggeringly beautiful evocation of the
East African savannah and ``The Little Mermaid'' was a extravaganza
of underwater kitsch, this film also creates its own unique visual
world: an imaginatively stylized explosion of chinoiserie _ Chinese
patterns, motifs and embellishments.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not all this exotic beauty will appeal to a child
audience or revive the public's waning interest in the feature
animation genre is hard to predict. The film is much less of a
musical than its predecessors (with no show-stopping song). As good
as it is in most respects, it fails to be the kind of emotional
grabber that would make it an instant classic.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an authentic Chinese legend and set in some unspecified
dynasty of the late Middle Ages, it's about Mulan, the spunky
daughter of a wealthy North China landowner who disguises herself
as a man and takes her ailing father's place in the Emperor's
defensive war against the invading army of Huns from beyond the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a cheeky miniature dragon named Mushu (voice of
Eddie Murphy) provided by the quarrelsome ghosts of her ancestors,
the young girl makes it through basic training, distinguishes
herself in battle and meets the young man of her dreams before her
disguise is uncovered and the action shifts to a grand climax in
the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   It's roughly the same story as Warner Bros.' recent animated
musical, ``Quest For Camelot,'' but so much better in every way
that there's simply no comparison. It should instantly re-establish
the faltering (after ``Pocahontas'' and ``Hunchback of Notre
Dame'') Disney animation department as the industry's best, and
bolster it from the big challenge of DreamWork's upcoming ``Prince
of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Every shot is a treat to the eye, and the backgrounds _ aping
the muted colors and minimalist landscapes of Chinese scroll
painting _ are especially pleasing. The big scenes _ vast battle
sequences, an avalanche of snow sweeping away a whole army of Huns,
tens of thousands of extras milling before the entrance of the
Forbidden City _ are even more striking. It's the movies' most
effective combination of computer animation and traditional
hand-drawn cels to date.
</P>
<P>
   The character animation is also first rate, and superior to
anything put out by Disney's competitors in ``Quest'' or Fox's
recent ``Anastasia.'' The fact that Mulan comes off as a realistic
and appealing young woman helps the film work on a level that, say,
``Pocahontas'' did not. And the non-humans _ dragon, horse, falcon
and cricket characters _ are all imaginative conceived and
reasonably charming.
</P>
<P>
   With only four Matthew Wilder and David Zippel songs cutting
into the story _ all of them unobtrusive and none (including the
intended show-stopper, ``I'll Make a Man Out of You'') particularly
memorable _ much less effort seems to have been taken to make the
film work as a musical. This is actually a blessing, because the
milieu and story-line of ``Mulan'' really doesn't lend themselves
to songs and big production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring downside to the movie is the decision to have
Eddie Murphy supply the voice of Mushu and to talk in a litany of
'90s ghetto jive. What is this about? The filmmakers go to infinite
lengths to create a stylized world of Ancient China and then turn
around and poke holes in its delicate fabric every time the dragon
opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   According to Variety, Murphy's there to give the movie a ``wider
demographic.'' But it's a shame, because he definitely breaks the
fable, and cheapens the experience. What if, back in 1942, Disney
had hired Groucho Marx to ad-lib the voice of Thumper in ``Bambi.''
Or given ``Snow White'' a Jack Benny-like sidekick to widen the
demographic with cheapskate jokes. Would those movies seem half as
magical to us as they do today?
</P>
<P>
   Mulan. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft. Score by Jerry
Goldsmith. Voices: Ming-na Wen, Lea Salonga, Eddie Murphy, B.D.
Wong, Donny Osmond. Disney. 87 minutes. Rated G, suitable for all
audiences.

DON'T LET YOUR MIND GET IN THE WAY OF A GOOD GOLF GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A few days ago I thought a niblick was a can of
corn. Now I'm a golf expert.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are in a hip, ironic, politically correct city consumed
by golf, Tigermania and the U.S. Open. Sure, I could have gone out
to the Olympic Club and made fun of the toffs in their togs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I could have condemned golf as a crime against nature,
sport, good politics and our legally established domestic meaning
of the word ``partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, I went to the Mission Bay Golf Center to take a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're having fun, you aren't playing golf,'' said Jim
Smith, the cashier at the place.
</P>
<P>
   I must have been playing some great golf.
</P>
<P>
   I was sweating up my polo shirt trying to make a dozen parts of
my body bend in unnatural ways under the expert tutelage of
instructor Rodger Langlois.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't fun. And I hadn't even gotten to the really
ridiculous part of golf _ trying to put the little ball in a little
hole.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith asked me how I'd done, I told him I'd been hitting
pretty close to 150 yards (well, on occasion) with a 7-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mission Bay Golf Center is that driving range you see as you
get off Interstate 280 in San Francisco, the one speckled with golf
balls as big as hail.
</P>
<P>
   It has none of the disadvantages of the Olympic Club. You don't
have to apply and wait for years to pay the equivalent of an
average family's yearly income just to get in. You just pay for a
bucket of balls.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to have partners or talk or make excuses to
anybody. Nobody watches where your ball goes, and golfers and
parked cars are protected by screens.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you lose your ball. They're all lost.
There's a kid in an armored harvester picking them up. How many
country clubs offer moving targets?
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to walk anywhere or ride in a ridiculous cart.
You play among people of all ages, races, social classes and
genders. And you don't actually have to stuff the little ball in a
little hole.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it was my kind of place because I had to wait for my
lesson behind a dozen kids from a YMCA day camp. The tension
mounted, though, when I saw that some of them really could whack
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Langlois, a fundamentals kind of guy with a gentle voice, told
me that these 8- to 13-year-olds were the perfect age to learn
golf. ``They're so easy to change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I had a hard time turning my hips to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but when I did, the ball easily went 40 yards farther than
the longest ball of the best camper who was just learning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them already had taken lessons. A couple of little girls
had their own clubs. On Friday, Langlois will take them out on a
real course. Just give these kids a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the backbone of the sport,'' Langlois said proudly as
the kids packed up and left.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the next hour hitting balls while Langlois
adjusted my posture, I didn't want to talk about backbones.
</P>
<P>
   That's the last time I say golf isn't a sport. Either it's a
sport or I'm completely out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is a sport you really can't teach yourself. Langlois told
me that, and he wasn't just trying to sell lessons. He said that
just two weeks ago Tiger Woods went back to Butch Harman for a
tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best players in the world have an instructor to go back
to,'' Langlois said. I'm not so sure that's reassuring, especially
considering lessons cost $40 per half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm a golf expert, let me give some tips to folks like
me who learned to be repelled by golf in the Eisenhower
administration and now are fascinated by it because even
Cablinasians are admitted to country clubs.
</P>
<P>
   First, don't think you can play golf just because you were a
pretty good hitter as second-string catcher in high school.
Baseball and golf are as similar as radicchio and arugula.
</P>
<P>
   Langlois finds out what other sports you've played, just to use
as a basis for telling you what not to do. He theorized that I
hooked rather than sliced because I had played tennis back when I
had knees.
</P>
<P>
   The following are the key elements of golf, not as the careful
Langlois taught them to me, but as I sit here in my plaid shorts
remembering them.
</P>
<P>
   One: Take every limb, joint and extremity in your body and put
them in unnatural positions.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Move all of the above unnaturally over and over again.
Remember to keep your tongue tense, your lips pursed and follow
through with a muttered ``Damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Three: Keep your mind on trying not to think about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, golf is a mental sport that requires a blank mind.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the mind in golf is to remember bad jokes to tell
your compatriots, jokes somewhat better or dirtier than ``If the
object of golf is to get the lowest score, why play at all?''
</P>

FILMS OFFER TWO DIFFERNT LOOKS AT MODERN ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pair of movies open this week that deal with the complicated
nature of modern romance in very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Heaven,'' which played in the Seattle International Film
Festival, updates Henry James' ``The Wings Of the Dove'' to present
times and to Seattle without losing the essence of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' is a screwball comedy that features an attractive
black cast. It was made in 1996, but is just now being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Heaven,'' which also acknowledges a debt to Terrence
Malick's 1977 classic ``Days Of Heaven,'' belies its low budget and
manages to give the story a '90s slant.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to the iconoclastic casting of Canadian
Molly Parker and Australian Aden Young, as the white-trash, poor
lovers, Cynthia and Buck, and Brit Joely Richardson as their
employer, the dying, rich Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   The couple scheme to make Ellie to fall in love with Buck, marry
him and ultimately leave him her vast riches.
</P>
<P>
   But as in James' dark novel, the young man falls in love with
the sad, tragic heroine, played with beautiful vulnerability by
Richardson, and, for the first time, has purpose in his life
because he's actually needed. The actors manage to transcend the
awful melodrama of the material (a death scene is embarrassingly
histrionic) and are so capable that they even make some dreadful
lines seem viably heartfelt and potent.
</P>
<P>
   The other plus is the marvelous cinematography of Claudio Rocha,
who shot ``The Whole Wide World,'' and ``Picture Bride.'' Never has
Seattle looked so beguiling on film. Seattleite Meg Richman
directed and wrote ``Under Heaven'' and she has a way with actors
and, with a background in art, knows how to blend style, color and
light to create a Pre-Raphaelite look. It gives the film a sense of
timelessness that binds it to James' turn-of-the-century story
despite its modern setting.
</P>
<P>
   Richman, who recently adapted the W. Somerset Maugham novella,
``Up At The Villa,'' for the screen (it's currently in production
and set to star Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn), clearly has a
gift for period pieces and knows how to translate works based in
the past for present day sensibilities. Had she excised some
overwrought dialogue, ``Under Heaven'' might actually have been
heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Hav Plenty,'' writer and director Chris Cherot says he
``basically lied'' in order to get his first movie made, though he
swears it's based on his own, true-life story.
</P>
<P>
   The film explores modern romantic relationships among a group of
black friends and family over a New Year's holiday and, in some
ways, it's a fresh take on a soggy, familiar tale.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Plenty (Cherot) is a struggling writer living off the good
nature and generosity of his pals. He's been in love with one,
Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell), for years. When she invites him
to her family's D.C. home on New Year's Eve, Lee hits the road in a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Havilland is engaged to famous singer and songwriter Michael
Simmons (Hill Harper), an unctuous type who autographs a picture
for a fan named Melissa and tells her, ``You can't spell Melissa
without an M and an E.'' He's smooth and glib and, more than
likely, not very faithful to his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and after several comic mishaps, Lee finds himself
sleeping in the same bed with the woman he loves but things don't
transpire quite the way they should. Even after he admits his
feelings, it may be too late to salvage a relationship with the
wary Havilland.
</P>
<P>
   There are some clever moments and the cast is extremely
attractive and makes the one-dimensional characters more engaging
than they should be. But there's so much information missing and so
few reasons why Lee and Havilland shouldn't get together that the
film doesn't feel cohesive and flowing and it doesn't make much
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a welcome change from recent black comedies like
``Woo'' that are an insult to the actors. Compared with that
unfunny project, ``Hav Plenty'' is a breath of fresh air. Cherot at
least tries to find a new voice and reinvent a tired genre. The
problems may stem from the film's low budget, but it's a shame he
could't tie the story together in a less rough and raggedy way.
</P>
<P>
   Under Heaven. Directed and written by Meg Richman. Cast: Joely
Richardson, Molly Parker, Aden Young. Banner Entertainment. 112
minutes. Rated R for nudity, language, sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

`WILDE' IS A FASCINATING GULP OF PERSONAL HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great Irish playwright, novelist and wit Oscar Wilde had a
lot of bad luck in his life, but history has been extremely kind to
him. He's been the focus of a regular revival of admiring interest
every few decades since his death _ including a big ongoing one in
the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   He's been especially lucky at the movies _ the subject of no
less than three successful, mostly complimentary, British biopics _
``Oscar Wilde,'' starring Robert Morley; ``The Trials of Oscar
Wilde,'' starring Peter Finch and filmed in 70mm (both released in
1960); and ``Wilde,'' which debuted last month in the Seattle
International Film Festival and moves into a regular run today.
</P>
<P>
   All three films cover the same basic territory: Wilde's triple
life as a somewhat scandalous man of letters (``The Picture of
Dorian Gray'') and playwright (``The Importance of Being
Earnest''); a loving (if absent) husband and father; and
not-so-secret homosexual, whose affairs with various aristocratic
lovers and off-the-street ``rentboys'' eventually lead him to
become the most famous man ever publicly prosecuted for sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three films, this new one is, of course, by far the most
sexually explicit (perhaps more than it needs to be), as well as
the most intellectually honest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde (Stephen Fry, in a performance that won him the best actor
award at SIFF) comes off less as a martyr than a man who foolishly
lets his obsession for an unworthy young lover lead him into big
trouble that he might well have avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a fascinating gulp of personal history, directed
with assurance by Brian Gilbert (``Tom &AMP; Viv'') and filled out with
an exceptional supporting cast that includes Jude Law as Wilde's
selfish lover, Tom Wilkinson as the lover's vengeful father,
Vanessa Redgrave as Wilde's widowed mother and Jennifer Ehle, as
Wilde's long-suffering wife, who emerges as the movie's single
noble character.
</P>
<P>
   Another worthy film opening this weekend after a debut in the
Seattle International Film Festival is the unique German drama,
``Beyond Silence,'' which played not in this year's SIFF but in the
1997 edition _ and went on from there to earn a best
foreign-language Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A first film directed by young filmmaker Caroline Link, it's a
finely crafted, deeply engrossing drama of a young woman (Sylvie
Testud as an adult, Tatjana Trieb as a child), who grows up to
become her deaf parents' sole link to the hearing world.
</P>
<P>
   When she becomes interested in music and shows a special gift
for the clarinet, the attraction is discouraged by her stubborn
father (Seattle actor Howie Seago), a family crisis ensues, the
story gradually widens out to include several other characters in
the extended family, and the film comes together to be an unusually
poignant family saga.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Beyond Silence'' may well be the most striking and
original of all the deluge of first films in the last two editions
of the film festival. It's impeccably cast, sensitively scripted
and directed with a glossy visual flair and original storytelling
style that often recalls Link's great filmmaking countryman,
Douglas Sirk.

ENGLISHMAN FRY IS WILD ABOUT PLAYING LEAD IN FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Stephen Fry is a man of many words.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, they're impeccably and eloquently chosen. The
40-year-old, hawk-nosed (he broke it at age 4) Englishman has a
reputation as a ``Renaissance man,'' a title that causes him to
respond with an uncharacteristically short riposte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear tights,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a valid epithet. After all, he's published four
novels _ most notably, his J.D. Salinger-esque ``The Liar'' _ and a
volume of autobiography, adapted ``Me and My Girl'' for the stage,
and appeared in such movies as ``Peter's Friends,'' ``I.Q.'' and
``Cold Comfort Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also created a legion of fans from his TV appearances
alongside his regular comedy partner, Hugh Laurie, on the British
comedy programs ``A Little Bit of Fry and Laurie'' and ``Jeeves and
Wooster,'' as well as guesting on Rowan Atkinson's acclaimed
``Blackadder'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, he's also part of a tightly knit English acting
community _ an association that began at Cambridge University's
Footlights Drama Club _ that includes Emma Thompson, Tony Slattery
and Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   But the man has other fish to, well, fry, as he chain-smokes
through an interview at the Plaza Park Suites in Seattle. He's here
at the invitation of the Seattle International Film Festival to
talk about his first starring role, in Brian Gilbert's opulent and
emotional film, ``Wilde.'' Fry's portrayal of Oscar Wilde won him
the best actor award at the Seattle festival.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on Richard Ellman's definitive biography of the
late-19th-century bohemian writer and wit, opens tomorrow at the
Egyptian.
</P>
<P>
   The film focuses on Wilde's marriage, his fatherhood, his
success as a playwright in the ever-changing morality of the
Edwardian Age, and his eventual recognition that he was gay _ which
tragically altered his life in an England where homosexuality was
punishable by imprisonment and hard labor. Wilde's passionate love
affair with Lord Alfred ``Bosie'' Douglas landed him in court
opposite Bosie's disapproving father.
</P>
<P>
   Fry believes Wilde has a universal and everlasting appeal for
the young, citing the Irish writer's current resurgence. In
addition to the movie, David Hare's play, ``The Judas Kiss,''
starring Liam Neeson as Wilde, is playing on Broadway, and Moises
Kaufman's Off-Broadway hit, ``Gross Indecency: The Three rials of
Oscar Wilde,'' is having in its West Coast premiere at Seattle's
Intiman Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only speculate as to why,'' says Fry, ``but we all
respond to zeitgeists, and zeitgeists tend to be created by the
young as a rule. Up until the '60s and '70s, there was something
for the young to invest in, some point of view to believe in,
whether it be political or religious, to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' notes Fry sadly, ``the real cheat of this time is kids
are not pressed to reform or cut their hair by their parents, but
by the dire necessity of the competition in the labor market and
the fact that there aren't communes to drop out into. So how do you
find your individuality and that sense of wonder?
</P>
<P>
   ``In our college days, there were yogis and maharishis and Che
Guevara postered on the dormitory wall as a symbol of rebellion and
hope for the future. Since the downing of the Berlin Wall, a lot of
young people sense that if there is a saving grace, it's in art and
the intellect over God and ideology, and I'm with them on this. I
think Oscar Wilde stands for that. The two most potent T-shirt
images most likely to be seen in a university are of Albert
Einstein and Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein is more than a nerdy techno-head; he has a kind human
face that speaks of internationalism. And Wilde stands as the crown
prince of bohemia and the supremacy of art, and, above all things,
the individual. In that, there's still a sense of his downfall and
society's revenge on that individuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry says he can relate because he, too, is gay. ``I did as much
research as I could on Wilde's life. I read the biographies and
those of his circle, but the thing that most drove his tragedy home
for me was being on a set with two little children (who played the
writers' sons). Wilde loved his family,'' he insists, despite his
`passion' for Bosie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always two extremes,'' says Fry. ``Wilde's case was
a tragedy and by that I don't mean sad. The tragedy is not that he
went to prison and suffered humiliation and had his body and spirit
broken. The tragedy is that he never saw his children again and his
relationship with Bosie was ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, insists Fry, ``It was right of him to recognize his
nature as a gay man. He believed in that very Greek, Socratic
philosophy _ to realize one's nature, to be what we should be. But
it was terrible because it destroyed his marriage and possibly the
future of his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde was more the master of his fate and captain of his soul
than we give him credit for. He had flaws, but he more or less knew
what he was doing. Other versions of his life always painted him as
a gay martyr, a tragic figure compounded by vanity, hysteria and
blistering defiance. Ellman's book showed he had real courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde, the actor recalls, is ``one of the few role models'' he
had growing up gay in the '60s. ``There were no magazines or Web
sites. The only magazines were seedy pornography that was purchased
by men in raincoats in Soho.'' He laughs. ``There was no community
at all _ only the secret world of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fry, the theater and his crowd became his freedom. Yet he
has no idea why they have enjoyed such huge success. ``The obvious
answer,'' he believes, ``is if you get, perhaps, three people at a
university at the same time who just happen to meet and spark off
each other, they might just make a fire. There might just be the
right energy, the right excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get lots of letters from students saying, `Yours is a
career path I'd like to follow. How do I do it?' One is tempted to
answer, `Be lucky,' because I don't know. We never set out to do
it. If anyone did, it was Emma (Thompson), who felt she might be an
actor because both her parents were actors. But Hugh and I had no
heritage. We just sort of fell into it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he loves acting, he feels the same way about writing and
feels ``terribly lucky to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, does he prefer the stage or the screen?
</P>
<P>
   Fry laughs. ``I much prefer the cinema, though I know it's
terribly un-English of me to say so. We're supposed to say, `My
roots are in theater' and `Theater is my first love,' but the fact
is I get pleasure in theater but it's not in doing plays. There's
no pleasure in repetition. I had a nasty time with a play a few
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry is alluding to an infamous moment when he walked offstage in
the middle of a show, got in a car and drove away. There was a week
of speculation as to whether he was alive, dead or had a nervous
breakdown. Fry laughs at the memory. ``It wasn't rational or
logical and the end result was a kind of re-evaluation. But at the
time, it was a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakdown sounds hysterical and it wasn't quite that. I was
deeply miserable and I just felt I could not appear onstage again.
I had a crisis of confidence, so I just drove to the continent. I
toured through Belgium and Holland and Germany and then I saw an
English newspaper with pictures of the police swarming over my roof
at home, looking for dead bodies. I called my parents and my
friends and said I was fine. They said, `Come home and see a doctor
and get sorted out, otherwise you'll get sued for a million
pounds.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' he says. ``I knew it was wrong to do the play
but I kidded myself it would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about film is it's different every day. The things
people find terrible about it, I love. There's a slow rhythm and a
holding of energy. I'm so twitchy and hyperactive that filmmaking
makes me slow down. It's good for me. It's technical.''
</P>
<P>
   And he laughs again. ``That,'' he notes, ``is a quandary,
because I think art should be slightly mysterious. Filmmaking is a
little mystical but supremely banal and contrary. In a way, it's
really quite magical that the whole thing can ever come together.''

MULAN-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Disney's new animated musical breaks
the mold a bit with its new animated film, featuring a heroic young
woman who doesn't need any help from a man and has both of her
parents still alive. This excellent film demonstrates, yet again,
that Disney still has the magic touch when it comes to animation.
By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
WESTERN-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Seeing a western on anything other
than a wide screen is like a one-horse town with a hanging judge.
It doesn't do justice. Like-minded movie-watchers will be glad to
hear that Laemmle salutes 75 years of Warner Bros. westerns with a
summer full of them. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
MULAN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Mulan'' stands on its own as an
example of what the Mouse House still does best _ classic
storytelling, bold animation technique and zippy songs. These
elements combine to make this Disney's most appealing animated film
since ``The Lion King.'' 3{ Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
XFILES-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ First off, a disclaimer: I don't
believe in UFOs, aliens or Trilateralists. Roswell is just a spot
on the map, LBJ didn't whack JFK, and O.J. was not set up by the
Japanese mafia.I do believe in good movies, though, so I was
curious. Could I watch the ``X-Files'' film and not become lost in
a murky labyrinth understood only to Internet geeks and dateless
shut-ins? 3 Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
X-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ We learn more and understand less from
``The X-Files'' movie. Really, did you expect it to be any other
way? Fans of the TV show, and I'm one of them, have gotten used to
the somewhat radical concept of inconclusiveness as part of the
fun. Even when things are resolved in the series _ a monster
caught, an innocent exorcised _ it's always with an edgy, ``but
...'' attached. 3 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
DREAM-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ A sweet little film that convincingly
shows the blush and rush of first love. 3 Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
NILE-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ We catch up with Nile Rodgers, who with
late partner Bernard Edwards put the funk in disco supergroup Chic.
By Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ Caramel singer-bassist Andy Curran
collects vintage effects pedals that made it into his self-titled
debut for Geffen Records. By Fred Shuster.

`MULAN' BREAKS THE MOLD WITH GIRL POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know what you're going to get when you watch a
Disney animated feature and, at least initially, the studio's 36th
such effort, ``Mulan,'' neither surprises nor disappoints.
</P>
<P>
   All the conventions are there. The snappy songs. The rousing
score. The linear storytelling. The cute little critters who will
soon be disappearing from the shelves of Disney stores across
America.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mulan'' isn't like past Disney animated efforts in one
important respect _ the title character herself. Where many past
Disney heroines have been passive or dependent or waiting for
Prince Charming to come and save the day, Mulan takes matters into
her own hands. When her aging warrior father is conscripted to
fight the Huns, she cuts off her hair, disguises herself and takes
his place in the army. She's smart, she's strong, she's resourceful
and she's Asian (a Disney first). If Prince Charming did show up,
she'd probably find him a bore.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't look like a Barbie doll this time, either,'' says
longtime Disney animator Mark Henn, who has overseen work on past
leading ladies, including Ariel (``The Little Mermaid''), Jasmine
(``Aladdin'') and Pocahontas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that fact alone will make her a lot more accessible,''
Henn adds. ``That and the fact nobody will mistake Mulan for a
princess.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Mulan is often clumsy and never dainty. She fails
miserably during her interview with a matchmaker, spilling tea all
over ancient China's version of Martha Stewart. But she finds her
way once she puts on her father's armor, although she never loses
sight of the fact that she's a young woman, completely rejecting
her comrades' butt-scratching, nose-picking and
macho-for-macho's-sake ways.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan wasn't always so substantial, though. Five years ago, when
Disney animators began reworking a short feature called ``China
Doll,'' the heroine was a waifish Chinese girl who fought a losing
war against tyranny until a British soldier came and swept her
away. Nobody liked the character, so the writers went back to a
Chinese poem, ``The Song of Fa Mu Lan,'' for inspiration. But the
poem only took them so far. They were still battling the legend _
and the formula _ of past Disney epics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, she was more of a tomboy going off to play
soldier,'' says co-director Tony Bancroft.
</P>
<P>
   Adds directing partner Barry Cook: ``There was another story
line that had her running off to war to escape a bad situation at
home, either bad parents or a forced marriage. That didn't work.
Then she was driven by a romance she had with the captain of the
soldiers. And that just ruined everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, story editor Chris Sanders found the right balance.
Mulan would be a quirky, imperfect girl who goes to war to save her
old warrior father. She's motivated by love _ love for her father,
her emperor and her country. It's that selflessness, Bancroft says,
that separates Mulan from other Disney heroines.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to change herself and she isn't looking for a
better life,'' Bancroft says. ``She just wants to be accepted for
who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Disney's Florida animation studio.
``Mulan'' is the first full-length movie to come from Orlando, and
animators worked as if they had something to prove. Of course, this
being Disney World, many were on display for tourists while they
were working, coloring in backdrops in glass cubicles as tourists
gawked. But, they say, that fishbowl existence was a small price to
pay for artistic freedom from Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real pride of ownership,'' says Cook, who lives in
Florida. ``We weren't just helping Burbank; we were doing something
on our own. And that gave us freedom in a way because it made us
rely on our own resources. If we were in California, we probably
would have gone downstairs and asked for ideas when we ran into
problems. Here, we were more or less on our own and we had to come
up with the solutions. It made it a bit of an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bancroft believes that being away from Disney's Burbank lot
might have helped in another way as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on in the project, they weren't paying much attention to
us,'' Bancroft says. ``They were concentrating on `Pocahontas' and
`The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' so we had a little more leeway to
experiment. There wasn't quite the same amount of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   That same low-key atmosphere has continued even now that
``Mulan'' is finished and playing in theaters. Disney has lowered
the hype surrounding the movie by a good 25 percent, according to
marketing and distribution president Dick Cook, and that's
certainly evident in the way the studio is promoting the film. For
one thing, the marketing budget has been cut from the $60 million
spent promoting ``Hercules'' to about $30 million for ``Mulan.''
The new strategy: Let the movie speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   As such, there was no extravagant premiere like the $4 million
electric light parade that accompanied ``Hercules'' or the French
Quarter celebration and New Orleans Super Dome screening for ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame.'' The promotional tie-in with McDonald's
didn't begin until this week, about the same time most of the toys
began appearing. And the advertising campaign primarily targeted
adults, figuring they would be the toughest crowed to lure in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're being smart about the marketing,'' Bancroft
says. ``Instead of pushing the film down people's throats, Disney
is being a little more mysterious this time. I think it goes quite
well with the theme of `Mulan' and its setting in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everything surrounding ``Mulan'' has changed.
When it came time for Mattel to create a Mulan doll, the company
initially made her a carbon copy of _ you guessed it _ its most
famous ideal of feminine beauty, Barbie. It was all producer Pam
Coats could do to get the toy company to reduce the cleavage and
base Mulan's figure on Midge, Barbie's slightly less endowed gal
pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed that we couldn't get our own Mulan body
type because we wanted it to be true to the character and true to
the culture,'' Coats says. ``But at least she's less buxom than the
original version. I think there will be people who appreciate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Count among them actress Ming-Na Wen (``The Joy Luck Club''),
the voice of Mulan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian community needs this movie,'' Wen says. ``It's nice
to look up on the screen and see Asian faces and the Asian culture
spotlighted. None of the usual stereotypes are anywhere to be
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Prince Charming. Just a couple of the things that
make ``Mulan'' a heroine in every sense of the word.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With ``Mulan,'' Disney has toned down the hype
that typically surrounds its new animated features _ and with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' stands on its own as an example of what the Mouse
House still does best _ classic storytelling, bold animation
technique and zippy songs. These elements combine to make this
Disney's most appealing animated film since ``The Lion King,'' a
movie that will captivate children, and entertain and emotionally
involve adults.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's last three animated features _ ``Pocahontas,'' ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and ``Hercules'' _ haven't necessarily
been bad. Indeed, ``Hunchback'' managed to capture the spirit of
the Victor Hugo novel and make it affecting and accessible for
kids. But these three films all suffered from what Disney now calls
the ``sincerity'' issue. They were so overhyped that the public
became cynical about the studio's motives. Was Disney making movies
or merchandising vehicles?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the answer lies somewhere in between. And it still
does. With ``Mulan'' though, Disney seems to be starting to address
the issue and, in the process, created one of its most engaging
heroines. Mulan is interesting, quirky, full of energy, suffering
from little self-doubt and, physically, doesn't even faintly
resemble the kind of lap-dance ladies the studio has been drawing
of late. (See Pocahontas or ``Aladdin's'' Jasmine or
``Hunchback's'' Esmerelda.)
</P>
<P>
   Mulan's most obvious quality, though, is her selflessness, which
becomes evident early when she takes her frail father's place in
ancient China's war against the invading Huns. She does this out of
love, both for her father and her country. It also seems like a
pretty natural decision: Although she's not exactly a tomboy, an
early misadventure with a matchmaker indicates that Mulan isn't
exactly at home with the womanly arts.
</P>
<P>
   Having chopped off her hair and borrowed her father's armor,
Mulan joins her fellow conscripts, a motley crew of screw-ups led
by a handsome young captain named Shang. Naturally, at first Mulan
has trouble pulling off her ruse and Mushu, a little dragon (voiced
by Eddie Murphy) sent by her ancestors for protection, proves to be
more of a hindrance than a help. This reinforces the film's message
that Mulan doesn't need help from a sidekick _ or a man _ to get
by.
</P>
<P>
   It's a refreshing twist to the Disney formula, as is the fact
that the romance is more or less an afterthought. After all, it's
hard to save China and still worry about impressing the opposite
sex _ even in an animated film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' does remain true to many of the Disney animated
traditions. Matthew Wilder and David Zippel have written five
rousing songs (without the standard schmaltzy love ballad) that fit
nicely within the film's dramatic framework, and Murphy's dragon _
along with a goofy dog and a bouncy cricket _ provide the requisite
comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, Murphy's humor seems a bit out of place in
the film's Chinese sensibility, and that can be occasionally
off-putting. Certainly no one under the age of 12 will mind, but
Disney's continued reliance on this kind of schtick might be a
little annoying to viewers caught up in Mulan's touching,
compelling story. Unlike ``Aladdin,'' where Robin Williams' genie
dominated a lighthearted cartoon tale, ``Mulan'' has serious themes
and a delicate mood, a state that can be easily disrupted by a
jive-talking dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Disney is still casting its net wide enough to reel in
the broadest possible audience. We would be naive to expect
otherwise. But when the finished product is as accomplished as
``Mulan,'' it's pretty easy to set aside such small quibbles and be
swept along with the gorgeous animation, heartfelt storytelling and
catchy songs that make this Chinese legend truly a story for the
ages.

THERE'S PLENTY HERE FOR `X-FILES' FAITHFULS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We learn more and understand less from ``The
X-Files'' movie. Really, did you expect it to be any other way?
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the TV show, and I'm one of them, have gotten used to
the somewhat radical concept of inconclusiveness as part of the
fun. Even when things are resolved in the series _ a monster
caught, an innocent exorcised _ it's always with an edgy, ``but
...'' attached. Usually, the mystery just gets deeper and the truth
gets fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' movie continues this grand tradition, tacking on
at least an illusion of dramatic closure that it doesn't really
want to give up. It's a brighter, handsomer, sporadically more
spectacular upgrade of the show _ which is saying something, since
``X-Files'' is far and away the best-looking program on television.
But in the end, the movie plays like a decent, but not great,
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Chris Carter, directed by Rob Bowman and written by
Carter and Frank Spotnitz _ ``X'' veterans all _ the movie is a
Mythology story, about the outer space colonists FBI agents Fox
Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)
constantly try to prove are in our midst, and the powerful,
meta-governmental conspiracy that stops at nothing to cover it all
up.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fun for fans, especially when the story gets into the
true nature of that living black oil and the deeper moral
complexities of the conspiracy syndicate's scary, Well-Manicured
Man (John Neville). The initiated will also get an extra kick out
of two brilliantly staged scenes in which very different, equally
important aspects of the Mulder-Scully relationship are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough for true fanatics is questionable,
though. Nothing is clarified about Cigarette-Smoking Man's (William
B. Davis) real relationship to Mulder, or what happened to Mulder's
sister, or any of the other key questions that keep the devoted
coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``X''-philes shouldn't have too much trouble with the way
backstory is sprinkled into the scenario, though _ Carter has
deftly avoided the real possibility of bogging down the narrative
with too much explanation. And what's there is inserted with quick,
even amusing, strokes. Duchovny has a funny bit in a tavern where,
drowning in whiskey and self-pity after being decommissioned for
the umpteenth time, he blabs his whole, unbelievable story to a
disinterested barkeeper (Glenne Headly), who logically figures her
customer's had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cleverly as all this inside ``X'' stuff has been worked into the
movie, Carter and company have some trouble freshening up themes
and plot lines we've seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Alarming agribiz experiments pop up in the middle of nowhere.
Scully is abducted and suffers invasive procedures. A Guy Who Knows
Something With Uncertain Motives (Martin Landau) lays cryptic
information on Mulder. Bureau higher-ups are gonna get to the
bottom of all this or fix Mulder and Scully good. The movie starts
and climaxes in very cold, snowy places.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? That means you've watched at least a season's
worth of ``X-Files'' episodes, since all of these tropes are, more
or less, recycled each year.
</P>
<P>
   That acknowledged, Duchovny and Anderson dutifully dig into
their long-running characterizations and each, miraculously, comes
up with new shadings and emotional temperatures that are worthy of
the big screen. The scale of special effects, starting with an
Oklahoma City-style building explosion and crescendoing with
something we're not going to describe, are appropriately awesome,
if a little too infrequent by current sci-fi spectacle standards.
</P>
<P>
   None of this quite overcomes the feeling, however, that we're
not watching anything too much more special than an average
``X-Files'' TV episode. If the show wasn't so consistently better
than most movies, that would be a real problem.

`X-FILES' MOVIE HOOKS A SKEPTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First off, a disclaimer: I don't believe in UFOs,
aliens or Trilateralists. Roswell is just a spot on the map, LBJ
didn't whack JFK, and O.J. was not set up by the Japanese mafia.
</P>
<P>
   I don't watch ``The X-Files'' either, which makes me something
of an anomaly among journalists, most of whom see a government
conspiracy of some sort lurking around every corner. (The latest:
Ginger Spice quit the Spice Girls because she was seen in the White
House with Clinton. That's why she didn't come to the States with
Posh, Sporty, Scary and Baby _ the Feds wanted to keep her quiet.)
</P>
<P>
   I do believe in good movies, though, so I was curious. Could I
watch the ``X-Files'' film and not become lost in a murky labyrinth
understood only to Internet geeks and dateless shut-ins? Or would
all the conspiracy-speak and black helicopters simply wash over me
like the liquid from a bottle of Snapple iced tea (whose old label
did NOT depict a slave galley, conspiracy freaks _ it was the
Boston Tea Party).
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, all of my doubts were erased once the lights went
down and the opening images from the ``X-Files'' movie came on the
screen. Not only did I end up enjoying this spooky romp down
paranoia lane, I probably ended up liking it quite a bit more than
some of the die-hard ``X-Philes'' surrounding me. As a neophyte, I
brought no baggage to the show. I had no expectations, no questions
and no demands, other than to be entertained. And the movie did
that quite effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers do the nonbelievers a favor by tossing out some
early exposition to explain things and generally make sure everyone
is on the same page. Of course, even if you've never watched the
show, you probably know Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian
Anderson) are a couple of FBI agents who investigate wacky
paranormal-type stuff. Mulder is the true believer in all things
alien; Scully's there to effectively poke holes in his crackpot
theories.
</P>
<P>
   She has her work cut out for her in this movie. In the film's
first half hour, there's an Oklahoma City-like bombing of a Dallas
office building (paging Lee Harvey Oswald!), a creepy scene where a
kid comes down with an alien virus, and a lot of talk about
biological warfare, mutating diseases and the end of the world as
we know it.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, we're given just enough information to keep us
happy, even though we're really still stumbling around in the dark.
Martin Landau does a wonderfully loopy turn as a conspiracy nut who
leads Mulder to the truth, which involves an alien colonization
scheme worthy of Lyndon LaRouche's weirdest tracts. It's hardly an
original story line _ ever see ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers''?
_ but series writer-producer Chris Carter brings enough of his own
modern-day lunatic fringe element to make it his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' becomes a little repetitive toward the end _ too
much deadpan dialogue, one too many trips to the cornfield (bees
and corn are two of Carter's favorite things). Also, for a series
that's supposed to be so cutting-edge, there are an awful lot of
familiar plot conventions here, like car bombs, back-alley
informants and a helicopter chase scene quite reminiscent of
``North by Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't diminish the movie's creepy fun or the
nicely empathetic turns by Duchovny and Anderson, who make the jump
to the big screen with performances that provide knowing portraits
of their characters. Besides, how can you not like a movie that has
a drunken Agent Mulder relieving himself outside a bar _ on an
``Independence Day'' poster. If that's what they mean by ``The
Truth Is Out There,'' then count me in as a believer.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: I'll be tuning in this fall.

`DREAM' STIRS FEELINGS OF BEING MADLY IN LOVE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Frankie is a young woman who lives in a
black-and-white world. Literally. When we first meet her in ``Dream
for an Insomniac,'' she and her drab coffeehouse existence are
filmed with the absence of color. It's a rather obvious device used
by first-time writer-director Tiffanie DeBartolo as a means of
conveying Frankie's gloomy persona. And then, when Mr. Right walks
through the front door of that coffeehouse _ whammo! Life explodes
into iridescent hues.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the audience, most of ``Dream for an Insomniac''
shows a lot more originality and spunk than the film's derivative
opening reel. Once we're rid of the black-and-white contrivance and
the early pretentious dialogue, we're left with a sweet little film
that convincingly shows the blush and rush of first love.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie (Ione Skye) is a would-be actress living in a San
Francisco loft above a coffeehouse run by her Sinatra-obsessed
Uncle Leo (Seymour Cassel) and his in-the-closet, gay son, Rob
(Michael Landes). Frankie goes out on auditions with fellow actress
and best friend Allison (Jennifer Aniston), but mostly she just
serves coffee and complains about men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less than extraordinary is a waste of my time,'' she
says over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, extraordinary walks in the door. His name is David
(MacKenzie Astin), and he's cute, smart and can match Frankie quote
for quote when it comes to identifying who said what out of
Bartlett's. Best of all, in keeping with the film's salute to
Sinatra, David has blue eyes. (That's how the color returns to
Frankie's world.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, David also has a live-in girlfriend. There's
another complication as well _ Frankie and Allison are leaving for
Los Angeles in a few days. This ticking clock forces her to go all
out and convince David that their love was Meant To Be.
</P>
<P>
   It's an offbeat little movie that initially plays like an overly
intellectual episode of ``Friends'' (too much Aristotle and
Nietzsche), but eventually evolves into a interesting look at the
ways people approach passionate love. It's certainly a feeling most
of us recall, even if from the distance of years of sameness and
stability that a permanent relationship brings. DeBartolo nails
those emotions, vividly capturing the exciting intensity that
occurs when you know you've met The One.
</P>
<P>
   Those heightened feelings, as well as appealing performances
from Skye and Astin, carry you through ``Dream for an Insomniac''
and make it an enjoyable confection for anyone who has ever been in
love.

   After its contest to promote the first 100 years of filmmaking,
The American Film Institute announced (on CBS-TV June 16) a list of
the 100 greatest American movies. Newsweek is devoting a special
issue to the results.
</P>
<P>
   This roster of the ``100 best ...'' reminds me a lot of the 1927
Yankees: undeniably filled with Hall of Fame entries,
unquestionably deserving of such a lofty reputation _ and white.
</P>
<P>
   Very white.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the list fail to include even a single film from a
black director, but only a handful of the movies on the much-hyped
list feature minorities of any kind in supporting roles, much less
leading parts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should be sending kudos to the AFI for not bowing to
any politically correct pressure to present a more diverse list.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should say this ranking _ whose criteria for winning
is said to include box-office sales, critical acclaim and
historical significance _ is of great benefit to the cause of
minorities in films. For sure, it illustrates just how few
opportunities have existed for blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans
behind and in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we should be wondering how the AFI could even put
together such a collection and all but ignore any non-white actors
or directors, with only a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, there's Sidney Poitier in ``Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner'' (No. 99), he was a standup guy. (Although I have to say I
don't know what this horribly dated, condescendingly cutesy period
piece is even doing on the list. Did anyone who voted for the movie
see it recently? It did not age well, either as a piece of social
commentary or an alleged comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   Sharing screen time with Bruce Willis and John Travolta, among
others, Samuel L. Jackson did have a prominent role in the
crackling ``Pulp Fiction,'' which clocked in at No. 95. As a hit
man struggling to walk the righteous path, Jackson was probably the
most sympathetic character in a movie filled with killers,
druggies, thugs and thieves.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it, as far as main characters go. I don't think
we want to count Al Jolson wearing blackface in ``The Jazz
Singer,'' do we?
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for ``West Side Story.'' Sure there were Hispanics in
the cast _ but there was also Natalie Wood as Maria. Try to watch
that in 1998 without wincing.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other minority performances worth noting in the
films considered to be the best America has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Peters was dignity personified as the man wrongly accused
of rape in ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Mykelti Williamson was memorably sympathetic in ``Forrest
Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattie McDaniel did win an Academy Award for Best Actress in a
Supporting Role for her portrayal of the lovable maid in ``Gone
With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   And a number of Native American actors had parts in ``Dances
With Wolves'' _ though Dances With Wolves' love interest, Stands
with a Fist, was played by Mary McDonnell _ who sounds and looks a
lot more Irish than Sioux to me.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these parts, we're talking about a sea of white faces,
with a few less-than-heroic minorities here and there such as the
guy named ``Spearchucker'' in ``MASH,'' the ``Yes sir, Mr. Rick''
piano player in ``Casablanca,'' the villagers in ``King Kong'' and
the villains in ``The Birth of Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, ballots went to prominent American critics,
directors, screenwriters and even, though the AFI hasn't revealed
whether they voted or not, President Bill Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing to me that the 1,500 voters couldn't find even a
few more examples of films with minorities in leading roles, from
``A Raisin in the Sun'' to ``Stand and Deliver'' to ``Glory'' to
``Philadelphia'' to ``Boyz N the Hood'' to ``Menace 2 Society.''
</P>
<P>
   And lest you think such a tight list of 100 left no room for any
or all of the aforementioned, I'll give you a quick roster of some
of the wildly overrated films that easily could have been dropped:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Strangelove'' (No. 26 on the list)
</P>
<P>
   ``MASH'' (56)
</P>
<P>
   ``Tootsie'' (62)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wild Bunch'' (80)
</P>
<P>
   ``Giant'' (82)
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy Rider'' (88)
</P>
<P>
   ``Unforgiven'' (98)
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the voters should have done the right thing
and put ``Do the Right Thing'' on that list. Not only does it
belong in the top 100, it should be in the Top 10 _ perhaps at No.
7, in place of ``The Graduate.''

   After its contest to promote the first 100 years of filmmaking,
The American Film Institute announced (on CBS-TV June 16) a list of
the 100 greatest American movies. Newsweek is devoting a special
issue to the results.
</P>
<P>
   This roster of the ``100 best ...'' reminds me a lot of the 1927
Yankees: undeniably filled with Hall of Fame entries,
unquestionably deserving of such a lofty reputation _ and white.
</P>
<P>
   Very white.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the list fail to include even a single film from a
black director, but only a handful of the movies on the much-hyped
list feature minorities of any kind in supporting roles, much less
leading parts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should be sending kudos to the AFI for not bowing to
any politically correct pressure to present a more diverse list.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should say this ranking _ whose criteria for winning
is said to include box-office sales, critical acclaim and
historical significance _ is of great benefit to the cause of
minorities in films. For sure, it illustrates just how few
opportunities have existed for blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans
behind and in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we should be wondering how the AFI could even put
together such a collection and all but ignore any non-white actors
or directors, with only a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, there's Sidney Poitier in ``Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner'' (No. 99), he was a standup guy. (Although I have to say I
don't know what this horribly dated, condescendingly cutesy period
piece is even doing on the list. Did anyone who voted for the movie
see it recently? It did not age well, either as a piece of social
commentary or an alleged comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   Sharing screen time with Bruce Willis and John Travolta, among
others, Samuel L. Jackson did have a prominent role in the
crackling ``Pulp Fiction,'' which clocked in at No. 95. As a hit
man struggling to walk the righteous path, Jackson was probably the
most sympathetic character in a movie filled with killers,
druggies, thugs and thieves.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about it, as far as main characters go. I don't think
we want to count Al Jolson wearing blackface in ``The Jazz
Singer,'' do we?
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for ``West Side Story.'' Sure there were Hispanics in
the cast _ but there was also Natalie Wood as Maria. Try to watch
that in 1998 without wincing.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few other minority performances worth noting in the
films considered to be the best America has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Peters was dignity personified as the man wrongly accused
of rape in ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Mykelti Williamson was memorably sympathetic in ``Forrest
Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattie McDaniel did win an Academy Award for Best Actress in a
Supporting Role for her portrayal of the lovable maid in ``Gone
With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   And a number of Native American actors had parts in ``Dances
With Wolves'' _ though Dances With Wolves' love interest, Stands
with a Fist, was played by Mary McDonnell _ who sounds and looks a

NILE RODGERS HAS GUITAR SOUND ALL HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's a sound as distinctive as that of Jimi
Hendrix or Eric Clapton.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear the rhythm guitar on ``Like a King,'' the opening
cut on Texas guitarist Jimmie Vaughan's new album, ``Out There,''
you know it's Nile Rodgers, guitarist and producer extraordinaire
who wrote, produced and played on the tune.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, best-known as co-founder of Chic, the polished
disco-era band that influenced dance music throughout the past two
decades, has produced and written songs for million-selling albums
by Madonna, the B-52's, David Bowie, Diana Ross, Duran Duran, Eric
Clapton and many others.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the New York-based Rodgers is busy writing material
for the next Ross album, and putting the finishing touches on a
Chic album recorded live in Tokyo in April 1996, just before his
longtime partner, bassist Bernard Edwards, died suddenly of
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my last record with Bernard,'' Rodgers explained. ``It's
taken me a year and a half to decide to release it because I was so
emotional about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the show, Rodgers and Edwards were joined by Steve Winwood,
Simon LeBon of Duran Duran, Slash of Guns N' Roses &UR;  &LR; on guitar and
singers Sister Sledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear Slash playing with Chic, you say he should have
always played with us,'' Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers says the first Chic production, ``Everybody Dance,'' was
released as a white-label disc given only to New York club disc
jockeys in 1977, thus ensuring a hip underground following at
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pop dance ditty, but when we wrote it, it was really
avant-garde,'' Rodgers, 45, said. ``That was the song that allowed
us to make hit records and hold our head up high. At first we
didn't have a label _ it went to the DJs at Studio 54 and other
clubs, and that's how you knew the place was hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Chic's first major-label single, ``Dance, Dance, Dance,'' which
sold a million copies for Atlantic, hit the top 10, followed by
further Chic hits like the earlier ``Everybody Dance'' (with Luther
Vandross on backing vocals), ``Le Freak,'' ``I Want Your Love'' and
the 1979 chart-topper ``Good Times.''
</P>
<P>
   While disco was often dismissed as banal, disposable dance-floor
fodder, Chic was actually a highly polished, imaginative band like
Steely Dan, which was also unfairly derided and misunderstood for
its perceived synthetic sound.
</P>
<P>
   Utilizing lush arrangements, sharp, syncopated grooves and a
chorus of talented singers such as Alfa Anderson, Norma Jean Wright
and Luci Martin, Chic built a reputation as one of the best pop
groups of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the group was often lumped in with disco novelty
acts such as the Village People or pure disco divas like Donna
Summer.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the second edition of the ``All Music Guide to
Rock,'' Chic's patented ``crisp grooves and walloping boogie''
influenced an entire generation of artists from David Byrne to
Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Critic Ken Barnes said Chic was the tightest rhythm ensemble at
least since Booker T. &AMP; the MG's, maybe ever.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' ``Good Times'' bass riff was the basis for both
Sugarhill Gang's ``Rapper's Delight'' and Queen's ``Another One
Bites the Dust.'' Meanwhile, Rodgers and Edwards produced and
played on ``We Are Family,'' the Sister Sledge pop masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole disco phenomenon was so big you forget about the
passion of some individuals,'' Rodgers explained. ``The disco
format allowed primarily r&AMP;b/jazz-fusion musicians like us to make
sophisticated popular music as long as we had good grooves and
beats. It allowed us to stretch the harmonic possibilities of pop
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said the era of soul-funk bands like Chic, Cameo, Con
Funk Shun and Average White Band ended in the early '80s when dance
music became mechanized with drum machines standing in for human
percussionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When mechanical music came in, it was easy for Lipps Inc. to
have a No. 1 hit with `Funkytown','' Rodgers recalled. ``Disco acts
had flourished, but Lipps changed the way dance music was being
made. Disco was now created by producers while artists just sang
over tracks. We just couldn't bring ourselves to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight Chic albums in six years, the group disbanded in
1983 and Rodgers went on to produce or co-produce such top-selling
albums as Bowie's ``Let's Dance,'' Madonna's ``Like a Virgin,''
Duran Duran's ``Notorious,'' the B-52's' ``Cosmic Thing'' and the
Vaughan Brothers' ``Family Style,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became producers,'' Rodgers said. ``And the new romantic
bands like Power Station and Duran Duran became an extension of
Chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said if Edwards hadn't died, Chic would be touring now
with Slash, Winwood and others in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Tokyo gig was the beginning of us doing a whole new
thing,'' the guitarist said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to sampling, Chic's infectious sound hasn't disappeared
from the charts entirely. Last year, for example, saw Chic samples
as the basis for such smashes as ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It'' by Will
Smith and ``Mo Money Mo Problems'' by the Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers credits his innovative rhythm guitar style _ a blend of
clean sevenths and warm ninth chords delivered with razor-sharp
syncopation _ to his former partner, who helped develop the sound
when the pair were touring as part of an early pop-r&AMP;b group called
New York City in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were gigging down south and Bernard kept trying to explain
to me the rhythm style called `chucking','' Rodgers remembered.
``The other guitarist in the band had the style down and I got
jealous. Finally, I said to Bernard, `I give up. Show me how to do
this.' So, we went back to the hotel and he showed me the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, whose background in jazz harmony allowed him to use the
style with a wide variety of chords and musical progressions, first
had to switch instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of those guys that always used big old Gibsons for
that warm jazz sound,'' Rodgers said. ``One day, Bernard just
couldn't take it anymore and said, `Why don't you go buy a Fender?'
So, I switched to a Stratocaster and I've been playing it ever
since.''

SADDLE UP FOR SUMMER OF BIG-SCREEN WESTERNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Big or little? That's the litmus test when
deciding on an art-house re-release of a film.
</P>
<P>
   An epic like ``How the West Was Won,'' with its bigger-than-life
photography and cataclysmic train wreck, is a must-see on the big
screen. Same goes for cattle-driving ``Red River,'' directed by
Howard Hawks, with John Wayne playing the tyrannical boss and
Montgomery Clift a cowhand who stirs up rebellion along the way.
</P>

VERY SPECIAL EFFECTS ON CARAMEL'S DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Some people collect stamps, some collect coins.
Caramel singer-bassist Andy Curran collects vintage effects pedals.
</P>
<P>
   The milk crate Curran keeps at home in Toronto, filled with old
wah-wah pedals, fuzz-tone and distortion effects, came into play
during the making of Caramel's self-titled debut, which boasts the
standout track ``Lucy,'' now getting airplay at rock stations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Geffen Records disc is packed with high-quality material and
strange guitar noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producer and myself are especially into guitar sounds,''
Curran explained. ``If we had heard a certain effect before, we
wouldn't use it. I used the pedals I've searched the world for _
and my old vintage amps.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lucy,'' for example, the guitar was run through three or
four '60s effects pedals and an old theater speaker. Curran says
the goal ``was to make it sound like the speaker was blowing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, Caramel was able to duplicate the sound of the record
after adding a second guitarist and singer, Virginia Storey.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Caramel recorded the album around day jobs. A
friend in promotion sent the indie release to stations in Boston
and Sacramento, which immediately added ``Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen talent scout David Simone beat the major-label rush to
Caramel's door by a week, scooping up the band at a hometown gig.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw us in Toronto, and 48 hours later we had a deal on the
table,'' Curran, 37, said. ``I felt like Dorothy when her house was
being sucked up by the tornado. It was bizarre. And we still don't
even have a booking agent.''
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAMS: The credits to ``Jubilee''
(Slash/Warner Bros.), the latest album from North Hollywood's Grant
Lee Buffalo, read like a who's who of the new studio mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Along with ubiquitous multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion, the
well-reviewed album features cameos from keyboardist Rami Jaffee of
the Wallflowers, alt-country studio king Greg Leisz, E of the Eels,
Michael Stipe and Robyn Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was less planned than you would imagine,'' singer-guitarist
Grant Lee Phillips explained. ``Some people we were dying to work
with were asked to come by; others just happened to drop by the
studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he added the ``Buffalo' part to the band name six
years ago ``at a time when I was trying to figure out my beliefs
and obsessions as an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Lee Buffalo contributed to filmmaker Todd Haynes' ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' which deals with London's '70s glam-rock scene and is
due this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A VERITABLE `GOLDMINE': Where did the name ``Velvet Goldmine''
come from? It's actually the title of an obscure David Bowie song
originally found only on the B-side of the 1975 British reissue of
``Space Oddity.'' The song is also included as a bonus track on
Rykodisc's reissue of Bowie's classic 1972 concept album, ``The
Rise &AMP; Fall of Ziggy Stardust.''

   FILM-XFILES (Undated) In the '90s, as movies seek ever broader
demographics and film writing becomes increasingly infantile, the
question a critic must ask is the reverse: Will the series lower
its standards to the crass demands of the big screen? For better or
worse, Fox's feature version of its own TV show, ``The X-Files,''
seems amazingly true to itself. At least, it's shadowy,
straight-faced, labyrinthine in structure, as paranoid as Oliver
Stone in a dark alley.

`MULAN' IS A MASTERPIECE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART ANIMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news about `Mulan,'' this summer's cartoon musical from
Disney, is that it's a masterpiece of animation that defines the
current state of the art. Several of its scenes are so epic _ and
so stunning _ that they're genuinely thrilling. Visually, the movie
just takes your breath away.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Lion King'' was a staggeringly beautiful evocation of the
East African savannah and ``The Little Mermaid'' was a extravaganza
of underwater kitsch, this film also creates its own unique visual
world: an imaginatively stylized explosion of chinoiserie _ Chinese
patterns, motifs and embellishments.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not all this exotic beauty will appeal to a child
audience or revive the public's waning interest in the feature
animation genre is hard to predict. The film is much less of a
musical than its predecessors (with no show-stopping song). As good
as it is in most respects, it fails to be the kind of emotional
grabber that would make it an instant classic.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an authentic Chinese legend and set in some unspecified
dynasty of the late Middle Ages, it's about Mulan, the spunky
daughter of a wealthy North China landowner who disguises herself
as a man and takes her ailing father's place in the Emperor's
defensive war against the invading army of Huns from beyond the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a cheeky miniature dragon named Mushu (voice of
Eddie Murphy) provided by the quarrelsome ghosts of her ancestors,
the young girl makes it through basic training, distinguishes
herself in battle and meets the young man of her dreams before her
disguise is uncovered and the action shifts to a grand climax in
the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   It's roughly the same story as Warner Bros.' recent animated
musical, ``Quest For Camelot,'' but so much better in every way
that there's simply no comparison. It should instantly re-establish
the faltering (after ``Pocahontas'' and ``Hunchback of Notre
Dame'') Disney animation department as the industry's best, and
bolster it from the big challenge of DreamWork's upcoming ``Prince
of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Every shot is a treat to the eye, and the backgrounds _ aping
the muted colors and minimalist landscapes of Chinese scroll
painting _ are especially pleasing. The big scenes _ vast battle
sequences, an avalanche of snow sweeping away a whole army of Huns,
tens of thousands of extras milling before the entrance of the
Forbidden City _ are even more striking. It's the movies' most
effective combination of computer animation and traditional
hand-drawn cels to date.
</P>
<P>
   The character animation is also first rate, and superior to
anything put out by Disney's competitors in ``Quest'' or Fox's
recent ``Anastasia.'' The fact that Mulan comes off as a realistic
and appealing young woman helps the film work on a level that, say,
``Pocahontas'' did not. And the non-humans _ dragon, horse, falcon
and cricket characters _ are all imaginative conceived and
reasonably charming.
</P>
<P>
   With only four Matthew Wilder and David Zippel songs cutting
into the story _ all of them unobtrusive and none (including the
intended show-stopper, ``I'll Make a Man Out of You'') particularly
memorable _ much less effort seems to have been taken to make the
film work as a musical. This is actually a blessing, because the
milieu and story-line of ``Mulan'' really doesn't lend themselves
to songs and big production numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring downside to the movie is the decision to have
Eddie Murphy supply the voice of Mushu and to talk in a litany of
'90s ghetto jive. What is this about? The filmmakers go to infinite
lengths to create a stylized world of Ancient China and then turn
around and poke holes in its delicate fabric every time the dragon
opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   According to Variety, Murphy's there to give the movie a ``wider
demographic.'' But it's a shame, because he definitely breaks the
fable, and cheapens the experience. What if, back in 1942, Disney
had hired Groucho Marx to ad-lib the voice of Thumper in ``Bambi.''
Or given ``Snow White'' a Jack Benny-like sidekick to widen the
demographic with cheapskate jokes. Would those movies seem half as
magical to us as they do today?
</P>
<P>
   Mulan. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft. Score by Jerry
Goldsmith. Voices: Ming-na Wen, Lea Salonga, Eddie Murphy, B.D.
Wong, Donny Osmond. Disney. 87 minutes. Rated G, suitable for all
audiences.

FILMS OFFER TWO DIFFERNT LOOKS AT MODERN ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pair of movies open this week that deal with the complicated
nature of modern romance in very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Heaven,'' which played in the Seattle International Film
Festival, updates Henry James' ``The Wings Of the Dove'' to present
times and to Seattle without losing the essence of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' is a screwball comedy that features an attractive
black cast. It was made in 1996, but is just now being released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Heaven,'' which also acknowledges a debt to Terrence
Malick's 1977 classic ``Days Of Heaven,'' belies its low budget and
manages to give the story a '90s slant.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to the iconoclastic casting of Canadian
Molly Parker and Australian Aden Young, as the white-trash, poor
lovers, Cynthia and Buck, and Brit Joely Richardson as their
employer, the dying, rich Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   The couple scheme to make Ellie to fall in love with Buck, marry
him and ultimately leave him her vast riches.
</P>
<P>
   But as in James' dark novel, the young man falls in love with
the sad, tragic heroine, played with beautiful vulnerability by
Richardson, and, for the first time, has purpose in his life
because he's actually needed. The actors manage to transcend the
awful melodrama of the material (a death scene is embarrassingly
histrionic) and are so capable that they even make some dreadful
lines seem viably heartfelt and potent.
</P>
<P>
   The other plus is the marvelous cinematography of Claudio Rocha,
who shot ``The Whole Wide World,'' and ``Picture Bride.'' Never has
Seattle looked so beguiling on film. Seattleite Meg Richman
directed and wrote ``Under Heaven'' and she has a way with actors
and, with a background in art, knows how to blend style, color and
light to create a Pre-Raphaelite look. It gives the film a sense of
timelessness that binds it to James' turn-of-the-century story
despite its modern setting.
</P>
<P>
   Richman, who recently adapted the W. Somerset Maugham novella,
``Up At The Villa,'' for the screen (it's currently in production
and set to star Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn), clearly has a
gift for period pieces and knows how to translate works based in
the past for present day sensibilities. Had she excised some
overwrought dialogue, ``Under Heaven'' might actually have been
heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Hav Plenty,'' writer and director Chris Cherot says he
``basically lied'' in order to get his first movie made, though he
swears it's based on his own, true-life story.
</P>
<P>
   The film explores modern romantic relationships among a group of
black friends and family over a New Year's holiday and, in some
ways, it's a fresh take on a soggy, familiar tale.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Plenty (Cherot) is a struggling writer living off the good
nature and generosity of his pals. He's been in love with one,
Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell), for years. When she invites him
to her family's D.C. home on New Year's Eve, Lee hits the road in a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But Havilland is engaged to famous singer and songwriter Michael
Simmons (Hill Harper), an unctuous type who autographs a picture
for a fan named Melissa and tells her, ``You can't spell Melissa
without an M and an E.'' He's smooth and glib and, more than
likely, not very faithful to his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and after several comic mishaps, Lee finds himself
sleeping in the same bed with the woman he loves but things don't
transpire quite the way they should. Even after he admits his
feelings, it may be too late to salvage a relationship with the
wary Havilland.
</P>
<P>
   There are some clever moments and the cast is extremely
attractive and makes the one-dimensional characters more engaging
than they should be. But there's so much information missing and so
few reasons why Lee and Havilland shouldn't get together that the
film doesn't feel cohesive and flowing and it doesn't make much
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a welcome change from recent black comedies like
``Woo'' that are an insult to the actors. Compared with that
unfunny project, ``Hav Plenty'' is a breath of fresh air. Cherot at
least tries to find a new voice and reinvent a tired genre. The
problems may stem from the film's low budget, but it's a shame he
could't tie the story together in a less rough and raggedy way.
</P>
<P>
   Under Heaven. Directed and written by Meg Richman. Cast: Joely
Richardson, Molly Parker, Aden Young. Banner Entertainment. 112

`WILDE' IS A FASCINATING GULP OF PERSONAL HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great Irish playwright, novelist and wit Oscar Wilde had a
lot of bad luck in his life, but history has been extremely kind to
him. He's been the focus of a regular revival of admiring interest
every few decades since his death _ including a big ongoing one in
the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   He's been especially lucky at the movies _ the subject of no
less than three successful, mostly complimentary, British biopics _
``Oscar Wilde,'' starring Robert Morley; ``The Trials of Oscar
Wilde,'' starring Peter Finch and filmed in 70mm (both released in
1960); and ``Wilde,'' which debuted last month in the Seattle
International Film Festival and moves into a regular run today.
</P>
<P>
   All three films cover the same basic territory: Wilde's triple
life as a somewhat scandalous man of letters (``The Picture of
Dorian Gray'') and playwright (``The Importance of Being
Earnest''); a loving (if absent) husband and father; and
not-so-secret homosexual, whose affairs with various aristocratic
lovers and off-the-street ``rentboys'' eventually lead him to
become the most famous man ever publicly prosecuted for sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three films, this new one is, of course, by far the most
sexually explicit (perhaps more than it needs to be), as well as
the most intellectually honest.
</P>
<P>
   Wilde (Stephen Fry, in a performance that won him the best actor
award at SIFF) comes off less as a martyr than a man who foolishly
lets his obsession for an unworthy young lover lead him into big
trouble that he might well have avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a fascinating gulp of personal history, directed
with assurance by Brian Gilbert (``Tom &AMP; Viv'') and filled out with
an exceptional supporting cast that includes Jude Law as Wilde's
selfish lover, Tom Wilkinson as the lover's vengeful father,
Vanessa Redgrave as Wilde's widowed mother and Jennifer Ehle, as
Wilde's long-suffering wife, who emerges as the movie's single
noble character.
</P>
<P>
   Another worthy film opening this weekend after a debut in the
Seattle International Film Festival is the unique German drama,
``Beyond Silence,'' which played not in this year's SIFF but in the
1997 edition _ and went on from there to earn a best
foreign-language Academy Award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A first film directed by young filmmaker Caroline Link, it's a
finely crafted, deeply engrossing drama of a young woman (Sylvie
Testud as an adult, Tatjana Trieb as a child), who grows up to
become her deaf parents' sole link to the hearing world.
</P>
<P>
   When she becomes interested in music and shows a special gift
for the clarinet, the attraction is discouraged by her stubborn
father (Seattle actor Howie Seago), a family crisis ensues, the
story gradually widens out to include several other characters in
the extended family, and the film comes together to be an unusually
poignant family saga.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Beyond Silence'' may well be the most striking and
original of all the deluge of first films in the last two editions
of the film festival. It's impeccably cast, sensitively scripted
and directed with a glossy visual flair and original storytelling
style that often recalls Link's great filmmaking countryman,
Douglas Sirk.

<P>
   As the Moby Dick started to founder, Tom Sheridan, a 68-year-old
MIT professor on vacation with his wife, grabbed the boat's rail as
dishes began crashing down and passengers started screaming.
</P>
<P>
   It took only three seconds for the 70-foot Ecuadorian boat,
chartered by Boston-based Elderhostel, to capsize last Wednesday,
plunging 15 American vacationers and eight crew members into the
seas of the Galapagos archipelago, 600 miles off the coast of South
America.
</P>
<P>
   In the three hours that followed, two passengers died. Two
others remain missing, and one is recovering from severe injuries.
The surviving 11 passengers and eight crew members clung to a
dinghy, rafts, or life rings as waves crested 15 feet over their
heads and currents pulled them apart. An investigation as to the
exact cause of the accident is underway. ``All of a sudden, an
exceptionally big swell picked our boat up and tilted it on its
side,'' recalls Mary Jo Cannarella, 62, of Nashua, N.H., one of
four New Englanders on the Moby Dick. ``We expected it to right
itself, but it didn't. It hung on the balance at a 30-degree angle,
and another wave gave it a push and knocked it over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The water was rising very, very fast,'' she added. ``I knew I
had to get out of the (cabin), or I would be trapped and drown. In
the first few moments, I was thinking `This can't be real.' Yet I
was swimming for my life. Then as I was clinging to the ring buoy,
I thought, `This might be my moment of death.' However, I didn't
give up my determination at any moment. I had a brief thought about
sharks, but I didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The disaster occurred in the early evening of the third day of a
seven-day cruise of the Miami-built ship's maiden voyage, shortly
after the tourists set sail under a double rainbow bound from
Espanola (Hood) Island to Puerto Ayora. Out of sight of land,
amidst scattered islands famed for their unique plants and animals,
cocaptains Carlos and Freddy Penaherrera, natives of the Galapagos
with 26 combined years of sea experience, were trying to control
the vessel in unexpectedly heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers weren't especially concerned. Most were engaged in
recreational activities when the boat ran into trouble, survivors
recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were heavy swells,'' Cannarella says. ``The captain was
going at a slower pace than usual, but he wasn't having problems
navigating. We were assured that this was quite normal for that
part of the channel. Other than a few people being seasick,
everything was going along okay. We weren't worried.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Freddy Penaherrera: ``A large wave lifted the rear
of the yacht, the bow dove steeply, just as a gust of wind caught
the vessel broadside, knocking it partly over. Then a second wave
hit, knocking it down completely. Furniture and people were tossed
about inside and outside the vessel. In just a few seconds, our
boat was sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 15 minutes before the vessel was completely submerged,
the crew worked frantically to free as much lifesaving equipment as
possible. Passengers thrown into the sea were yelling to find each
other in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan and his wife, Rachel, 70, had been on the bow area of
the second deck talking with Joe Cannarella, 64, Mary Jo's husband.
After the boat tipped, the three were dragged under the hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept trying to surface, but our heads kept striking the
hull, then the boat passed over us and we emerged at the stern,''
Sheridan says. ``Joe's arm was lacerated by the propeller as it
went by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew across the lounge,'' says Mary Jo Cannarella, who was
inside the boat when it tipped over. ``Within three breaths, the
water was up to my neck. Five breaths and it was over my head. I
refused to die and rammed my head repeatedly against the glass
window now above me. The window popped and I scrambled through to
the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Another passenger, Martha Brooks of Corvallis, Ore., who is
nearly blind, followed the light through the now open window,
escaping to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Brewer of Florida found herself pinned by furniture and a
window. ``Until the water reached my nose, I was yelling to others
not to panic. Then the water went over my head. The man pinned next
to me was dead, but I felt it wasn't my time to die. I heard the
glass shatter, felt I had a chance, wriggled under the furniture,
found a hole in the glass, and I was free. At the age of 70, I held
my breath for more than two minutes for the first time in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was the last out of the boat alive.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside, Mary Jo Cannarella said: ``Five of us were
clinging to that one ring buoy. One person was trying to climb up
on it and kept pulling us under water. We could have died on that
small ring. Then two of the women caught a glimpse of a dinghy and
decided to swim for it to save the rest of us. Amazingly, they made
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others drifted and swam to join us,'' she added. ``Then
Richard Sayer, who couldn't find his wife, said, `I'll go. I'm
ready to go.' We said, `No, hold on,' but he said `good-bye,' let
go, and went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Drifting about half a mile away, the Sheridans and Joe
Cannarella managed to make it to what became a small flotilla of
life rafts tied to a dinghy. Passengers and crew huddled together.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, those in the dinghy spotted a small boat in
the distance and fired two flares. The boat didn't respond. Soon
after, a larger boat, the Angelino II, appeared on the horizon. It
had spotted the flares.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Cannarella, Vera Brower, and the others on the buoy ring
also saw the boat responding, but realized they could easily be
overlooked. They gathered strength to paddle directly into the path
of the oncoming ship.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean seas were rough. Johnny Fong, 24, a crew member aboard
the Angelito II, jumped in and swam out wearing a life vest and
carrying a ring attached by a rope to his vessel. One by one, he
accompanied each passenger as they were towed to the boat and
hoisted in, taking 20 minutes for each rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors arrived at Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz, at 2 a.m.,
more than seven hours after the Moby Dick sank. The entire village
turned out to take them to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Sheridan rushed to contact her four children and her
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, those well enough to travel flew home, the
Cannarellas and the Sheridans taking the same plane to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Neither couple blames Elderhostel, which sends 33,000 older
travelers overseas every year. This was the travel agency's first
fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Cannarellas have already planned another trip. Their
destination: the Galapagos Islands. Says Mary Jo, ``We definitely
want to go back again and finish what we started.''

GOLF MANUFACTURERS NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When the US Golf Association announced Wednesday that it will
continue to study advances in club and ball design and construction
before imposing new _ and much feared _ restrictions, golf
equipment manufacturers proclaimed themselves relieved and pleased.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, major equipment makers in the $2.5 billion
industry, including Titleist and Spalding in Massachusetts, had
mounted a public relations offensive. They feared that the USGA,
the governing body of professional and recreational golf, was
poised to adopt Draconian restrictions that would even ban clubs
currently used on the professional tours and at the local country
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking a more conservative and rational approach and
they've done a good job of listening to the manufacturers and the
consumers,'' said Scott Kreelman, executive vice president of
Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers feared that the USGA would use the eve of the
US Open in San Francisco to announce new rules that would ban
several new clubs and balls and sharply curtail future research and
design.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of new technologies and the impact on the game is
being played out amid enormous stakes for the manufacturers and the
USGA alike.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of clubs earned $1.7 billion in wholesale business
in 1997, an increase of 74 percent in just four years, according to
the National Golf Foundation, an industry-supported research group.
Manufacturers of golf balls made $667 million in wholesale business
last year, an increase of 23 percent from 1993.
</P>
<P>
   New USGA rules would strike at the heart of the industry, which
relies heavily on major advancements in technology to market new
products every few years. But when top USGA officials took the
microphones at The Olympic Club golf course in San Francisco
Wednesday, they were anything but confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not uncomfortable with what we see on the market
today,'' said David Fay, USGA executive director. ``We don't
believe that clubs submitted at this point have lessened the skill
to play the game at championships such as the US Open or at a
recreational level.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay and other USGA officials outlined a plan to establish a
formula to measure the ``spring-like effect'' that occurs when a
club face hits a ball. What the officials, and many golfers, are
concerned about is that new technology may be artificially putting
more power into shots.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for determining the maximum allowable effect will be
sent to manufacturers in a proposed protocol within the next few
weeks, Fay said. The companies will then be allowed the rest of the
summer to comment on the proposal, before meeting formally with the
USGA to discuss the issue further in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Fay also said that the USGA continues to examine golf balls in
an attempt to determine an acceptable level of design advancements.
He said no restrictions are currently contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers, though, remain concerned that the USGA may
eventually seek to halt the enormous strides in technology that
have made clubs lighter, more accurate, and capable of striking a
ball farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USGA still feels it needs to protect the game from
equipment manufacturers, and I strongly disagree with that,'' said
Donald Dye, chief executive of Callaway Golf Co., the Carlsbad,
Calif., manufacturer that has led the way in club designs. ``But,
at least now, consumers will feel comfortable buying what we have
in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA's concern is that younger, stronger players, combined
with space-age technology and materials, will overwhelm courses.
The association has already turned down a bid by the Merion Golf
Club outside of Philadelphia to host its fifth US Open because the
course is not long enough. Perhaps most alarmingly, the famed Old
Course at St. Andrews in Scotland is planning to lengthen its
layout, a massive bit of construction and landscaping that some in
the sport consider to be sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   And, on June 9, the Augusta National course, which annually
hosts the Masters tournament, announced plans to lengthen a few
holes and to add trees to counter the game's big hitters. Just a
year ago, Augusta said it would never consider such changes.
</P>
<P>
   The average drive on the PGA Tour has increased from 260 yards
to 269 yards in five years. In that time, several companies have
introduced clubs and balls, each promising to deliver easier,
longer, more accurate play. Perhaps the major factor in the
increase of sales of clubs is this repeated introduction of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Titleist, a division of Fortune Brands in Fairhaven, and
Spalding, in Chicopee, control 70 percent of the market in golf
balls. Both companies have been fighting a continual war for market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the battle is waged in company laboratories, where as
many as 50 research and design workers compete. New balls with new
promises of longer, more accurate flight are introduced virtually
every other year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spalding and Titleist are in a tong war right now,'' said
Richard Haskell, the retired executive director of the
Massachusetts Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the companies are highly motivated by the bottom line
in terms of what they make and whatever advancements they can get
out on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway is a strong example of how new designs lead to greater
sales. In 1989, the year before its revolutionary club, the Big
Bertha, was launched, the company reported sales of $20 million.
Last year, after consecutive progeny of Big Bertha were brought to
market, the company was reporting sales of $842 million. Sales now
surpass that of its four next rivals combined; before the birth of
Big Bertha, it was the sixth-largest club maker.
</P>
<P>
   And when it appeared that the USGA might eliminate the
large-headed clubs, Callaway's stock plunged, falling 54 percent in
the first quarter of this year. Wednesday, with the encouraging
announcement by the USGA, Callaway stock rose by 1 1/4, closing at
19 13/16.

ENGLISHMAN FRY IS WILD ABOUT PLAYING LEAD IN FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Stephen Fry is a man of many words.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, they're impeccably and eloquently chosen. The
40-year-old, hawk-nosed (he broke it at age 4) Englishman has a
reputation as a ``Renaissance man,'' a title that causes him to
respond with an uncharacteristically short riposte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear tights,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a valid epithet. After all, he's published four
novels _ most notably, his J.D. Salinger-esque ``The Liar'' _ and a
volume of autobiography, adapted ``Me and My Girl'' for the stage,
and appeared in such movies as ``Peter's Friends,'' ``I.Q.'' and
``Cold Comfort Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also created a legion of fans from his TV appearances
alongside his regular comedy partner, Hugh Laurie, on the British
comedy programs ``A Little Bit of Fry and Laurie'' and ``Jeeves and
Wooster,'' as well as guesting on Rowan Atkinson's acclaimed
``Blackadder'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, he's also part of a tightly knit English acting
community _ an association that began at Cambridge University's
Footlights Drama Club _ that includes Emma Thompson, Tony Slattery
and Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   But the man has other fish to, well, fry, as he chain-smokes
through an interview at the Plaza Park Suites in Seattle. He's here
at the invitation of the Seattle International Film Festival to
talk about his first starring role, in Brian Gilbert's opulent and
emotional film, ``Wilde.'' Fry's portrayal of Oscar Wilde won him
the best actor award at the Seattle festival.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on Richard Ellman's definitive biography of the
late-19th-century bohemian writer and wit, opens tomorrow at the
Egyptian.
</P>
<P>
   The film focuses on Wilde's marriage, his fatherhood, his
success as a playwright in the ever-changing morality of the
Edwardian Age, and his eventual recognition that he was gay _ which
tragically altered his life in an England where homosexuality was
punishable by imprisonment and hard labor. Wilde's passionate love
affair with Lord Alfred ``Bosie'' Douglas landed him in court
opposite Bosie's disapproving father.
</P>
<P>
   Fry believes Wilde has a universal and everlasting appeal for
the young, citing the Irish writer's current resurgence. In
addition to the movie, David Hare's play, ``The Judas Kiss,''
starring Liam Neeson as Wilde, is playing on Broadway, and Moises
Kaufman's Off-Broadway hit, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of
Oscar Wilde,'' is having in its West Coast premiere at Seattle's
Intiman Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only speculate as to why,'' says Fry, ``but we all
respond to zeitgeists, and zeitgeists tend to be created by the
young as a rule. Up until the '60s and '70s, there was something
for the young to invest in, some point of view to believe in,
whether it be political or religious, to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' notes Fry sadly, ``the real cheat of this time is kids
are not pressed to reform or cut their hair by their parents, but
by the dire necessity of the competition in the labor market and
the fact that there aren't communes to drop out into. So how do you
find your individuality and that sense of wonder?
</P>
<P>
   ``In our college days, there were yogis and maharishis and Che
Guevara postered on the dormitory wall as a symbol of rebellion and
hope for the future. Since the downing of the Berlin Wall, a lot of
young people sense that if there is a saving grace, it's in art and
the intellect over God and ideology, and I'm with them on this. I
think Oscar Wilde stands for that. The two most potent T-shirt
images most likely to be seen in a university are of Albert
Einstein and Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein is more than a nerdy techno-head; he has a kind human
face that speaks of internationalism. And Wilde stands as the crown
prince of bohemia and the supremacy of art, and, above all things,
the individual. In that, there's still a sense of his downfall and
society's revenge on that individuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry says he can relate because he, too, is gay. ``I did as much
research as I could on Wilde's life. I read the biographies and
those of his circle, but the thing that most drove his tragedy home
for me was being on a set with two little children (who played the
writers' sons). Wilde loved his family,'' he insists, despite his
`passion' for Bosie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always two extremes,'' says Fry. ``Wilde's case was
a tragedy and by that I don't mean sad. The tragedy is not that he
went to prison and suffered humiliation and had his body and spirit
broken. The tragedy is that he never saw his children again and his
relationship with Bosie was ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, insists Fry, ``It was right of him to recognize his
nature as a gay man. He believed in that very Greek, Socratic
philosophy _ to realize one's nature, to be what we should be. But
it was terrible because it destroyed his marriage and possibly the
future of his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde was more the master of his fate and captain of his soul
than we give him credit for. He had flaws, but he more or less knew
what he was doing. Other versions of his life always painted him as
a gay martyr, a tragic figure compounded by vanity, hysteria and
blistering defiance. Ellman's book showed he had real courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde, the actor recalls, is ``one of the few role models'' he
had growing up gay in the '60s. ``There were no magazines or Web
sites. The only magazines were seedy pornography that was purchased
by men in raincoats in Soho.'' He laughs. ``There was no community
at all _ only the secret world of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fry, the theater and his crowd became his freedom. Yet he
has no idea why they have enjoyed such huge success. ``The obvious
answer,'' he believes, ``is if you get, perhaps, three people at a
university at the same time who just happen to meet and spark off
each other, they might just make a fire. There might just be the
right energy, the right excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get lots of letters from students saying, `Yours is a
career path I'd like to follow. How do I do it?' One is tempted to
answer, `Be lucky,' because I don't know. We never set out to do
it. If anyone did, it was Emma (Thompson), who felt she might be an
actor because both her parents were actors. But Hugh and I had no
heritage. We just sort of fell into it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he loves acting, he feels the same way about writing and
feels ``terribly lucky to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, does he prefer the stage or the screen?
</P>
<P>
   Fry laughs. ``I much prefer the cinema, though I know it's
terribly un-English of me to say so. We're supposed to say, `My
roots are in theater' and `Theater is my first love,' but the fact
is I get pleasure in theater but it's not in doing plays. There's
no pleasure in repetition. I had a nasty time with a play a few
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry is alluding to an infamous moment when he walked offstage in
the middle of a show, got in a car and drove away. There was a week
of speculation as to whether he was alive, dead or had a nervous
breakdown. Fry laughs at the memory. ``It wasn't rational or
logical and the end result was a kind of re-evaluation. But at the
time, it was a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakdown sounds hysterical and it wasn't quite that. I was
deeply miserable and I just felt I could not appear onstage again.
I had a crisis of confidence, so I just drove to the continent. I
toured through Belgium and Holland and Germany and then I saw an
English newspaper with pictures of the police swarming over my roof
at home, looking for dead bodies. I called my parents and my
friends and said I was fine. They said, `Come home and see a doctor
and get sorted out, otherwise you'll get sued for a million
pounds.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' he says. ``I knew it was wrong to do the play
but I kidded myself it would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about film is it's different every day. The things
people find terrible about it, I love. There's a slow rhythm and a
holding of energy. I'm so twitchy and hyperactive that filmmaking
makes me slow down. It's good for me. It's technical.''
</P>
<P>
   And he laughs again. ``That,'' he notes, ``is a quandary,
because I think art should be slightly mysterious. Filmmaking is a
little mystical but supremely banal and contrary. In a way, it's
really quite magical that the whole thing can ever come together.''

HEAT TAKING TOLL ON POULTRY FARMERS IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Torrid heat has claimed more than 200,000 chickens
and turkeys in one South Texas county, poultry farmers say, and the
toll could worsen if temperatures continue to soar past 100
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkeys, hens and broilers all got a good lick Sunday,'' said
A.M. `Buddy' Lindeman Jr., 65, a poultry farmer in Gonzeles County,
southeast of San Antonio. The temperature hit a record 107 degrees
on Sunday
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still. It was hot. The air did not move, and the
chickens just couldn't take it even with the fans and misters in
the house,'' said Lindeman, who estimates he lost around 18,000
birds.
</P>
<P>
   The expected high on Thursday in the San Antonio area was 102
and forecasters said it could reach 100 on Friday. The National
Weather Service issued heat advisories in parts of north and
southeastern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Grauke, the lab production manager for Tyson Foods in
Gonzales, estimated his loss at around 160,000 birds out of 6
million the company was raising in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost some broilers. The hens and pullets fared OK,'' Grauke
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We furnish the birds to the grower, and they raise them. Tyson
owns the birds, and the grower is paid to grow them for us. We
raise a little over a million a week here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grauke said growers face the unpleasant task of cleaning up the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a short period of time to render them or bury them.
That's your only choice. You just want to get rid of them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the death toll, it won't result in a shortage of split
breasts or leg quarters in the supermarket, Grauke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This loss is not even a drop in the ocean for the industry or
for Tyson. No one likes to lose birds, but we sell 35 million a
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the loss of the fowl is expected to hurt farmers,
especially the sweltering heat continues, said Travis Franke, the
Gonzales County agricultural extension agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good situation now. I haven't heard a financial
figure yet, but it will be significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While deaths of poultry are a normal summertime hazard, Franke
said, this is unusual.
</P>

SOME PROBLEMS WITH BRILL'S CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Steven Brill's object is to make the media look absurd, he
got off to a roaring start. On the front page of the New York Times
last Sunday was a story that said the first issue of Brill's
Content would report that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had
leaked information about his investigation to the press--including
the Times. Now if the question of whether Starr leaks to the Times
</P>
<P>
   is important enough for the front page, you might wonder why the
Times needed Brill to raise the subject. And who knows better than
the Times whether Starr leaked to the Times? Yet the Times cites
Brill and then cites its own Washington editor, Michael Oreskes,
saying the Times does not discuss its sources. And all this
contortion was induced by Brill's having leaked his own forthcoming
article to the Times.
</P>
<P>
   But if Brill's goal is to offer a socially useful critique of
media misbehavior, he is doing less well. There are two problems
with Brill's Content. The first is that though the editor seems to
envision a magazine that will hold the press accountable to a wider
public, he has created one that is unlikely to interest anyone
outside the media. The second problem is that though Brill deserves
a Pulitzer for self-righteousness, he simply isn't a careful enough
journalist himself to be criticizing others.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the magazine. After hearing it disputed for so
many days, potential readers will be fooled into thinking something
scintillating is going on. In fact, what will strike most people
when they finally get their hands on Brill's Content is how boring
it is. Dullness is a problem for media magazines in general, the
prototype being the ever worthy, always soporific Columbia
Journalism Review. CJR is filled with articles you'd say only
people in the business could possibly want to read, except that
they're too mundane even for people in the business. ``New Guild
contract at the Milwaukee Sentinel'' is the sort of thing CJR does.
You will find praise for that five-part series on Pennsylvania's
neglected infrastructure, and a spank for local TV news directors
who can't seem to put anything but crime on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Brill is hoping for an audience beyond the industry, but most of
his magazine--the first issue, anyhow--amounts to little more than
CJR on steroids. There's a long feature lauding the New York Times
for its fine reporting on mismanagement at the Columbia/HCA health
care conglomerate, and another rapping 60 Minutes for a flawed
story--aired 10 years ago--on alleged spontaneous acceleration in
Audis. There's a ``Heroes'' column about the reporter at Chicago
magazine who exposed the Beardstown Ladies for inflating the
returns of their investment club. Seems he had to go in for sinus
surgery the day the Wall Street Journal picked up his scoop. Crazy
... If I were a better person, perhaps I would read stories like
this through to the end.
</P>
<P>
   What is pernicious is Brill's attitude that he's the only guy in
the world with the guts to point out other people's mistakes. His
maximum opus on the first three weeks of Monica Lewinsky scandal
coverage is intended to be a devastating case study of media
malpractice. This 24,000 word story charges reporters with just
about every sin in the book, and commits most of them itself. Here
are 10 journalistic no-nos that stand out in Brill's piece:
</P>
<P>
   1) Overhyping to the Point of Dishonesty
</P>
<P>
   Brill contends the press has allowed itself to be used by Starr
to make Clinton look guilty. But to prove that Starr has leaked
grand jury information to the media--which, by the way, Brill
doesn't do--is not to demonstrate that journalists have been
irresponsible. By my reading, Brill does not document a single
error of fact made in the national publications he analyzes--the
New York Times, the Washington Post, Time, and Newsweek--and he
presents only a few cases in which any of them even misplayed a
story in a significant way. He ignores the tough coverage Starr has
received. To conclude, as Brill does, that the press is now ``an
institution being corrupted to its core'' wildly overreaches the
evidence he presents.
</P>
<P>
   2) Misquotation
</P>
<P>
   Susan Schmidt, a Washington Post reporter, claims she did not
tell Brill that she ``heard from Starr's office something about
Vernon Jordan and coaching a witness.'' The quote is damaging
because it implies Schmidt revealed the identity of an anonymous
source. For another example from a nonjournalist who claims
plausibly to have been misquoted by Brill, see ``Chatterbox.'' We
cannot know for sure who is right, because Brill did not
tape-record his interviews.
</P>
<P>
   3) Self-Contradiction
</P>
<P>
   Later in the piece, Brill writes that Schmidt and another
reporter ``declined all comment on their sources.'' Well, did she
or didn't she?
</P>
<P>
   4) Distortion
</P>
<P>
   Brill accuses Newsweek of suppressing critical exculpatory
information about Clinton in its initial story published online. He
cites a passage in the Linda Tripp tapes in which Tripp asks
Lewinsky if the president knows she is going to lie in her upcoming
deposition in the Paula Jones case. Lewinsky answers ``No.''
Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek reporter whom Brill criticizes,
notes, first, that the full exchange is equivocal--Lewinsky also
tells Tripp the president doesn't think she is going to tell the
truth. Second, the Newsweek online story stated that the tapes
offer ``no clear evidence'' to support or undermine Tripp's
allegations. And third, in the issue it published the following
Monday, Newsweek included the full excerpt--which is where Brill
found the out-of-context quote he claims Newsweek ignored.
</P>
<P>
   5) Neglecting Contradictory Evidence
</P>
<P>
   In building his case that much of the information could have
come only from Starr, Brill ignores a highly plausible alternative
explanation: Most if not all could have come from the lawyers of
various witnesses sympathetic to the president. Lawyers for the
Clintons, Betty Currie, White House steward Bayani Nelvis, and
others are operating under what is called a ``joint defense
agreement.'' They pool data about what their clients have told
Starr's grand jury. This means there are lots of lawyers with
access to information about what various witnesses said and a
variety of motivations to leak that information. Noting this
possibility isn't just a matter of fairness--it's an issue of basic
intellectual honesty.
</P>
<P>
   6) Giving Only One Side of an Argument
</P>
<P>
   Brill asserts that leaks from Starr's office were obviously
illegal. ``There are court decisions,'' he writes, ``that have
ruled explicitly that leaking information about prospective
witnesses who might testify at a grand jury, or about expected
testimony, or about negotiations regarding immunity for testimony,
or [about] the strategy of a grand jury proceeding all fall within
the criminal prohibition.'' Nowhere does he note court decisions
that have ruled the opposite, or acknowledge that the question is
far from settled.
</P>
<P>
   7) Faking Scoops
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the criticism of the press in Brill's piece is
familiar, much of it to the point of clich. Items about
``witnesses'' retracted by the Dallas Morning News and the Wall
Street Journal Web edition have been endlessly hashed over. So have
various nuances that Brill presents as revelatory. Both the
Washington Post and Slate, for instance, have reported that the
source for the erroneous Dallas Morning News item about a Secret
Service witness was Joseph DiGenova. Brill reinvents the wheel in
this way numerous times. And while we're at it, is it really a
revelation that Starr talks to reporters? At televised press
conferences he has held in Little Rock, he can be seen calling on
journalists by their first names, suggesting that he knows some of
</P>
<P>
   them pretty well and that he doesn't regard this as a secret.
</P>
<P>
   8) Sabotage Through Blind Quotes
</P>
<P>
   Defending the New York Times story on Currie, ``one Times
reporter'' is quoted by Brill as saying that ``this was not some
Sue Schmidt jam job.'' Schmidt is the reporter covering the
Whitewater-Lewinsky beat for the Washington Post. To allow her
competitors to snipe at her under cover of anonymity seems exactly
</P>
<P>
   the sort of thing Brill started his magazine to nail other
journalists for doing. And what's a ``jam job,'' anyway?
</P>
<P>
   9) Conflict of Interest
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kurtz reports in the Washington Post this week that Brill
and his wife donated $2,000 to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.
Most publications forbid journalists from making campaign
contributions, certainly to people they're writing about. But
whether or not Brill thinks such a prohibition makes sense--I look
forward to 20,000 words on the topic in a future issue of Brill's
Content--he should have disclosed this fact, as he acknowledged
when busted.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Reporters, especially TV reporters, have
been far from blameless in Flytrap. In the heat of competition,
stories have run that shouldn't have. But the best reporters
covering the scandal have done an extremely good job in a vexing
and unfamiliar situation. At times, they have behaved almost
heroically. When first offered a chance to listen to the Tripp
tapes, Isikoff refused, passing up what might have been the scoop
of the decade out of concern that doing so would put him in an
ethically compromised situation. Brill disparages these
compunctions, noting that Isikoff had to run off to ``CNBC, where
he was a paid Clinton sex scandal pundit.'' Actually, Isikoff
notes, it was MSNBC, where he was under contract to discuss the
campaign finance scandal. That makes 10) Errors of Fact. But more
to the point, is there anybody who thinks that Steve Brill, back
before he was a press scold, would have passed up the chance to
hear those tapes?

THE POSTMAN'S KNOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  By HERBERT STEIN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And none will hear the postman's knock
</P>
<P>
   Without a quickening of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   For who can bear to feel himself
</P>
<P>
   forgotten? --W.H. Auden
</P>
<P>
   How archaic that now sounds, technologically! And how true it
is, psychologically!
</P>
<P>
   No one hears the postman's knock any more. I can't remember that
I ever heard it. At home, I get my mail from a clerk at the desk
six floors below my apartment. At my office, I either find my mail
on a shelf or have it placed on my desk by my helper. In either
case I don't hear the postman's knock or ever see him.
</P>
<P>
   But the mail--now derisively called ``snail mail''--is not the
primary means of mediated communication; that is, communication at
a distance beyond face-to-face contact. First, there is the
telephone, today generally equipped with ``voice mail,'' which
allows you to retrieve messages left in your absence. Now,
increasingly, there is e-mail, opening up a whole new world of
instantaneous written communication.
</P>
<P>
   Along with this technological change have come some changes of
attitude. We no longer are in the position evoked by Auden,
passively awaiting a connection with the outside world through the
postman. Now we increasingly seek the connection. We go to a clerk
and ask for our mail; we call our answering service to see if there
have been any phone calls; we log on to our computer to search for
messages.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of means of communication has come a
degradation of the messages. In my youth, ordinary mail was the
standard means of communication among people who knew each other,
even those who knew each other very well, such as parents and
children. Long-distance telephone was reserved for the announcement
of births or deaths. Today, I send or receive hardly any personal
post office mail, except when printed matter, such as a newspaper
clipping, is enclosed. There is one person with whom I have a
fairly regular postal mail correspondence, and that is because we
are both trying to make a literary exercise of our writing to each
other and he, alas, does not have e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever personal communication there is in the mail I receive
at home is buried in a mountain of solicitations for contributions
from people or institutions I barely know. My usual response to
receiving my packet of mail is not Auden's ``quickening of the
heart.'' It is more likely to be ``ugh!'' At my office, my mail
consists almost exclusively of policy memorandums and pamphlets
from institutions to whom I am but one name on an enormous mailing
list. This mail makes me confront the feeling that I ought to study
it all and the realistic knowledge that I ought to throw it out.
Not much ``quickening of the heart'' there.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of junk in my e-mail also. When I log on in the
morning, I am sure to find a couple of messages offering me
pornographic videos with one click of the mouse, and at least one
message from someone ready to tell me how to earn $1,000 an hour
working from home. But still, the ratio of personal communication
to garbage is higher than for snail mail.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of personal communication is highest on the
telephone. But even there, when the bell rings and I pick up the
receiver I am likely to hear someone asking, ``How are you today,
Herbert?''--a sure sign of a stranger trying to sell me something.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against getting a ``quickening of the heart'' by any of
these media are high. But despite the odds, I find it worthwhile to
try to make the connection. We have been warned at the apartment
building where I live not to disturb the desk clerk by asking for
mail before 11:00 a.m. But I am there at the desk at 11:01. In my
office, two or three times a day I look into the room where the
mail is shelved. I call my home phone from the office at least once
a day to see if any messages have been left. From home, I call my
office three or four times a day. (One of the saddest and most
common responses is the operator saying, ``Herbert Stein, no new
messages.'') Even more frequently than that I log on to one of my
three computers, hoping to see the little message on the screen,
``You have mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Why am I so eager for the connection? It is not that I expect
anything ``practical.'' I am not going to get a letter offering me
a six figure advance for the publication of a volume of my personal
essays. No, it is as Auden says. I cannot bear to feel forgotten. I
seek from the mail or telephone or e-mail some sign of being
remembered--and not just as a nine digit Social Security number or
a 16 digit credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the communication don't matter. It can be a
postcard saying, ``I am in Mexico. It is hot here.'' It can be a
phone call asking, ``How are you?'' It can be an e-mail message
forwarding one of those slightly funny jokes that circulate around
the Internet. What counts is the connection--the feeling of not
being forgotten. Even if the message comes from someone you are
sure has not forgotten you--one of your children, for example--it
is a comfort to be reminded. It is also a comfort if the message
comes from a total stranger, as long as the message is for you
specifically and personally and not for a name on a mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, I am more avid in pursuit of such connections than the
average person. I know people who don't go down for their mail
until afternoon, who have no telephone answering service, and who,
</P>
<P>
   even if they have an e-mail account, don't log on to see their
messages for days at a time. But still, in one degree or another
the feeling described by Auden, of not wanting to be forgotten,
must be nearly universal. Whole industries rest on that
feeling--the greeting card industry and the florist industry, for
example. AT&AMP;T knows how important it is. That is why it implores
you to reach out and touch someone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jewish tradition, the dead live on in the memory of their
survivors. Something like that is true for the living also. The
living are most alive when they feel that they are remembered. That
is why I go for my snail mail, call for my telephone messages, and
log on to my e-mail--several times each day.

<HEADLINE>
CHARLTON HESTON, INTO THE BREACH 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By my reckoning, Charlton Heston has played: a CIA director, two
prophets (Moses, twice, and Brigham Young), two saints (Thomas More
and John the Baptist), an admiral, two generals (as well as six
captains and three majors), a cardinal (Richelieu), two kings
(Macbeth and Henry VIII), and three presidents of the United States
(Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, and Franklin Roosevelt's voice).
</P>
<P>
   So the National Rifle Association, which elected Heston
president this week, can be forgiven for mistaking the actor for a
real commander. NRA leaders believe the patriarchal Heston will
polish the gun lobby's lousy public image while galvanizing its
red-meat-and-gunpowder members. ``Hey, Moses is on our side,''
gloats NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.
</P>
<P>
   At 73, Heston does remain an awesome presence--tall,
grandfatherly, astonishingly handsome, his voice as magnificent as
ever. (President Heston has already employed that godly bass to
great effect. His NRA speech produced a memorable sound bite that's
being played and replayed on newscasts.) Heston's ascendance seems
to be filling some conservatives with what-if regret. Why didn't he
run for office when he was in his prime?
</P>
<P>
   Heston's fans are falling victim to Celebrity Identification
Disorder, the same malady that causes people to write letters to
soap opera characters. Heston periodically says, ``I am not
Moses,'' but his admirers don't quite believe it. He's been
associated with extraordinary men for so long that they assume he
must be one.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Heston embodies a very different, more mundane, but
still admirable ethos. The defining quality of his career is
competence, not genius. He was never a romantic lead, but he was
Hollywood's superstar during the epic's brief heyday. Since the
late '50s, however, he has enjoyed the most workmanlike career of
any actor in Hollywood. He has made a prosperous living by playing,
with slight variation, the same role for 50 years: the hero with a
stick up his rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Heston is the Volvo of Hollywood actors: never brilliant, never
awful, always reliable. He has appeared in more than 80 movies,
countless TV films, dozens of plays. He is always first on the set.
He's unfailingly polite to co-workers and respectful to directors.
He never misses work because of illness. Appropriately modest, he
credits his success to his ``physical equipment'' rather than his
talent: his height and good health, as well as that voice, that
jaw, and that nose. Heston researches his roles assiduously,
memorizing Old Testament passages to play Moses and reading all
Michelangelo's letters to play him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many actors of his generation, Heston has cheerfully
adjusted to senior citizenship. He accepts lesser parts in bad
movies (Call of the Wild) and worse television (The Colbys, a
short-lived, dreadful Dynasty spinoff). He has become a hired-gun
narrator, the guy you buy when you need God's voice. Heston's
signature characters (Moses, Ben-Hur, El Cid) always took
themselves seriously, but Heston doesn't. He has played
self-mocking parts in Wayne's World 2 and Bud Light ads. He is a
pro, a hack, the guy whose highest value is that he gets the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Off-screen, too, Heston leads an unremarkable life. He has been
married for 54 years and is extremely close to his two children. He
lives quietly on a (well-armed) Los Angeles estate, eschewing
parties for history books and his journal (author of three memoirs,
he is an excellent, funny writer). And his activism is a steady
hobby rather than an obsession. He's an enthusiast, but also a
dilettante. In the early '60s, he was a staunch civil rights
advocate. In the early '80s, he advised Ronald Reagan on National
Endowment for the Arts funding. He has condemned the nuclear freeze
movement, obscene rap music, and overpopulation. In every case
Heston has been effective without being monomaniacal. (His
rhetoric, admittedly, is not always restrained. He denounces
political correctness with froth-at-the-mouth language that would
be hilarious if it weren't so nasty.)
</P>
<P>
   Heston has even had moderate instincts about gun rights. Until
recently, he hasn't spent much time pushing the Second Amendment.
After Robert Kennedy's assassination in 1968, he endorsed strong
gun control legislation, and as recently as last year he declared
that AK-47s are ``inappropriate for private use.'' (Heston's
``softness'' on gun rights was an issue in his NRA election, but he
has quieted critics by backing off his earlier statements and
hewing to the NRA's official line. He recently said that a
Washington state initiative to require trigger locks was ``written
by Satan.'')
</P>
<P>
   All this is to say: Those who liken him to Reagan misunderstand
Heston. It is an easy comparison. Both are Democrats who converted
to conservative Republicanism. Both are actors who involved
themselves in politics. Both served as president of the Screen
Actors Guild. Both are marvelous speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the critical point about Heston: He never grabbed
the ring. He declined invitations from Democrats and Republicans to
run for the Senate in California and resisted efforts to draft him
into the 1988 presidential race. He was an actor, is an actor, and
will always be an actor. His life is comfortable, and he sees no
reason to change it.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Heston the activist has accomplished more than
most private citizens ever hope to. But he has never done what his
characters would have. The extraordinary man, the man who believes
he can change the world, hungers for the power to do it and pursues
that power relentlessly. Reagan had that hunger and changed the
world. Heston has all the ``physical equipment''--brain, voice,
good looks--but not the hunger.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the NRA presidency is the perfect job for him. It's a
ceremonial position, a grand title with few responsibilities
attached. He will not actually run the NRA. His job is to give
speeches, to be a symbol, to act presidential. And there's no one
who acts presidential better than Charlton Heston.

AMERICAN AIRLINES SWITCHES TO `BUSINESS CASUAL' DRESS CODE _ FOR
NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Bob Crandall is out; casual is in.
</P>
<P>
   In what is being hailed as the first major change at American
Airlines headquarters under new Chairman and Chief Executive Donald
Carty, the airline now allows employees to dress ``business
casual'' every day.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall, who retired in May as the airline's chief, was a
button-down kind of guy who always wore suits and liked to see his
employees dress for success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he acquiesced in allowing casual dress on Fridays for
nonuniformed employees who didn't have direct contact with
customers. The new policy extends that to the rest of the week _
for now.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, which applies to about 20,000 management employees,
will continue through Sept. 4, according to a memo to employees
from Jaynne Allison, vice president for human relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard from our employees that they believe they are
more productive'' in casual dress, Allison wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the policy is continued after summer might depend on how
tasteful employees are in their casual dressing, the memo hints.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans, T-shirts, short shorts, halter tops and athletic shoes
are out, but golf shirts, open-neck button-down shirts,
Dockers-type pants and sleeveless shell tops for women are allowed,
airline spokeswoman Andrea Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting here in a business suit today because I felt like
dressing up,'' she said. ``But it's sure great to have the
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried but abandoned casual dress because
``employees did not exercise good judgment and became too careless
_ and too casual,'' Allison's memo says. ``Let's not be one of
those companies.''
</P>
<P>
   As a guide to what is appropriate, Allison said:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you find yourself standing in front of your closet,
trying to figure what to wear, try imagining what you would expect
to see if you were visiting another company's corporate
headquarters. My guess is that provides a pretty high standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Crandall began his vacation after a retirement party by stepping
onto an American Airlines flight to England wearing an open-collar
shirt and blazer. It might have been the first time, some observers
said, that he ever flew without a tie.

<P>
   Forget ``Year of the Woman'' proclamations. How about ``Century
of the Woman''?
</P>
<P>
   Many elements are in place for women to make major strides in
the workplace in the next century, according to two interesting
books now out.

   One is a bestseller by ABC Washington correspondent Cokie
Roberts called ``We Are Our Mothers' Daughters'' (Morrow, 197
pages, $19.95).

   Although this book may seem an odd choice for a business column,
Roberts does an excellent job of showing just how far the women's
movement has come in terms of business.
</P>
<P>
   Women own one-third of all U.S. businesses, or about 8 million
enterprises, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That number is
expected to grow to one-half of all businesses in a few years.
Currently, women-owned businesses employ about a quarter of the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of women-owned businesses outpaces that of all
businesses by nearly two to one,'' Roberts writes. ``And once a
woman starts a business, she's more likely to keep it going than
her male counterpart.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts uses her own interesting career, as well as those of
several other women, to highlight the advances made by women in
virtually every aspect of work, from the military to consumer
advocacy to business.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts notes that her career began just a few months before the
Civil Rights Act became law. (In an interesting side note, she
explains that women were included as a group along with minorities
in the language of the law only in an attempt by Howard Smith of
Virginia to split the vote and defeat the bill. It passed anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Her family was also involved in the women's movement,
particularly her politician mother and sister. Roberts' mother,
Lindy Boggs, who filled the house seat of her husband, Hale Boggs,
after his death, was instrumental in having women included in
legislation that was designed to protect minorities against
discrimination in the credit industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 50 women in the House of Representatives and nine
in the Senate, Roberts writes, and their votes are affecting
legislation on issues from gun control to child-support enforcement
to the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts writes eloquently of today's female experience, whether
as reporter, consumer advocate, soldier or entrepreneur, or as a
sister, wife or mother.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting study of women's advancement in the
workplace is titled ``Advancing Women in Business/The Catalyst
Guide: Best Practices from the Corporate Leaders'' (Jossey-Bass,
244 pages, $26).
</P>
<P>
   Written by the staff of a nonprofit research and advisory
organization focused on women called Catalyst, this book is based
on the current practices at some of the businesses Catalyst has
identified as winners. In fact, many of the companies have won the
Catalyst Award for successful women's advancement programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although not as personal as Roberts' book, this book does offer
concrete examples of how many firms have successfully hired,
retained and promoted women, to the benefit and profitability of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more companies now understand the importance of using
the widest range of talent available,'' the Catalyst staff writes.
``These companies and firms are focusing on a soup-to-nuts
approach, ranging from hiring and recruitment to career pathing and
mentoring, all based solidly on commitment from top leadership and
on fixing accountability for making change happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that women now constitute 46 percent of the
total work force and that more than half of the bachelor's and
master's degrees awarded every year go to women, it is becoming
increasingly more evident to many companies that women must be
considered a key part of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies highlighted in the book are Texas
Instruments, J.C. Penney Co. and Motorola, as well as Deloitte &AMP;
Touche, Dow Chemical, Knight Ridder and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Many women, particularly in the middle of their careers, ``slow
down, get derailed, disappear, or opt out of competition for
advancement,'' the authors write. This book offers ``an antidote.''

`OFF THE MENU': FOR A HOLLYWOOD INSTITUTION, JUST DESSERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In times of rapid change and shifting trends and enthusiasms,
the passing of institutions goes unrecorded all too often. By the
time anyone can react, the wrecker's ball has swung or the doors
have closed and the furnishings have been sold off here and there.
Cultural anthropology and archaeology are left the poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the case of Chasen's, the Los Angeles restaurant that
opened its doors in 1936; drew the elite of the movies to dine on
its high-cholesterol Hobo Steak and chili in the heyday of
Hollywood glamour, and closed on April 1, 1995, in part a victim of
more modern tastes, to make way for a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, two New York independent filmmakers with senses of
history and humor among their virtues saw in the passing of
Chasen's both the loss of an important link to another era and the
opportunity for a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Off the Menu: The Last Days of Chasen's,''
directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini. Their
valuable, poignant and often funny film mingles behind-the-scenes
views of the restaurant during its final week and interviews with,
and reminiscences by, the dedicated core of its staff, as well as
with the many luminaries who rushed back for a final visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're sick, nobody calls you,'' says Pepe Ruiz, the
bartender who invented the restaurant's Flame of Love cocktail.
``When you die, everybody comes to the funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   To compound the nostalgia, ``Off the Menu'' employs
black-and-white film clips from the days when the restaurant was
patronized by stars like Clark Gable, John Wayne, Spencer Tracy,
James Stewart, Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Kirk
Douglas, Gregory Peck, Greta Garbo, Lana Turner, Barbara Stanwyck,
Lauren Bacall, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly, not to mention a
succession of presidents, J.Edgar Hoover and gangsters like Mickey
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   David Brown, the producer, observes that Chasen's at its peak
was not so different from some of today's crowded, trendy New-Age
restaurants, although ``alcohol was the drug of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chasen's heyday, the film notes, was also a time when the
restaurant's Hispanic kitchen staff could scarcely hope to venture
into the dining area, much less aspire to rise beyond the most
menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So as the reminiscences roll on and the staff works with
polished professionalism through the final week, including the
party on Oscar night, watching ``Off the Menu'' becomes akin to
leafing through a sociological scrapbook in the company of people
who were there when the pictures were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The film is generous in its appreciation of the staff that
helped to make Chasen's so popular, giving ample time to the
outspoken and uninhibited dining room captain, Tommy Gallagher, who
called Sinatra ``Frank''; to the fussy and demanding Raymond
Bilbool, who commanded the banquet staff, and to their colleagues,
from maitre d' and waiters to coat room and ladies' room
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the Menu'' is a poignant farewell.

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: A RECORDER OF HISTORY MANUFACTURED IT, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mathew Brady was the most famous American
photographer of his day and is still one of the best known of ours,
and yet in a peculiar way he is not well known.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of his life is clear enough, but so few personal
documents survive that he might as well have carried on his
correspondence by e-mail. His very birth date was uncertain,
perhaps even to himself. At an advanced age he reluctantly told an
interviewer he was born ``near 1823 or 24.'' Death being one of the
few certainties in the lives of the famous, we know he died in
1896.
</P>
<P>
   His work is familiar but may not be his. He is enshrined as the
recorder of the Civil War, though he was only one among many.
What's more, most of Brady's photographs of the war were taken by
his employees and issued under Brady's name, as were his portraits.
</P>
<P>
   By 1851, when he won an international medal in London, his
eyesight was so bad that he could not handle a camera well. He
brought in the clients, posed them and lighted them, and no one
thought him less a photographer because an employee took the actual
picture. It is strange to think that a man who does not see well
decides to become a photographer; one wonders how many
photographers have been nearsighted and intent on seeing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathew Brady's Portraits: Images as History, Photography as
Art,'' at the International Center of Photography Midtown, is
billed as ``the first time since his studio closed over a century
ago that the full range of his work is gathered together in one
place.'' Mary Panzer, curator of photographs at the National
Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution, which organized
the exhibition, selected more than 100 images for this show,
including Civil War photographs. She also wrote the accompanying
book, ``Mathew Brady and the Image of History'' (Smithsonian
Institution Press).
</P>
<P>
   Brady's career began in 1844 and spanned every medium of his
time, from daguerreotypes to ambrotypes to stereographs and cartes
de visite and ``Brady Imperials,'' paper prints some 24 inches high
by 20 inches wide. The daguerreotypes and ambrotypes in this show
are unfortunately placed so low that most visitors must stoop
repeatedly to view them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Panzer's thoughtful, occasionally elegiac book brings up
many of the issues involved in the recording and manufacture of
history through images. The exhibition tries to navigate between
Brady's self-proclaimed dual roles as historian and artist, with
history generally winning out in the labels, which expound the
subject's achievements more often than the photographer's. They
also quite properly credit the Mathew Brady Studio as author.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits are fine, honest, grand but not officious,
straightforward and American. Some are elegant, a few eloquent, and
all far outdo the common run of studio portraiture. The men are
rock-solid and apparently prepared to tackle destiny if need be,
heroes of a sort but revealed by the camera to wear ill-pressed
clothes and tend to overweight. Still, without their attendant
history to say why we should care, they do not often stop the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Brady proclaimed his intention to capture an image of every
distinguished American and thereby write a textbook of his time.
The belief was that faces could teach lasting lessons; as Thomas
Carlyle wrote, ``Often I have found a Portrait Superior in real
instruction to half-a-dozen written `biographies.'''
</P>
<P>
   The photographs were meant to forge an identity for a nation
still uncertain of what set it apart and in need of a unifying
principle as slavery threatened to sunder it. Brady sought America
in the character of its leading citizens and memorialized it in the
new kind of monument created by photography. He wrote history on
the spot so that future citizens could read in his pictures what
their country stood for when it was still young.
</P>
<P>
   But history is notoriously fickle. It immortalizes some people
who played major roles in their day and simply discards others. Men
like Ulysses S. Grant and Jefferson Davis still stir up curiosity
about whether visual clues to character might shed light on events
they influenced. Just enough might be known about Horace Greeley to
make his tentative, even poignant expression a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But many of Brady's sitters are today mere strangers standing
still while time and viewers inexorably move on. Among lesser
figures, only the power of a personality has great interest now _
William Marcy, for instance, confronting us with a tense gaze and
the look of having braved a storm or two in his political career
and survived _ but not every personality is electric.
</P>
<P>
   A few exceptionally well-turned compositions can have their own
power, as in the photograph of actor Edwin Booth, the brother of
Lincoln's assassin, and his small daughter, who clings to him and
turns back to the photographer with some distrust.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Panzer suggests that history passed Brady's portraits by
while he was still alive, for the idealistic notion of heroic
leaders did not survive a war that many of those leaders may have
brought about. Brady went bankrupt after the Civil War, not once
but twice, and ended up poor. That was mainly because he was a bad
businessman and constantly in debt, but his war pictures did not
sell well when peace arrived, and Ms. Panzer says the postwar
audience was more interested in family pictures than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathew Brady's Portraits'' proposes other arresting histories.
One is the story of how images were manipulated long before the
computer came along. When Brady photographed General Sherman and
his staff, one general was absent. Brady took this man's portrait
later and pasted it onto the group image, then rephotographed it so
no one would know. Other photographs had sumptuous backgrounds
added by painters in Brady's employ, much as film and television
today project the Alps or outer space behind an actor on a set.
</P>
<P>
   After Lincoln's assassination, painter Alonzo Chappel asked
Brady to take photographs of everyone who had been in the room the
night Lincoln lay unconscious, each person posed as Chappel
specified. The painter then faithfully copied these portraits in a
picture showing all the visitors in the room where the president
died. This careful document was a fiction. The room was too small
to accommodate all those people, who visited by ones and twos
throughout the night. The photographically exact painting was an
early form of docudrama.
</P>
<P>
   The ``full range'' of Brady's work here includes a lot of
nonphotographic media: lithographed and engraved copies of Brady's
photographs in newspapers and journals; paintings made by artists
Brady hired to copy his portraits for exhibition in his gallery;
even a sculptured portrait, the presence of which is not explained.
</P>
<P>
   The show ends up being a history of the way photographic images
gained a wide audience in the mid-19th century through engraved
copies in illustrated journals or lithographs sold separately. By
1860, small, inexpensive images brought actual photographs into
many homes.
</P>
<P>
   And already the emphasis was on images of famous people, famous
for more solid achievements than those of many celebrities today.
Indeed, until early in this century, the press printed more
articles about politicians and businessmen than entertainers. Yet
Brady's subjects were the celebrities of his day, and he benefited
from fame by association.
</P>
<P>
   He was himself a star and worked hard to keep his name before
the public. Distinguished citizens had him take their portraits
because they intuited, if they could not yet have spelled it out,
that the world was becoming dependent on images, which in one guise
or another were already turning out to be the keys to fame, success
and whatever immortality life on earth affords. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathew Brady's Portraits: Images as History, Photography as
Art'' remains at the International Center of Photography Midtown,
1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, through Sept. 6.

CALIFORNIA FACULTY DEFEND ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some faculty in the University of California
system have jumped to the defense of ethnic studies programs amid
questions raised by Ward Connerly, a university regent who has
staunchly fought affirmative action in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to defending the curriculum, the professors
questioned whether the regents should be involved in curriculum
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legitimacy and credibility of the university depends
entirely on its ability to conduct research freely without
political intimidation,'' said Ling-chi Wang, chair of the ethnic
studies department at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said the university, not just his department, should be
concerned with Connerly's remarks this week calling for a review of
ethnic studies.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly is the man behind the regents' 1995 decision to ban
race-based admissions and hiring and, in 1996, the passage of
Proposition 209, the ballot initiative that effectively abolished
affirmative action in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who is black, questioned the validity of a course such
as black history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their contributions aren't being represented, you correct
that in an overall history course,'' he said. ``I'm not sure you
need a separate black history curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the legitimacy of women's studies, along with
gay and lesbian studies or any discipline that probes issues of
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like personal ancestry, or your heritage, to the extent
that they're important, you get them at home, or you should have it
in high school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly has asked for more information about ethnic studies
courses _ how many students take them, what they learn, what they
do afterward. He said he planned to talk to more professors from
all fields before bringing up the matter at a meeting of regents.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly acknowledged that curriculum matters are the
responsibility of the faculty at each campus. For the board of
regents to review a department would be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only way to do away with a department would be by
manipulating the budget. However, university system spokesman Rick
Malaspina said regents only distribute money from the overall
University of California budget to individual campuses and have no
say in how each campus chooses to allocate the money.
</P>
<P>
   Regent William Bagley, a San Francisco lawyer, described his
reaction to Connerly's comments as ``involuntary muscular
contractions in my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The board should not be determining what curriculum is
taught,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California campuses have courses that include African-American,
Asian-American, Native-American and Hispanic studies. The programs
were born out of the Third World student strikes at San Francisco
State in 1968. Gender and womens studies also emerged at that time.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco State and Berkeley were the first universities to
establish ethnic studies programs in 1969 and many schools around
the country followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Asian-American Studies Center at the University of
California at Los Angeles is the largest in the country, with an
endowment of more than $1 million and more than 2,000 students
enrolled in 70 classes each year.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic programs go beyond identity issues, and students who take
the courses are of all races, one professor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I taught ethnic studies at Sonoma State, it was mostly
white students,'' said Gin Yong Pang, a Berkeley-based professor.
``Many were interested in community work, or they'd say, `Our state
is becoming very diverse and I'm going to be working with a very
diverse population. If I have no idea where these people are coming
from, it's going to be very frustrating.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Connerly said the faculty who do question ethnic studies
programs are afraid to be vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some faculty members with serious reservations about its
academic merit just don't want to go on the record,'' he said.
``There's a lot of political correctness involved.''

`HAV PLENTY': A FEATHERWEIGHT BUT REFRESHINGLY BUOYANT SOCIAL
COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a male character in Christopher Scott Cherot's witty
screwball comedy ``Hav Plenty'' asks a woman he has just met,
``What's your first impression?'' she retorts, ``I'll let you know
when you impress me.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, an up-to-the-minute examination of the mating habits
of well-heeled young black professionals in New York City, is
packed with such snappy exchanges among competitive, upwardly
mobile characters who, despite their vanity and self-absorption,
are disarming in the vulnerability that occasionally leaks through
the cracks of their brittle exteriors.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator and self-deprecating observer of this scene is an
aspiring young novelist and screenwriter named Lee Plenty (Cherot),
who is the only member of his group to have no money. Temporarily
homeless and suffering from writer's block, Lee is camping out in
the apartment of Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell), an old college
friend, while she's visiting her mother in Washington. Beautiful,
chic, haughty and avidly materialistic, Havilland, who works in
publishing, is on the verge of becoming engaged to Michael Simmons
(Hill Harper), a pop-soul singer and songwriter whose debut album,
``Love 40,'' has just gone platinum.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, whom some are hailing as ``the new Marvin Gaye,'' is so
pleased with himself that he greets friends and fans alike with the
same annoying little slogan, ``Hey! Love 40, baby!'' One of the
songs on his record, whose lyrics Lee recites in a tone of mild
derision, is a swatch of smarmy braggadocio called ``Crack Addict''
that's not about drugs. As the movie opens, Havilland has already
caught Michael cheating once and has begun having serious doubts
about their future.
</P>
<P>
   Lee happens to be Michael's polar opposite, an anomaly in a
world of macho preening. He takes a self-effacing pleasure in
announcing that he is broke and ``homeless'' and then gauging the
revulsion that his admission incites. His statement that he doesn't
date prompts some women to assume he must be gay. But Lee's air of
exaggerated indifference exerts its own magnetism. And after
joining Havilland and her family in Washington for New Year's Eve,
he finds himself resisting the aggressive sexual overtures of four
different women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' may be a featherweight social comedy without a
political bone in its body, but its characters are refreshingly
buoyant. Havilland, whom Ms. Maxwell embodies with a perfect
mixture of heat and hauteur, is a woman who appears to have
everything, including an attitude. And the movie shows you exactly
how that attitude and the expectations that go with it can act as
an impenetrable barrier to any real personal fulfillment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The funniest character is Havilland's brassy best friend,
Caroline (Tammi Katherine Jones), who changes her hairdo every few
hours and ludicrously lards her conversation with French phrases.
Caroline is the kind of compulsively contrary person who, when
reading a warning sign not to flush a toilet, immediately presses
the lever to see what will happen, then afterward refuses to take
the blame.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Lee, the filmmaker's obvious alter ego, who binds this
froth into something that feels like a lighter-than-air hybrid of
Woody Allen and Spike Lee. It turns out, of course, that despite
his strenuous disapproval of her values, he has been in love with
Havilland since college.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, Lee turns to address the camera and announce
what will happen next. As he is about to have his first serious
relationship talk with Havilland, he invites us to follow him into
her bedroom and watch as he makes a complete fool of himself. With
his self-deflating cool and amused insight into the shallowness of
the buppie world in which he drifts, Lee is one of the most
original and likable characters to pop up in a movie in quite a
while.

ART REVIEW: A DREAM WORLD OF PAINTING, YIELDING ITS SECRETS
SLOWLY

   NEW YORK _ When Pierre Bonnard died in 1947, at 79, Cahiers
d'Art published an editorial by Christian Zervos, one of Picasso's
mouthpieces. Picasso called Bonnard a piddler, saying: ``Don't talk
to me about Bonnard. That's not painting, what he does.'' And
worse: ``He is not really a modern painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Zervos parroted Picasso's view, and since Cahiers d'Art was the
most influential art magazine, this opinion spread.
</P>
<P>
   In the 50 years since then, Bonnard's reputation has largely
recovered, though I think Americans still don't appreciate him
enough. He doesn't fit comfortably into the history of modernism,
so we tend to regard him as an anachronism: an Impressionist after
Impressionism was dead. Puritanical, we're also a little wary of an
art of such paradisiacal beauty, whose complexity and peculiar
sadness isn't immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonnard retrospective opening Sunday at the Museum of Modern
Art should change some minds. It's a tendentious show. The stress
is not on the early years, when he earned a niche in history as one
of the Nabis, who emulated Gauguin, but on his later years. The
idea is that Bonnard remained a modernist and didn't just turn into
a demode painter of bonbons on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one who has looked seriously at his work can have
thought of him as a lightweight hedonist, much less a piddler,
though he did paint some bad pictures because he painted a lot.
Never mind; his best work deserves to be ranked with Matisse's and
Picasso's, and if you doubt this, spend time in the show's last
rooms with the paintings of his wife, Marthe, which are mysterious
elegies of love. His self-portraits, as a group, are also
unequaled, and that's not forgetting Rembrandt's, van Gogh's,
Beckmann's or Picasso's.
</P>
<P>
   I dwell on Picasso because his genius seems the antithesis of
Bonnard's. The photographer Cartier-Bresson, who knew them both,
once explained Picasso's disdain for Bonnard by saying that Picasso
``had no tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true, Bonnard's art is tender, and it also requires
patience by a viewer to grasp its precise emotional pitch. You can
appreciate the pictures superficially because they're ecstatically
colored. But unless you look long and hard, you don't really get
Bonnard _ his rigorous geometry, the way his compositions are
locked in place yet everything seems fluid and shimmering, as with
Cezanne.
</P>
<P>
   And on one level that's the point of the art: it's about looking
hard and recognizing that things appear different when seen out of
the corner of your eye or squinting into the sun or staring from
light into shadow.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is his ``Breakfast Table,'' the parts of which
disentangle themselves only after we stare at it. Like other
Bonnards, it first looks flat, as if the forms were flowers pressed
between pages in a book. Someone has compared Bonnard's patchy
images to tweed. The woven surfaces yield slowly to depth.
</P>
<P>
   We gradually make out a landscape through a window, a teapot on
the table, the edge of a chair, the open door beside a radiator _
and Marthe gingerly inspecting a teacup with the same curiosity
that we have about the whole image. Proust, Bonnard's literary
analogue, wrote about ``optical illusions which prove to us that we
should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not bring
some process of reasoning to bear on them.'' And that's what's
happening here: Marthe struggling to put a name to what she sees.
</P>
<P>
   Only after a moment do we notice that there's another figure in
the picture, too: the mirrored reflection of the artist behind her,
looking at us looking at her looking at the cup.
</P>
<P>
   I think the source of Bonnard's intimacy is not that he painted
cozy interiors but that he inhabited his pictures in this way. He
once told a model that he wanted her not to sit still but to move
around the room while he painted. ``He wanted both presence and
absence,'' she concluded. Put differently, he tried to convey his
presence: to imply the interaction between him and his subject.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, critics like to link his pictures of Marthe
bathing to Degas' nudes because they look similar at first. But the
difference is that Degas maintained a clinical distance, while
Bonnard sometimes almost seems to project himself right into the
image of Marthe.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he paints his knee or thumb in a corner of the picture
to make explicit that he's there. Sometimes he's present implicitly
in the surface of the paintings, which looks caressed and nervously
fussed over. One friend of Bonnard's said that Bonnard loved and
cared for Marthe but also ``feared her, put up with her.'' They met
in 1893 and stayed together until her death in 1942. For a few
years, in the early 1920s, he had a relationship with a model named
Renee Monchaty. They spoke about marriage but he wouldn't leave
Marthe. Renee killed herself.
</P>
<P>
   One story has it that he found her body in a bathtub. Bonnard
depicted her in ``Young Women in the Garden'' as a kind of robust
flapper-angel: a beaming blond with emerald eyes. Marthe is a dour
shadow figure looking on. The picture was begun in 1923. Bonnard
returned to it at the end of his life, after Marthe was dead,
adding a cornflower backdrop for Renee, a halo.
</P>
<P>
   Marthe, by contrast, was often likened to a startled bird: a
dark-haired, slight woman of fragile health, apparently given to
delusions, with a hoarse, asthmatic voice. Her suspicion of
everyone except Bonnard shaped their vagabond life in secluded
villas and cheap hotels. He was a successful painter, yet they
seemed to revel in monastic discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   He dressed like a retired government clerk, and he drew on any
odd scrap of paper, which he then stuffed into his rumpled jacket.
He also sketched on the pages of a little pocket calendar in which,
every day, he noted the weather. It's a pity the show doesn't
include his drawings. Their relationship to his paintings would
make another good exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   At the small pink stucco house on a hill in Le Cannet, near
Cannes, where Bonnard and Marthe finally settled, he devised a
cramped, jerry-built space with a little bamboo table for his
paints and a chipped plate for a palette. He tacked his canvases to
the wall, several at a time, close together, like postcards on a
bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There's a wonderful photograph by Brassai, from 1946, showing
several of these pinned-up canvases, and Bonnard, in a hat and
furry slippers, bending over to touch up one picture of an almond
tree. It's the pose of a man feeding birds, a stooped figure of
sweet humility.
</P>
<P>
   Was he suffocated in marriage? Who knows? Love affairs are
always inscrutable from the outside. A self-portrait from 1931,
which is in the exhibition, shows him as a scrawny shadowboxer,
fighting who knows what demons. Mostly he seems to have spent a
life contentedly painting what was immediately around him because,
for his purposes, that was enough. He often spoke about dreaming
while painting, and this may have meant partly that he escaped into
art but also that he allowed the images to assume their own lives:
letting the shapes shift and the forms take on new guises. ``People
always speak of submission to nature,'' he said. ``There is also
submission to the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   So he painted the mix of jasmine, mimosa, honeysuckle and
wisteria in the garden behind the house at Le Cannet as if it were
Eden. Occasionally he would sneak away from Marthe, through the
garden, to walk the dog or to meet friends for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise they were together, alone. She is in 384 pictures
by him, her face mostly blurred or obscured. It makes sense that
her tub, as he paints it, has often been compared to a coffin or a
womb. It can be either. Bonnard, a master of indirection, was a
lifelong disciple of Mallarme. I recommend reading the letters
between Matisse and Bonnard. Matisse was enraged after Bonnard's
death by Zervos' editorial in Cahiers d'Art and scrawled across his
copy of the magazine: ``I certify that Pierre Bonnard is a great
painter today and assuredly in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letters are something else: understated, modest. They
can make you weep, though it's just two codgers moaning about the
weather and their health because everything that's really important
goes without saying.
</P>
<P>
   And that's essentially how it is in Bonnard's art. Things don't
happen, they're implied.
</P>
<P>
   Above all you find this with his pictures of Marthe. He's
unflinching when it comes to aging in his self-portraits,
heartbreakingly, but she remains in the pictures of the 1940s
uncannily as she was in ``Siesta'' of 1900. Only the light changes.
Increasingly Bonnard paints gaily patterned rooms where big bowls
of fruit sit on the tables and the open windows allow the beaming
summer sun to pour in on perfumed breezes of orange and lavender.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Marthe, sitting at the table or standing before a
mirror, a ripe reflection of youth, eternally 25. Sarah Whitfield,
the curator who organized this exhibition for the Tate Gallery in
London, where it was shown this spring, suggests in the catalog
that we see these pictures as images embalmed in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``These works crystallize what has always been Bonnard's primary
mood, that of elegy,'' Ms. Whitfield writes. ``He has often been
described as a painter of pleasure, but he is not a painter of
pleasure. He is a painter of the effervescence of pleasure and the
disappearance of pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Walking through the show I suddenly recalled a favorite
passage from Nabokov's ``Speak, Memory'': Uncle Ruka finds some
French children's books from his own childhood in Nabokov's
schoolroom. Nabokov comes across the same books decades later and
they trigger the recollection of Ruka recollecting his past:
</P>
<P>
   ``I see again my schoolroom in Vyra, the blue roses of the
wallpaper, the open window. Its reflection fills the oval mirror
above the leathern couch where my uncle sits, gloating over a
tattered book. A sense of security, of well-being, of summer warmth
pervades my memory. That robust reality makes a ghost of the
present. The mirror brims with brightness; a bumblebee has entered
the room and bumps against the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is as it should be, nothing will ever change,
nobody will ever die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnard'' opens on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 W.
53rd St., where it remains through Oct. 13.

RENO OFFERS AID IN HATE-CRIME CASE IN JASPER, TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno
offered Thursday to help the small town of Jasper, Texas, with its
prosecution of three white men in the hate-crime killing of a
disabled black man in order to avoid letting ``dollars become part
of the equation of justice.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the rural logging town of about 8,000 people are
struggling with the costs of trying not only that case but an
earlier murder case as well.
</P>
<P>
   The community must find the resources for prosecutions that
could seek the death penalty in the highly publicized slaying of
James Byrd Jr., who was chained and dragged to his death behind a
pickup truck in the early hours of June 7, and in the bludgeoning
death of a local builder on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper District Attorney James Gray is awaiting final results of
laboratory tests before deciding whether to seek the death penalty
in the Byrd case. With an annual budget of less than $250,000, Gray
expects the two cases to cost many times that amount to prosecute.
He will present evidence in both cases to a grand jury, which will
convene July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said at her weekly news conference here that she had spoken
with Gray about how the Byrd case should be pursued to ensure that
justice is served. Although no decision has been made on whether
the federal government will pursue charges of civil-rights
violations against any of the three suspects in the Byrd case, Reno
said she offered to give the local prosecutors as much help as she
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funding should not be an issue with respect to justice,'' she
said. ``I hate to see dollars become part of the equation of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the federal government could aid the local authorities
by providing investigative assistance and help with forensic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Byrd, whose headless torso was left in front of a
black cemetery June 7, a state pathologist said this week that the
49-year-old man was alive when he was chained to the truck.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sheriff Billy Rowles, that suggests a kidnapping
occurred and means that the suspects could be charged with capital
murder _ homicide committed in conjunction with another crime _
which would allow the prosecutor to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Charged already with murder in the case are Lawrence R. Brewer,
31, of Sulfur Springs, Texas, and Shawn A. Berry and John W. King,
both 23, of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The second case stirred little interest outside of Jasper but
could end up costing a lot of money to prosecute, according to a
Justice Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The builder, Jerry McQueen, 47, was bludgeoned to death at his
hunting camp, according to local authorities. Deputies arrested
Donald Kinebrew, 34, three days later. They said Kenebrew, an
employee at McQueen's cement company, had McQueen's wallet when he
was arrested and that a pile of bloody clothes was next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has said that he thinks this case also qualifies as capital
murder.

   JAPAN-ASSESS (Tokyo) _ In a few weeks, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto will face nationwide elections as he presides over the
worst recession in more than half a century, a limp stock market
and the highest unemployment rate since records began to be kept.
Yet his governing Liberal Democratic Party is overwhelmingly
expected to do very well. The latest polls show it with more than
five times as much support as any other political party in Japan.

   CHINA-MIDDLECLASS (Beijing) _ Like a phoenix rising from the
ashes of Communism, the last few years have seen the a stunning
growth of a flourishing Chinese middle class. Ten years ago, this
group did not even exist. Today its core of independent businessmen
has been joined by a growing number of private-sector lawyers,
artists and employees of joint-venture companies. It is first
defined by what its members have: computers, microwaves, interior
decorators and, increasingly, cars and homes. On Saturday nights
they go to concerts; in winter they vacation in Thailand. But the
rapid accumulation of material things has left its psychological
mark as well, infusing this group with a kind of independence, and
carefree optimism, that has not existed in China for decades. By
Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   CHINA-HOUSING (Beijing) _ The Chinese government has formally
spelled out its radical new housing policy, under which the
hallowed right of workers to virtually cost-free apartments will be

the state-run news media, most of China's urban residents will be
required either to buy their homes or pay much higher rents. By

   TOBACCO-SUITS (New York) _ For months, cigarette industry
executives have said they would rather fight every lawsuit filed

tobacco introduced by Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But now with the
defeat Wednesday of the McCain bill, they are likely to get plenty
of practice. Today, over 800 lawsuits are pending against tobacco
companies, a figure that represents a quadrupling of the number of
such cases in just three years. For cigarette makers, the
rapidly-accelerating rate of lawsuit filing is also producing a
high-speed game of legal Russian Roulette. And with ever courtroom
wound suffered by the industry, such as a recent verdict in
Florida, more lawsuits are likely to come. By Barry Meier.

   MANZANAR-NATIONAL-SITE (LONE PINE, Calif.) _ The stone sentry
posts stand empty and silent now at Manzanar, their graceful pagoda
shapes a haunting reminder in the desolate high desert here on the

stretch of scrub off Highway 395 was the largest outpost between
Los Angeles and Reno, the place where 10,000 Japanese-Americans,

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Duval, one of the golfers in the U.S. Open
field who has recently discovered the magic of fitness, was waxing
on the vital topics of the day _ the height and fluffiness of the
rough, the hardness of the greens, the state of the club face in
modern society and the debatable virtues of ``The Fountainhead'' _
when someone asked him if, given the choice and equality of
paycheck, he would rather play golf or go fly-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real good question,'' he said with a laugh, making it
clear without saying so that he would rather sit on a boat
terrorizing the local trout than shoot 70 anywhere in the world.
``I don't know how to answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, he does. Even though he lost 40 pounds to improve
his stamina, to the point where you just want to give him a
sandwich on general principle, there is a part of him that sees the
value in a hamper full of goodies, an ice chest full of more than
just ice, and a day without exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, a man of the people. The Eva Peron of the PGA, if you
must strain for an analogy.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, we suspect there are more of them out there _
``them'' being golfing flatbellies who stifle their natural craving
for a properly prepared dish of linguine and sausage in search of
the proper way to hit a sand wedge or some other fascist silliness.
</P>
<P>
   We have heard ad nauseam of the legion of golfers who are now
doing hours of flexibility and strength work because of the sudden
minirash of back injuries, because better fitness might allow them
to play a couple of extra years on the Senior Tour down the road,
and because it is good for the PGA Tour to display its clientele as
athletes in the truest 31-waist sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, we've had enough of it. Better for us civilians to
take solace in the tales of those who either took the cure but
aren't fanatics about it, or those who defy convention. Your Colin
Montgomeries, your Fuzzy Zoellers, your John Dalys, your Tim
Herrons yearning to have a good round and then top it off with a
proper dinner instead of two hours on Satan's treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Westwood, the big-haired Englishman, says he lost seven
pounds for the betterment of his game but admits he has put back on
at least a couple since arriving in town. Tom Lehman, who dropped
25 pounds over the winter and lost his rhythm, now says he has
found it again and hastily adds, ``I read somewhere that I'm a gym
rat now, that I work out for an hour every day ... that's not true.
I just lost some weight.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of attitude we need to see more of this week.
As the modern golfer gets farther and farther from his or her less
angular forebears, it is heartwarming to know that not everyone in
the field wants to be able to lay on his bed at night bouncing
quarters off his stomach. It is not, you see, the true golfing way.
</P>
<P>
   The golf establishment has always had this problem coping with
those who claim that golf is not an athletic endeavor, let alone a
sport. This is, of course, nonsense, because golf meets all the
criteria for membership _ it requires the use of your body in a
pursuit that requires skill and strength, it is a sport whose goal
can be quantified (one stroke equals one stroke, period), and you
neither have to wear rhinestones nor smear your hair with gelatin
to impress the Romanian judge with the bad posture and the squint.
</P>
<P>
   This is also why golf struggles so with the Casey Martin issue,
because it fears the communist notion that people will think golf
is not really about skill and artistry but about riding around the
course on a modified sofa and minibar and throwing the empties out
the back every other hole.
</P>
<P>
   The level of discourse in that matter has become so grindingly
dull that Martin spent much of Monday and Tuesday being asked about
the number of seats on his cart. Nothing this side of ``NASCAR On
The Air'' delves into such vehicular detail, and with less benefit
to society.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it's enough to make your brain leak out your ear. Or to
hit the guilty party with a dictionary until his brain leaks out
his ear.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the best outcome this week would be for Montgomerie,
or Herron, or Zoeller to win the tournament _ or for that matter,
even Guy Boros if you want to add to Olympic's tradition of
rewarding the previously underknown. The Olympic Club is a tough
place to walk, true, but the Texas Open is played on a far more
hilly course in San Antonio (they use carts in some portions of the
grounds) in heat that would make Bolivians cranky, and the last
three winners were Duffy Waldorf, David Ogrin and Herron _ total
throw-weight 655.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, a victory by one of the above will spare us
another long acceptance speech by the winner in which he thanks his
wife, his kids, his primary through tertiary sponsors, and his
personal trainer Gunter. Not necessarily in that order. Because
athleticism, shotmaking and the odd cheeseburger are not mutually
exclusive, and never have been.

`HENRY FOOL': A PERFECT MODERN PARABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The affectless precision of Hal Hartley's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
his ``Henry Fool.'' Here is a great American film that's no more
likely than ``Nashville'' to turn up on the American Film
Institute's Top-100 hit parade (where ``Rocky'' outranks ``The
Searchers'') but will linger where it matters: in the hearts and
minds of viewers receptive to its epic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Without forsaking the clean, spare look and hyperreal clarity
that are so much his own, Hartley moves into a much larger realm
than was used in his earlier works. This film aspires to be a
meditation on (among other things) art, trust, loyalty, politics
and popular culture. With utter simplicity, and with unexpectedly
intense storytelling, it achieves all that and more.
</P>
<P>
   Shot so beautifully by Michael Spiller that its squalid Queens,
N.Y., settings assume an instant mythic quality, ``Henry Fool'' is
a perfect modern parable. It begins with the utter degradation of
Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and the mysterious appearance of a
stranger who may be his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up off your knees!'' orders Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan, a
stage actor making a swaggeringly good screen debut) barging into
the basement apartment in Henry's house and instantly taking up
residence. Henry's arrival would be Faustian even if it were not,
thanks to the basement hearth, greeted by a fiery glow.
</P>
<P>
   The scarecrow-thin, owlish Simon (the haunting Urbaniak bears a
deliberate resemblance here to young Samuel Beckett) works as a
garbage man and takes heaps of abuse from much of the neighborhood.
That includes his heavily medicated mother (Maria Porter) and his
slatternly sister Fay (played with deadpan, nonchalant wit by
Parker Posey, in one of her best roles). Simon is so silent that
his response to this literally and figuratively Grim existence is a
mystery until Henry urges him to write down his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Henry describes his own huge, unpublished work, known variously
as ``my opus'' or ``my confession,'' with supreme grandiosity.
``It's a philosophy,'' he tells Simon. ``A poetics. A politics, if
you will. A literature of protest. A novel of ideas. A pornographic
magazine of truly comic-book proportions.'' The work's mystique
comes from Henry's cagey unwillingness to let anyone see it.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's writing also remains hidden at first (and always wisely
hidden from the audience). But as it starts to emerge, its effects
are astonishing. The mute girl at the local World of Donuts, this
story's cultural and culinary mecca, reads a few words and she
suddenly sings. A girl who once bullied him becomes a literary
groupie in a beret. A waitress with conservative political leanings
is offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You brought on my period a week and a half early, so just shut
up!'' complains Fay, after typing Simon's manuscript. When the
Board of Education denounces Simon's poem as scatological (in a
film that insists on a few wild gross-outs of its own), Simon and
Henry share a proud handshake. ``An honest man is always in
trouble,'' Henry has announced early in the story, and an honest
artist is, too.
</P>
<P>
   Genius and celebrity eventually shift the story's balance in wry
ways. There's an especially droll sequence devoted to the world of
publishing, where slick young executives insist on thinking way
beyond mere books. The effect of a right-wing political candidate
on the neighborhood's sleaziest character (Kevin Corrigan) points
to another wave of the future. But the tension between Simon's
utter seriousness and Henry's big dreams always remains the story's
central concern, especially after Simon learns more about Henry's
past.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``To be honest, my ideas, my writing, they've not always been
received well _ or even calmly,'' Henry eventually confesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Fool'' is its own testament to the power of words, even
as it merges the fortunes of its characters in a wonderfully
ambiguous final gesture. Hartley's splendidly articulate screenplay
(which won a prize at Cannes this year) is as exacting as his
visual style. Even more than its story of private genius and public
opinion, the dialogue itself offers proof that every word matters.
All the film's characters speak with utter honesty about matters
both large and small, and sometimes make a major virtue of
understatement. As in: ``Look, Simon, I made love to your mother
about half an hour ago, and I'm beginning to think it wasn't such a
good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``Henry Fool'' shows off such fine compositional sense
that there's not a paint streak on a wall that doesn't tie in with
some other part of the frame. There are no casual details and
absolutely no clutter. Props are where Hartley finds them, to the
point where a stack of huge tires, a gum-ball machine or a garden
hose can be as arresting as another film's elaborate set.
Everything the camera sees is present for a reason.

REMEMBERING JUDY, OVER AND UNDER THAT RAINBOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here was the voice quivering with a scary,
heartbreaking fragility one second, then thrillingly confident the
next, and always hovering perilously on the line between tears and
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Here were the eyes, wide and scared and darting like the gaze of
a frightened deer one second, but fiercely mirthful the next as the
cherry lips spread into a grin of voracious playfulness. And don't
forget the hands, crossed on the chest one second, then suddenly
flung upward to the sky, the tiny fists clutched and shaking with
an iron determination.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was Judy Garland as seen in film clips from her 1960s
television show and flashed onto the walls of Carnegie Hall. These
clips, of which there were not nearly enough, along with a final
galvanizing concert recording of Garland singing ``Over the
Rainbow,'' were the only heart-stopping moments in a disappointing
and often dreary two- evening celebration of Garland's music on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The simple, sad fact of the tribute is that even on old
black-and-white videos, Garland's voice and stage presence are so
mesmerizing that no one could begin to compete with the raw
emotional power surging through her body like a kind of natural
electricity. Many tried, not the least of them Lorna Luft, one of
Garland's two daughters (Liza Minnelli was conspicuously absent),
and the evening's co-host with a robotically formal Robert Stack,
an early Garland pal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luft has a solid, medium-large, pleasantly rounded voice
with no defining personality, and her interpretations of several
Garland signature songs (including a big pumped-up ``The Man That
Got Away'') performed to the brassy orchestral arrangements Mort
Lindsey created for Garland, lacked inner fire.
</P>
<P>
   They were dutiful, affectionate imitations whose tone was in
keeping with Ms. Luft's blandly upbeat reminiscences of growing up
with ``mama.'' To hear Ms. Luft tell it, life with Garland was a
protracted episode on a cheery sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Following Ms. Luft's lead, a bunch of second-rank singers were
trotted out to perform Garland signature songs and pay stiff verbal
tribute. Vikki Carr, Gogi Grant, Nancy Dussault and Pamela Myers
were among the old-style Las Vegas and Broadway belters who went
through the motions of ``feeling'' Garland's spirit and came up
empty. Their male equivalents, Robert Goulet and Jack Jones, also
turned in performances that had the same pallid professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hollow emoting and sanitized praise, a few
performers succeeded in making personal statements. Over two
evenings, the only live vocal performance with emotional bite was
Weslia Whitfield's lingering, pungently accented version of
``You're Nearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Herman appeared both evenings to sing his clever rewritten
version of ``That's Entertainment'' (renamed ``That's Judy
Garland'') and to announce that the ``trick'' behind composing his
Broadway showstoppers has always been to imagine them sung by
Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many anecdotes told, only those related by Shana
Alexander and Elaine Stritch conveyed a vivid sense of the ball of
lightning that was Judy Garland. Ms. Alexander who was backstage
with Garland on the night of her historic Carnegie Hall concert on
April 23, 1961, remembered holding the singer's lighted cigarette
as she clutched the curtain and prepared to make a stage entrance
during which she ``actually got bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stritch, as is her way, cut to the chase with tales of
partying with Garland until 6 a.m. In summing up Garland's power as
a performer, Ms. Stritch seemed genuinely awestruck by the
phenomenon of someone who, as she put it ``reached out to an
audience with absolute 100 percent truth.'' Hyperbolic? Yes. But
also accurate.

DISNEY FIGHTS THE GOOD FIGHT WITH A GORGEOUSLY ANIMATED `MULAN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Disney still high on the Southern Baptist Convention's
dartboard of decadence, the studio couldn't have timed the release
of its 36th animated feature any better.
</P>
<P>
   Just as 1996's ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' _ with its
messages of religious persecution and lustful villainy in the
clergy _ rang out in theaters just days after the convention
announced its national boycott of the Walt Disney Co., ``Mulan''
also arrives with its irony intact.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the convention asserted in a revised statement of
beliefs that ``a wife is to submit graciously to the servant
leadership of her husband''; this week Disney unveils the story of
strong-headed young Chinese girl who forces an entire culture to
rethink its long history of subjugation of women.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant coincidence, or a piece of sociopolitical marketing
savvy on the grandest scale? As deliciously devious as the latter
would be, considering the amount of time it takes to produce an
animated film _ ``Mulan'' has been in the works for the past five
years _ a pleasant coincidence seems most likely.
</P>
<P>
   But ``pleasant'' is hardly a strong enough word to describe the
lavish work of art that is Disney's latest animated effort.
Gorgeously animated, delightfully voiced and expertly unfolded,
``Mulan'' stands as one of the studio's finest cartoon features
since ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ming-Na Wen gives voice to the headstrong Fa Mulan, another
well-rounded addition to the Disney pantheon of strong female
characters. Filled with good intentions, Mulan struggles to bring
honor to her family and earn the respect of her father, but she
never quite gets it right.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hun army invades China, Mulan is distressed to learn
that her aged, infirm father will be required to fight. So later
that night she takes his armor and sword, disguises herself as a
man and runs away to fight in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that revealing her deception will mean certain death for
their daughter, the family prays to their ancestors to protect her.
The best the family spirits can muster is a scrawny, snakelike
dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy) who, along with a lucky-cricket
friend Cri-kee, sets out to help Mulan become a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   It's no easy task, especially considering that Mulan's fellow
fighters are a few noodles short of a bowlful. There's Chien-Po
(Jerry S. Tondo), the gentle giant; Yao (Harvey Fierstein), the
diminutive tough guy; and Ling (Gedde Watanabe), the lanky
loudmouth. Of course, Mushu's lamebrain advice usually lands Mulan
in hot water with her commanding officer, Captain Shang (the voice
of B.D. Wong), a stern taskmaster and top-notch soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The troops are whipped into shape soon enough, just in time to
witness the aftermath of devastation of a nearby village by the
Huns, led by the evil Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer). When the armies
finally clash in an amazing computer-animated attack sequence that
blows away the wildebeest stampede in ``The Lion King,'' Mulan's
quick thinking saves the day. But then she is injured, and her
secret is revealed, forcing her expulsion from the army.
</P>
<P>
   Shan-Yu and the Huns aren't finished, however, and it's once
again up to Mulan to save the emperor from certain death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is a departure for Disney on a number of fronts. While
technically a musical, the Jerry Goldsmith score and Matthew Wilder
songs lack the kind of magic composer Alan Menken brought to
Disney's animated efforts. But like ``Hercules,'' ``Mulan'' is more
of a movie with songs in it than a full-blown musical, and a few
tunes _ namely ``Reflection'' and ``A Girl Worth Fighting For'' _
hold up well.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike almost every Disney film in recent memory, the plot
doesn't center on a love story. It focuses instead on the coming of
age of a young girl. And the studio explores Chinese mysticism and
faith more deeply and accurately than any culture it has Disneyfied
to date.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are pretty close to the Disney mold of late:
strong woman, goofy sidekicks, intimidating bad guy. Wen's Mulan is
a charming heroine, and Murphy steals every scene he's in, making
his mischievous dragon the first Disney creation to give Robin
Williams' Genie in ``Aladdin'' a run for his money. But the showy,
camp-it-up style of Disney's most memorable villains instead gets
the strong, silent treatment in the menacing embodiment of Shan-Yu.
</P>
<P>
   Created almost entirely by Disney's Orlando, Fla., facility,
``Mulan'' promises to take the studio in a bold new direction, the
single distinction that's kept it at the top of the animation game.
Let's hope DreamWorks, Fox and Warner Bros. are paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is rated G and is suitable for the whole family.

USGA TAKES SOFT STANCE ON NEW CLUBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the subject of Big Bertha and the other war
clubs of modern golf, what the U.S. Golf Association didn't say is
more notable than what it did.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Director David Fay said Wednesday that the USGA has
developed a ``conformance'' test to measure the spring-like or
trampoline effects of clubs, a growing concern in this age of
strong and long hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said particulars of the test _ which will be based on the
rebound velocity of a golf ball off a club face _ will be released
to manufacturers within the next few weeks, in advance of a meeting
with manufacturers and others this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the current crop of clubheads was pretty much cleared for
continued use.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there may be exceptions that we are not aware of,'' Fay
said, ``we expect that all clubs that (already) have been submitted
to the USGA will satisfy the new standard.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it for sweeping change on the eve of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA didn't directly address effects of several other
technological advancements in golf equipment that have been under
serious scrutiny, including balls, putter lengths, loft limits of
irons and number of clubs in bags.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's major manufacturers have talked of possible
lawsuits to help protect their billion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   They liked at least some of what they heard from Fay and USGA
President Buzz Taylor, who said: ``We are perfectly satisfied with
what we see today. But we don't know what is coming tomorrow. There
are an awful lot of people that have an aerospace or high-metal
technology background that are now involved in the game of golf,
and our consultants have suggested that there are materials around
the corner which may create a problem for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   John Solheim of Karsten Manufacturing, which makes Ping
products, said, ``I'm very happy to hear that our clubs meet their
specifications. But there's still a cloud of indecision over the
whole thing. I really feel they need to make field tests (of
clubs), not laboratory tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Ely Callaway of Big Bertha-making Callaway said, ``We're quite
pleased the USGA executive committee came to the conclusion that
modern-technology clubs are not a threat to the game _ and are in
fact good for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the interests of the golfers of the world, we want to
make improvements so that clubs are a little more forgiving,
accurate and get greater distance. We don't want to be inhibited. I
think the USGA threw up some caution on that _ and that's not good
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Solheim added, ``Innovation is part of the game,'' and noted the
potential effects of the USGA's club restrictions on the
recreational players who don't hit the ball like Tiger Woods or
John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 25 million golfers,'' he said, ``and only 2 million
of them have handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay tried to downplay any dispute with the manufacturers. Asked
if the USGA would try to make peace with the equipment companies,
he said, ``I didn't know we were at war.''

REPORT CLOUDS CONVICTED AU PAIR'S PRIOR INJURY DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Correcting title of NEJM editor in penultimate graf; a and i
coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A report published by an independent team of scientists casts
doubt on a central premise of Louise Woodward's criminal defense:
that an infant like Matthew Eappen could suffer a skull fracture
that eventually would kill him, then behave for weeks as if nothing
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of a prolonged interval of lucidity
between the injury and the onset of symptoms'' in children with
such severe head injuries, said the report in the current New
England Journal of Medicine. ``Thus, an alert, well-appearing child
has not already sustained a devastating acute injury that will
become clinically obvious hours to days later.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, by four physicians at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine, was commissioned by the journal to
respond to the scientific controversy over ``shaken-baby syndrome''
generated by the Woodward case, although the authors did not
specifically address that case. The report, and interviews with its
authors, generally bolster arguments raised by the Woodward
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This article has to answer even the most discerning of
skeptics that the prosecution case of how Matthew died, by
shaking-impact syndrome, is correct,'' said Martha Coakley, one of
the Woodward prosecutors who is now a candidate for district
attorney of Middlesex County in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ayub Ommaya, a Washington neurosurgeon who testified for
the defense, said there are ``holes'' in the journal report that
undermine its conclusions and make clear that ``it is certainly not
the final word.'' While he agreed that ``it is not common'' for an
infant to remain lucid after a severe head injury, Ommaya added
that ``such lucidity has been noted.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the journal article responds to general issues
surrounding ``shaken-baby syndrome,'' which became the center of
focus and confusion during last year's Woodward trial. The authors
say the syndrome is real and responsible for most severe brain
injuries by infants, but they also say a more accurate term is
``shaking-impact syndrome,'' since most damage is done when the
head forcefully strikes a surface.
</P>
<P>
   Can shaking alone cause the severe injuries often lumped as part
of the syndrome? Probably not, the UPenn doctors say, although that
``is still debated'' and severe shaking oftentimes leads to a baby
striking its head against a hard object.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's defense team didn't contest that 8-month-old Matthew
had suffered a severe head injury, but it argued that the injury
that killed him stemmed from a wound as old as three weeks rather
than from anything Woodward did to him before he was hospitalized
and days later died. That issue of whether a baby like Matthew
could die from an earlier severe injury, exacerbated by a
relatively minor later wound, was a key point of contention at the
trial, and was dealt with directly in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such rare events have been reported in older children and
adults,'' the UPenn authors said. But, they added, ``there is no
evidence that traumatic acute subdural hematoma, particularly that
leading to death, occurs in otherwise healthy infants in an occult
or subclinical manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence rather suggests that, after a truly severe injury,
there is an ``immediate or rapid onset of neurological symptoms,''
the authors wrote. They based that finding in part on a San Diego
study published last year involving 95 children who died from
accidental head injuries. All but one of those children ``had an
immediate decrease in the level of consciousness.'' The one
exception suffered a different injury than Matthew's and died of
surgical complications.
</P>
<P>
   But Ommaya, the former chief of neurosurgery at the National
Institutes of Health, said a far bigger study is needed to test
whether such delays in symptoms occur. ``You can't make a claim
that you can't have a lucid interval,'' he said. ``There are cases
of lucid intervals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal authors were less definitive with other
symptoms Matthew suffered, such as retinal bleeding. While
published reports suggest that such hemorrhages are found in ``65
to 95 percent of patients'' with shaken-baby syndrome, the authors
wrote, they are not by themselves proof of the syndrome and it is
tough to tell how long ago the bleeding began.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fact that Matthew did not have severe injuries to
the neck and upper vertebra, or obvious marks on his scalp, which
Woodward's lawyers say proved he was not a victim of shaken-baby
syndrome?
</P>
<P>
   The journal article says that when the surface the baby strikes
is soft, like a couch pillow, ``the force of the impact is widely
dissipated and may not be associated with visible signs of surface
trauma, even though the brain itself decelerates rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As for neck and vertebra damage, ``it's too ill-defined to say
you have to have a neck injury,'' said Dr. Cindy W. Christian, an
author of the journal article and head of the child abuse program
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ``I don't believe those
things have ever been described as necessary components for this
diagnosis'' of shaken-baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Angell, the New England Journal's executive editor, said
she recruited the authors of the article because they were
independent experts who the journal felt could help shed light on a
subject made even more controversial by the Woodward case.
</P>
<P>
   Such a neutral review was called for in the aftermath of the
trial by Harvey Silverglate, one of Woodward's lawyers. But
Wednesday Silverglate said that what he wanted, and still wants, is
a review not of generic shaken-baby issues like the journal
published, but one where independent scientists examine specific
evidence in the Woodward case, none of which the UPenn researchers
saw.

`BIOGRAPHY' LOOKS AT THE NELSON FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it was commonly referred to as ``Ozzie and Harriet,'' the
full title gives the game away. ``The Adventures of Ozzie and
Harriet'' posited everyday family life as a dynamic, exciting
activity, and the show went a long way toward convincing 1950s
middle America that was true.
</P>
<P>
   The images trotted out in this two-hour installment of
``Biography'' influenced and arguably warped the perspectives of
millions of less-than-picture-perfect families: Ozzie sitting in
the living room in a jacket and tie, reading the paper; Harriet
cheerfully making sandwiches in the kitchen while the whole family
looks on. Eventually, their younger son, Ricky, would pick up a
guitar and become a teen idol with hits like ``Travelin' Man,''
while his brother, David, steadfastly represented neglected
siblings everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coming along just when television was making its first major
impact, the Nelsons helped shape the American family's sense of
what it ought to be: close-knit and carefree. The documentary's
shrewd selection of a major Nelson problem shows Ozzie desperate to
find some tutti-frutti ice cream late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Covering three generations, this ``Biography'' episode is wider
in scope and more intriguing than most. It includes family movies
and interviews with the surviving Nelsons, notably David himself,
and all four of Rick's children. Still, it adheres to the form of
this immensely popular A&AMP;E series. It is straightforward and kind
rather than deeply probing, despite a few stabs at social
commentary. What is most surprising is how effectively its images,
both from the television show and from real life, linger.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary begins with a quick glimpse at Ozzie and Harriet
before they married. He was a teetotaling band leader; she was a
singer with a slightly sultry image. ``She was a babe in the
'30s,'' says their granddaughter, actress Tracy Nelson, the most
articulate and revealing source on camera here.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Ozzie had a brainstorm: a radio show called ``The
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,'' in which they played themselves.
Eventually, their children joined them. Inthe show's television
run, from 1952 to 1966, America watched the Nelson boys grow up and
marry, yet stay remarkably close to home.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to make too much of the way the Nelsons portrayed
themselves, blurring art and reality. ``Biography'' doesn't mention
that Jack Benny, and George Burns and Gracie Allen, were already
doing that. The difference is that the Nelsons depicted themselves
not as the show-business family they were, but as a typical family.
</P>
<P>
   The least believable element was that Ozzie had no apparent
employment on the show. Off-camera, he was a smart, controlling
businessman; he made a deal with ABC to broadcast the series for 10
years, with himself as producer, director and head writer.
</P>
<P>
   Though it tries, ``Biography'' doesn't convincingly depict a
vast distance between the Nelsons' on-air and off-air
personalities. Peter Graves, the narrator, says, ``The real David
Nelson, a typical self-conscious teen-ager, looked upon his
television character as a separate invention.'' But we never quite
see how.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the show ended that the perfect image began to
crack. But there were rumblings before that. Tracy Nelson recalls
being told what she calls ``an outrageous story'' by her mother,
Kris, who was three months' pregnant with Tracy when she and Rick
married. To preserve the family's wholesome image, Ozzie persuaded
the hospital to change Tracy's birth certificate; the infant was
even put in an incubator, though she wasn't really premature.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the family's problems centered on Rick, who became a
casualty of his own fame and image. His story is the most affecting
here, his absence the most haunting.
</P>
<P>
   He tried, with occasional success, to put together a new musical
career. He and Kris entered a tumultuous phase of drug use, and
eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents both effectively lost their minds at a certain
point,'' says Matthew Nelson, Rick and Kris' son (who with his
twin, Gunnar, made records as Nelson in the 1990s and repeated
their father's teen-idol success). Recalling her years as part of
the country's most idealized family, a sober Kris Nelson now says,
``I spent my whole life trying to fight that fairy tale: first
trying to be it and then trying to just tell the truth and get away
from that perfection that everybody was insisting on.''
</P>
<P>
   This Biography may overstate the importance of Rick's later
music, but not the strain of trying to outrun his youthful success.
``If memories are all I sing/ I'd rather drive a truck,'' he wrote
in the song ``Garden Party,'' his biggest adult hit. He was touring
in 1985 when his plane crashed and he was killed, at 45. By then,
Ozzie had died. David's wife, Yvonne, speculates that Harriet (who
died in 1994) dealt with her son's death by choosing to believe he
was simply on the road.
</P>
<P>
   With such revelations, the Nelsons become wrenchingly real. This
``Biography'' may leave deep social analysis to others, but it
brings the Nelsons vividly to life, and makes it possible to
understand how these sincere, appealing characters exerted such a
wishful hold on America's imagination.

A CENTENNIAL SERENADE TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ This city really knows how to give a party. This
weekend, it will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its
consolidation with a colossal three-day birthday revel in all five
boroughs.
 &HT;    Centennial Weekend, the apex of the yearlong New York City 100:
Greater New York Centennial Celebration, will salute the city on
land (with parades, street fairs, walking tours and exhibitions),
at sea (a harbor festival on the Hudson River with everything from
ferryboats to kayaks) and in the air (simultaneous fireworks in the
five boroughs on Saturday night, bursting over 24 miles of sky).
 &HT;    There will be festivities indoors (historic house tours,
prix-fixe meals at $18.98), on the pavement (centennial sidewalk
sales) and in greener places (a weekend festival at various
botanical gardens). At 3 p.m. on Sunday, bells will ring
simultaneously in all the boroughs.
 &HT;    There will also be lots of music: jazz and Latin bands at Coney
Island in Brooklyn, the Queens Symphony Orchestra in Flushing
Meadows-Corona Park, a sock hop at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, a
Dixieland band at South Beach on Staten Island, rock at the South
Street Seaport in Manhattan and an international music festival at
the World Trade Center. (A look at the musical line-up, by Jon
Pareles, follows.)
 &HT;    On Sunday, more than 100 institutions will waive admission fees
or offer free events as birthday gifts to the city. A complete list
can be found at the New York City 100 Web site: www.nyc100.org.

 &HT;    NEW YORK SINGS ITSELF A CENTENNIAL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JON PARELES
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city's music is the world's music, the sound of
every group to arrive since the Dutch were met by the Indians. To
commemorate the centennial of the annexation of Brooklyn and the
consolidation of the five boroughs into one city, the musical
celebration will be as varied, scattered and unpredictable as the
city itself.
</P>
<P>
   From brass bands to Central American punta music to jazz, oldies
and alternative rock, the centennial offers glimpses of New York's
many musical worlds. (There are also scores of nonmusical events:
walking tours, exhibitions and free admission on Sunday to many
museums and gardens in all five boroughs.)
</P>
<P>
   One major event is synchronized: a citywide display of fireworks
Saturday night at 9:30, which is expected to set a new record for
the widest geographic pyrotechnic display, covering 24 miles. The
fireworks are to be accompanied by free concerts: classical works
from the Queens Symphony Orchestra in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park;
Latin and Irish music on Coney Island Beach in Brooklyn, and high
school marching bands, Dixieland jazz and 1950s oldies (from Randy
and the Rainbows) at the South Beach Boardwalk on Staten Island.
There are more oldies (from the Regents, the Mellow Kings, and
Johnnie and Joe) on Orchard Beach in the Bronx, and, at South
Street Seaport in Manhattan, a concert by Rachid, a progressive
soul songwriter who shares Prince's mystical streak, slinky tenor
voice and willingness to explore.
</P>
<P>
   New York City 100, which is coordinating the weekend's events,
has also hooked up with other performances around the city. Many
are by local groups, but some feature nationally known musicians.
</P>
<P>
   One is a benefit concert that the songwriter Ani DiFranco is
giving for the Battery Park Conservancy. Ms. DiFranco is a
hard-strumming acoustic guitarist whose words rush out like
passionate conversation. Her songs about making her way through the
world with humor and rage and compassion have earned her a fervent
following, particularly among college students. Her fans are likely
to be singing along, verse and chorus, on every song.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Fete de la Musique,'' an annual summer solstice celebration
partly sponsored by the Alliance Francaise, does not confine itself
to French music, although it does include Autour de Lucie, a
thoughtful alternative-rock band that appeared last year at some
Lilith Festival shows. It also includes opening and closing
invocations by Silver Cloud, an American Indian group, and a solo
singer from Belgium, Bernard Massuir, who has been compared to
Bobby McFerrin.
</P>
<P>
   Its centerpiece, however, is a performance by Philip Glass,
presenting music he collaborated on with the Gambian griot Foday
Musa Suso for the production of a play by Jean Genet, ``The
Screens.'' There's some piquancy in French sponsorship for the
music; the play itself is about French colonialism in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the exploitation and brutalization of one culture
by another,'' Glass said in a telephone interview. ``I was at the
premiere in 1964 in Paris, and there was a riot. The French
considered it so insulting, they tried to shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   To create a combination of African and Western music for ``The
Screens,'' Glass decided to work with Suso, who plays the kora
(harp-guitar), and other African instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always very self-conscious about being a
conservatory-trained musician who's used to looking at notes on a
page,'' Glass said. ``I've spent the rest of my life trying to make
up for what I didn't learn at school. For this, we went to the
studio, and I didn't allow myself to write anything down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the concert, at the World Trade Center Plaza, Glass will be
performing with Suso, as well as the saxophonist Jon Gibson and a
percussionist, Zohar Fresco, playing some of the music for the
first time outside the recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman Memorial Band is devoting its Sunday concert at
Damrosch Park to New York music from Sousa to Copland to Bernstein
to Rodgers and Hammerstein. And in the Bronx on Saturday, a
lesser-known New York community will be making itself heard with
``Punta Rock Explosion '98,'' a festival of Garifuna music. The
Garifuna, descended from West African and Carib Indians who were
exiled from St. Vincent to the coast of Central America, now live
in Honduras, Belize, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Some 75,000 live in
New York, where the bounce of traditional punta music now meshes
with electric guitars.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one more example of New York's cultural plentitude,
which is worth celebrating for another 100 years.

`MAN OR MANGO': RAGING AT LIFE IN AN EMOTIONAL BUNKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(PLEASE NOTE: In the text of the book, the name Eloise has an
umlaut over the `o'. The umlaut has been omitted because the symbol
is non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eloise, the cranky heroine of Lucy Ellmann's darkly comic novel,
doesn't care much for other human beings. She has moved to the
English countryside and begun a new life as a hermit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had tired of death and disappointment, her own guilt and
sorrow, and the distress of others,'' writes Ms. Ellmann. ``She had
tired of the speed with which things happen. She had tired of
boring human busy-ness, human requirements, human bodies. She had
tired of streets, buildings, farm produce, `romantic bathrooms.'
She had tired of the News! She had tired of her species. So she set
off to construct for herself the illusion of a less populated
world, in which no one knew or cared who or what she was and she in
turn was free to care about no one.''
</P>
<P>
   Eloise the curmudgeon has a lot in common with Suzy, the
sourpuss heroine of Ms. Ellmann's first novel, ``Sweet Desserts''
(1989), which won the prestigious Guardian Fiction Prize in
Britain. Like Suzy, she's had to cope with the death of her parents
and a series of romantic disappointments; and like Suzy, she's let
these experiences thoroughly embitter her about life.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Ellmann's narrative technique, it, too, is remarkably
similar to that employed in ``Sweet Desserts'': a collage-like
method that juxtaposes chapters of Eloise's story with lots of
little newspaper and book snippets dealing with everything from the
great potato famine in Ireland to the Nazis' persecution of the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellmann's use of this technique not only feels a little
tired the second time around, but in this case it has also become a
formulaic _ and loaded _ means of putting her heroine's
self-pitying life into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what individual's petty romantic and familial
concerns don't pale in comparison with the great tragedies of
history? As Humphrey Bogart put it in ``Casablanca'' (also alluded
to in this novel), ``It doesn't take much to see that the problems
of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this
crazy world.''
</P>
<P>
   What keeps ``Man or Mango'' from devolving into a predictable
portrait of an unhappy woman are Ms. Ellmann's raucous, bawdy sense
of humor and her highly tuned radar for the absurdities of modern
life. She has embued both Eloise and her estranged boyfriend,
George, with these same qualities, and they emerge as two of the
most dyspeptic and savagely funny characters to talk their way
through a recent novel.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two, virtually nothing in contemporary English or
American life escapes unscathed. George, a sometime screenwriter
who is writing an epic poem about ice hockey, rails against the
jingoistic pride of the British: ``Can't help thinking that most of
Benjamin Britten's (enormous) reputation here's due to his name
being BRITTEN.''
</P>
<P>
   He denounces the stupidity of American settlers: ``Who else
could come up with names like `Dekalb,' `Denver,' `Irondale,'
`Garson,' `Belcher'?'' And he mocks the plight of single women who
like to play the cello: ``How do all those little girls have the
prescience to realize they're going to end up alone and forgotten
and in need of a huge human-shaped object to wedge between their
legs?''
</P>
<P>
   Of movie producers' fondness for characters who grow and mature,
George grumpily complains: ``Each character's got to make a
JOURNEY, they say. Something like a pasta machine: start off as one
sort of guy, go through stuff (:LIFE), and come out different by
the end (twirled, ridged, tubular or green). How childish can you
get, this idea that everybody's CHANGING and IMPROVING all the
time!''
</P>
<P>
   Eloise is even angrier about ... well, about just everyone and
everything she encounters. She rages against her neighbors, the
clockmaker, the carpenter, the car-repair people. She reviles
gardening, the telephone, books, traveling and doctors. And she
writes angry letters to the Queen, Margaret Thatcher, the BBC, the
police and the Whiskas cat food company.
</P>
<P>
   She reserves her greatest anger, however, for men, whom she
blames for war, bad architecture, napalm, ``nuclear bombs,
fluorescent lights, burning witches at the stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, of course, Eloise is so angry, and so sad, is that
she is still pining away for George, who six years ago dumped her
and returned to his wife. The loss of George has heightened the
sense of abandonment Eloise has felt since her parents died, and
she has willfully translated her loneliness and hurt into a prickly
defensiveness. For six years now, she has lived like a hostile,
faithless nun; for six years, she has nurtured her mistrust of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In slowly revealing the events behind Eloise's existence as a
hermit, and orchestrating the events that will put Eloise and
George on a collision course toward an uneasy reunion, Ms. Ellmann
demonstrates her ability to write uproarious, pitch-black comedy
and to probe more heartfelt, painful emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's shock ending, like its annoying interpolations, not
only undercuts the poignancy and humor of Eloise's story but also
coats the entire book with a pretentious gloss. In the end, it's a
defensive strategy, not unlike Eloise's posture toward the world,
that distracts attention from Ms. Ellmann's rich and very real
talents.

   U.S. Open Notebook  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF and JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the journalists polled by the U.S. Golf
Association picked Colin Montgomerie to win, the players themselves
have offered many, many other choices.
</P>
<P>
   A few free samples you won't get from the scalpers outside the
admission gates at the Olympic Club:
</P>
<P>
   David Duval likes Justin Leonard, Davis Love III, Ernie Els, Jim
Furyk and Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman picks Phil Mickelson, Duval and ``as crazy as it may
seem,'' Jack Nicklaus, who is 58. ``Even at his age, if he can just
put the ball in the fairway, I know he is going to make a lot of
pars, and if he makes a lot of pars, you know, even-par might
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson puts his money on Montgomerie and Lee Westwood. ``I
think Colin Montgomerie is a real threat to win here,'' he said.
``He works the ball left to right, and it is the perfect golf
course for Colin. I think left to right is the shot this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Simpson, an underdog winner in 1987, likes Love, Duval,
Leonard, Furyk and Els, but also says, ``I do not think there's any
reason why David Ogrin couldn't win the tournament. ... Start
looking down the list and how are you going to say Tom Watson can't
win or, who knows, even Nicklaus.''
</P>
<P>
   The forecast on the winning score has been anywhere from 7-under
to even-par _ depending on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First Watson said it was the worst, most difficult rough he has
ever seen in the U.S. Open, and that's 27 Opens. Then Tiger Woods
observed that when he was playing the 13th hole Tuesday, the
grounds crew was watering the rough and not the ever-quickening
greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that kind of interesting,'' Woods said. ``They were
watering the front part, probably two yards (on the) front part of
the green, so that anything that hits there is going to stop.
Anything that hits after, it will bounce and fly over.''
</P>
<P>
   Explained course superintendent John Fleming: ``We are counting
on the good weather. That is what little irrigation we are doing
... going around in the mornings trying to get irrigation on the
rough grass, so that it does what rough grass is supposed to do and
not just limp over.''
</P>
<P>
   USGA agronomist Tim Moraghan says players needn't worry yet that
the rough has gone over the top and become too penal at these Open
venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't find your golf ball and we start to slow down
play and it really begins to make fun of the best players in the
universe, that is when I don't think it is quite proper,'' he said.
``I want it to be a challenge out there, but I don't want it to
embarrass someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can play basketball with a 30-foot rim or football and
narrow the goal posts more, but it is not fair and you can't allow
the athletes to display their marvelous talents. That is where we
have to draw the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Moraghan reputedly has a single-digit handicap.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   USGA Executive Director David Fay was asked if the Olympic Club
rough was higher than ever, or if that was only an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the primary rough is between 5 and 6 inches,'' he said,
``but growing grass is not so scientific that you can say it is 5.1
inches or whatever. I suspect that the competitors in the '55 Open
(at Olympic) might look at this rough and say, `How come it is so
low?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Roos, who ran the tournament that year, said that the
deepest portion of the rough in '55 was ``forget it'' territory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's chances of winning this Open aren't the only thing
people are talking about. His fetish for tidiness also has
attracted some attention, as tourmate Brad Faxon noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's a fetish,'' Leonard said. ``I think people
have fetishes about cheese and chocolate. It's just that I am a
pretty organized person. I don't have labels on everything. I don't
even have one of those labelmaker deals, but you know, I just like
knowing where my stuff is.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watson figured the USGA committee wouldn't do anything to
regulate equipment advancement and turned out to be prophetic. He
does, however, have a concern with the way the game is going, as
well as thoughts on how to change the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe like Jack Nicklaus, that the ball has become too
easy to play,'' Watson said. ``Given the issue of the ball versus
the equipment, the ball should be addressed. They should come up
with a ball that's harder to play in windy conditions. The
aerodynamics of today's ball just aren't enough to keep the game
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While twentysomethings like Leonard and Woods captivate the golf
scene, there's still plenty to be said for the older players. Fred
Couples and Watson were both playing well entering this year's
Open, and of course, Mark O'Meara, at 41, is the current Masters
champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a good mix once again,'' O'Meara said.
``I've said this before, but the golf ball is just sitting out
there on the ground. It doesn't know how old you are. It doesn't
know if you're 20, 30, 50, 60 or 70. It just sits there waiting to
be struck. That's what makes this game so special.''

`MARIE BAIE DES ANGES': BEACH BLANKET BRUTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   French legend has it that the two spurs of rock jutting
ominously from the sea in the ``bay of angels,'' near Nice, are
shaped like the fins of ``angel sharks'' that once upon a time
devoured the bodies of invaders shipwrecked while navigating the
area's treacherous waters. In Manuel Pradal's stunningly beautiful
film, ``Marie Baie des Anges,'' those rocks and the pearly waters
surrounding them become a riveting metaphor for the savagery of
teen-age sexual rites.
</P>
<P>
   In this dizzying paganistic ode to Eros, where the camera almost
never stops moving, the angel sharks have been replaced by the
bodies of restless, hot-blooded adolescents diving and treading
water and nipping on each other in the shadowy depths. The
comparison is made explicit in a scene in which a pubescent swimmer
with an angelic halo of blond hair is shot and the water slowly
turns deep red.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the film _ whose cast largely consists of
nonactors gleaned from French stadiums, beaches, Gypsy camps and
housing projects _ is a brooding, sensual 15-year-old girl named
Marie (Vahina Giocante) who runs wild one summer. Marie snubs the
impoverished local boys in favor of a group of arrogant American
sailors who take her to nightclubs and hotels. Then having had
their way with her, they discard her with brutal contempt, calling
her a Gypsy whore. Marie ends up sharing a brief idyll with Orso
(Frederic Malgras), a rootless, pug-faced petty criminal who robs
houses and hangs around with the local youth gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Baie des Anges'' is filled with ominous images of men in
packs. Whether on the prowl for girls or for a fight, the energy of
their giddy, reckless camaraderie is charged with physical danger.
In one scene, Marie does a wild Gypsy dance for the sailors who
encircle her with a whooping euphoria that you feel could at any
second turn ugly. In another scene, a group of sailors in a car are
chased by the local boys on motorbikes after exchanging insults.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes give you the feeling that gang rape and gang war
are almost the same thing and that given the right circumstances
they are inevitable eruptions of male aggression.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie that celebrates the raw sexual energy of
adolescence, ``Marie Baie des Anges'' is surprisingly unexplicit.
The sexual encounters, instead of being set up the way they are in
most films, are brief gawky episodes in a continual game of
roughhouse. If they're intense, they're also no big deal. They're
simply part of the natural ebb and flow of the characters' animal
exuberance. These youths have no apparent physical
self-consciousness. You sense that none have ever seen a
Stairmaster or lifted a barbell.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, the images of water, rocks and half-naked bodies
merge into a vision of the film's characters as untamed forces of
nature who are the fauna of the environment in which they cavort.
Viewed this way, you begin to stop thinking of them as civilized
humans bound to any social or moral order, even when they commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   This dizzy lyricism comes at a price. The movie has no sense of
time, and its story line isn't always clear. The life it evokes is
one big swirl of ceaseless physical activity and raw sensation. It
is about as far away as you can get from the icky, coy Hollywood
``primitivism'' of ``The Blue Lagoon.''
</P>

REPORT CLOUDS CONVICTED AU PAIR'S PRIOR INJURY DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Correcting title of NEJM editor in penultimate graf; a and i
coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A report published by an independent team of scientists casts
doubt on a central premise of Louise Woodward's criminal defense:
that an infant like Matthew Eappen could suffer a skull fracture
that eventually would kill him, then behave for weeks as if nothing
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of a prolonged interval of lucidity
between the injury and the onset of symptoms'' in children with
such severe head injuries, said the report in the current New
England Journal of Medicine. ``Thus, an alert, well-appearing child
has not already sustained a devastating acute injury that will
become clinically obvious hours to days later.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, by four physicians at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine, was commissioned by the journal to
respond to the scientific controversy over ``shaken-baby syndrome''
generated by the Woodward case, although the authors did not
specifically address that case. The report, and interviews with its
authors, generally bolster arguments raised by the Woodward
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This article has to answer even the most discerning of
skeptics that the prosecution case of how Matthew died, by
shaking-impact syndrome, is correct,'' said Martha Coakley, one of
the Woodward prosecutors who is now a candidate for district
attorney of Middlesex County in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ayub Ommaya, a Washington neurosurgeon who testified for
the defense, said there are ``holes'' in the journal report that
undermine its conclusions and make clear that ``it is certainly not
the final word.'' While he agreed that ``it is not common'' for an
infant to remain lucid after a severe head injury, Ommaya added
that ``such lucidity has been noted.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the journal article responds to general issues
surrounding ``shaken-baby syndrome,'' which became the center of
focus and confusion during last year's Woodward trial. The authors
say the syndrome is real and responsible for most severe brain
injuries by infants, but they also say a more accurate term is
``shaking-impact syndrome,'' since most damage is done when the
head forcefully strikes a surface.
</P>
<P>
   Can shaking alone cause the severe injuries often lumped as part
of the syndrome? Probably not, the UPenn doctors say, although that
``is still debated'' and severe shaking oftentimes leads to a baby
striking its head against a hard object.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's defense team didn't contest that 8-month-old Matthew
had suffered a severe head injury, but it argued that the injury
that killed him stemmed from a wound as old as three weeks rather
than from anything Woodward did to him before he was hospitalized
and days later died. That issue of whether a baby like Matthew
could die from an earlier severe injury, exacerbated by a
relatively minor later wound, was a key point of contention at the
trial, and was dealt with directly in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such rare events have been reported in older children and
adults,'' the UPenn authors said. But, they added, ``there is no
evidence that traumatic acute subdural hematoma, particularly that
leading to death, occurs in otherwise healthy infants in an occult
or subclinical manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence rather suggests that, after a truly severe injury,
there is an ``immediate or rapid onset of neurological symptoms,''
the authors wrote. They based that finding in part on a San Diego
study published last year involving 95 children who died from
accidental head injuries. All but one of those children ``had an
immediate decrease in the level of consciousness.'' The one
exception suffered a different injury than Matthew's and died of
surgical complications.
</P>
<P>
   But Ommaya, the former chief of neurosurgery at the National
Institutes of Health, said a far bigger study is needed to test
whether such delays in symptoms occur. ``You can't make a claim
that you can't have a lucid interval,'' he said. ``There are cases
of lucid intervals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal authors were less definitive with other
symptoms Matthew suffered, such as retinal bleeding. While
published reports suggest that such hemorrhages are found in ``65
to 95 percent of patients'' with shaken-baby syndrome, the authors
wrote, they are not by themselves proof of the syndrome and it is
tough to tell how long ago the bleeding began.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fact that Matthew did not have severe injuries to
the neck and upper vertebra, or obvious marks on his scalp, which
Woodward's lawyers say proved he was not a victim of shaken-baby
syndrome?
</P>
<P>
   The journal article says that when the surface the baby strikes
is soft, like a couch pillow, ``the force of the impact is widely
dissipated and may not be associated with visible signs of surface
trauma, even though the brain itself decelerates rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As for neck and vertebra damage, ``it's too ill-defined to say
you have to have a neck injury,'' said Dr. Cindy W. Christian, an
author of the journal article and head of the child abuse program
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ``I don't believe those
things have ever been described as necessary components for this
diagnosis'' of shaken-baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Angell, the New England Journal's executive editor, said
she recruited the authors of the article because they were
independent experts who the journal felt could help shed light on a
subject made even more controversial by the Woodward case.
</P>
<P>
   Such a neutral review was called for in the aftermath of the
trial by Harvey Silverglate, one of Woodward's lawyers. But
Wednesday Silverglate said that what he wanted, and still wants, is
a review not of generic shaken-baby issues like the journal
published, but one where independent scientists examine specific
evidence in the Woodward case, none of which the UPenn researchers
saw.

too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than 20 years, Karen B. Cohen, a New Yorker
and a longtime supporter of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has
been collecting works by Eugene Delacroix.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, 40 of her Delacroix paintings were shown for
the first time in New York when the Met mounted an exhibition
devoted to North American collections of Delacroix, the French
Romantic painter and draftsman. Now Ms. Cohen has promised 21 of
these works to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gift not only marks the 200th anniversary of the artist's
birth, it also doubles the size of our Delacroix holdings,'' said
Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director.
</P>
<P>
   The Met was the first American museum to collect Delacroix
consistently, beginning in 1903 with its purchase of ``The
Abduction of Rebecca'' (1846). Ms. Cohen's gift makes the museum's
Delacroix holdings the largest of any institution outside France.
</P>
<P>
   The works, which date from the 1820s to the 1850s, include early
studies after Raphael; exotic scenes from Morocco; renderings of
wild animals Delacroix observed at zoos in Paris, and narrative
scenes. A watercolor, ``The Sea at Dieppe,'' is one of his few pure
landscapes and is on view until July 20 at the Grand Palais in
Paris in its exhibition, ``Delacroix, the Late Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a well-rounded and deep collection,'' said George
Goldner, the Met's curator of drawings and prints, who added that
from Sept. 15 to Nov. 30, selections from the gift will be on view
at the museum's Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Gallery. &QL;

<P>
   Hoping to increase attendance at its Pierre Bonnard
retrospective, which opens on Sunday and runs through Oct. 13, the
Museum of Modern Art is offering a variety of promotions.
</P>
<P>
   First is the ``Bonnard Bonanza,'' which for $67.75 includes
admission to the museum and the Bonnard show; a three-course lunch
with a French menu at Sette Moma, the museum's restaurant; a
softcover exhibition catalog; an audio tour of the show, and a 10
percent discount at any of the museum stores.
</P>
<P>
   The package is available without the lunch for $41.75. There is
also ``Bonnard and Broadway,'' a $116.50 package that includes
admission to the museum and the Bonnard show, a ticket to a
Saturday matinee of ``Ragtime'' and a three-course lunch at Sette
Moma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine and Bonnard,'' at $25.75, provides admission to the
museum and the Bonnard show, an audio tour of the exhibition and a
French wine tasting at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of 10 or more can sign up for a tour of Lincoln Center's
theaters as part of ``Music and Bonnard,'' which costs $27 and
includes admission to the museum and exhibition, dessert and coffee
at Cafe Vienna at Lincoln Center and a 15 percent discount on a
future performance at the Lincoln Center Festival or the Mostly
Mozart concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Advance tickets are not necessary for the Bonnard show, but
admission is $12.50, $3 more than its general admission; that
includes entrance to the entire museum.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, museums have offered hotel packages and
discounts on airplane and train fares to encourage visitors to see
special exhibitions. Two years ago, the Philadelphia Museum of Art
used this strategy to lure visitors to its blockbuster Cezanne
exhibition. That same season, the Museum of Modern Art offered a
discount package to a Manhattan hotel during its hugely popular
``Picasso and Portraiture'' show. The success of that promotion
inspired the museum's efforts for the Bonnard show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one-stop shopping,'' said Elizabeth Addison, the museum's
deputy director for marketing and communications. ``It's a way of
reaching a broader audience. For instance, someone who's interested
in seeing a Broadway show but who wouldn't have necessarily gone to
see Bonnard could be introduced to the museum by getting our
`Broadway and Bonnard' package.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also set up three kiosks that resemble
touch-screen cash machines at the entrance to the Bonnard show.
Instead of spewing out money, the machines will offer detailed
information about Bonnard's work and life as well as analyses of
his paintings and working methods.
</P>
<P>
   The same information and more will be available on the museum's
new Web site (www.moma.org/exhibitions/bonnard).
</P>
<P>
   The audio guides and Bonnard brochures are different for this
show, museum officials said. Rather than providing the usual
sequential walk-through, John Elderfield, the Modern's chief
curator who was the curator for the show, selected one painting in
each room to highlight. The brochure also addresses only selected
paintings rather than providing a general overview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to slow people down,'' Elderfield said, ``because the
longer you look at these paintings, the more you see.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the J. Paul Getty Museum opened its $1 billion
campus in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, it has lost two of
its most important curators.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Getty announced that David A. Jaffe, its paintings
curator, would leave at the end of the summer to become senior
curator at the National Gallery of Art in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an offer I simply couldn't refuse,'' said Jaffe, who was
at the Getty for four years. ``The National Gallery has a dream
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Turner, the Getty's drawings curator, who is on leave,
has also resigned, effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe's job has been considered enviable because he has had a
giant acquisitions budget. But now that the new building is open
and the walls filled, there is speculation that his successor will
not be able to buy as aggressively. Jaffe said that was not so.

SOME ICONS OF MODERNISM TO BE AUCTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether it's fashion or nostalgia for a more innocent
past, Americans are falling in love with the 1950s. When the
William Doyle Galleries in Manhattan sponsored four lectures on
Modernism and the decorative arts in January, nearly 250 people
attended each presentation, and hundreds were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No lecture series here ever generated this much interest,''
said Eric Silver, an expert in the decorative arts at Doyle. ``They
opened up the gallery to a whole new group of people. We're getting
a new audience here.''
</P>
<P>
   William Doyle is holding its first auction of 20th-century art
and design on Wednesday, at 175 East 87th St. The viewing begins
Saturday at 10 a.m., and the sale includes both fine and decorative
arts. There are, for example, drawings by Elie Nadelman, gouaches
by Ossip Zadkine and Sonia Delaunay, paintings by Tom Wesselman and
Larry Rivers, and sculptures by Lynn Chadwick and George Rickey.
</P>
<P>
   Architects, interior designers and collectors, however, are
focusing on the postwar furniture in the sale. There are modern
classics like the aluminum armchairs that Warren McArthur designed
about 1950 for Mayfair Industries (a set of six is estimated to
sell for $1,200 to $1,500); both a Swan chair ($600 to $900) and an
Egg chair ($300 to 500) by Arne Jacobsen of Denmark, designed for
the Fritz Hansen Co.; an oversized armchair and round matching
ottoman done by the American industrial designer Warren Platner for
Knoll International in 1966 ($900 to $1,000), and a pair of painted
metal and wooden daybeds by George Nelson, with a Jack Lenor Larsen
cover ($800 to $1,200 for the pair).
</P>
<P>
   The design revelations are many. An unknown, Jens Risom of
Sweden, created an amusing doughnut-shaped occasional table with a
horseshoe-shaped, wrought-iron base. (Estimate for three: $400 to
$600.) There is also an anonymous stainless-steel chandelier with
33 candle arms arranged in a spiral ($400 to $600), as well as a
pair of brown leather and gilt-brass floor lamps with gooseneck
arms ($1,200 to $1,800).
</P>
<P>
   Several of the lots were consigned by a Long Island woman who in
the 1950s had commissioned a completely modern interior for her
house. Today, she seems like a design pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts to buy this furniture then, especially
when all your friends were decorating in a traditional style,''
Silver said. ``Most people wouldn't go near it then. They bought
Georgian furniture and French pieces. Now it's all considered
classic design. You can see pieces just like these in museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the lots in the Doyle sale are similar to the design
icons featured in a 1983 exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of
Art called ``Design Since 1945.'' Many are also on view in the
design galleries of the Museum of Modern Art. &QL;

   Saturday, in Monaco, Christie's is selling the contents of a
house in Roquebrune, France, that was owned by the American
photographer Henry Clarke until his death in 1996. Clarke
bequeathed his belongings to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, which
consigned them to Christie's for one of the auction house's
high-profile, twice-yearly sales in Monte Carlo. (The Pasteur
Institute was also the beneficiary of the recent Duke and Duchess
of Windsor sale.)
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was the quintessential American in Paris: a handsome
blue-eyed blond with the wit and charm of his Irish heritage and a
very strong American accent in his French. He moved to Paris in
1949, and by 1950 Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of
Conde Nast, had put him under an exclusive contract to shoot
fashion for French, British and American Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   He photographed celebrities like Sophia Loren and all the top
models of the day: Suzy Parker, Bettina, Douvima, Fiona Campbell
and Veruschka.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Michael Gunther, an American professor of photographic
theory and history at the Institut d'Etudes de Sciences Politiques
in Paris, said Clarke donated his archive of negatives and signed
prints to the Musee de la Mode de la Ville de Paris. Christie's is
selling only Clarke's paintings, furniture and objets d'art.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke was born in 1918 in Los Angeles and as a young man moved
to San Francisco and took a job as a window dresser at I. Magnin.
``Even then he was aware of objects and how to arrange things
beautifully,'' said Gunther, a longtime friend who is executor of
the estate.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, Clarke moved to New York and got a job as a
prop man in Vogue's studios. Someone lent him a camera, and he
began to take black-and-white photographs. He watched Cecil Beaton
at work and took courses at the New School for Social Research with
Alexey Brodovitch, a famous Russian art director who worked at
several fashion and art magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke moved to Paris right after World War II. Gunther said
that Clarke soon became a great photo technician and began to
develop his signature style: showing aloof beauties in couture
gowns in formal surroundings, either in a studio, an apartment or
on a Paris street.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bowman, a photographer who worked for Vogue years later,
said, ``Henry Clarke is all about elegance, and he was `it' until
elegance went out of favor and Liberman declared that `the elegance
of the past is not relevant today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gunther, who has organized several shows of Clarke's work over
the years, has a different take on the Clarke style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Clarke made images with a vigor that gave them
equilibrium and force,'' he said. ``He maintained an ideal distance
from his subjects. His pictures had the architecture of the mise en
scene. He would spend hours, if not days, choosing accessories for
his models. There was a sophistication of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite models, Bettina Graziana, said: ``He was
very careful about decor, because it was the background for
dresses. He bought the flowers. He borrowed the antiques to make a
set. It was like theater. He had a lot of imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monte Carlo sale reflects these same qualities. There are
fine 18th-century French antiques mixed with charming prints he
picked up in India, and seashells from all over the world. He would
put an Old Master next to a Leon Bakst study for a Nijinsky costume
for the ballet ``Peri'' (estimate: $260 to $330). There's a
19th-century micromosaic from Italy and a Georges Jacob armchair
upholstered in green leather from about 1765.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things are truly precious: an 18th-century
serpentine covered vase (estimate: $12,000 to $17,000), an Italian
porphyry-and-marble bust of an Italian emperor ($11,000 to $15,000)
and a rare 17th-century terrestrial globe by Hondius Jodocus I
($51,000 to $67,000).
</P>
<P>
   But the objects themselves are not the story here. As in his
pictures, Clarke had the knack for putting it all together in a
charming way in his 16th-century priory on a hillside overlooking
the Mediterranean. He defined elegance and style for a generation,
and evidently lived the same way at home.

IF YOU LIVE IN ALBANY, TEXAS, CHANCES ARE YOU'RE A VETERAN OF THE
STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Texas _ It takes almost 20 years in this West Texas town
to progress from a prairie dog to a dance-hall girl. It takes about
the same to sprout from a simple tree to a full-fledged cowboy,
whippin' and spurrin' across a grassy, 1-acre stage.
</P>
<P>
   They are all parts in Albany's annual Fort Griffin Fandangle, a
communitywide theatrical event that chronicles the early
development of the area and its people.
</P>
<P>
   It takes place Thursday through Saturday nights on the last two
weekends of June. This is the 60th anniversary of the massive
prairie show, which began in 1938 at the high school football field
and has developed its own 1,600-seat outdoor theater north of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 411 people involved,'' said Betsy Parsons, the show's
director for the past five years. ``We have 44 high school dancers.
I have six babies under a year old; we have 50 kids under 6. There
are 96 kids between first grade and eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a pecking order for parts, Parsons explained.
The young girls who think they have outgrown portraying fuzzy
animals or prairie flowers know they cannot ascend to the saloon
scenes until they've graduated from high school. The boys who want
to ride know they have stiff competition from the local cowboys who
earn their livelihood in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long, dutiful wait for some, but Parsons said there are
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children aren't afraid to perform in front of people,''
she said. ``Our kids gain so much confidence from this experience.
They know how to speak to people. They know how to conduct
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' she added. ``There are not many shy adults in
Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are not many people who haven't been a part of
Fandangle, which is a big part of life here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets kind of tough sometimes,'' said Tunny Hollingsworth, a
71-year-old retired cowboy whose first Fandangle was 1953. ``You
work all day on the ranch, then go to practice at night until
midnight or 1 a.m. Then it's back to the ranch, where you're up at
4 in the morning again.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice for Fandangle begins in February. It is once a week
until May, then every night until its over.
</P>
<P>
   Hollingsworth can't remember how many years he's been in the
show. Not all of them, he said, maybe 25 or 30. Maybe more. ``You'd
have to ask my daughter,'' he said. ``She'd know. She's been in
30.''
</P>
<P>
   In most rural ranching communities, cowboys and oil-patch
roughnecks would be reluctant to perform on stage, some in costumes
and makeup. But in this community 125 miles west of Fort Worth,
Hollingsworth said, it is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen Fandangle one year before I was in it,'' he
recalled. ``I knew it was made up by the townspeople, and all the
cowboys around were in it. There are probably 40 or 50 working
cowboys who do this every year. You get used to it, and if you
don't go one year, you miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Fandangle serves as a melting pot for the community, he
and several others said. Doctors and lawyers work alongside cowboys
and oilfield drillers and welders.
</P>
<P>
   Hollingsworth said he thought about leaving the production this
year and handing the reins of his wagon over to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my daughter that I didn't want to be in it again, and
she said they'd kill me if I didn't show up,'' he said with a
laugh. ``I figured I'm too young to die, so I'm doing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the longhorn cattle used in the production keep coming
back. The 18 head used in the Fandangle come from Fort Griffin
State Park and are part of the ``Official Texas Herd.'' One has
been in the show for 14 years, several others for 10 to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done it so many times they know their cues,'' swears
Bob Echols, who was in the first Fandangle as a baby 60 years ago.
``Near the beginning of the show, there is a song called the
`Cowboy's Prayer.' In the last verse they sing, `When it comes my
time to go ...' and the longhorns know that's their cue to turn and
leave.''

`DREAM FOR AN INSOMNIAC': COFFEE AND KIERKEGAARD IN FRISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not an encouraging sign when a movie whose center of
gravity is a San Francisco coffeehouse called the Cafe Blue Eyes
plays Frank Sinatra Jr. on the soundtrack instead of the real
thing. And that's not the only element that rings false in ``Dream
for an Insomniac,'' the much-too-cute feature film debut of
Tiffanie DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   This portrait of a morose intellectual caffeine addict named
Frankie (Ione Skye), who works in her uncle's bohemian
establishment and hankers for a dream lover who must meet
impossibly high standards of looks and intelligence, is seriously
miscast. Ms. Skye's Frankie happens to be almost a dead ringer for
Monica Lewinsky. As she ruminates about life and love with her best
friend, Allison (Jennifer Aniston), Ms. Skye whines in a Valley
Girl drawl that makes her sound vapid instead of brooding and
stubbornly idealistic.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Right miraculously appears in the form of David Shrader
(Mackenzie Astin), an intense young man who takes a job in the
cafe, the discrepancy between the screenplay's witty banter, in
which the two toss quotes from Kierkegaard at each other, and
Frankie's airheaded delivery is almost painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dream for an Insomniac'' is really a self-conscious modern
sitcom that with its San Francisco setting suggests a pale shadow
of Armistead Maupin's ``Tales From the City.''
</P>
<P>
   One of its contrived subplots involves the dilemma of Rob
(Michael Landes), the gay son of Leo (Seymour Cassel), the gruff
but kindly Italian-American owner of the Cafe Blue Eyes. Rob, who
lives with a boyfriend, enlists Allison to be his collaborator in a
transparently trumped-up romance intended to convince Dad that he
is straight. After Allison leaves town with Frankie to pursue an
acting career in Los Angeles, Rob has second thoughts and decides
to come out to his father.
</P>
<P>
   How will Dad react? And will David, who is engaged to a dippy
lawyer named Molly (Leslie Stevens), realize that Frankie is his
one true love and follow her to Los Angeles? You don't have to wait
for the next episode to find out.

`MULAN': FEMALE WARRIOR TAKES ON HUNS AND STEREOTYPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender
stereotyping in ``Mulan,'' a film that not only breaks the
cross-dressing barrier but also ratchets up the violence level for
children's animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sign me up for the next war!'' exclaims the heroine's
grandmother, in a show of what does not precisely qualify as
progress for women.
</P>
<P>
   And for all its supposed daring in presenting a bold female
warrior, ``Mulan'' takes no steps forward when it comes to Disney's
animation renaissance. This is the most inert and formulaic of
recent Disney animated films, right down to the clowning sidekicks
and would-be ``Under the Sea'' production number. This time there's
a big musical sequence about basic training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who spit in HER bean curd?'' wisecracks one character in this
supposedly Eastern fable, which often seems about as Chinese as
chop suey. When not falling back on ancient shtick, ``Mulan'' rails
against gender prejudice by trotting out every storytelling
stereotype in the Disney playbook. These include the Destiny
ballad, in which a questing young person sings about becoming his
or her true self (``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''
Mulan wonders musically), and the fight against cartoonishly wicked
heavies.
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness as intense as this film's leaves
gray-faced, yellow-eyed Huns as the only group available for
demonization.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan, the rare Disney character to have two parents and a
granny, must count on marriage to settle her fate as the story
begins. A group of twittering female relatives doll her up demurely
for a visit to the matchmaker, singing ``Wait and see, when we're
through, boys will gladly go to war for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the tiniest viewers should see how wrongly and repressively
she is being treated. In case they miss the point, the film shows
girls and boys being made to play with dolls and swords
respectively, and not being allowed to switch roles.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan (with the voice of Ming-Na Wen) makes her own switch when
her father is conscripted for military service and nobly prepares
to leave home despite his infirm health. So his daughter bravely
takes his place. She disguises herself as a man and joins the army,
accompanied by a tiny dragon named Mushu who perches on her
shoulder to give advice. Though Mushu has the very funny voice of
Eddie Murphy to make him lovable, this black-sounding character is
treated as a servile clown. When he hollers ``Call out for egg
roll!'' there's something to offend everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Reverent as it is in the depiction of Mulan as a woman warrior,
the film presents most of its male characters as buffoons. (Or
worse: ``I never want to see a naked man again!'' exclaims Mulan
after having to watch the other soldiers bathe.) The exceptions are
the wise old emperor (voice of Pat Morita), Mulan's estimable
father and a general's son named Shang (with the voice of B.D.
Wong), who has the huge square jaw of any Disney hero.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Mulan's courage and independence in rebelling against
the matchmakers, this is still enough of a fairy tale to need Mr.
Right.
</P>
<P>
   Though the plot and setting present exotic new opportunities for
the filmmakers, the China of ``Mulan'' has surprisingly little
depth of field or background detail. The Great Wall and the
Forbidden City are here, but so are a lot of empty spaces and
scenes in which only one figure moves. As directed by two
first-time feature filmmakers, Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, the
film works harder at staging computer-enhanced battle scenes with
swooping camera movement and loads of extras, more little figures
than its technical prowess can accommodate. (Try looking at the
back rows in any crowd scene.)
</P>
<P>
   When animation strains to mimic overpopulated live-action films,
it loses sight of its own magical ability to envision wondrous,
fanciful things we could not otherwise see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' has several songs by Matthew Wilder, who comes to
Disney after having produced the No Doubt album called ``Tragic
Kingdom.'' But the musical sequences have little of the jauntiness
that was previously supplied by songwriters like Alan Menken and
Elton John. And they are not especially musical; the fluid
choreography of vastly better-made films like last year's
``Hercules'' is strikingly absent this time, so images just seem
busily piled on while music blares.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hit to accompany the closing credits mostly because
Stevie Wonder (with the band 98 Degrees jolts it to life.

D'AMATO ASKS LOTT TO ALLOW SENATE VOTE ON HORMEL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharply worded letter to Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato said Thursday that he is
``embarrassed'' that Republican senators have held up the
nomination of gay rights advocate James C. Hormel to be ambassador
to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that Mr. Hormel's nomination is being obstructed for
one reason, and one reason only: the fact that he is gay,'' D'Amato
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more, on a personal level, I am embarrassed that our
Republican Party, the Party of Lincoln, is seen to be the force
behind this injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination has been blocked from a floor vote by Sens. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., Robert C. Smith,
R-N.H., and one anonymous senator. The four senators have used the
ancient Senate tactic of placing ``holds'' on the nomination,
effectively keeping it off the floor. Only the four senators or
Lott can remove the holds.
</P>
<P>
   The four conservative Republicans argue that Hormel, 64, a San
Francisco philanthropist, Democratic Party donor and homosexual
rights activist, would try to promote a ``gay agenda'' in
Luxembourg, a predominantly Catholic nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has declined to overrule their objections and allow a floor
vote, saying it would take too much time. Neither he nor his press
secretary, Susan Irby, had any immediate reaction to D'Amato's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Lott set off a debate on homosexuality earlier this week when,
in a cable TV interview on ``The Armstrong Williams Show,'' he said
homosexuality was a sin and likened it to alcoholism, sex addiction
or kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey joined in
and said the Bible ``is very clear'' in holding that homosexuality
is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Lott, D'Amato said Hormel's ``academic,
business and community service credentials are outstanding and are
easily equal to or greater than those of most ambassadorial
nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a Republican from New York, said Hormel ``clearly
understands that his own personal philosophies... are not to
influence his ambassadorial duties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, when people ably serve our country in so
many capacities without regard to sexual orientation, for the
United States Senate to deny an appointment on that basis is simply
wrong,'' D'Amato declared.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay and lesbian organization, which Hormel
founded, said D'Amato's letter shows ``that momentum is building''
in favor of Hormel.

<P>
   ``It's a strong indication that there is strong movement within
the Republican caucus to move this nomination to the floor,'' Smith
said. ``It underscores the bipartisan support and means the battle
is shifting to the Republican caucus. We're cautiously
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne, Feinstein, D-Calif., says she has rounded up at
least 60 senators who support a Senate vote on Hormel's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., made it clear Thursday that he's not
one of them. He voted against Hormel's nomination in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and said he would vote against him
again if the nomination reaches the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   A person's sexual conduct ``is within what could be considered
and what is eligible for consideration'' for ambassadorial
nominees, Ashcroft told reporters. The Senate has a responsibility
to weigh such issues in determining whether a U.S. ambassadorial
nominee is ``the kind of representative (the American people) want
to have for the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has been a leader in promoting a lifestyle which,
at the level of his promotion of that lifestyle and the kind of
leadership he's exhibited there, is likely to be offensive to both
Americans and individuals in the setting to which he will be
assigned.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, Ashcroft said he agrees that
homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, my tradition, the Bible defines what's a sin. The
Bible defines homosexuality and homosexual behavior as a sin. And
it basically says sex is a gift of God that ought to be preserved
for people who are married.''

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   The Future of Theater
</P>
<P>
   The news this week that after 33 years, Isabelle Stevenson would
hand over day-to-day operations of the American Theater Wing to a
new president, Roy Somlyo, marking a transition for the industry
group, provided another opportunity to ponder the ageless question:
What is Broadway becoming?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of other developments this week provide further grist.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Lane, the veteran producer and owner of the Palace
Theater, sent out letters this week to other Broadway producers
asking them to join the Producers' Network, a new organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to convene some casual brainstorming sessions to
go over the ever-changing face of the theater,'' he said.
``Independent producers, in particular, really need a venue to keep
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he will convene champagne brunches in his Manhattan
home every two months, beginning in October, to discuss issues of
importance with other independent and corporate producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no dues,'' he said. ``It's just come on over,
the bar is open. I just feel that the theater is at a real
watershed and the role of the producers, especially the independent
producers, needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, David Merrick announced a reorganization of his
philanthropic foundation, which from now on will focus on
developing American musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the future success of developing American
musicals on a broad scale, not only in New York but around the
country, is in the subsidized, not-for-profit arena, unencumbered
by commercial concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ships Passing in the Night
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing more frustrating for a producer than having
your star not win a Tony Award, it's having your star win a Tony
and then leave the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roundabout Theater Company has come up with a solution
for the departure of Natasha Richardson on Aug. 4 from its revival
of ``Cabaret,'' which won the Tony as best musical revival and also
awards for Ms. Richardson and her co-stars Alan Cumming and Ron
Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Aug. 4, Jennifer Jason Leigh will take over the
role of Sally Bowles, the desperately seedy nightclub singer who
provides a window into life in Weimar Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Louise Wilson, who plays a well-meaning landlady in the
musical, is also leaving in late July, and auditions will be held
next week to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   Summer of Betrayal
</P>
<P>
   Uta Hagen will be interrupting her summer in Montauk, N.Y., to
comeback into the city next month and star in a new production of
``Collected Stories'' by Donald Margulies, at the Lucille Lortel
Theater. The play had been performed last year at the Manhattan
Theater Club, with Maria Tucci in the role of a teacher and writer
who is befriended and betrayed by a protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old lady and it's hard to find interesting, challenging
material for an older person,'' said Ms. Hagen, who made her
professional debut in 1937, playing Ophelia. ``When I read it, I
flipped over it. It's a very provocative play in terms of ideas.
It's a play about betrayal, which we've all experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside a Kamikaze
</P>
<P>
   Masayuki Imai has performed his play ``The Winds of God'' four
times in America and is now mounting its first commercial run at
the Judith Anderson Theater, with performances beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The play is about two Japanese men, flung back in time, who
slowly come to realize that they are kamikaze pilots in the closing
days of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I liked the kamikaze because they were so
strong; like supermen or samurai, they do not fear dying,'' the
actor and playwright said. ``But when I read more books and did
interviews, I noticed that they were not really supermen, just
human beings, and that they were afraid of dying, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a Break
</P>
<P>
   Brian Murray is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other word for it. He is playing Sir Toby in
Nicholas Hytner's production of ``Twelfth Night'' at Lincoln
Center, the 10th show in which Murray has appeared in New York
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it incredible and wonderful that it's happening,''
Murray said. ``It's like being in a rep company, going from one
play to the other, which is how I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest gap he had between plays in this period was about
six weeks, he said, but often he went from one directly to the
next. That's what he did this time, finishing work on ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' for the Irish Repertory Theater one night and
beginning rehearsals the next day on ``Twelfth Night.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these days, he said, he's going to have to get organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some time to get my life in order, to clean up my glove
drawer, if you know what I mean,'' Murray said. ``When going from
one play to another, the pressure is fairly steady. You don't get a
chance to organize your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Treat Williams will play Manuel, the Portuguese fisherman at
the center of ``Captains Courageous,'' a new musical based on the
Rudyard Kipling story, at the Manhattan Theater Club in the late
fall or early winter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Primary Stages has announced its new season, which will
include Leslie Uggams in ``The Old Settler,'' a play by John Henry
Redwood, and ``This Lime Tree Bower,'' a play by Conor McPherson,
the young Irish playwright whose ``St. Nicholas'' was a hit at
Primary Stages last season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Capitol Steps, the Washington-based satiric troupe, will bring
their new show, ``Unzippin' My Doo Dah and Other National
Priorities,'' to the John Houseman Theater beginning on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cathy Rigby is returning to Broadway with a revamped
production of ``Peter Pan,'' for a limited engagement beginning
Nov. 20. She has played the role in holiday productions twice
before. ``But this time, we redid the whole production from the
ground up,'' she said.

WHAT TO WEAR TO TEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You may think you'll be as natty as all get-out
if you show up at the Olympic Club in your old yellow turtleneck
and those burgundy-and-butterscotch plaid pants.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Think layers, says Orel Hershiser. Think earth tones. Think
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   You can find Hershiser, the veteran San Francisco Giants
pitcher, on Page 45 of the 1998 AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach program, flicking
his way out of a sand trap dressed in a signature dark knit shirt,
the collar tipped with brown, his left hand wrapped in a white
glove, a black Titleist cap on his head. Hershiser has not only
played Pebble Beach, rubbing cap brims with the best of them, but
has flailed at the game across four decades, watching golf fashion
go through half a hundred changes.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who first started playing golf when he was five years
old, claims the joke garb of years past _ the pastel-plaid look,
those closets full of golf clothes in the colors of candied
sprinkles _ is gone, making way for a more common-sense approach to
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Layers,'' says Hershiser. ``You definitely need layers at the
Open, because of the way the weather could change. And an umbrella
... in case of rain, and to lean on walking up those hills at the
Olympic (Club).
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors ought to go with the scenery _ the ocean, the
trees, the greens,'' he says. ``Some muted greens and blues.
Nothing exotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gallery is as much a part of the course as the scenery, as
much as the manicured greens and the trees,'' Hershiser says. ``The
gallery has an obligation, I think, to present itself well, to
dress well. That's kind of old-fashioned, I guess, but that's the
way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser acknowledged he would ``dress differently for the AT&AMP;T
than if I had an invitation to golf with someone at a private club.
When you're in a celebrity golf tournament, people want to see you
in nice clothes _ color-coordinated, classy clothes. But a private
club _ people use it as an oasis, to get away from things _ so I'd
dress more casually. A comfortable pair of slacks, a nice brown
sweater.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser likened the difference to wearing a uniform at a
private school and wearing the more casual uniform of a public
school. Golf does have a uniform, he says _ ``Whenever you have
people with the same beliefs, the same interests ... whether you're
talking about nightlife people wearing a lot of black or ladies at
a luncheon with a certain length of skirt, there's going to be a
uniform of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   For golf, in the '70s and early '80s, that uniform consisted of
liberal splashes of lime green and lemon yellow, sky blue and
mandarin orange, framed by white belts and white golf shoes.
Hershiser shudders at the memory. ``Unreal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of pastels, but not those neon colors, thank
goodness.'' He laughed, adding, ``If I'd known back then what I
know now, I would've stayed away from the pastels, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hershiser, the best change in golf fashion has come ``in the
quality of the clothes. Early on it was tacky slacks, paired with a
Polo or Izod. Now people are wearing clothes that are both classy
and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain slicks they've got now? There's extra material in the
shoulder to give you room to swing, and the material itself ...
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-notch clothes, once available only to those who could speak
golfese, are now available to everyone, Hershiser says. Which is
not to say everyone takes advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a lot of Cosby sweaters out there, knit in
colors that belong on the inside of a cow's stomach. There are
still shirts cut from circus tents, still a lot of retro-bumble
looks on the green. Just last year Jack Lemmon strolled Pebble
Beach in brown plaid pants and a thin white turtleneck, leading a
black poodle on a leash. And some of the dignity golfers have
gained from ditching the dextral shirts and plus-fours of past
years has been lost in the mawkish flood of corporate-logo,
one-size-fits-all ballcaps.
</P>
<P>
   Turn to the Pro-Am program again and there's Jesper Parvenik,
the bill of his big, white SAP cap turned up, looking for all the
world like a self-obsessed kulak. There's the double-swoosh team of
Tiger Woods and Fluff Cowan. There's the odd bodkins of the beret
craze, which may have run its course, and the smarminess of
galleries dressed to wash the dog.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the history of clothes on the links. More than any
other sport, golf has to live down its past years of truly
laughable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All fashion went ugly-up in the '70s _ Nehru jackets and
hip-slop bell bottoms, leisure suits and platform shoes, wide,
white belts and polyester collars stitched with brown yarn, all
vying for the championship of the ``Love Ya, Baby'' look. And no
sport embraced the pure grotesque of it the way golf did.
</P>
<P>
   Men making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year routinely
walked out on the course wearing something pulled from the Kabuki
rack at Kmart, maundering around in colors cut from an over-ripe
grapefruit, preening in front of each other like tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
   Without golf, the turtleneck sweater would've died the death it
deserved long ago. Golf, by itself, has kept white belts and white
shoes alive. And the only place you can still see yellow pants off
the golf course is along the strip in Vegas, worn by men who have
long since lost touch with the word ``Goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   In no other sport has plaid become a way of life _ a statement
of cherry-red and charcoal fashion made between the waist and
ankles, a scream for help unheeded by everyone around. In no other
sport have the colors of Popsicle been embraced as they have in
golf. And no other sport has made the wearing of funny hats such a
serious business.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a bit much, says Hershiser. He'd just as soon stick
with ``some good black slacks, black golf shoes, a shirt in neutral
colors,'' he says. ``Nothing too crazy.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `COUSIN BETTE,' starring Jessica Lange, Elisabeth Shue and Bob
Hoskins. Directed by Des McAnuff (R, 108 minutes). Balzac's great
novel of 1840s Paris, like Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire of the Vanities,''
of which it is an obvious forerunner, is far too big and sprawling
to be compressed into a film of average length. McAnuff, a gifted
theater director making his feature-film debut, has staged the
novel's greedy social climbing and revenge as a cartoonish
``Masterpiece Theater'' spoof in which an avaricious courtesan (Ms.
Shue) and an ambitious young sculptor (Aden Young), who wreak
sexual havoc, are charmless buffoons. Ms. Lange is grimly opaque as
a vengeful, scheming cousin who manipulates these narcissists into
destroying the aristocratic relatives who have humiliated her
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP IMPACT,' starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood,
Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell and Morgan Freeman. Directed by
Mimi Leder (PG-13, 120 minutes). Apparently there is no better aid
to family therapy than a murderously large meteor hurtling toward
Earth. So this is a more sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most,
with lovers bonding and old wounds healing as the summer's first
colossal cinematic catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously
made, but it provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As
the planet faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art,
antiques, elephants and flamingos. Special-effects wizardry
provides a suitably devastating tidal wave (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS,' starring Johnny Depp and
Benicio Del Toro. Directed by Terry Gilliam (R, 120 minutes).
Gilliam, the visually ingenious cinematic maestro behind ``Brazil''
and ``12 Monkeys,'' has filmed Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 classic of
gonzo journalism with an astonishing fidelity to the book's
psychedelic phantasmagoria. But if this is as close to recreating
the sensory world of an acid trip that a mainstream film has ever
come, the movie packs the book's vignettes into an overstuffed
hodgepodge. Where the book conveyed a spirit of open-ended
adventure in which each new caper could be spun out into its own
little movie, the film rarely gives the book's appallingly funny
anecdotes room to breathe. Depp, who has been made partially bald
for the role of Raoul Duke, turns in a clever performance. And Del
Toro's portrayal of Raoul's gun-waving sidekick and ``attorney,''
Dr. Gonzo, is a tour de force of unfettered goonishness (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GODZILLA,' starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria
and Maria Pitillo. Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139
minutes). The ads for ``Godzilla'' proclaim that ``size does
matter.'' But it turns out that bigger doesn't necessarily mean
better. The animatronic lizard that rises from the ocean and stomps
on a number of New York City landmarks has thundering metallic
footsteps but still has the impact of a weightless cartoon monster.
The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through, when the beast's
eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square Garden) and an army of
more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to devour the search party.
The storytelling and acting in this $120 million wad of gummed-up
popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness and ineptitude for a
so-called Event Movie (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH ART,' starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed by
Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a fierce, tricky
performance in the role of a once-celebrated photographer, spooked
by fame, who long ago retreated from the art world to live a
reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This steamily intense
story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms. Mitchell's
bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a desperately stylish
photography magazine. Ms. Cholodenko's seductive, powerfully
atmospheric first feature explores their relationship with
intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any hope of raw edges
and real emotion to its own chic sensibility, which proves so
studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story. Patricia Clarkson
does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover, a glamorously
decadent German actress who never got past the Fassbinder years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOPE FLOATS,' starring Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr. and
Gena Rowlands. Directed by Forest Whitaker (PG-13, 112 minutes).
This pajama-party women's picture starts out on a talk show and
stays there, raising issues like divorce, single parenthood,
mother-daughter relationships, caring for aging relatives and
summoning the courage to date after trauma. But Ms. Bullock, who is
actually seen cheerleading here, gives her best approximation of
America's sweetheart since ``While You Were Sleeping,'' and her
winning performance helps make up for the film's cute streak and
rosy, commercial glow. Ms. Rowlands does a feisty, down-to-earth
turn as the star's Texas mama, even if the story gives her
taxidermy for an offbeat hobby. As the post-divorce dreamboat,
Connick is on the tepid side. ``The Horse Whisperer'' does this
kind of serene, resuscitating romance much better (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HORSE WHISPERER,' starring Robert Redford, Kristin Scott
Thomas and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Robert Redford (PG-13,
164 minutes). There's a blunt soap opera of a movie inside Nicholas
Evans' widely popular novel. But Redford, directing himself for the
first time with intelligence and restraint, has found a visually
eloquent way to turn it into something much more thoughtful and
tranquil. Magnificently photographed by Robert Richardson, this
film is a wide-screen love affair with the West, and a story more
of peace and healing than of ardor. Though it's long and its
resolution is a problem, this is an enveloping film that richly
rewards the viewer's attention (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE LAND GIRLS,' starring Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz,
Anna Friel and Steven Mackintosh. Directed by David Leland (R, 112
minutes). A sentimental valentine to the Women's Land Army, the
legion of young women dispatched across England during World War II
to assume jobs vacated by fighting men, this film presses familiar
nostalgic buttons but not so aggressively that it makes you feel
queasy. Good girl Stella (Ms. McCormack); bad girl Prue (Ms.
Friel), and nerdy academic Ag (Ms. Weisz), women from varying
backgrounds, share cramped quarters on the same Dorset farm where
they plow fields, milk cows and have their romantic turns with the
owner's frisky son, Joe (Mackintosh). Rich with period detail and
atmosphere, the movie leaves the inner lives of its characters
largely unexplored to paint a heroic canvas of romantic turmoil and
noble self-sacrifice (Holden).

 &HT;    COLUMN: A veritable font of first, last lines
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 21: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Jayson's wife thinks he's bugging me.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jayson: Lay off. Ron's a good man. Anybody who'll do half
my work is all right by me.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Jayson is among the readers who responded to a recent column
about memorable first lines and last lines in literature. Some
called, others wrote; most sent e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   None sent more than Jayson. From Dr. Seuss (``One fish two fish
red fish blue fish'') to the Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato (``It
should be sufficient to say that I am Juan Pablo Castel, the
painter who killed Marla Iribarne''), Jayson is not just widely
read. He's generous with what he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle, too. Others would have gone in for the kill when I
confessed that I couldn't immediately identify the author of ``One
fish two fish red fish blue fish ...''), even if it did sound as
familiar as star-belly sneetches.
</P>
<P>
   Not Jayson. He just reminded me that it was Dr. Seuss _ as if
I'd known all along.
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Called up from memory
</P>
<P>
   Jayson also passed on a number of other opening lines that were
on the top of his head but not mine. Two of them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Take care to chop the onions fine.'' From ``Like Water for
Chocolate'' by Laura Esquivel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virginians clattered into Philadelphia with the glitter,
almost, of Magi.'' From Garry Wills' ``Inventing America.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of Jayson's I recognized, and it's the reason we
remember certain strings of words, whether at the beginning or the
end of a book. Read once, they are not forgotten, any more than a
song called up from memory on the sound of the first note:
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother died at the moment I was born and so for my whole
life there was nothing standing between myself and eternity; at my
back was always a bleak, black wind.'' From ``The Autobiography of
My Mother'' by Jamaica Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   The column to which Jayson and others responded arose from a
casual reading of David A. Spector's ``Call Me Ishmael: 801
Memorable First and Last Lines in Literature,'' a nightstand
paperback that begins with Henry Adams and ends with Emile Zola. In
between were 799 lines that had a particular magic. All were of one
sentence, which disqualified the eminently qualified Rahim
Ghassemian, the editor of Pardis, a newspaper published in Farsi
and read by Atlanta's large Iranian community.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassemian, who has translated Shakespeare and Raymond Chandler
into Farsi, first nominated opening passages from Honore de
Balzac's ``Pere Goriot,'' then J.D. Salinger's ``Catcher in the
Rye,'' and then this from Chandler's ``The Long Goodbye'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I laid eyes on Terry Lennox he was drunk in a
Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith outside the terrace of The Dancers. The
parking lot attendant had brought the car out and he was still
holding the door open because Terry Lennox's left foot was still
dangling outside, as if he had forgotten he had one. ...''
</P>
<P>
   It's vintage Chandler: a voice distinctively his own, the words
transparencies for describing a certain high-class sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   After the details of the story have faded, it's the voice and
the words that remain. David Moore offered this last sentence from
Edward Abbey's ``Black Sun'': ``The guy we counted on, well, he
moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Abbey could have written it, but all of us know that guy.
</P>
<P>
   More than `regional' renown
</P>
<P>
   Sara Tucker mentioned a writer with a very different voice.
Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, once one of the most popular of American
novelists, has been undeservedly overlooked if not forgotten. She
is often called ``a Florida writer,'' whatever that might be, but
her real terrain was larger. Her best-known novel, ``The
Yearling,'' ends:
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere beyond the sinkhole, past the magnolia, under the
live oaks, a boy and a yearling ran side by side, and were gone
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Read out of context, it borders perilously on the sentimental.
But on the last page of Rawlings' novel, it has the tone-perfect
finality of a bedroom door closed at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Words open doors as well as close them. I wasn't surprised that
many readers _ but not Ron Jayson _ mentioned the first sentence in
William Kennedy's ``Ironweed'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding up the winding road of Saint Agnes Cemetery in the back
of the rattling old truck, Francis Phelan became aware that the
dead, even more than the living, settled down in neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   A sentence like that _ exact in its imagery, measured in its
cadence _ could not have been written in a better way. It could not
even have been written another way. It is pure perfection as it is,
as individual as the writer who chiseled it into our memory.

<P>
   `THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,' starring Kate Beckinsale, Chloe
Sevigny, Chris Eigeman and Robert Sean Leonard. Directed by Whit
Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's smart, fretful, patrician
characters turn up midway between ``Metropolitan'' and
``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes post-college career
worries with improbable discomania. A delightful cast engages in
nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting debate, rendered with
Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms. Beckinsale, an English
actress with a flawless American accent here and diffidence that's
just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at the center of a bright
and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone willing to entertain
the notion that the spread of environmentalism was sparked by the
revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco generation's formative years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A PERFECT MURDER,' starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Viggo Mortensen. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The
characters may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted
update of Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film)
``Dial M for Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play
are icily amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled,
riled-up rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader
in deep financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover
(Mortensen), a con man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not
as easy as he hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic and twinkly, is the
wife, Emily, a translator at the United Nations, who has her own
agenda. The story takes enough surprising twists to keep you
engrossed, and the high-style ambiance (especially the Taylors'
Fifth Avenue apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `QUEST FOR CAMELOT,' with the voices of Andrea Carr, Gabriel
Byrne, Cary Elwes, John Gielgud, Jessalyn Gilsig, Eric Idle, Gary
Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, Don Rickles and Bryan White. Directed by
Frederik Du Chau (G, 100 minutes). Warner Brothers' shaky entrance
into the Disney-dominated sweepstakes of the musicalized animated
feature wants to be a juvenile feminist ``Lion King'' with a
musical heart that fuses ``Riverdance'' with formulaic Hollywood
gush. But its characters are too wishy-washy and visually unfocused
to be compelling, and the songs (by David Foster and Carole Bayer
Sager) so forgettable as to be extraneous. In this variation on the
Arthurian legend, a nondescript Celtic farm girl named Kayley with
aspirations to be a knight wrests the magic sword Excalibur from
the evil would-be emperor Ruber (a Hulk Hogan look-alike) and saves
the kingdom (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,' starring Anne Heche and Harrison Ford.
Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SPANISH PRISONER,' starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Written and directed by
David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's
cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security
check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for
reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery
here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate
con game, stays tricky to the very end. Scott plays the inventor of
a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss
who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast
working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays
a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his
pretty young sister. In her performance as a pert, unaccountably
off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's
sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TRUMAN SHOW,' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Jim Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin)

 &HT;    An X-tremely weird world: Guide to intricate world
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For five years, fans of the ``The X-Files'' have been slowly
immersed in a byzantine world of aliens (good and bad), genetic
engineering, shadowy government operatives and massive cover-ups.
Creator Chris Carter has concocted one of the most diabolically
complicated worlds ever created for the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   If you're coming to the movie ``The X-Files: Fight the Future''
as a neophyte, or have followed the show without obsessing on how
it all fits together, here's a quick cheat sheet to get you up to
speed on what's known and what's conjectured.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S WHO
</P>
<P>
   -- FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) _ Brilliant but
darkly obsessed agent who believes his sister, Samantha, was
abducted by aliens as a child. On his quest, he is uncovering
pieces of a far-reaching conspiracy involving an alien attempt to
colonize Earth and powerful men who are helping the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   -- FBI Special Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) _ Mulder's
partner, who usually plays a scientific and rational role to his
intuitive, seat-of-the-pants style.
</P>
<P>
   -- FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) _
Mulder and Scully's boss, he's mainly a benevolent protector who
looks out for them, but sometimes tries to rein them in.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) _ Shadowy unnamed
figure who's somehow a key. Works for the Syndicate (see below) but
may have his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   -- Well-Manicured Man (John Neville) _ Minor character in the
series becomes crucial in the movie. Unnamed British Syndicate
figure.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Syndicate _ Top-secret international cabal that has
conspired with aliens to take over and colonize Earth.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Lone Gunmen _ Three ultra-geeky free-lance conspiracy
buffs (named after the Warren Commission's theory about the JFK
assassination) who help Mulder and Scully.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S WHAT
</P>
<P>
   -- The X-Files _ Secret FBI files on cases involving unexplained
phenomena (X  &QC;  unexplained). On the series, these can involve all
sorts of spooky stuff, including vampires, werewolves, telekinesis,
etc. The important ones are about aliens and are part of the core
mythology of the series.
</P>
<P>
   -- The aliens _ There are believed to be at least two kinds,
maybe more. The bad aliens are attempting to colonize and enslave
Earth and use their life force, a black, oily substance, to take
over humans. They have been here for thousands of years, although
it's not clear yet what is taking so long. Some good aliens, who
are shape-shifters and can take human form, may be fighting the bad
aliens, but they are involved in the TV series, not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S WHO
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of ``X-Files'' Web sites. A few key ones:
</P>
<P>
   -- http://www.astolat.demon.co.uk _ A good overview of what's
been figured out and deduced so far on the conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   -- http://www.AnotherUniverse.com/columns/amhh
</P>
<P>
   /amvvhh0605982.html _ On the movie soundtrack, Chris Carter
recorded a ``hidden track'' at the end, in which he talks about the
background of the Syndicate and the alien takeover. An unofficial
transcript (with misspellings) is available here, on Another
Universe's page.
</P>
<P>
   -- http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Cavern/7094/Cafe/cafe.html _
Some of the most thorough and thoughtful episode summaries are done
by Barbara Ruef on her site called Cafe Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   -- http://www.usd.edu/(tilde)mmarek/xf/movie.html _ If you want
some of the movie's secrets divulged (``spoilers'' in Net jargon),
go here.
</P>
<P>
   -- http://www.thex-files.com _ The TV series' official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   -- http://www.fightthefuture.com _ The movie's official Web
site. It doesn't offer nearly as much information as the unofficial
sites, but you can download the movie trailer if you have a fast
modem and plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   ON VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   Fox Broadcasting Co. has released 30 ``X-Files'' episodes from
the first three seasons on home video, available for rental or sale
at most major outlets. You can't really get a thorough grounding in
the intricacies of the show's mythology, because several key
episodes from this past season aren't out yet. If you want to get a
taste for the show, just get the pilot episode, which introduces
the major players.

 &HT;    No answers, much action follow
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' is like a weird fan dancer, a sexy-creepy
performer who obscures as much as she (he? it?) reveals. First we
see a sexy glimmer of leg, next a hairy hand holding a pistol, next
the rubbery belly of a monster fluke worm. Glimpses, never the
whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way creator Chris Carter likes it. His movie is more
of the same. It's a chimeric beast, fusing Nixon-era conspiracy
paranoia with a millennial dread of biological warfare, domestic
terrorism and little green men from outer space. Oh, and there's a
sexy lead couple to keep our eyes soothed when the plot gets too
shaggy.
</P>
<P>
   As FBI agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian
Anderson take a smooth step up from television to the big screen.
The script tweaks their patented deadpan style without veering into
camp. As for those Internet rumors of romance, the movie handles
the characters' celebrated sexual tension with a scene that's the
equivalent of a knowing wink.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cheesy old ``Star Trek's'' transition to this glossier
medium, ``The X-Files'' translates smoothly. That's no surprise,
since the show's rich, dusky production values give it a visual
edge over standard TV fare.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but you're wondering what the movie is about?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as a fan of the show, the last thing I want is a bunch of
``X''-ers angry at me for giving stuff away. So forgive me if this
review remains as opaque as a typical episode.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a variation of the show's ``mythology'' plot lines.
More complicated than ``Twin Peaks'' ever was, the mythology
presents a shadowy network of corrupt men in power (played here by
Martin Landau, John Neville and Armin Mueller-Stahl), somehow
involved with a planetary colonizing project involving alien life
forms. The movie draws on staples from past shows, including that
pesky alien ``black oil,'' virus-laced bees and that uber-villain,
the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis).
</P>
<P>
   It also tries to give good ``boo'' value with a brutal species
of aliens. Unfortunately, these mean E.T.'s, whose icky treatment
of humans owes a debt to the ``Alien'' franchise, never turn into
the super-scary monsters the movie needs.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the problems here. ``The X-Files'' film is bigger
than the TV show, but not significantly better. It has more gore
and the occasional profanity. But it never accelerates to that
stratospheric level of action, suspense or awe that we hope for in
a summer movie. It's well-made but feels long. And it depends on
coincidences we're less likely to question on the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder about logistics, for instance. How does Mulder
get so easily from D.C. to Antarctica when his every move is being
watched? You may also marvel at his knack for always choosing the
right direction during a chase and his luck at literally stumbling
into a secret entrance to a vast military site.
</P>
<P>
   The film may seem too familiar to series fans, too confusing to
newcomers. A colleague who doesn't watch the show followed the plot
OK. But she was bothered that Mulder and Scully acted so surprised
by the conspiracy and alien elements. Haven't they been
investigating these things for five years? While she had a fine
time watching, nothing about the movie made her eager to tune into
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Fans may get a headache from trying to match the film's
semi-explanation of things with the hints and snippets the series
has dropped. The movie does not tie up a lot of loose ends. After
all, the series is committed for another two years; creator Carter
isn't ready to knock down his own house of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a better analogy for ``The X-Files'' would be to call
it a shell game. No matter how many times we get cheated, it makes
us want to play one more round. The film is a disappointment, but
in the same way that explains the success of the series: It leaves
us wanting more. It's a tease, always promising to show us the end
of the world, then having us make do with some running, some
gunfire, some explosions ... and a kiss that never quite happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files:
</P>
<P>
   Fight the Future''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson. Directed by Rob
Bowman. Rated PG-13 for mild language, gore and violence. At metro
theaters. 2 hours, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Bigger but not really better.

 &HT;    ``Intimate Relations''
 &HT;    Grade: C
 &HT;    Starring Julie Walters and Rupert Graves. Directed by Philip
Goodhew. Rated R for sex, language and violence. 1 hour, 42
minutes.
 &HT;    The verdict: Half of a good film.
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find us very generous,'' says Marjorie Beasley
(Julie Walters) as she welcomes new lodger Harold Guppy (Rupert
Graves) to her home in ``Intimate Relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generous'' is an understatement. Before long, Harold is
sharing bed and board, literally, with his sexually voracious
landlady. On the surface, Marjorie is an average middle-class
British housewife, circa 1954, busy with her sewing, her cups of
cocoa and her 13-year-old daughter, Joyce (Laura Sadler).
</P>
<P>
   But it's no wonder that the aptly named Guppy is soon hooked.
He's got all the comforts of home plus regular sex and some very
nice gifts. Things get more complicated, however, when Joyce
demands her share of the action. Their not-quite menage a trois
becomes a fertile breeding ground for sexual tension, blackmail,
jealousy and worse.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on a true story, ``Intimate Relations'' has been
crisply directed by newcomer Philip Goodhew. Unfortunately, he also
wrote the script, and here he runs into trouble. After a jaunty
beginning, the film turns increasingly bleak. Or rather, events do.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhew, however, remains true to his isn't-this-a-goof tone.
Unlike ``Heavenly Creatures'' or ``The Young Poisoner's
Handbook,''' similarly themed but far more successful films,
``Intimate Relations'' seems either uninterested in or incapable of
getting inside its characters' twisted heads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Walters remains a formidable actress. Her deceptively
matronly Marjorie could whip Glenn Close's ``Fatal Attraction''
fanatic without looking up from her teakettle. But even she can't
save a movie that wears awfully thin without ever deciding what
it's about.

 &HT;    Big themes get grand treatment in timeless tale from Disney
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's not mince words. ``Mulan'' is the best Disney animated
feature since ``Beauty and the Beast'' or ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   A quantum leap beyond the labored pretentiousness of ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' or the self-conscious chic of
``Hercules,'' Disney's 36th full-length animated movie is far more
than a grand family film. It's a grand film, period.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a Chinese legend that dates to the fourth century,
``Mulan,'' opening today, is a timeless tale of individualism,
courage, brains-over-brawn and love between fathers and daughters.
Our heroine (voice by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga) doesn't fit
in with Chinese culture's expectations of a proper young lady;
namely, that the only way a daughter can honor her family is by
making a good marriage. Impetuous, curious and a tad rebellious,
Mulan makes a mess of her matchmaking session. She has the
requisite tiny waist, but she's not very good at the calm and
obedient part.
</P>
<P>
   Fate intervenes when the neighboring Huns invade. The emperor
(Pat Morita) decrees that every family must send one male to the
country's defense. Mulan's father, a war hero, is willing but
hardly able. He's elderly and infirm. So she pulls a National
Velvet _ cuts her hair, dresses like a guy and reports for duty.
</P>
<P>
   But now she's in double jeopardy. Not only could she be killed,
but if her disguise is discovered, the law mandates that she be
executed by her commanding officer, who just happens to be an
inviting young hunk named Shang (B.D. Wong/Donny Osmond).
</P>
<P>
   Good thing her ancestral spirits have sent along some
protection. Well, not protection so much as a disgraced little red
dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), trying to prove himself worthy
of said spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The story and characters are irresistible. Mulan differs from
earlier Disney heroines like Ariel (``The Little Mermaid'') and
Belle (``Beauty and the Beast''). She's not dreamy/spunky; she's
more fast-talking and quick-witted. Her foray into a male domain is
less to prove anything than it is to save her father. She's not
trying to win medals or be a role model; she just wants to pass.
And Murphy, handed the comic sidekick role, is a glorious surprise.
He's as funky and funny as Robin Williams was as the genie in
``Aladdin.'' When Mulan heads off into combat, he nearly swoons
with pride: ``My little baby off to destroy people!''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a terrific story and great characters, the look
of ``Mulan'' is astonishing. It's completely unlike any previous
Disney effort. On one hand, there's the exquisite delicacy of a
falling cherry blossom; on the other, there's the thundering
excitement of the invading horde. The basic-training segments are
as slapstick silly as an old World War II comedy, and there's a
touch of Looney Tunes throughout (Mushu's double takes are worthy
of Daffy Duck). Yet there's also the Great Wall of China and the
Forbidden City, as awe-inspiring as outtakes from ``The Last
Emperor.'' And just look at the animated horses. The Chinese steeds
look like they're right off a silk screen or some ancient Chinese
porcelain. The enemies' mounts are much like the Mongolian ponies
that still roam the steppes.
</P>
<P>
   The score may be more witty than memorable, but it's a plus. So
are the film's enduring themes: girl power, special father-daughter
bonds, how ``being a man'' is more than just handling a sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is one of those small miracles the movies bring us
every once in a while. Don't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Ming-Na Wen and B.D. Wong. Directed by
Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft. Rated G. At metro theaters. 1 hour,
28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: As Eddie Murphy's dragon says, ``Mulan, you the
man!''

 &HT;    Sound of `Music' rings far from true
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its lyrical title and a cast including Jude Law
(``Gattaca'') and Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (``Secrets &AMP;
Lies''), ``Music From Another Room'' sounds like a charming
character study, perhaps a sweet romance.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what was intended. But writer-director Charlie
Peters' deeply annoying romantic comedy is mainly an endurance
test. Peters wrote and directed the lame ``Passed Away'' a few
years back. He's also written the clunkers ``Krippendorf's Tribe,''
``My Father the Hero,'' ``3 Men and a Little Lady'' and ``Her
Alibi.'' The list goes on, but those titles should clue you in.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more disturbing film introductions in a while, we
meet 5-year-old Danny shortly before he plunges his hands into a
pregnant neighbor's womb
</P>
<P>
   (Blethyn plays the mom). That's because she's gone into labor
unexpectedly, and it's up to him to disentangle the baby from the
umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is a girl, christened Anna. And Danny swears he'll
someday marry her. Jump ahead 20 years. Danny is now played by Law,
Anna by a lovely but gratingly shrill actress named Gretchen Mol.
</P>
<P>
   Though she's engaged to a rich guy (Jon Tenney), Danny, back
from living abroad for two decades, falls for Anna all over again.
And angles to win her back.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, it's clear that the movie confuses ``character''
with ``quirk.'' It leapfrogs among its various ``wacky'' plot lines
with all the focus of a 4-year-old whose chocolate milk got laced
with coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn is wasted as an exuberant life force saddled with one of
those obscure terminal diseases you only get in movies. Law does
his best to hold onto his dignity in an underwritten, uninteresting
role.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't help but feel some contact humiliation when the
actors have to mouth Peters' empty homilies about love and fate.
The movie is an embarrassment of twitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music From Another Room''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jude Law, Gretchen Mol. Written and directed by Charlie
Peters. At Phipps. Rated PG-13 for a mild sex scene and some
profanity. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Badly off-key.

 &HT;    Group's angst is plenty uninvolving
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the hero is named Lee Plenty, and the heroine is Havilland
(a.k.a. ``Hav''), you'll feel pretty sure you know where a movie
called ``Hav Plenty'' is going.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot's feature debut
manages to subvert those expectations, but for the most part is low
on originality. It mainly proves that African-American filmmakers
are just as proficient at aimless romantic navel-gazing as their
white colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' introduces us to Lee (Cherot), dateless in New
York on New Year's Eve. He happily accepts an invitation to a party
when his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he secretly
adores, calls from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish name-dropper, Havilland mentions parties with Eddie
Murphy and Quentin Tarantino. She's just broken up with a rising
pop musician (Hill Harper) who makes other women swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's life, in contrast, is far from glam. A writer whose latest
book deal has fallen through, he lives in friends' apartments and
scrapes by as a teacher's assistant at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Down in D.C., in a house that proves to be the movie's
claustrophobic primary location, we meet Hav's arch friend Caroline
(Tammi Katherine Jones) and sister Leigh (Robbine Lee).
</P>
<P>
   Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have the movie
star wattage or sly charm his role needs. Maxwell can't do much
with her character, written as a chilly and sour woman.
</P>
<P>
   Shot unimaginatively, with the flat lighting and composition of
an industrial commercial, ``Hav Plenty'' perks up slightly with an
enigmatic ending, a film-within-the-film featuring some amusing
cameos. Unfortunately, the snippet we see of the faux flick looks a
lot more interesting than the main feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christopher Scott Cherot, Chenoa Maxwell. Directed by
Cherot. Rated R for language. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Plays like the first draft of what might have been
a good comedy.

 &HT;    `Wilde' too earnest for own good
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The importance of being Oscar _ Oscar Wilde, that is _ has
varied over the years. There's Oscar Wilde the esteemed playwright
(``The Importance of Being Earnest'') and novelist (``The Portrait
of Dorian Gray''). There's Oscar Wilde the world-renowned wit and
elegantly foppish, self-impressed man-about-London. And finally,
there's Oscar Wilde the early martyr for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third Wilde who dominates director Brian Gilbert's
``Wilde,'' a well-intentioned and well-made movie that, alas, gives
Wilde's colorful life a kind of
not-that-there's-anything-wrong-with-that whitewash. Oh, it shows
pretty boys together and gives an occasional glimpse of the full
monty, but overall the picture is so sympathetic, so compassionate
and so decorous that it verges on dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde's'' most daring gambit is its opening scene. We're in
the wide open spaces of the Wild West. Or rather, the Wilde West.
The writer visited America in 1882, and the picture starts in
Leadville, Colo., where a mine shaft is dedicated to him while he
discreetly ogles the brawny miners.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his life, however, Wilde (Stephen Frye) is
still very much in the closet _ even to himself. What many people
probably don't know, and what this movie manages to convey in its
Cliffs Notes way, is that he tried Victorian conformity. He marries
and has two children. But one night while his wife (Jennifer Ehle)
is upstairs in the nursery, a houseguest (Michael Sheen) introduces
Oscar to his true sexual inclination.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster strikes when Oscar falls hard for handsome, heartless
Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law), a petulant brat with a title and a
tyrannical father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson).
Oscar's toxic infatuation leads to his becoming a pawn in a
poisonous struggle between a nasty son and a nastier father. The
result? Victorian England's trial of the century.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, ``Wilde'' is a safe gloss on a life that was
anything but. However, at its center is a gem of a performance.
Frye, best known to American audiences as Peter in``Peter's
Friends,'' gives a sweet, regretful portrayal that has all the
nuance and intelligence his movie lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde'' is dutiful and well-behaved. Wilde was neither. It
makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Frye and Jude Law. Directed by Brian Gilbert.
Rated R for nudity and sex. At Phipps. 1 hour, 56 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A dutiful, well-behaved movie about a man who was
anything but.

 &HT;    First installment of new Wolfe novel appearing in Rolling Stone
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe's big novel on big men and big money in Atlanta will
not be published until Nov. 12, but readers can get a preview of
``A Man in Full'' in the July 9 issue of Rolling Stone, which hits
some newsstands today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27.50), Wolfe's
first major work since ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' 11 years
ago, traces the convergence of the lives of three men: Charlie
Croker, an Atlanta real estate developer and conglomerate magnate;
Roger White, a black lawyer in a white-glove Atlanta firm; and
Conrad Hensley, the 23-year-old son of hippie parents.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any mention of Atlanta or any of the Georgia
characters in this excerpt, however. They won't appear until
October, when the next two chapters are published in Rolling Stone
and Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first installment, titled ``The Suicidal Freezer Unit,''
we meet Conrad Hensley as he reports to work as an ``ice weevil''
at a San Francisco frozen food warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, a young father with two children, is working the
$14-an-hour job in hopes of buying a condo. But he soon learns his
future at Croker Global Foods Warehouse is as precarious as the
footing on the ice-patched floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrad burrowed on, a weevil with the best of them, into the
Salisbury steaks, fish, burgers, gravy stock, ice cream, orange
juice, cut fava beans, margarine, pepperoni pizza, chipped beef,
bacon and waffles, and the ruckus rose, and the cries rang out _
Crash 'n' burn! _ and the produce crashed, and the pickers yahooed,
and Dom's big voice bellowed over the speakers: ``Cleanup! Cleanup!
Kilo 9! Kilo 9! Come on, Ferdi! You, too, Birdie! On the double!' _
and the light-night frenzy ran through the chamber like a rogue
hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Conrad struggles to keep his job, a continent away the
owner of Croker Global Foods Warehouse is enmeshed in his own
personal and financial problems. Croker, a middle-aged former
football hero, has a 28,000-acre South Georgia plantation, a young
and demanding ``trophy wife,'' a half-empty office tower in Atlanta
and a huge amount of debt.
</P>
<P>
   As Croker's financial woes intensify, Atlanta is thrust into a
racial crisis when Fareek Fanon, a young man who scratched his way
out of the slums to become a star college football player, is
accused of raping an Atlanta blue blood's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all the tight-lipped publisher has revealed so far.
According to Rolling Stone, the novel is still a work in progress.
``I don't have much more to go,'' says Wolfe, 67. Meanwhile,
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux has planned a 1.2 million-copy first
printing and a major media blitz this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Having his books serialized in Rolling Stone has become a
regular event for Wolfe. His nonfiction best seller ``The Right
Stuff'' began as a four-part feature commissioned by the magazine
in 1973. ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was serialized in 27
installments in 1984 and 1985. And in 1996, Wolfe's novella
``Ambush at Fort Bragg,'' which was released only on audiotape, was
published in two parts in the magazine.

PRIMARY COLOR? THINK RED  
 UNDERACHIEVER NO MORE  
 BITING THE HAND ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Don't bother writing a political movie! At least for
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has never been too welcoming of films about politics,
but the recent box-office disappointments, ``Primary Colors,''
directed by Mike Nichols and starring John Travolta, and
``Bulworth,'' directed by and starring Warren Beatty, have made
similar projects even more dicey.
</P>
<P>
   Both films were critically acclaimed. ``Bulworth,'' a farce
about a California Senate candidate (Beatty) in the grip of a
nervous breakdown, who speaks bluntly about race, class, power of
money and just about everything else, was, by all accounts, one of
the more provocative films of the star's 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary Colors,'' based on the novel by Joe Klein about a
Southern governor who resembles Bill Clinton, earned some of the
strongest reviews of the year and was termed one of Nichols' best.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two movies generated an extraordinary number of
magazine covers, television interviews and newspaper stories.
Beatty, who was also co-writer and co-producer of the film,
appeared on everything from the Sunday morning talk shows to Howard
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   But neither film stirred enthusiasm at the box office.
``Bulworth,'' made by Fox Filmed Entertainment, grossed about $24
million, while Universal's ``Primary Colors,'' which cost about $64
million, has grossed less than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives say they are proud of the films. And they
blame the public's dislike of politics and politicians for the
lackluster box-office performance.
</P>
<P>
   As one person involved in ``Primary Colors'' said: ``The day
before the film opened, I went to the dentist, and the hygienist
said to me: `I'm so sick of politicians. I don't even care if it's
John Travolta playing a politician. I don't want to see that
movie.' And that's what hurt the movie _ this distaste for
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers here say the airwaves are so glutted with politics and
scandal that making a movie about a president or senator in trouble
seems redundant. Worse, it seems unentertaining. Audiences hear
enough bad news about politicians on television; who wants to pay
for it?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hollywood has had commercial success with some political
films, like ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''(1939), ``State of the
Union'' (1948) and ``Advise and Consent'' (1962). There have been
some more recent hits, too, like ``All the President's Men''
(1976), about the two Washington Post reporters whose coverage led
to the fall of President Richard Nixon, and ``Dave'' (1993), about
a presidential look-alike who moves into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``Wag the Dog,'' a satire about a president who
wants to start a war to divert attention from a sex scandal, also
proved successful. The movie cost less than $20 million to make and
grossed about $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Primary Colors'' and ``Bulworth'' have been high-profile
disappointments. Asked if he would approve a political film, the
head of one studio remarked: ``It would have to be exceptional. And
for a very reasonable price.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current embargo on political films cannot endure. For
years Hollywood studios had a similar sentiment about sports films,
believing that movies about baseball or football fell flat at the
box office. Then came the 1989 Phil Alden Robinson drama, ``Field
of Dreams,'' starring Kevin Costner. The film was a hit, and
studios happily opened the gates to sports films.
</P>
<P>
   It will take one big hit political film. Then there'll be an
avalanche.

 &HT;    Bad blood, serious consequences
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Character'' is a dour yet compelling movie, laden with
Dickensian incident and a Kafkaesque sense of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1920s Rotterdam, director Mike van Diem's debut feature
manages an adroit mixture of passion and repression, destiny and
character study. It's not exactly a lighthearted romp, and it
leaves a strong impression as well as a sense of a filmmaker with
something more on his mind than merchandise tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   The picture opens with a tense confrontation between an
emotional young man named Jacob Willem Katadreuffe (Fedja van Huet)
and a powerful older man, Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir). What's
immediately clear is that there's bad blood between them.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the police station. Dreverhaven, a heartless and
much-feared bailiff who prides himself on his lack of compassion
for the poor, has been murdered. Katadreuffe is the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   We soon learn, via flashbacks framed by the police
interrogation, that there was more than bad blood between the two:
There was shared blood. Katadreuffe is Dreverhaven's illegitimate
son, the issue of a near-rape committed against his stone-faced
housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman).
</P>
<P>
   What ensues, for the most part, are Katadreuffe's bitter
memories of the relentless war waged between father and son. At
every turn, the son seems somehow thwarted by his father. Are these
cruelties meant to be character-revealing (of the father) or
character-building (for the son)? Perhaps a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Van Diem somewhat overdoes the Oedipal sturm und drang that
colors their bitter conflict. However, so much happens so quickly
that you barely have time to worry about it. Van Huet is determined
and sympathetic as the abandoned son driven to distraction (and
murder?) by his formidable father's notions of tough love. Decleir
is equally forceful in a more one-dimensional role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character'' has a uniquely European ferocity and despair. And
though it may be a bit too broodingly ambitious for its own good
(remember, it's a first film), it still makes you grateful that not
everyone in movies these days is recycling '60s TV series and '50s
Japanese monster movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character ''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fedja van Huet. Directed by Mike van Diem. Not rated,
but there is brief sex, nudity and violence. Subtitles. 1 hour, 57
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A mix of Dickens and Kafka. A deserving winner of
this year's Oscar for best foreign language film.

   Underachiever No More
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Platt grew up mostly in Asia. A diplomat's son who spent
years in Hong Kong, Beijing and Taipei, and had attended a dozen
schools by the time he was a teen-ager, the 38-year-old actor
recalled: ``I would hang around my parents' parties, and their
friends would ask what I was going to do and the only answer I
could think of was `I'm going to be an actor.' It's what I did
best. It's what I enjoyed. Of course, I had no idea what that
entailed.'' He laughed. ``I was sort of an underachiever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Platt is a character actor who appears to be working nonstop and
has a movie surfacing, it seems, just about every month. He played
Beatty's harried associate in ``Bulworth''; he has a villainous
role (``I'm joyfully greedy'') in the Eddie Murphy comedy ``Doctor
Doolittle,'' opening on June 26, and he portrays a sweet-natured
schoolteacher in ``Simon Birch,'' an adaptation of John Irving's
novel, ``A Prayer for Owen Meany,'' which opens in September.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, he will appear as an out-of-work actor in the
1930s in the comedy ``The Imposters,'' directed by Stanley Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky,'' Platt said, in a bit of an understatement.
``There's been a nice, steady trickle of work. It sometimes surges.
Now it's surging.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt, who lives in New York's Greenwich Village with his wife,
Camilla Campbell, and their two small children, said his
peripatetic early life was both a blessing and a curse. His father,
Nicholas Platt, now president of the Asia Society, was a diplomat
who served abroad for years and was ambassador to Pakistan and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a kind of global perspective, but the price you pay is
a certain rootlessness,'' said Platt, speaking from Toronto, where
he is making ``Three to Tango,'' a comedy. ``In an odd way, acting
was a funny way to plug into some kind of weird stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt recalled that as a 3-year-old in Taipei, he once imitated
a water buffalo at a backyard barbecue _ and was hooked on acting.
``I knew I was destined for the stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Platt said his parents were entirely supportive of his acting
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the wisdom to let me do what I wanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Tufts University, and lived in Boston for several
years to work in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends were all moving to New York, beckoning me to come,
but I was terrified,'' he said. ``In hindsight it was a smart
decision to stay in Boston. I was part of the semiprofessional
theater scene there. It was such an important part of my
preparation. I never would have been able to play the parts I
played had I moved to New York immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   By late 1986, Platt had arrived in New York and, to his
surprise, began working almost immediately at Lincoln Center, the
Manhattan Theater Club and Playwrights Horizon. ``I got lucky very
quickly,'' he said. ``In one evening, in a series of one-act plays
at Playwrights Horizon, I played an Indian waiter, a deranged
Vietnam vet and a demented Elizabethan manservant. It was
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Film work followed, including ``Married to the Mob,'' ``The
Three Musketeers,'' ``Indecent Proposal,'' ``Flatliners,'' ``Funny
Bones'' and ``Dangerous Beauty.'' Perhaps his most memorable
experience was one of his first movie jobs, the 1988 film
``Crusoe.''

   ``I was flown to the Seychelle Islands,'' Platt recalled, ``and
found myself sitting around nude beaches, eating smoked fish and
being paid more money on a daily basis than I would have been paid
for the whole run of an off-Broadway play. It was obvious my values
would be imminently corrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt said his favorite comment about acting came from Sir Alec
Guinness, who once observed that the best actors only have four or
five faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be lucky if I get two or three,'' Platt said.

   President Clinton often comes to Hollywood to raise money. But
last weekend, before attending another fund-raising event here, he
stopped in Springfield, Ore., and made two speeches in which he
denounced, of all places, Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   At Thurston High School, the site of a shooting by a 15-year-old
boy on May 21 that killed four and wounded two dozen, Clinton said
Hollywood bore a heavy share of the responsibility for the recent
school shootings by producing movies, television shows and songs
that romanticize violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio speech the same day, he said children had become
increasingly numb to violence, and he deplored the ``mindless
killing'' that had become ``a staple of family entertainment.'' He
said that ``when children see cinematic conflicts resolved not with
words but with weapons, we shouldn't be surprised when children,
from impulse or design, follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Clinton flew to Los Angeles to attend a glittering
$800,000 fund-raising event for the Democratic National Committee
at the home of the entertainment mogul Lew Wasserman. The guests at
the $10,000-a-couple sirloin dinner included Barbra Streisand,
James Brolin, Rob Reiner, Sidney Poitier and assorted agents,
executives and stars.
</P>
<P>
   But there, Clinton was far less pointed on the issue of the
entertainment industry's responsibility for violence by children.
He mentioned his visit to Oregon and said studies showed that
random and repetitive violence in the media made ``children more
deadened, desensitized to the immediate consequences of it.'' But
then he veered to other subjects. There was no criticism of
Hollywood in its own back yard.

FULL GRAB BAG OF VARIED TITLES

   When a biological weapon called Trixie gets loose in little
Evans City, the Army sends a large contingent to seal off the town
and prevent anyone from leaving. Trixie either kills people or
turns them into homicidal maniacs, which makes for a busy time for
soldiers in gas masks and for citizens, whose terror and outrage
aren't eased by the fact that the Army decides not to tell them
what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the military and civilians are fighting pitched battles,
with moms and dads appropriating M-16s to pick off the troops, who
return the favor in front of horrified offspring. Looks as though
the entire town will have to be eradicated, but that's a job for
the B-52 headed their way with just the right-size warhead to
insure the problem stays confined to Evans City.
</P>
<P>
   With little money and only the crudest special effects, George
A. Romero's 1973 film ``The Crazies'' puts on as realistic and
involving a show as anything coming out of the big-budget Hollywood
action mill.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Romero's ``Night of the Living Dead,'' ``Day of
the Dead'' and ``Season of the Witch,'' ``The Crazies'' fills out
an interesting horror package from Anchor Bay Entertainment, of
Troy, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 90s the company has put together all kinds of
properties _ public domain material, old studio films, television
classics, cult items _ into one of video's most eclectic
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   A riffle through the Anchor Bay catalog turns up, among hundreds
of titles, ``Mystic Pizza'' (1988), Tom Mix matinee serials, Lewis
John Carlino's ``Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea,'' Sam
Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' and ``Evil Dead 2,'' two Monty Python titles
from Handmade Films, 4 Jerry Lewis and 11 Bob Hope movies, 5
episodes of ``Prime Suspect'' with Helen Mirren, 10 Hopalong
Cassidy titles, ``Brideshead Revisited'' and a dozen ``Saturday
Night Live'' special editions.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, new releases include horror titles from Hammer
Films, Sam Peckinpah's ``Straw Dogs'' and ``Far From the Madding
Crowd'' from PBS's Mobil Masterpiece Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most recently we've been gearing up to put out remastered
versions of Hitchcock's `Rebecca,' `Suspicion' and `Notorious,' ''
said Jay Douglas, Anchor Bay's vice president for acquisitions.
Those videos are due in August. Next month will come David
Cronenberg's ``Shivers'' and King Vidor's ``Duel in the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Bay looks for deals with companies like Hammer and
Handmade and ABC Circle Films, which owns much of the Selznick
library. Other films are picked up after studios let their rights
lapse. ``Our goal is to elevate these old films and B movies, if
that's what you call them,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally that requires completely new editions. Next week,
for example, Anchor Bay will reissue Peckinpah's western ``Junior
Bonner,'' with Steve McQueen, in the wide-screen format rather than
the customary panned-and-scanned square. ``You can't watch that
movie panned and scanned,'' Douglas said. ``It looks like
`Gunsmoke' or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Bay also has four cassettes of ``Gunsmoke.'' Information:

   Errol Morris' documentary explores the human condition through
the eyes of four very different visionaries: a topiary gardener who
prunes large bushes into the figures of animals, a lion tamer, a
molecular scientist who perfects robots and an expert in the
behavior of the tiny mole rat.
</P>
<P>
   Blending conversation and inventive camera work, Morris savors
their individuality while joining them into a loose but overarching
whole. Perhaps most interesting is Morris himself, ``a
one-of-a-kind filmmaker,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times, ``capable of melding science, philosophy, poetry and sheer
whimsy into an elaborate meditation on mankind's mysteries.'' &QL;

   Welcome to Sarajevo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tackling its subject head on, Michael Winterbottom's film jumps
into random death and commonplace horror with an oddly diluted
result. Tensions between British and American war correspondents
(Stephen Dillane and Woody Harrelson) work well in concert with the
setting, but the arrival of a relief worker (Marisa Tomei) is too
obviously dramatic and undercuts the near-documentary feel.
</P>
<P>
   Overly fancy camera work and a flippant tone also don't help a
film that ``winds up less affecting than a more poetic or
roundabout approach might be'' (Maslin). &QL;

   Adapted from a much better novel by David Brin, Kevin Costner's
post-apocalyptic Western lands in what's left of a blistered United
States in 2013. Drawing inspiration from the long-dismantled postal
service, a former clerk (Costner) inspires a band of stalwart
survivors and leads them against murderous renegades.
</P>
<P>
   That makes for a 1950s-style showdown but too late for a film in
which ``the accumulated bad lines and bogus sentimentality become
so cloying that the best defense against a mounting queasiness is
an awed amusement'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

   A schizoid comedy is bracketed at beginning and end by animated
excerpts from the myopic cartoon figure of the 60s. In between, the
shortsighted antics of a live Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) send him in
pursuit of a ruby, which is called the Star of Kuristan and comes
with a lovely representative (Jennifer Garner) of that country.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the chase leads to Brazil and a criminal named Peru.
Actually, the film works for a bit as a thriller but is
``incomplete as cartoon, indecisive as comedy and halting as
adventure'' (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;

   BLACKMAIL and MURDER. Both films are among a half-dozen early
Alfred Hitchcock titles recently reissued by RepublicViacom(DG). In
``Blackmail'' (1929, 86 minutes), a young woman (Anny Ondra) kills
a man who tries to rape her and then gets trapped between the
investigating detective, who is her boyfriend, and a blackmailer.
</P>
<P>
   When Hitchcock completed the film, it was silent, but he was
later asked to add dialogue, making the movie his first talkie. In
``Murder'' (1930, 108 minutes), a peer of the realm (Herbert
Marshall) is the one jury member convinced of the innocence of a
young actress accused of murder. The films are $9.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   COBRA (1925, 75 minutes) and THE SHOWOFF (1926, 82 minutes),
both silents. In ``Cobra,'' a promiscuous Italian count (Rudolph
Valentino) beset with romantic problems comes to New York with the
notion of starting a quiet career in the antiques business. Right.
Soon a new set of women, from husband-hunters to extortionists, are
lined up around the block.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Showoff,'' the slapstick actor Ford Sterling has the
title role, but Louise Brooks steals the film as the fetching girl
next door. Kino (independent). $24.95 each. Information: (800)

`THE X-FILES': IN THE DARK, IT RESEMBLES A CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists, consider this: What if the hush-hush
atmosphere and Internet mania surrounding the first ``X-Files''
feature film were part of a giant plot to hide the uneventfulness
of one more summertime sci-fi fizzle? It's as possible as much of
what ``The X-Files: Fight the Future'' has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   If devotees of the television series come to the film with
enough baggage for a six-week safari, perhaps they can deepen the
experience of watching a middling, unfocused action-adventure with
brand-name appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch: this film isn't tailor-made for true
X-fanatics, because the material has been so broadened to
accommodate the uninitiated. Trust no one who dreams up an action
sequence in Antarctica for the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   No, no and you must be joking. Those are the answers to the
first three questions that the prospect of an ``X-Files'' movie
raises: Do Scully and Mulder get extracurricular while hunting
extraterrestrials? Do they solve all the series' outstanding
mysteries? Will there be a sequel?
</P>
<P>
   The movie teasingly offers the prospect of big developments in
the television X-plot, but all it really does is create a vague
omnibus format for future movie spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That may make it a crossover hit quicker than you can say
Trekkie, but a lot of the show's otherworldly intensity has been
lost in the process. Also, ``The Truman Show'' built a better
mousetrap when it comes to paranoid fantasies this season.
</P>
<P>
   The captivating hold of ``The X-Files'' may itself be more
fascinating than the material anyhow. Reams may be e-mailed about
this film's tiniest nuances, but tiny they remain. (This week's
Newsweek notes that Scully's crucifix is ``a small gold pendant
symbolizing her faith in God.'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the movie may raise more questions than it meant to
when it offers glimpses of alien troublemakers. Reaching for
run-of-the-mill grisly horror, it winds up attributing
sophisticated global-domination plans to vicious, long-clawed
spacelings who are more prone to screams than schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Without making much connection with the end-of-season television
cliffhanger, the film starts off in Ice Age Texas, where aliens
lurk in wait for Early Man. Thirty-seven thousand years later,
Texas has heated up, but the aliens' modus operandi hasn't much
changed.
</P>
<P>
   A nicely diabolical early scene shows a little boy savaged by
the invasive virus nicknamed the black oil. Typically, as it works
to cover too many bases, the film mentions the virus again but
never follows through on one of its best special-effects tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's off to Dallas, where FBI agents Mulder (David
Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) trade affectionate
wisecracks atop a Dallas office building. The X-file investigation
into alien activity is now officially closed (as if!), so they have
been newly assigned to antiterrorist vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   They spot the bomb, but it goes off anyway, shearing off half of
a government building. That allusion to Oklahoma City could have
been the film's most shameless or daring aspect, but proves to be
neither.
</P>
<P>
   The film avoids real political conspiracies in favor of a
pie-in-the-sky thesis that the building was destroyed to hide
evidence of alien activity, and that aliens have subverted the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's also jokey enough to wink at this notion, make fun
of the stars' somber manner ``Y'alllook like door-to-door
salesmen''), recall that Mulder is nicknamed Spooky and let him
happen to urinate on an ``Independence Day'' poster in a dark
alley.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Chris Carter, the heart of ``The X-Files,'' from a
story he wrote with Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Rob Bowman, who
has done many episodes of the series, the new film strains to
involve as many familiar elements as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So a number of series fixtures (like the trio called the Lone
Gunmen) make minor appearances, while Martin Landau, Blythe Danner
and Armin Mueller-Stahl establish new characters. (Mueller-Stahl's
German mastermind, advocating the strangest of appeasement
policies, is the most intriguing of these.)
</P>
<P>
   Bees and cornstalks figure peculiarly in the story. The movie
also appropriates a bit of ``Alien'' for its ideas about
space-monster propagation. And thank a product tie-in for
automobiles for the specious scene that shows off a car.
</P>
<P>
   But the touch of X-iness that will matter most to both diehards
and neophytes is the film's promise of heightened conspiratorial
activity between Scully and Mulder. And here's where it does the
most mischievous teasing, since the story's big Antarctic spectacle
still seems warmer than the not-quite-love-affair.
</P>
<P>
   The film contrives a fairly strangled declaration of fondness
from Mulder, a near-clinch and a wild idea of how to get a heroine
out of her clothes. This last episode, unfolding in a huge set that
resembles a giant carburetor, doesn't actually glimpse Scully in
the nude or goad Mulder into anything more daring than a Sir Walter
Raleigh imitation. But as on-the-job rescue efforts go, it does
qualify as a fetishist's delight.
</P>
<P>
   Though both stars are sometimes eclipsed when the film strains
for action episodes, Duchovny sustains enough cool, deadpan
intellect and suppressed passion to give the story a center. Ms.
Armstrong has the harsher, more restrictive role, but she plays it
with familiar hardboiled glamor.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors are more at ease with either bantering dialogue
or X-ish hyperbole (``like nothing we've ever seen before!'') than
with the screenplay's more fulsome touches.
</P>
<P>
   Like the title phrase, which comes from this exchange: ``What
has he seen? Of the whole he has seen but pieces.'' ``He is but one
man. One man cannot fight ... the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files: Fight the Future'' is rated PG-13 (Parents
strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, grisly corpses, ugly
violence and the suggestion of nudity.
</P>

AT THE U.S. OPEN, AUTOGRAPHS ARE A SIGN OF THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Many players in the U.S. Open are familiar with
the crowds that turn out for such events and the resulting demands
for their signatures. But someone forgot to tell one caddie just
what such an event can mean in terms of security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The man made the mistake of seeking an autograph from Tiger
Woods while Woods stood on the putting green. Within seconds, a
handful of security guards descended upon the caddie as if he had
been wielding a switchblade instead of a pen.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear if he got the autograph. What he did get was a
lesson in what it's like to pursue an autograph from Woods, the
most coveted prize for autograph hounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's final practice rounds were the last chance for fans
to seek autographs or snap pictures. And though several people have
been rewarded by patient golfers, there was a little more
desperation on the Olympic Club Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes haven't been ugly this week. But more than a few kids
have complained about overzealous adults running them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think they would give us more of an opportunity,''
said Tina Smith, 14, from San Diego. ``They want the autographs
just as much as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest spot for autograph seekers had been just above the
18th hole. As the golfers walked through a narrow path leading to
the clubhouse, arms, books, pendants and hats all hung over the
ropes, blocking the players' route, awaiting approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy out there on Monday, but they got it under
control,'' said George Mason, a U.S. Open security volunteer.
``It's been amazing to see how many people want these autographs.
Some kids don't even know whose signatures they're getting. They
just know it's a golfer. Sometimes, they'll ask a friend who a
player was and the kid will say it was a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   While some golfers are less conspicuous than others _ a
volunteer in front of the locker-room door wouldn't allow David
Duval to enter on Monday because she didn't recognize him _ there
are some who have no trouble with identification. Woods tops that
list.
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation adores him most. The older one
understands how to benefit from his appeal. Woods doesn't mind
signing his name, but he's also discovered the trickery involved in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get kids and other people who are out there to watch golf
and want an autograph,'' Woods said. ``Then you get people who are
collecting autographs for business purposes. That's where we as
players have a problem. A lot of adults are sending kids out as
runners, paying them to get an autograph. Then they go mat it,
frame it and sell it. That's when it's hard to distinguish between
a genuine fan and someone trying to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat such problems, some golfers sign their autographs to a
particular person. Others only sign items they endorse.

STRIKING FLINT WORKERS SAY THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR ALL GM EMPLOYEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Dave Schneider, a striking electrician at General
Motor's metal plant, knows he's probably not a popular man in
Arlington, Texas, where the Michigan strike has triggered about
2,300 layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Schneider and his fellow strikers in Flint say they are
fighting for all GM workers, even though it might not seem that way
to the idled employees at the Arlington assembly plant and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is going to be bad feeling down there,''
Schneider said as he walked the Flint picket line. ``Just tell them
to hang in there. We're sorry they got laid off, but we've got to
do what we've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As impact of strikes at two GM parts plants ripples across the
country, the workers who touched off the chain-reaction layoffs are
grappling with the consequences of their action. By choking off the
supply of fenders, hoods, odometers, air filters and other critical
parts, the 9,200 Flint strikers have forced more than 84,000
layoffs at GM plants in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   Even GM's foreign operations _ a primary source of the strikers'
resentment _ have suffered. More than 18,000 Mexican workers have
been sent home, as have 50 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, the strike has forced nearly 1,800 layoffs at the
GM assembly plant, plus 500 more at Lear Corp. and Mackie
Automotive Systems, two GM suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The shock waves from the dispute have generated mixed feelings
of pride and discomfort among the striking workers. Analysts
predict that the shutdowns will cost the company as much as $500
million a week, giving the striking workers some powerful leverage
in the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this plant is so unproductive, how is it we brought this
whole company to its knees?'' striker Kim McKinnis asked.
</P>
<P>
   But other striking workers expressed unease with the fate of
union members at hobbled GM plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of the country doesn't understand. They see us as
greedy,'' said Elvis Strahly, who has worked for GM for 26 years.
``We're not out here for more money. We're not out here for more
benefits. We're out here because they didn't live up to their
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strikers contend that their effort to stem the loss of
jobs to foreign plants will help all GM workers, especially those
in Arlington with its proximity to Mexico. They see themselves as
the front line in a battle with a company that has become
increasingly dependent on foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for future jobs,'' said striker Larry Cuevas.
``If they slap me, they'll slap you. It's better we stop them in
Flint than wait until they get that close to the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they have no intention of pulling out of
the United States or Flint. They cast the strike as a contest
between the GM's need to compete in the global market and the
desire of the United Autoworkers Union to retain uncompetitive
production practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's environment in the marketplace, we need to have our
costs down and as finely tuned as we can,'' GM spokesman Gerry
Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have made almost no progress resolving their
differences, and both sides are bracing for a long shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wins in a strike. We lose. GM loses. The workers in
other plants lose. But it's one of the necessary evils of
collective bargaining,'' Cuevas said. ``We don't go to a strike
unless they put us out there.''

HYPOCRISY, MENDACITY AND THE TOBACCO PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 21)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hypocrisy and Mendacity are familiar figures in the
nation's capital. They stalk the halls of Congress, the executive
offices of government and the gathering places of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   They are particularly venal when special interests, with little
concern for the public welfare, feel endangered in their quest for
money.
</P>
<P>
   A good example of that venality was the tobacco industry's
$40-million dollar propaganda campaign that sought to show that the
congressional effort to lay heavier taxes on cigarettes was just
another quest by greedy politicians for more money to increase the
size of government.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, the campaign succeeded when the Senate voted last
week to kill the tobacco bill aimed at discouraging teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the industry's slick TV spots was there any
suggestion that tobacco kills people or that revenues from the tax
would have been used to reduce teen smoking, accelerate the war on
drugs or reduce taxes on the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the commercials was that the increased tobacco tax
would just be one more way of taking money from middle- and
lower-income people to support a more massive bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take much memory to recall that not long ago the
heads of the major cigarette companies lined up before a
congressional committee and swore under oath that they did not
believe tobacco was addictive. Talk about deceit!
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to garner more money from tobacco revenues, the TV
spots suggested, the two political parties were abandoning
traditional doctrines _ the Republicans, their opposition to
taxation, and the Democrats, their support of working people.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans did not abandon their opposition to
taxation. They latched onto the tobacco industry's argument and
made it their own. They, too, contended that the attempt to
increase the tobacco tax was simply a battle between big government
and the little people.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco campaign was similar to that conducted to great
advantage by Republicans in 1994. That year the GOP hammered
relentlessly at the fact that the Clinton administration and
congressional Democrats had passed a monumental tax increase.
Nowhere was there any mention of the fact that the tax was levied
against the richest 1 percent of the populace and not the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have the Republicans acknowledged subsequently that the
economic package, of which that tax hike was one key element, may
have helped produce the prosperity that Americans now are enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   The recent campaign also bore marked similarity to the
successful drive, financed in 1994 by the medical and health
insurance industries and promoted by the GOP, to kill Clinton's
plan to extend health care coverage to millions of Americans who do
not now have it.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP was informed by one of its pollsters that it could
nullify Democratic criticism of its alliance with the tobacco
manufacturers by asserting vehemently that it simply was opposing
traditional Democratic tax-and-spend policies.
</P>
<P>
   That is demagoguery of an ancient variety. It reaches back to
the days when the Democrats campaigned successfully to make Herbert
Hoover appear the arch villain of the Great Depression or when
Republicans won elections by asserting that Harry Truman, Adlai
Stevenson and the Democrats were ``soft on communism.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, however, that the voting public may now be too
wise to buy such subterfuge.
</P>
<P>
   The people may not be willing to sacrifice the lives of their
fellow Americans, including many who are young, to the money and
power of the big tobacco companies. They may realize that if the
tobacco tax were bad for them, its chief sponsor in the Senate
would not have been Arizona's John McCain, a Republican, a genuine
war hero and one of the most principled members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party has a corner on virtue. The Democrats, like the
Republicans, take care of those special interests that pump money
into their campaign coffers. A current criticism leveled at the
Clintonites is that they have permitted contributions from wealthy
Chinese individuals and institutions to influence their policy
toward China.
</P>
<P>
   The president denies the accusation. But as his journey to China
approaches this week, critics assert that he has abandoned human
rights and become a Chinese pawn.
</P>
<P>
   We will not know whether that's true until his state visit is
completed. What we do know is that many Republicans appear to have
taken up the tobacco industry's cause in response to contributions
made to their party.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., the poster boy of the religious
right, recently assailed the proposed tobacco settlement in the
exact terms used by the cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, a candidate for president in 2000, talked about how
awful it would be for people earning less than $30,000 annually to
have to pay the tax.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention that tobacco takes lives, that millions of
Americans who never smoked or who gave up smoking would not have
been taxed because they do not buy cigarettes or that millions of
dollars from the sale of cigarettes have gone into Republican
coffers _ and to those of some Democrats, too.
</P>
<P>
   Using some of the tobacco tax revenue to fight drugs or to end
the tax penalty imposed on married couples who work may or may not
have been valid. But there were various ways in which the
legislation could have been compromised and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hypocrisy and mendacity that characterized the behavior
of the measure's opponents succeeded in killing it outright.
</P>
<P>
   Now American voters will have a ready-made issue upon which to
decide who should control Congress as we enter the 21st century.

 &HT;    SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS AIR THEIR CONCERNS AT NATIONAL SUMMIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a diverse bunch, their worries are remarkably
similar.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, restaurant owners, computer software designers, travel
agents, printers and furniture builders were among the small
business owners visiting the nation's capitol Thursday to fight for
less government intrusion and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax code has 7 million words,'' said Charles Anderson, a
veterinarian from Waco, Texas. ''Why can't we have a code that is
simple and fair and everyone can understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson echoed a popular sentiment at the first-ever
``Congressional Small Business Summit'' organized by the
influential National Federation of Independent Business, with
cooperation from the American Farm Bureau Federation and five
smaller business associations.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is one of NFIB's 550 voting delegates who traveled to
Washington for the three-day event.
</P>
<P>
   Many said the forum was not only an opportunity to meet people
with similar needs from across the country, but also to give a
strong, united political voice for small business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been forgotten for a long time,'' said Jan Triplett,
co-director of Entrepreneurs Association, a business based in
Austin, Texas that links small firms with consultants, investors
and new American and foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett, a NFIB delegate, said many small business owners don't
have the extra time or money that other special interest groups
have to lobby for their agendas. ''We don't have lawyers on our
staff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Passarelli, a wholesale florist from Oregon, said that
scarce resources also put small business people at a disadvantage
in legal battles over land use.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we stand a chance?'' he said. ``We're just trying to
grow roses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuit protection was among the needs NFIB members expressed in
surveys. They also want a federal exemption from state standards
for health benefits and less burdensome environmental and safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In panel discussions and brainstorming sessions Thursday,
participants said the Endangered Species Act and many wetlands
regulations have infringed upon their property rights. In addition,
many delegates said public elementary schools have allowed
environmental groups to set curricula and portray business as an
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural war and we need to get involved in it,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFIB has some 600,000 dues-paying firms, 900 employees and
an $85 million annual budget. It was ranked this year as the
nation's most powerful business lobby in a survey of Washington
insiders by Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On one of its major priorities, the NFIB had reason to celebrate
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from President Clinton, the House approved a
measure Wednesday that would eliminate the tax code effective Dec.
31, 2001, except for provisions relating specifically to Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill is a positive sign that Washington is hearing the
voice of small business,'' said Jack Faris, NFIB president.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stalled low pressure over Maine will cause unsettled weather to
linger over New England. Clouds will be most prevalent across
northern New England while southern sections will be partly sunny
after patchy morning coastal fog. Scattered thundershowers with
locally heavy rain will develop through the region during the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A frontal system marking the leading edge of very warm and humid
air will move east from from the Ohio Valley toward the interior
Northeast. A cluster of thundershowers over the eastern Ohio Valley
early Friday will weaken as it drifts toward the central
Appalachians Friday morning. The showers and thundershowers will
regenerate Friday afternoon from western Pennsylvania to the
Carolinas. A few strong thunderstorms with gusty winds and hail are
expected in the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual heat will persist over a large area from the southern
Plains to the Southeastern States. Converging winds will promote a
band of strong thunderstorms which will move through the Tennessee
and lower Mississippi Valleys. A few isolated thundershowers will
bring little relief to the fire-plagued areas of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Another pool of unseasonably cool air will drift over the
northern Rockies and northern Plains. Showers will be common near
west-facing slopes in Montana and Wyoming. Scattered showers will
linger over the northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West Coast states will be warm with ample sunshine.
However, low clouds will remain in the cool air near the northern
coast of Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Different Spin
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a damage survey team in Pennsylvania uncovered
evidence of an unusual twister. The damage pattern revealed that
clockwise winds surrounded the center of the tornado. Over 90
percent of tornados spin counterclockwise. A tornado develops when
the motion in large slowly rotating thunderstorms is concentrated
into a narrow violent swirl. Since larger scale storms are affected
by the earth's rotation, the slow spin is usually counterclockwise.
Rarely, the turbulent motions near a thunderstorm can make small
areas of clockwise rotation that lead to tornados that spin in
reverse.

<P>
   &UR; By MIKE McMANUS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This morning I woke up in a hospital bed. Through the window
next to my bed and I could see tiny wisps of clouds in a delicate
pattern that again reminded me of God's marvelous handiwork. I felt
blessed to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, I was in the same hospital (on the same floor,
with the same gentle nurses) to have an orange-sized tumor removed
from my colon. The surgery went well and in five days I was home.
The cancer had passed through the wall of the colon, but had not
entered my lymph system. Doctors debated about whether I should
take chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Some said that since I had a 70 percent chance of recovery, I
was taking a needless risk of infection by taking a treatment that
would weaken my resistance to disease, and which at best could push
my survival odds only to 75 percent. Others said I was healthy
enough to take the risk, so I did.
</P>
<P>
   But last week I had to have emergency surgery because my body
had been invaded by a rare bacteria, a disease called necrotizing
fasciitis, that actually eats one's flesh and can be fatal.
Surgeons had to cut out two pockets of dead flesh. The care of
these wounds was very painful at first, but is now tolerable. And
antibiotics seem to have halted the bacteria's spread.
</P>
<P>
   At a time like this one is tempted to feel utterly helpless. My
life is in the hands of others. But I had complete confidence in
the medical team, and in God, who I felt was not yet ready to
``take me home.'' I feel absolutely at peace.
</P>
<P>
   However, Romans 8:28 kept running through my head: ``..in all
things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been
called according to his purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has been God's purpose in these illnesses?
</P>
<P>
   A friend who visited said, ``Sometimes God allows terrible
things like this to happen to get your attention. In 1955 Eli
Wiesel was hit by a taxi. In his long recovery, he also recovered
his faith that was lost at Auschwitz. I think God is calling you to
a new level of holiness. The Lord wants you to develop a closer
walk with Him.''
</P>
<P>
   So I've been reading more Scripture. My son, Adam, asked me to
read Psalm 18:32-33:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to
stand on the heights.''
</P>
<P>
   That has certainly been my experience. But how does one convince
the skeptical of such matters? During these weeks I've been reading
a wonderful book with answers called ``God: The Evidence'' by
Patrick Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his faith in high school, went to Harvard and emerged a
convinced agnostic, which later hardened into convinced atheism.
``Reason, I thought, was the only path to truth. No God in the
personal sense, no afterlife, no soul, no inherent justice in the
universe. We were on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he read a book called ``Life After Death'' by a
psychiatrist named Ray Moody recounting ``near-death experiences,''
deathbed visions of people who ``died and made a comeback.''
Victims of heart attacks, crashes, etc. described what they called
a realm beyond death. Most said they felt a sudden sense of peace
and detachment, an absence of pain. Some said they felt they were
floating over an operating table, then moved down a tunnel to a
heavenly landscape and encountered a ``Being of Light'' that some
described as Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Some even felt they underwent a detailed review of their lives,
a replay of every thought and action -- and its consequences for
good or ill on others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Sabon, a cardiologist, was critical of Moody's
methodolgy. So he decided to ask his own patients who claimed
``near-death experiences'' detailed questions that would not be
known to laymen. Some said they had observed surgeries on their own
heart and described details they could not possibly have observed
while unconscious on the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number also described ``hellish'' near-death
experiences that prompted some to change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Those who felt they encountered Christ were struck by an
overwhelming sense of unconditional love and compassion along with
His firm sense of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's conclusion: ``Near-death research offered the first
systematic body of evidence suggestive of the existence of a
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites similar persuasive evidence for the existence of God in
physics, astronomy and medicine, which I will examine in next
week's column.
</P>
<P>
   I did not need Patrick Glynn's research to have faith in God.
But others do.

GOLF FANS FIND WAYS TO GET TO THE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A question keeps popping up when walking through
the U.S. Open crowds at the Olympic Club: Doesn't anybody work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do. But my boss said take the day off. He said it's a
once-in-a-lifetime chance. Enjoy it,'' said Maureen McGowan, an
American Express accountant who spent Wednesday with her husband
watching the pros warm up for the Big Event.
</P>
<P>
   John Kavanagh, an attorney, works, too. Just not much while the
U.S. Open is in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a message on my voicemail for my clients letting them
know I'll be out on the course,'' said Kavanagh, standing near the
McGowans. ``I wouldn't miss this.''
</P>
<P>
   By the looks of things, a lot of people are calling in sick,
have a generous boss or simply are going AWOL to take in the U.S.
Open. Although the tournament began with Thursday's opening round,
the days leading up to the real golf had their own appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, the pros were loose, making side bets with
one another, chatting with the spectators, munching on the free
apples and bananas provided at the start of each hole, teeing off a
second or even a third ball if the first or second one missed the
intended mark. Onlookers also bent the rules during the practice
rounds, snapping pictures, talking above a whisper and shouting
``You the man'' at what during tourney play would be considered
inappropriate moments.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan, who spent a good chunk of the day at the 10th tee and
the nearby 17th, kept her automatic camera busy, capturing
superstar Tiger Woods, veteran Jack Nicklaus and her favorite
up-and-comer, Matt Kuchar from Georgia Tech, who won last year's
U.S. Amateur. She was so close she could hear his soft Southern
accent when he was conferring with his caddy.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan, who spent the day in the gallery with her husband,
Brian, had never been to a major golf tournament before and had a
mini-anxiety attack over what to wear in the fashion-conscious
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through four outfits. I even washed my tennis shoes,
but they didn't dry in time so I'm wearing these thongs,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And what attire did she settle on? A yellow tye-dyed blouse and
a denim skirt. Brian McGowan had on a white polo shirt, white
tennis shoes and gray Bill Blass shorts.
</P>
<P>
   An injured carpenter who has been off the job for more than a
year, Brian McGowan loves to golf, but has been kept off the course
with a bum elbow. For now, he's content to watch the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do admire their talent. Just look at that,'' he said,
as Paul Azinger teed off, smashing the little, white, dimpled ball
down the fairway in a smooth stroke that looked effortless.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife live in Ingleside Terrace, not too far from the
Olympic Club, and scored some tickets from a neighbor who works for
one of the corporate sponsors. If the freebies hadn't come through,
they had planned to volunteer for the event and work at a hot dog
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest draw on the course, of course, was Woods, pulling in
the most fans at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the top of his head. I couldn't get any closer,'' said
Angela Fung, a data analyst from Oakland who sacrificed one of her
vacation days for the U.S. Open. ``But I did get to see Fred
Couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, referred to by the in-the-know spectators as ``Freddy''
or ``Boom-Boom,'' was another fan favorite, with folks lined up
three or four deep to watch him drive the ball, although only those
in the front had a clear view. The other fans relied on the sounds
of the crowd reaction to learn whether the shot was on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, you learn the good spots to see the play,''
said Kavanagh, the lawyer. He used to caddy at the Olympic Club as
a boy and attended the last U.S. Open played there in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   And to say he knows the terrain well would be an understatement.
He can recite all the course stats, comment on the quirky rolls of
the greens and answer obscure questions about the players. But one
inquiry stumped him: How did he get past the fashion police wearing
black pants to a place where khaki rules?
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``I don't know.''

ART REVIEW: PEGGY GUGGENHEIM, CELEBRITY. OH YES, COLLECTOR. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A hundred years ago this August, Peggy Guggenheim was
born. The wild daughter of a wild father, she was a conversational
magnet for much of her lifetime. Forever in and out of love, she
was a conspicuous dresser _ even her sunglasses made news _ and, in
the popular imagination, a more than conspicuous party-giver. In
her later years, she was a more or less a permanent American
presence in Venice in a strange house on the Grand Canal that she
filled with what many a visitor thought were strange works of art.
</P>
<P>
   Much of all this is touched upon in a new exhibition called
``Peggy Guggenheim: A Celebration'' at the Guggenheim Museum
uptown. This is, of course, her family museum, and her second
cousin Peter Lawson-Johnston is its longtime chairman. The show is
likewise a family affair, in that its curator is Karole P.B. Vail,
Peggy's granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that it is a curious and somewhat insubstantial
affair, in which the center of attention is Peggy the celebrity,
rather than Peggy the champion of 20th-century art at its highest
level. But even on a wet Sunday morning, it draws an eager
audience. What people go to see, or to dream about, is the private
life of Peggy Guggenheim (who died in 1979). They fantasize about
her phantasmagorial ups and downs, and about having the run of her
palazzo in Venice.
</P>
<P>
   This latter preoccupation is much encouraged at the Guggenheim
Museum. What the visitor sees first is in effect an outsize and
open-ended photograph album in which most of the images are framed
and hung on the wall. Peggy herself is almost always present. Many
of the photographs of her and her friends or acquaintances are by
very gifted people, among them Berenice Abbott, Man Ray and Gisele
Freund.
</P>
<P>
   Other photographs are the more telling for being snapshots made
on the wing, like the image of Peggy in 1941 at the Villa Air-Bel
outside Marseilles, where a young American named Varian Fry was
taking risks to get European refugees to safety in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But in almost every photograph, and even in the two portraits of
Peggy that were painted by Franz von Lenbach when she was 5 years
old, there is a continuous refrain. She looks out at us as if to
say, ``Will anyone ever really love me?'' That look of puzzlement
and disquiet rarely leaves her.
</P>
<P>
   The section of memorabilia includes objects that are an integral
part of Peggy's legend, like the silver bedhead designed by
Alexander Calder. Others, like the earrings designed for her by the
painter Yves Tanguy, take a little finding.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view are a very large number of pages from Peggy's
Venetian guest books. Anyone who has ever kept a guest book will
have come to dread the results when guest after guest has fumbled
with words and mismatched them with unfunny drawings. Not many of
Peggy Guggenheim's guests did much better than that. The signal
exception was Jean Cocteau, a more than practiced performer who
could turn on at a moment's notice and did not fail to do so when
in Venice in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from this show almost entirely is the Peggy Guggenheim
who most deserves to be remembered. As a collector, she was lucky
on three vital counts. First, she had timely and inspired advice
from Marcel Duchamp, among others. Second, she could buy major
works by Brancusi, Braque, Picasso, Leger, Kandinsky, Duchamp,
Delaunay, de Chirico, Dali, Klee, Miro, Masson, Magritte and others
in 1940 and 1941, when nobody else was buying. Third, she was
around in the early days of the New York School and put herself
wholeheartedly behind it.
</P>
<P>
   It is often held against her that she acted upon advice. But
what mattered more was that she was quick to act. Nor was it bulk
buying, as has been suggested. Her ideal may have been ``a painting
a day,'` but those were times at which it was essential to move
fast. Many artists in Europe were desperate to sell as the Reich's
shadow extended over the continent.
</P>
<P>
   What she bought was the nucleus of one of the great collections
of 20th-century art. Much of it is the Peggy Guggenheim Collection,
which now belongs to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   She was not lucky in her timing when she opened her gallery in
London in January 1938. She opened with an exhibition of drawings
and furniture by Cocteau. (His preface in French appeared side by
side with an English translation by Samuel Beckett. Neither was at
his best, but as a double act it could not have been bettered.)
</P>
<P>
   Peggy was able to follow this in March 1938 with the first-ever
exhibition in London of paintings by Wassily Kandinsky. Nothing was
sold, but with 38 pictures on the wall this was a gallant effort.
</P>
<P>
   When she opened her gallery called Art of This Century in New
York in October 1942, her situation was entirely different. Whereas
London in 1938 had been already apprehensive of World War II and
flaccid, not to say inert, in its response to new art from
overseas, New York in 1942 was full of European artists who had
arrived as refugees. A city in which Mondrian, Max Ernst, Leger,
Masson, Chagall and Tanguy were all within reach could not be
called provincial.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the burgeoning New York School, which included
Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko and Robert Motherwell.
All of them were shown at Art of This Century in an environment
designed by Frederick Kiesler that was in itself a triumph of the
modern spirit. In that gallery, new paintings were shown in a new
way. Between 1942 and 1947, Peggy Guggenheim was an incomparable
impresario for the new American art. It may, in fact, have been her
greatest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the great defect of this exhibition that painting and
sculpture play so small a part in it. Art historian Leo Steinberg
once wrote in Peggy's guest book that hers was ``the only house in
Venice that does not make one feel ashamed to be of this century.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could possibly say that this is borne out by the present
show, where a desultory jumble of paintings of all kinds makes
nothing like a coherent statement. Pollock and Motherwell are there
with minor paintings. There is also a small bronze by Jean Arp.
Thereafter, the standard declines sharply into Surrealist odds and
ends.
</P>
<P>
   We should have been reminded of what Clement Greenberg, a
longtime champion of Art of This Century, said of Peggy Guggenheim
in 1980: ``Her place in history has grown in the last 30-odd years.
No question about it.'' That was the note for her centenary, but it
has not been sounded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Peggy Guggenheim: A Celebration'' remains at the Guggenheim
Museum, Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, through Sept. 2.

<P>
   ``Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me'' are the
opening words to a famous song. But what do the words really mean?
How can being filled with peace inside one's self lead to peace on
earth?
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant philosopher Teilhard de Chardin refers to the
``unimpeachable wholeness of the universe.'' What does this mean to
us?
</P>
<P>
   It means we are part of the universe; we are part of the
wholeness of creation. We do not walk our path of life alone. The
whole universe walks with us, and we, as a human race, are coming
to a greater realization that we are all ``one'' in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe each of us is like a pixel. Just as a hologram is made up
of numerous pixels -- each one containing all of the information
that can be found in the total image -- so each person may be a
tiny particle of life, containing all the data that is present in
the sum total of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Gautama Buddha, whose original name was Prince Siddhartha,
grappled with the problems of human existence. Though his words had
not been written down, his disciples memorized many of his
teachings and passed them on to succeeding generations by word of
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In the principal teachings of the Buddha called the ``Four Noble
Truths,'' it is stated first that human life is intrinsically
unhappy; second, that the cause of this unhappiness is human
selfishness and desire; third, that individual selfishness and
desire can be brought to an end; and fourth, that the method of
escape from selfishness involves what is called the ``Eightfold
Path.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``Eightfold Path'' involves right views, right thought,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness and right meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this awareness of ``rightness'' and the letting go of
personal negativities can do a tremendous amount to create a
loving, caring and more beautiful world. A good way to create a
better world is for each of us to be better individuals.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain laws of life that, when followed, can make
life sweeter, more harmonious, prosperous, healthy and free. When
we choose to abide by these laws, we reap the benefits of living in
harmony with the universe. When we don't, we risk experiencing
sickness, war, economic insecurity and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that create turmoil, pain, misery and suffering in
our world can change when each person makes a conscious decision to
act and think for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   Personal motive is always a good guide. Ask yourself, ``Why am I
doing the things I do?'' and allow the inherent wisdom of spirit to
provide the true answer. If your motives are pure, then good should
come of them.
</P>
<P>
   The positive ideas we believe in today can constantly expand and
grow in our consciousness. This could be termed being ``on beam''
with life. Pilots often fly using a radio beam as a guide. As long
as they remain ``on beam,'' they are safe. If they get off the
beam, they're in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Each human person, too, has an inborn ``beam'' -- a conscience.
While we are in tune with the way things were designed to be, we
are ``safe.'' When we are out of tune, we may show it in the form
of greed, fear, sickness, addiction and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Some people experience a lifetime of having the flu each winter,
allergies in the fall, headaches, indigestion and all the so-called
minor ailments that we accept as a part of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it isn't necessary for this to be so. Each of us has
the inner power to encourage health, happiness and serenity. We are
capable of re-educating our bodies and our thinking.
</P>
<P>
   By thinking and acting always with good in our hearts; by
becoming responsible for ourselves, and, as an old Irish saying has
it, ``If you see a job that needs doing, that means it's yours to
do,'' we can begin to change our wrong world into a right world.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to stop saying that ``they'' need to be changing
things around here. When we start saying, ``I need to be giving
life a helping hand,'' we then begin to benefit life.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that ``a journey of a thousand miles begins
with the first step.'' Let each one of us take that step and make
it count.

A BURST OF BRAZILIAN MUSIC REFLECTS 4 DECADES OF CULTURAL
INTERCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ The music of Brazil is a tuneful affirmation of the
beauties of cultural interchange. Ever since foreigners started
showing up in South America, Brazilians have borrowed and
transformed the music that showed up with them.
 &HT;    This weekend, and in the days that follow, New Yorkers have a
chance to hear the results of four decades of Brazilian musical
alchemy, with two festivals creating the most concentrated
Brazilian invasion in at least a decade.
 &HT;    Over the next few days, lucky New Yorkers can hear Brazilian
syncretism in action, from the understated samba-jazz-pop
innovation that was the bossa nova to the globe-hopping,
electronically sampled information overload of a 1990's group
called Karnak.
 &HT;    The JVC Jazz Festival has booked Joao Gilberto, the father of
the bossa nova, for a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall; the
reclusive, whispery singer, who rarely tours, is celebrating the
40th anniversary of his first bossa nova single.
 &HT;    Wednesday at Avery Fisher Hall, the JVC festival brings together
the guitarists Joao Bosco, Egberto Gismonti and Toninho Horta,
backed by first-rate Brazilian sidemen, as the Brazilian Jazz
Ensemble.
 &HT;    And in between are concerts by two major singers _ Maria
Bethania (at Carnegie Hall on Saturday) and Gal Costa (at Avery
Fisher Hall on Tuesday) _ from the movement called tropicalismo,
Brazil's major musical wave of the late 1960s and early '70s.
 &HT;    Tropicalismo merged Brazilian traditions with the wild-eyed
possibilities of rock and was spearheaded by songwriters who rank
with the best musicians alive: Caetano Veloso (Ms. Bethania's
brother) and Gilberto Gil.
 &HT;    Ms. Bethania and Ms. Costa are lifetime friends from Bahia,
where they grew up with Veloso and Gil. When the two songwriters,
who were already stars in Brazil, grew a little too inventive for
the dictatorship that was running Brazil in the late '60s, both
were imprisoned and then exiled to London. There, they soaked up
British rock from the Beatles to Traffic to Pink Floyd. Meanwhile,
they were sending songs back home, where Ms. Costa and Ms. Bethania
would perform and record them.
 &HT;    Ms. Bethania is revered in Brazil, but has not performed in New
York City since 1988; her deep contralto voice gives her songs a
pensive dignity. Ms. Costa's show at Avery Fisher Hall looks back
to the early days of tropicalismo, following up on an album,
``Acustico'' (``Unplugged''), that she recorded in a concert for
MTV Brasil. On it, she revives some of the songs from the early
days of tropicalismo; in concert, as on the album, she will be
backed by a small band playing acoustic instruments.
 &HT;    ``It is such beautiful and rich material,'' she said. ``And the
way that I sing is very different 30 years later. The feeling is
much deeper.''
 &HT;    Ms. Costa is one of the world's most graceful singers, with a
voice that brings tender understanding to every line. ``To be a
good singer, you must always think about the words and what the
words say,'' she said. ``I must identify with the song and find
something in common with the lyrics of the song. I try to feel
every word.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Central Park Summerstage has chosen this week for its
own Brazilian music festival, which started on Wednesday. Tonight,
the percussionist Cyro Baptista leads his group, Beat the Donkey, a
band of percussionists who merge carnival traditions with modern
friskiness. Sharing the bill is Dance Brazil, performing a work
about what gold mining did to the people of the Amazonas region;
the score is by Veloso.
 &HT;    Brazil now has its own wave of funk, which sounds less exotic to
American ears, but Saturday afternoon, one of Brazil's top funk
bandleaders, Ed Motta, performs alongside one of his models, the
vibraphonist Roy Ayers, whose brand of funk was rediscovered in the
'90s by acid-jazz fans.
 &HT;    Sunday afternoon belongs to O Rappa, a Brazilian hip-hop group,
and Karnak, a group that throws everything from Tuvan throat
singing to heavy-metal guitar chords to a symphony orchestra into
its mix, turning it into a polyglot samba party. Whether the group
is toying with juju guitars from Nigeria or segueing a mock-Russian
anthem into a samba, it maintains the light touch and buoyant humor
that runs through Brazilian music.
 &HT;    ``We don't have preconceptions about any kind of music,'' said
Andre Abujamra, Karnak's founder. ``Bad music, good music, strange
music, we put them all together in a mixer. But we don't look like
a Frankenstein monster. It's all Karnak.''
 &HT;    Abujamra traces Karnak's music to the diversity of his city, Sao
Paulo. ``For those of us who were born in Sao Paulo, the mixing of
the music and of the culture is in our blood. I didn't have to do
research, because my head is already a mix of all the music and
traditions and religions of the world.
 &HT;    ``We are not world music. We are just born into the chaos.''

`X-FILES' SUCCEEDS AT CREATING THE BIGGER PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get the burning questions out of the way first.
</P>
<P>
   No, ``The X-Files'' movie doesn't answer all the questions
raised by the show. Yes, fans will enjoy it, if only for the
endless coffee-shop debates it will inspire. No, it probably won't
convert the unconverted.
</P>
<P>
   Do the show's heroes, Mulder and Scully, explore the phenomenon
of a nonplatonic relationship? Ain't telling.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, it looks good. If you're worried that this is merely a
TV series writ large, know that it has the good sense to make use
of its largeness. Some shots have a David Lean-esque quality, as
solitary figures or tiny objects traverse vast, barren landscapes
(although like the TV series, the movie plays fast and loose with
locations).
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Bowman lights everything so brightly, it gives the
movie an odd, fakey look, as if he wanted you to know that most of
the picture was filmed on sets, but he has an eye for how specks of
dust and swirls of snow fall and dance in that bright light. Bowman
and screenwriter Chris Carter also make good use of silence, with
at least two long scenes that are nearly devoid of dialogue _ this
isn't the type of movie where you want a lot of talkers in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Would that they had showed such confidence more often. In trying
to educate the neophytes in the audience, the filmmakers rely on
words more than actions, an approach that bogs down the movie's
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your TV has been on the fritz for five years, you
probably know that FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)
believes in conspiracies and extraterrestrials, and that his
partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), is a skeptic who remains
unconvinced despite years of evidence supporting Mulder's theories.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need Scully on her cell phone telling Mulder that
she's the rational one, and that they should do the rational thing,
in so many variations that it seems like she just learned the word
``rational'' and is trying out its different uses.
</P>
<P>
   Such overkill also occurs occasionally on the TV series, which
comes to the big screen with all its virtues and flaws intact. By
now, the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson is so
second-nature that they could be a Tracy and Hepburn (or at least a
Lucy and Desi) for the '90s; not only does Anderson step into her
first big movie role without stumbling, her presence lifts Duchovny
to his best film performance. And at its best, the series is among
the best-written on TV, and its intelligent and complex writing
translates well to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Your enjoyment may depend on how much intelligence and
complexity you ``want'' from a summer ``event'' movie; ``The
X-Files'' can be so confusing that one newspaper started a weekly
column just to keep things straight, and Entertainment Weekly has
dedicated more than one article to sorting things out. Sometimes,
it seems like Cliffs Notes would help, too.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the movie itself goes, it furthers the series'
aliens-and-conspiracy plot with a couple of cave-bound discoveries,
an explosion at a Dallas federal building, an FBI inquiry or two,
and the introduction of a new, shadowy figure (Martin Landau).
</P>
<P>
   True fans of the show won't want to know more than that about
the plot. They'll steer clear of blabbing reviewers and fellow
X-philes until they can see the movie reveal its surprises for
itself, which it does with a refreshing
lack of predictability and a frustrating lack of closure _ or, at
times, logic. But that really doesn't matter here. Rookie watchers
just might not get it; they're likely to be entertained, but
they're equally likely to wonder whether the show's popularity is
part of some conspiracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' is rated PG-13 for profanity and violence.

   CHINA-MOTOROLA _ BEIJING _ Motorola, determined to grow into a
$2.5 billion business in China by the year 2000, on Thursday held a
festive grand opening for the 1,000 headquarters employees who
moved into the company's 18-story North Asia Center headquarters at
one of the most prestigious spots in downtown Beijing. And on June
29, with President Clinton in town, Motorola will take one more
step toward that goal when it signs a $225 million agreement in the
Great Hall of the People to expand a semiconductor component plant
that already makes 1.4 billion components a year. One of the
striking features of the new building is a mockup, about 10 feet
tallk of a Chinese Long March rocket that launches Motorola's
Iridium satellites. The rocket mockup stands in the center of the
Motorola's mini-museum on the first floor of the Asia center.
Reporters weren't allowed to enter the building officially and
weren't invited to the opening. A corporate PR vice president
assures in an interview afterword that the expansion in China isn't
linked to the cutback of 15,000 Motorola jobs elsewhere in the
word. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    Despite ranking 16th, Estes will be home for Open
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ He was one of the hottest players on the PGA Tour,
about as consistent as anyone, and Bob Estes was more pleased with
himself than he had been in years when he made a prediction earlier
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' the Austin resident said in
March. ``They're not going to stop me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. And no.
</P>
<P>
   Estes, who is playing his best golf since 1994, ranks 16th on
the tour's 1998 earnings list with $683,817. He has finished in the
top 10 in five tournaments. Yet, while the best players in the
world are at the Olympic Club in San Francisco competing for the
U.S. Open championship this week (week of Friday, June 19), Estes
is at home, mulling another alteration to his game _ cross-handed
putting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his high ranking on the tour's money list, Estes, 32,
failed to meet qualifying standards for the U.S. Open. The United
States Golf Association has several categories in which a player
can qualify, one of them a top-30 ranking on the PGA Tour's
earnings list the previous year. Estes finished 69th in 1997.
Players could also qualify for the Open by ranking among the top 10
on the 1998 money list through May 24, the final day of the
Colonial tournament in Fort Worth. Estes, who ranked 11th before
Colonial, missed the cut, earning only an early trip home. He shot
67 on Thursday but 75 on Friday, exhausted, he said, from pushing
himself so hard to play well enough to qualify for the U.S. and
British opens and PGA Championship, three of pro golf's four major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely fried,'' Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   Estes qualified for the British because he is ranked among the
top 20 on the PGA Tour and top 50 in the world rankings. He has
also played well enough to qualify for the PGA Championship. His
final option for the U.S. Open was a 36-hole qualifying event in
early June at the Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md., where
160 golfers arrived to claim 32 spots in the Open. Estes shot 148,
falling short by six strokes.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Estes has no one to blame but himself for having
to spend Open week in Austin. In another, he wonders why the USGA
has different qualifying standards for its men's and women's Opens.
The top 35 LPGA money winners from 1998 will compete in the women's
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who I've been beating every single week this
year but who finished in the top 30 last year, and they are in the
Open,'' Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   USGA spokesman Rich Skyzinzki said there are different standards
because more men try to enter through the qualifying tournaments
that are open to any professional and amateurs with a handicap
index of 1.4 or lower. (The women's maximum is 4.4).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than 7,100 men try to qualify (for 156 spots),''
Skyzinski said. ``We had 1,000 women.''
</P>
<P>
   So Estes, a former national collegiate player of the year at the
University of Texas, will have to call on the resiliency that has
enabled him to recover from swing problems and injuries the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Estes has undergone more makeovers than Dennis Rodman while
trying to regain the form that enabled him to finish a career-best
14th in earnings in 1994, when he won the Texas Open, his lone
victory in 10 years on tour.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, Estes developed soreness in his right elbow, he
says, from swinging shafts that were too long and heavy and from a
weak grip, hands turned to the left. His grip was causing him to
address the ball too steeply, inducing extra vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Estes' neck and shoulder muscles became too tight
from the intensive weight training he had undergone in hopes of
adding length to his shots. The 6-foot-1-inch Estes had increased
his weight to 195 pounds, 15 more than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Estes slipped to a disappointing 41st on the 1995 earnings list.
That spot looked great from where Estes landed in '96, when he
stumbled to 149th, losing his fully exempt status to compete on
tour. He survived the 36-hole cut in only seven of 26 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Estes began pulling himself toward respectability last year,
finishing 69th in earnings despite holding his clubs like a
baseball bat, an uncommon grip. He said it helped alleviate pain in
his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   This year Estes switched to a stronger grip, turning his hands
to the right and his game up several notches. He made the change
without using instruction from a swing coach. Estes now wishes
someone had advised him earlier in his career to use a stronger
grip, which produces right-to-left shots that tend to carry farther
than the left-to-right shots from a weak grip.
</P>
<P>
   Estes ranks ninth in scoring average, 70.04 strokes per round.
He has made 15 cuts in 16 events. He tied for second at Bay Hill in
March and finished third at Greensboro in April.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he is not satisfied, particulary with his putting.
Though he ranks 20th in that category, Estes said he needs to
become better to elevate his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hardly ever three-putt, so my total putts always look
good,'' Estes said. ``But I don't make nearly enough mid-length,
15- to 20- and 30-footers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not those putts that cost Estes a victory this year,
though. At Greensboro, he led by one shot with two holes left but
made bogey at both, missing four-foot putts at each.
</P>
<P>
   So Estes will now try crosshanded putting, placing his left hand
lower than the right. Some golfers say that enables them to move
their putter down the line more easily. Proponents of crosshanded
putting say that the conventional grip _ right hand below left _ is
less steady, because the left wrist can break down, producing putts
that pull to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk, considered by some the best putter on tour, putts
crosshanded. So does Fred Couples. Tom Kite has alternated between
grips. Short-game guru Dave Pelz recommends crosshanded putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried it before but never committed to it,'' Estes said.
``I was never quite comfortable. But I think I've found a way to
hold the putter that I like.''

 &HT;    Ex-Texas coach Penders top candidate at George Washington
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Tom Penders, who said recently that he was not a
candidate ``at this moment'' to become coach at George Washington
University, emerged a day later as the top candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of Texas coach is expected to be named
coach at George Washington today. A news conference is scheduled
for noon.
</P>
<P>
   Penders, 53, met with George Washington President Stephen J.
Trachtenberg on Wednesday in Washington D.C., where the school is
located. He also met with the team. Efforts to reach Trachtenberg
and Penders were unsuccessful. But Trachtenberg told the Washington
Post, ``He is the leading candidate. It's a question of minds
meeting and all that good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Penders and school officials were still
negotiating a contract Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Penders and George Washington associate head coach Kevin Clark
were left as the top candidates after Delaware head coach Mike
Brey, a George Washington alum, withdrew from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Penders, who resigned under pressure at Texas on April 2, would
replace Mike Jarvis, who recently was hired by St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   If Penders does become coach, he can leave his box of tools
behind this time. Penders, renowned as a Mr. Fix-It in college
basketball, turned losing programs into winners at Rhode Island and
Texas. He would start on higher ground at George Washington. The
Colonials were 152-90 in eight seasons under Jarvis, including 24-9
last season. They were 11-5 in the Atlantic-10 Conference, tied for
first in the West Division. Four starters return from that team. If
there is an adjustment period, it might be because Penders, who
prefers up-tempo basketball, inherits a team with more size than
quickness, one accustomed to a half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington made four NCAA tournament appearances under
Jarvis, reaching the third round in 1993 and losing in the first
round in '94, '96 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   When Penders went to Rhode Island from Fordham in 1986, he
inherited a program that was 42-97 the previous five seasons. Rhode
Island finished 20-10 in Penders' first season and 28-7 the next,
reaching the third round of the 1988 NCAA tournament before losing
to Duke by one point.
</P>
<P>
   That performance earned Penders the head coach's job at Texas
vacated by Bob Weltlich, who went 77-98 in six seasons and was
fired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Penders was 208-110 at Texas, winning more games than any
Longhorns coach. Texas, which had not been to the NCAA tournament
since 1979, went eight times in Penders' 10 years. His tournament
record was 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Penders resigned under pressure less than a month after four
players complained to Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds about verbal
abuse by the coach and lack of improvement in their games. Penders
was also under heat because an academic report for freshman Luke
Axtell was faxed to radio station KVET-AM by assistant coach Eddie
Oran in violation of privacy law.
</P>
<P>
   Oran took responsibility for faxing the report, saying in a
written statement that he did it of his own volition. Oran has not
been available to comment on the matter, and Penders said he had no
knowledge that his assistant was going to fax the report.

 &HT;    Don't expect arms race from richer Astros
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An hour before a recent game, Astros owner Drayton
McLane, a county judge, the mayor and even a pseudo-commissioner
gathered in the bowels of the creaky, old Astrodome for what was
described as a major annoucement to secure the team's stability.
</P>
<P>
   McLane, Bud Selig and friends did so much strutting you
half-expected the buttons on their shirts to fly off into the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The officials revealed the team's signing of a 30-year, ironclad
lease for the club's new stadium with 42,000 seats, a grass field
and a retractable roof that will retract, we suppose, on the last
day of the season if the temperature dips below 90.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will also have 63 luxury boxes closer to the
field, better amenities, charter seat licenses, a ritzy venue
attractive to free agents and, you can be sure, a new name by the
time the $229 million park opens in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballpark at Union Station, its current tag, sounds quaint in
the same manner of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Rather, it will
until McLane sells the naming rights to Enron or Compaq or anyone
else with a spare $40 mil or so.
</P>
<P>
   What Wednesday's news meant, besides the fact that the Astros
won't be moving to Northern Virginia, Round Rock or anywhere else
until at least 2031, is that McLane's pockets just got a little
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   That could be telling, particularly in the area of pitching to
shore up a fragile staff that just got weaker with Mike Hampton's
stay on the disabled list. New stadiums and high-priced talent go
hand in hand, or arm in arm. Is there any wonder that Houston's
Darryl Kile defected in the off-season for $24 million over three
years to Colorado, where the air is thin but the crowds are thick?
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you won't see the Astros pull off the type of deal
to bring Curt Schilling or Randy Johnson to town, but it might free
up McLane to shell out for Pete Harnisch or Bret Saberhagen before
the July 31 trading deadline. Both of those, however, are more
suspect than saviors. Same for the usual late- summer cast of
castoffs like Mike Morgan or Bob Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have a desperate need. If we went out and got
one (pitcher), we'd probably go to New Orleans,'' said Astros
President Tal Smith, referring to Triple-A talents Scott Elarton
and John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   Halama, a rakish lefty, was overwhelmed in his first stint with
the Astros to start the season but has recovered nicely in the
minors with a 6-1 record, 3.15 earned run average and six walks in
54 innings. Elarton has won nine games and given up only 71 hits in
92 innings. But I'd send them both packing in a New Orleans minute
to get Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, though, sounds like a man who prefers to stand pat, in
part because the team's $39 million payroll is still more bloated
than McLane desires after $100 million of red ink in six years.
Hampton, out with a strained groin, is expected to miss only two
starts. Shane Reynolds is 5-1 over his last seven starts with a
2.56 ERA. Until Tuesday's seven-walk game, Pete Schourek has
pitched more than adequately, and Sean Bergman has an outstanding
3.00 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Hampton rebounds with no dropoff, the Astros certainly
have enough pitching to hold off the Cubs, Brewers and surprising
Pirates in the Central. But it's doubtful they can best the Braves'
staff of Cy Youngs without an in- season transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a dearth of pitching and with the wild card, more
clubs are contenders later,'' Smith said. ``In my view, pitching is
so unpredictable, sometimes a household name is no longer as good
as what he's perceived to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that. After all, who in March would have dared think
Jose Lima would become the National League's first six-game winner
in May? The animated, 25-year-old right-hander threw seven strong,
fist-pumping innings Wednesday and Houston rallied for a 6-5 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching has been a lot better than I thought,'' Manager
Larry Dierker said. ``I thought if we kept our staff earned run
average around 4.00, we'd have a chance to win the division because
I thought our offense would be that good.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right on both counts. His offense, even with a struggling
Jeff Bagwell, has been better than good. And his pitching has been
incredible, its current 3.54 ERA the third-lowest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker could even deserve early manager of the year
consideration, given Bagwell's year and a pitching staff
three-fifths of which was lost to injury and free agency. Ramon
Garcia and Chris Holt have been disabled all season. Garcia's
probably done and Holt won't be available until at least late
August.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, Dierker's staff is highly underrated or highly
overachieving. In either case, it's working.

 &HT;    Tired of store lines? Scan your own groceries in Florida
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tired of scanning the tabloids while
waiting in line at the supermarket? Next time, try scanning your
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's the latest gimmick in the self-service universe _ the
no checker checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   Anne O'Connor did Wednesday morning. In a few minutes, she
scanned $31.02 in granola bars, ice cream and other groceries and
got a printed bill. The price of each item was displayed on a
screen and read off by a silky voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' O'Connor gushed. ``You hear the computer talk
to you. This is probably what they'll be using in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie opened its first self-checkout lanes in South Florida
on June 4 at its store west of Boynton Beach, at Jog and Hypoluxo
roads, and invited reporters in Wednesday to see them in operation.
The store, which opened April 30, got the lanes first because
executives of the Jacksonville-based chain believe customers in the
burgeoning Boynton suburbs would be more receptive.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Walsh, Winn-Dixie marketing director in South Florida,
said there still will be lanes with cashiers. But self-checkout
lanes _ including the three at the west Boynton store _ give antsy
customers in long lines an option to do it themselves. To pay, they
take printed bills to a central cashier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your cashier line is three or four deep, then this will be
faster,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Self-checkout lanes already operate at 16 Tampa, Orlando and
Jacksonville Winn-Dixies. Two more stores in Palm Beach County and
one in Broward will have them by the end of December. The company
won't say where. Outside of Winn-Dixie, only two other chains _ A&AMP;P
in the Northeast and Finast in the Midwest _ use them.
</P>
<P>
   The system works like this: Groceries are placed one by one on a
glass-surfaced bar code reader that records the price. The customer
then drops them onto a conveyor belt, and each item passes through
a second gizmo _ a scanner that showers it with lasers. The laser
is designed to prevent a customer from scanning an item, then
replacing it with something more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   If the two scans don't match, the conveyor belt reverses
direction and returns the item to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   For veggies and fruit, the shopper places the items on the
scanner, which doubles as a scale, looks them up in a booklet next
to the price display screen and keys in the identification numbers.
The computer does the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie estimates that 30 percent of a store's customers will
use the lanes, but it won't give out a customer total. Generally,
customers with 10 items or less will try it, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking is that it's an express lane, but it's not. About
8 percent of our customers have 25 to 30 items,'' said Winn-Dixie
Retail System Supervisor Joe Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The system, made by Productivity Solutions of Jacksonville, has
at least one other safeguard against theft. The bar code scanner
turns off after each item is recorded and doesn't switch on again
until the item rolls through the laser scanner. Also, there still
are cashiers and baggers who will watch for shoplifters, as they do
now.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns said the company doesn't expect shoplifters to steal
items in the self-checkout area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't do it up front where there's more scrutiny,''
Burns said. ``They'd just as soon do it down aisle 15.''

 &HT;    ASA a good place to look for mechanic
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- One of the most frequently asked questions of people
in the auto industry -- and around the water cooler at work -- is:
``Where can I find a good mechanic?''
</P>
<P>
   The Automotive Service Association, or ASA, is a national
organization with members throughout the country and is a good
place to start. The organization has a code of ethics members are
expected to follow, and it offers benefits such as technical
training and other amenities to attract top-notch mechanics. It
performs a pre-employment check of prospective employees, which
helps weed out substandard mechanics, and encourages certification
of its members.
</P>
<P>
   It can be contacted on the Internet (http://www.asashop
</P>
<P>
   .org) or by phone at 1-800-ASASHOP (1-800-272-7467).
</P>
<P>
   Here is ASA's Code of Ethics:
</P>
<P>
   -- To perform high-quality repair service at a fair and just
price.
</P>
<P>
   -- To use only proven merchandise of high quality distributed by
reputable firms.
</P>
<P>
   -- To employ the best-skilled technicians obtainable.
</P>
<P>
   -- To furnish an itemized invoice for fairly priced parts and
services that clearly identifies any used or remanufactured parts.
Replaced parts may be inspected upon request.
</P>
<P>
   You deserve to know what you've paid for in clear, concise
terms. There are times when the cost of a new part is prohibitive,
especially with larger components such as starters and alternators,
so a good-quality remanufactured unit may be a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   About the only time that used parts are installed is when there
is no source of new or remanufactured ones (as in the case of an
older or exotic car). If you want the shop to save your old parts
for inspection, please tell them before they begin the work. It's a
lot easier than digging them out of the garbage. Don't expect to
keep any parts that have been replaced with remanufactured parts.
The supplier charges the shop a ``core charge'' if the failed part
is not returned for overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   -- To have a sense of personal obligation to each individual
customer.
</P>
<P>
   -- To promote goodwill between the motorist and members of this
association.
</P>
<P>
   -- To recommend corrective and maintenance services, explaining
to the customer which of these are required to correct existing
problems and which are for preventive maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrupulous and poorly trained mechanics will recommend repairs
that are unfounded and, in all honesty, there are times when even a
well-trained mechanic will make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers get peeved when they take their cars in for the
repair of one thing only to be presented with a list of unrelated
items that need attention. However, if the fan belt breaks or the
brakes start grinding a week later, we blame the same shop for that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   When I am servicing or repairing a car, I look around for other
potential trouble spots. This means looking at more than the car
came in for. I know the customer isn't going to crawl under the car
on a regular basis (if at all) and check things out. That's my job.
I would much rather give customers a list of potentially
troublesome situations than have them encounter a problem I saw but
failed tell them about.

 &HT;    Strike a threat to GMC launch of new pickup
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For years, the GMC truck brand has seemed to exist in
the shadow of its big brother, Chevrolet. Chevy trucks have played
well, while the GMC brand has just sort of hung around other GM
brand dealerships with seemingly little more purpose than to offer
the availability of a truck should such a customer stumble into an
Olds, Pontiac, Buick or Cadillac dealer.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a sad state of affairs because from its very
beginning, GMC has represented serious quality trucks. When I
purchased my first pickup back in 1973, there was the perception
that a GMC was ``more'' of a truck than a Chevy. There was a time
when the GMC brand actually carried heavier-gauge steel and offered
more horsepower and torque than the Chevrolet brand.
</P>
<P>
   It is potentially GMC's time to shine again. GM management has
decided GMC, now teamed with the Pontiac division, will represent
the ``premium'' GM truck brand and leave the work-truck duties to
Chevy. It makes sense when you consider GMC frequently co-exists in
dealerships with other GM premium brands.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 GMC Sierra will, for the first time in many years, have
many brand-specific features: hoods, fenders, bumpers, fascia and
headlamp assemblies. No longer will it be merely a rebadged Chevy.
The '99 Sierra also offers some nifty new features, starting with a
redesigned frame; improved fuel economy, horsepower and torque
ratings; and comfortable seating in an enlarged passenger area in
the extended-cab models.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra's one possible shortcoming is the lack of the fourth door
on the extended-cab edition. Both Ford and Dodge extended cabs
offer this feature.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of these vehicles is important to GMC and General
Motors, especially since the average sales transaction on these
vehicles carries a reported $7,000 profit to GM.
</P>
<P>
   But a labor dispute at the Flint, Mich., stamping plant -- where
those unique hood and fenders were to be stamped -- is a problem.
Over the Memorial Day weekend, management quietly moved the
stamping equipment to another location, perhaps anticipating the
strike. It was like drawing a line in the sand; the Flint workers
walked.
</P>
<P>
   Their strike is about more than just the stamping equipment. It
is a culmination of watching the exodus of automotive jobs from not
only Flint and the rest of Michigan but the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the dispute isn't resolved quickly, it also has the potential
of disrupting one of the biggest vehicle launches in recent GM
history.

 &HT;    Test Drive: Daewoo's sedan a new player from South Korea
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Comes now the 1998 Daewoo Leganza front-drive sedan,
wafting over from South Korea like some test balloon intended to
tell its launchers which way car sales are blowing and to locate
hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Leganza, a comfortable enough four-door with exterior lines
and trim vaguely reminiscent of Chrysler/General Motors cars, is
one of three models due here from Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-industrial firm, which reports its sales last year
totaled $68 billion, also plans to bring in a 1.6-liter-engined
Lanos coupe and sedan and a 2.0-liter-engined Nubira coupe and
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Prices aren't firm. Daewoo says the Leganza will range from
$15,000 to $20,000, while the smaller Nubira will be in the
$12,000-$14,000 range and the subcompact Lanos in the
$9,000-$12,000 range. It's difficult to imagine the fully equipped
test Leganza -- silver with a two-tone brown interior set off by
faux wood trim -- rolling out of a showroom for less than $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find a showroom, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's Los Angeles-based publicity firm says July will find
the cars in 14 major markets, although a site for the company-owned
showroom in Atlanta has not been announced. (Calls to Daewoo's
offices in Compton, Calif., were not returned.)
</P>
<P>
   The test vehicle made it obvious that pricing will be a vital
factor in the Leganza's acceptance or dismissal in the highly
competitive family sedan market. Positives include the power/luxury
features, a willingness to run stably with I-285 traffic and
reasonable fuel mileage (about 25 mpg combined). Negatives include
some awkward controls, including those for the high-end stereo, and
Daewoo's lack of a track record (It has helped build some General
Motors vehicles, including the Pontiac LeMans).
</P>
<P>
   The tester's appointments were fine, with quality cloth,
visually acceptable plastic, the expected amenities and some
convenience pluses: drink holders, storage spaces, plenty of vents,
big outside mirrors and a split fold-down rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine is rated at 131 horsepower,
and that seemed very realistic. The test Leganza's motor
occasionally required restarting if cold and sometimes seemed to
have a bad relationship with the four-speed automatic transmission,
resulting in some gear-hunting and unexpected kick-downs. It's not
a quiet power plant, but how many four-cylinders really are hushed?
</P>
<P>
   The ride was generally good, although the independent suspension
could be heard working on rough surfaces. Both the rack-and-pinion
steering and the power anti-lock disc brakes seemed suitable for
the North American market, meaning neither required much effort.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the Leganza probably will, however. Few of the curious

concluding, ``For that, I could get a ....'' So how well the

   270&AMP;ADD  HOUSE BEGINS DEBATE ON MAIN
BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL
 &HT;     By ANDREW MOLLISON 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Overcoming months of resistance from Republican
leaders, the House began Thursday to debate the main bipartisan
proposal for new campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Up to seven more weeks of debate on hundreds of amendments lie
ahead before a final vote in the House under a new schedule for a
final vote promised by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting that the process is beginning, though it's
also slightly intimidating that there are so many amendments
pending,'' said Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He and Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., co-sponsored the main bill,
which would close the legal loopholes that have allowed parties to
take unlimited gifts, known as ``soft money,'' from corporations,
unions and wealthy people.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, made a statement on
the House floor that most members interpreted as a pledge there
would be a vote on the final, amended version of a campaign-finance
bill before the legislators start their summer vacation, now
scheduled to begin Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proceedings on this bill in this House will be completed in
their entirety by the August recess,'' Armey said. The debate would
be squeezed in between consideration of appropriations and other
bills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven weeks from now, of course, it will be so late in the
session that it will be too late for the Senate to act,'' grumbled
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Armey's promise persuaded Shays and other GOP supporters of
the bipartisan bill to drop their threat to vote against new rules
that allow a record number of amendments during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The modified rules adopted Thursday by a vote of 221-189 state
that let members offer an unlimited number of amendments that are
germane, or related to campaign finance bills, and a record-setting
258 non-germane amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fulfills the promise made by the speaker for full and
fair consideration of campaign finance reform,'' said Rep. John
Linder, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is fooled by this attempt to drown the Shays-Meehan
bill with frivolous amendments,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at Meehan's suggestion, Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo.,
who acknowledged crafting ``several'' of the non-germane
amendments, said he believes that it would be better to simply
eliminate all contribution and spending limits but require faster
disclosure of all campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would ban all contributions to parties for
any purposes from corporate or union treasuries, and would limit
the amount that any individual could contribute in one year. Under
the current system, parties can accept as much as they want from
any source to fund activities that the parties assert do not
provide direct assistance to federal candidates.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHY TO HATE THE THUGS, AND HOW TO DISCOURAGE THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There are three good reasons for despising the thugs,
the mostly English thugs, who ran wild in Marseille the other day _
and who are lying in wait to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason to despise them is that they despise us. They
are sociopaths, not stupid, and they mean to attack the helpless,
throw society into chaos. They just happen to choose soccer for
their cover.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason to despise the thugs is that they are used as
an excuse to scorn soccer back in the United States. Apparently it
is easier for television news editors and newspaper headline
writers to document English criminals and racists than it is to
portray Nigerians running the fast break or Brazilians charming the
host country.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason to despise the thugs is that they jeopardize
the carnival mood of this World Cup. The organizers in Toulouse
have had to cancel their summer-solstice music festival Sunday
night because they fear the jackals waiting in the weeds for the
next England game Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What a shame, because the hosts have planned such nice parties.
The other day I went to Copacabana Beach in Nantes, the old city on
the Loire estuary, where hosts trucked in tons of sand so young
people could play beach soccer, so elegant women from Cameroon
could sell T-shirts and artwork, so Moroccan entrepreneurs could
sell Middle Eastern sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the main square, there was a motorcade of Moroccan fans
(men and women together), horns honking, flags waving, marching and
cheering, joined by Brazilians and Japanese and French and Scots
and Americans and Cameroonians, all linking arms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Marseille, they were cleaning up the mess from
their English visitors, who had gone into that hard southern port
city, looking to stir up trouble among the large Middle Eastern
community.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get this wrong. These marauders are not homeless or
jobless or marginal people. A number of studies have shown that
these are men from their teens into their 40s who work all week
while plotting military-style maneuvers, trapping and wounding
blacks or Pakistanis or Indians or Jews or women or some toff whose
face annoys them.
</P>
<P>
   I could make my guesses about the cause _ the monarchy, the
none-too-subtle divisions of accent and school and neighborhood and
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The louts are encouraged by the Murdochian tabloids, where
anything goes, with their headlines about ``treacherous Froggies,''
with the message that it is all right to go over there and bash
some heads.
</P>
<P>
   Any American knows we've got more than our share of malevolence
back home, but nobody has ever linked one sport with planned
violence. It is not the fault of the sport itself, obviously, but
the question is, can these people be identified and stopped?
</P>
<P>
   While Marseille was trembling, the English sent over a security
official who spoke excellent French and lectured on the Rights of
Man, on Liberte, Fraternite, Egalite. I almost expected him to
break out singing the Marseillaise.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, he was right. In the new European Community, people
can cross the old borders with fewer restrictions than the past,
the price for cheaper wine and cheese. After several decades of
death and violence around soccer games, English officials have
tried to limit the most notorious thugs from traveling, but it's
not working, or else the malaise is deeper than they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer officials cannot very well ban the English team from
major tournaments, although it was a stroke of luck having them
fail to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There is one immediate way the world soccer community might get
the attention of England, currently the favorite to hold the 2006
World Cup. It is time for the global referee to brandish a yellow
warning card at the rogue and say, ``You are booked, sir. Any
further infractions and you will be dispatched.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates for 2006 _ Germany, South Africa,
Australia. I say it's too soon to give the World Cup back to
Europe, and South Africa could be unstable after the Mandela era.
Australia is a good alternative, and the yobs could not just hop a
ferry or a train and be at the World Cup in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   The multinational sneaker companies might also consider their
wonderful images, and threaten to cut off sponsorships if the
English cannot control their own.
</P>
<P>
   Do I really think a yellow card would stop the marauders? No,
not really. But a red card would make the 2006 World Cup safer from
these thugs, to allow the Brazilians and the Moroccans and all the
other joyous fans to link arms and dance in the streets, the way
they do on Copacabana Beach in Nantes.

`LE CORSAIRE': BALLET WHOSE FINALE IS A ROUSING SHIPWRECK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world will come crashing down in a huge shipwreck
at approximately 10:30 Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera
House, where American Ballet Theater is performing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Ballet Theater has bowed to popular taste and
created a dance version of ``Titanic.'' Instead, it has resurrected
``Le Corsaire,'' a seldom-seen, three-act Russian ballet that ends
with the spectacular sinking of a ship. The company will perform
the ballet on Friday night for the first time, and then Saturday
afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet, based on a poem by Lord Byron, was first performed
in London in 1837. Since then, 12 other versions of ``Le Corsaire''
have been created in Europe and most recently in the United States,
in a production staged last year by Anna-Marie Holmes for the
Boston Ballet. Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of Ballet Theater,
saw the production and loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people only know `Le Corsaire' from the famous pas de
deux and have never seen a full production,'' McKenzie said,
referring to the glittering bravura gala number. He added: ``That's
a shame, because it's such a spirited, extravagant ballet that's so
much larger than life. It's the Errol Flynn movie of ballets. And
there are so many challenging roles to showcase the principal
dancers that each performance becomes a mini-gala for the
audience.'' The lure of the ballet has probably not been the plot,
a complicated story of pirates, pashas and slave girls with names
like Conrad, Lankendem and Medora, set in Turkish-ruled Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holmes, the Soviet-trained artistic director of the Boston
Ballet, had danced the pas de deux and was drawn to the three-act
work after seeing a videotape of Konstantin Sergeyev's 1992
production for the Bolshoi Ballet. The Sergeyev staging was itself
inspired by versions by Marius Petipa, whose ballets helped define
ballet classicism in Russia, in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Holmes acquired the sets and costumes from another Soviet
production, by Yuri Grigorovich, which she found stored in a
warehouse in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the production, she brought Vadim Disnitsky,
Sergeyev's assistant, to Boston, along with Natalya Dudinskaya, Ms.
Holmes' longtime mentor, a noted Soviet ballerina and the wife of
Sergeyev. Other Soviet dancers already in Boston _ Tatiana Legat,
Tatiana Terekhova and Sergei Berejnoi _ helped with the staging.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Kolpakova, a former Kirov Ballet star currently coaching
Ballet Theater dancers, helped with the Soviet style, which
emphasizes the line of the upper body more than American ballet
training does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Barbee, a very good, very logical actor, is helping
with the dramatic scenes,'' Ms. Holmes said. Barbee is a Ballet
Theater principal.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Holmes' first step in the restaging was to work with
company music directors on the score, which is by five composers.
Then came considerable editing and reassigning of dances and
dramatic bits to make the plot more plausible.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Holmes was worried about making changes. Ms.
Dudinskaya, who had learned the lead female role of the slave
Medora from Agrippina Vaganova, who in turn had learned it from
Petipa himself, was like a mother to her. ``I didn't dare,'' Ms.
Holmes said, laughing. ``But Kevin gave me the force to say let's
get the story better.'' The three-hour ballet has been cut by a
half-hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As far as Ms. Holmes is concerned, ``Le Corsaire'' has just
about everything: delicate solo dances for the women, powerhouse
dances for the men and Petipa's exquisite ``Jardin Anime,'' a group
dance in which flowers come alive, danced by a cast that includes
children from the School of American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Why is ``Le Corsaire'' so little known outside Russia?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think impresarios saw `The Sleeping Beauty' and `Swan Lake'
as being the big sellers,'' Ms. Holmes said, adding that she would
like next to restage Soviet productions like ``Laurencia'' and
``The Fountain of Bakhchisarai.'' But she has no doubt about the
appeal of ``Le Corsaire'' at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will knock your socks off,'' she said. ``And the dancers
are eating it up.''

`INDIAN HUMOR': ART THAT EXPRESSES A CLASH OF VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We don't serve Indians,'' a waitress said to two
Indians as they sat in a diner just outside their Mesquakie
settlement in Tama, Iowa. ``We don't want Indians,'' replied one of
them. ``We want cheeseburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   This story, which involves his father, is told by Duane Slick,
who is of Sauk-Fox ancestry. He is one of 38 artists whose work
appears in the wry and illuminating contemporary show ``Indian
Humor,'' at the National Museum of the American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Including the anecdote in a catalog statement about his art,
Slick sees the fast, funny cheeseburger zinger as the kind of
equalizer used by Indians to arm themselves against the put-downs
of white America.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the strongest theme of the show is the clash of
American Indian values with those of the contemporary world _
specifically the white world _ and the way Indians deal with being,
so to speak, low men on the totem pole in a country they still see
as a bastion of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   Every topic that touches on Indian-white contact is ripe for
gibes, from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to television to casinos
even.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which was organized by American Indian Contemporary
Arts, a nonprofit center in San Francisco, must certainly be a
first in the annals of Indian-white relationships. One of its
primary aims is to counter ``the popular notion that Indians are
stoic and serious,'' writes Janeen Antoine (Sicangu Lakota),
executive director of the San Francisco center, in the catalog
preface.
</P>
<P>
   A contribution directly assailing that notion is the cartoony
lithograph ``Lady in Waiting'' (1987) by Robert Freeman
(Dakota-Luiseno), who describes himself as a creator of ``Indian
babes,'' rather than ``typical Indian maidens.''
</P>
<P>
   In this work a voluptuous young thing wearing sunglasses, a
feather headdress, clunky ``Indian'' jewelry and not much else sits
before a tepee in whose suggestive opening can be glimpsed a large
television. Behind her, clumps of giant phallic cacti stretch back
to a string of idyllic blue mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Fake ``Indian'' tchotchkes, toys and nostalgia are satirized by
Joanna Osborn-Bigfeather (Cherokee-Mescalero Apache) in ``May I
Serve You? Cultural Artifacts'' (1994) and Bently Spang (Northern
Cheyenne) in ``The Beginning of the End for the End of the Trail''
(1994).
</P>
<P>
   Kay Walkingstick (Cherokee-Winnebago) has produced ``Talking
Leaves: You're an Indian?'' (1993), a book of comments made to her
over the years by whites. Next to a lively self-portrait in
pseudo-Indian dress, for instance, appears the remark: ``You're an
Indian? I thought you were a Jewish girl from Queens who changed
her name.''
</P>
<P>
   George Blake's (Hupa-Yurok) ``Hang Around the Fort Injun''
(1993) is an over-lifesize carving in painted redwood of a
long-haired brave smugly dressed in white man's clothes and a Stars
and Stripes necktie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang around the forters,'' Blake explains, were Indians who
ingratiated themselves with white officials sent to govern them,
headquartered in fortlike buildings on the reservation. Acting as
servants, scouts, Indian policemen and so forth, the hang-arounds
wound up working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also themes that are peculiarly Indian, like the
folk hero Coyote, a trickster who embodies the devilish side of
human nature. (Could he be the inspiration for the Wile E. Coyote
character in the ``Road Runner'' film animation series?) A
quintessential survivor who adopts many guises, Coyote looks out
for himself. He likes to play jokey pranks, but he is also a sly,
hard-biting dog.
</P>
<P>
   In Slick's work, ``Coyote Television Bookpiece'' (1994), Coyote
lurks in mock television screens and the pages of books, making
fleeting appearances to jeer at the distortions of Indian culture
by the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   In three paintings by Harry Fonseca (Maidu) done from 1987 to
1993, Coyote turns up as a vaudeville Uncle Sam, a hipster in a
black leather jacket and a saint surrounded by clouds and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jean LaMarr (Paiute-Pit River) portrays
Coyote as a woman, addressing the issue of male-female inequality
that is by no means confined to Indian communities. ``Ms. Coyote''
(1992), a leering coyote wall mask that wears an earring and a rose
on its head, goes so far as to suggest that women can be tricksters
on a par with men.
</P>
<P>
   In the artists' humor there is often the angst of seeing ancient
traditions eroded. Funny as it sounds, ``The Zen Electric Jingle
Dress Dancer: The Sound of One Jingle Jangling'' (1994), by Arthur
Amiotte (Oglala Sioux), is a gentle lament for the disappearance of
Indian craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In the painting, an Indian dancer is seen in a flashy ceremonial
costume bedizened with sequins and rickrack, wearing on her head a
sort of tennis cap adorned with tiny American flags. While he means
his painting to be amusing, Amiotte writes, ``It also represents
something of the shoddiness that has replaced the fine and
delicately wrought traditional techniques.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beadwork, as a symbol of ancient Indian traditions now degraded,
is very much part of the show. Take Marcus Amerman's (Choctaw)
``Iron Horse Jacket'' of 1993. On the back of a nail-studded black
leather motorcycle jacket, he has embroidered a kitschy rendition
of Brooke Shields, something of an innovation in that the tiny
beads, traditionally used in abstract patterning, here create a
realistic image. The presence of this sole white pop-culture figure
also suggests, in a roundabout way, the absence of Indians from the
mass media.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Larson Bread (Southern Blackfoot) uses her mastery of
beadwork to comment on the inroads of white culture. In ``Traveling
Through Indian Country'' (1994), she has beaded a white travel
pouch on the front with a design reflecting one-time Indian control
of a large piece of American geography. On the back, she uses clan
patches with Indian tribal symbols separated by lots of white space
to indicate the sparseness and separation of Indian communities
today.
</P>
<P>
   Like most group shows, ``Indian Humor'' is uneven, and it
contains material that is not altogether accessible if you're not
an Indian. But it has real punch and a refreshing absence of
polemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth remains that there hasn't been much to laugh about
in Indian country since contact'' (an Indianism for the historical
confrontation with white Europeans), writes the show's curator,
Jolene Rickard (Tuscarora) in the catalog. ``The irony is that it
almost seems an unnatural task to share a joke with the continually
colonizing `west.'''
</P>
<P>
   But by sharing these jokes, ``Indian Humor'' sets up a beguiling
approach to Indian attitudes and feelings, of which most other
Americans are sadly unaware. See it and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian Humor'' remains at the George Gustave Heye Center,
National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, New York,
through Aug. 2.

ART REVIEW: FROM WHITE PLASTER FIGURES TO WIDER THEMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By KEN JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mournful tableaux of white plaster figures fitted
into diners, subway cars or telephone booths produced by George
Segal in the 1960s earned him a permanent niche in the history of
Pop Art. But he was not content to confine his vision to that
genre, and in later years he tackled other worlds and bigger
themes.
</P>
<P>
   The retrospective of Segal's work now on view at the Jewish
Museum is determined to prove that he was more than just a Pop
artist; it presents him as a humanist able to address difficult
historical topics or deep religious themes. He also appears as a
playful traditionalist doing variations on Cezanne or Cubism and,
in a series of late portrait drawings, as a follower of Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 42 works on view, only three or four are in the style for
which Segal is best known. But the problem is that those remain his
most convincing works. The original show, organized by Marco
Livingstone for the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, had 71 works;
this was whittled down to fit the tighter confines of the Jewish
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Segal, who was born in 1924, was in his late 30s when, in 1961,
he discovered the possibilities of casting human bodies in plaster.
Before that, he had been a brushy, figurative painter mixing
influences from Matisse and Abstract Expressionism, and he had made
some roughly modeled plaster figures that he posed in front of his
paintings. At the same time, he was working in New Jersey as a
chicken farmer and later as a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Segal realized he didn't have to make everything
with his own hands but could work as an assemblagist, arranging
things he had found into theatrical situations. Other artists,
including Robert Rauschenberg, Edward Kienholz and Segal's friend
Allan Kaprow, who staged his first Happening at Segal's farm, were
already moving in this direction. In Segal's case, it was a
breakthrough and was what made his figures so striking.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed from thin plaster shells made by applying medical
plaster-impregnated bandages to real people, the figures are more
like found objects than expressive representations. And when
they're placed in settings built from real-world materials, the
effect is uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Diner'' (1964-66), a man sitting at the counter of a
low-rent restaurant and a dumpy waitress pouring coffee appear
frozen in some existential twilight zone. In ``Cinema'' (1963), a
man putting up letters on an illuminated movie marquee is bathed in
mystic radiance.
</P>
<P>
   There's a resonant ambiguity about these figures. They're blank
but emotionally fraught, specific but anonymous, ordinary but
strange. And there's a melancholy romance in these scenes that
calls to mind the paintings of Edward Hopper.
</P>
<P>
   But ambiguity is lost when Segal tackles more specific themes.
In ``The Holocaust'' (1982), a memorial commissioned by the City of
San Francisco, a lone concentration camp inmate looks out at the
viewer between the strands of a real barbed-wire fence; behind him
lies a pile of plaster corpses. Here you have a one-dimensional
illustration, a composite of the most common cliches of Holocaust
imagery.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Depression Bread Line'' (1991), commissioned for the new
memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, the haunted, glum
look of waiting men in overcoats and fedoras, all painted gray,
makes an all too literal point. Like Segal's retelling of a
biblical story, ``Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael'' (1987), it looks
like a waxworks display.
</P>
<P>
   Segal's sculptural portraits, like a full-figure cast of his
dealer Sidney Janis (1967), posed looking at a simulated Mondrian
on a wooden easel, are problematic in another way. The technique
doesn't allow nuanced responses to personality, and the sculptures
look like what they are: inert shells of real people.
</P>
<P>
   As for Segal's play with still lifes and Cubism, or his late
portrait drawings, it's enough to say that he is most compelling
when he deals with the human figure in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Of late works in this exhibition, only ``Woman Sitting on a
Bed'' (1993) shows Segal to full advantage. On a rumpled bed in a
dark, claustrophobic room, a naked middle-aged woman sits with her
back to us under a stark overhead light. Everything is painted
black, which may be overdoing it, but as an evocation of the
shadowy, depressive side of the American experience and a
meditation on death, it exerts a grim poetic mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Segal, a Retrospective: Sculptures, Paintings,
Drawings'' is at the Jewish Museum, Fifth Avenue at 92nd Street,
through Oct. 4. The exhibition will then go to the Miami Art
Museum, where it will remain from Dec. 17 through March 7, 1999. &QL;

`ARSILDA, REGINA DI PONTO': RARE VIVALDI 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Music has had little trouble keeping Vivaldi's
instrumental works alive. ``The Seasons,'' deserving better, has
become the stuff of elevators. The other concertos, and they number
in the hundreds, ring with energy and dramatic turns of phrase,
though admittedly it is sometimes easy to mistake one for another.
The cogniscenti of this particular generation tend to mock Vivaldi,
but he will survive them as he has their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The operas breathe less easily, for saving them means saving
their librettos, and Italian theatrical values of the late Baroque
are not good time travelers. The Little Orchestra Society under
Dino Anagnost restored ``Arsilda, Regina di Ponto'' to the public
on Wednesday night at Alice Tully Hall in what it thinks may be the
first performance since 1716. Welcomed in the Venetian press of the
time, it has at any rate left no trace of subsequent revivals.
</P>
<P>
   Camp is not the desired solution for producers of period pieces
like this, but Anagnost and his forces did not have much choice.
The plot is a tangle of regal figures, assumed names and mistaken
identities, and so overblown seem the sentiments to our ears today
that modernizing this piece for late-20th-century palates would
probably mean junking everything except Vivaldi's music. This might
not be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   The self-mocking approach is applied with an appropriately light
touch. Lynn Redgrave's narration between numbers is the principle
device, but there were discreet bits of business throughout the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lavish application of the opera-in-concert format. The
singers often added a crown or a kingly robe to standard evening
dress. Strewn around the stage were columns, garden statuary and
urns sprouting greenery. Flowers were everywhere. The seven singers
reclined in period armchairs when not at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arsilda'' includes dramatic and pictorial music used to good
effect, and for those who know only the concertos, the vocal music
underlines the singing qualities of Vivaldi's instrumental writing.
There is less of the composer's otherwise extraordinary sense of
adventure here. We are given a few choruses and no vocal ensembles,
instead a parade of da capo arias tied together with minimal
recitative and, in this production, by Ms. Redgrave's helpful
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   An audience that literally filled Tully Hall seemed happy to sit
for three hours, and there were some good singers for it to hear.
As Lisea, Julia Anne Wolf's muted mezzo-soprano was a steadying
influence. Rockland Osgood (Tamese) was an attractive tenor. As
Barzane, Robert Crowe's countertenor bravely attacked Vivaldi's
high-flying music, suffering only one near meltdown. As Miranda,
Theresa Cincione's soprano worked well at times but was unsuited
for the part's upper-range adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Rabiner, also a mezzo-soprano, took the title role with
great emphasis and sureness. Stephen Bryant was the strong, solid
Cisardo. I especially liked the evening's Nicandro, Julie Newell, a
soprano whose sustained musicality and sureness with florid
figuration sounded as good as any singing of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Anagnost conducts Vivaldi with a relaxed musicality. No flashy
tempos, not much emphasis on spit-and-polish exactitude but rather
an atmosphere of roominess and leisure. The small orchestra of
assorted modern strings and brass also used recorders and
harpsichord. The Metropolitan Singers and the Greek Choral Society
were a little frayed and blowsy but they got by.

`THE X-FILES': IN THE DARK, IT RESEMBLES A CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct reference to Ms. Anderson and spelling of
glamour in 20th graf. No pickup.)  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists, consider this: What if the hush-hush
atmosphere and Internet mania surrounding the first ``X-Files''
feature film were part of a giant plot to hide the uneventfulness
of one more summertime sci-fi fizzle? It's as possible as much of
what ``The X-Files: Fight the Future'' has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   If devotees of the television series come to the film with
enough baggage for a six-week safari, perhaps they can deepen the
experience of watching a middling, unfocused action-adventure with
brand-name appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch: this film isn't tailor-made for true
X-fanatics, because the material has been so broadened to
accommodate the uninitiated. Trust no one who dreams up an action
sequence in Antarctica for the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   No, no and you must be joking. Those are the answers to the
first three questions that the prospect of an ``X-Files'' movie
raises: Do Scully and Mulder get extracurricular while hunting
extraterrestrials? Do they solve all the series' outstanding
mysteries? Will there be a sequel?
</P>
<P>
   The movie teasingly offers the prospect of big developments in
the television X-plot, but all it really does is create a vague
omnibus format for future movie spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That may make it a crossover hit quicker than you can say
Trekkie, but a lot of the show's otherworldly intensity has been
lost in the process. Also, ``The Truman Show'' built a better
mousetrap when it comes to paranoid fantasies this season.
</P>
<P>
   The captivating hold of ``The X-Files'' may itself be more
fascinating than the material anyhow. Reams may be e-mailed about
this film's tiniest nuances, but tiny they remain. (This week's
Newsweek notes that Scully's crucifix is ``a small gold pendant
symbolizing her faith in God.'')
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the movie may raise more questions than it meant to
when it offers glimpses of alien troublemakers. Reaching for
run-of-the-mill grisly horror, it winds up attributing
sophisticated global-domination plans to vicious, long-clawed
spacelings who are more prone to screams than schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Without making much connection with the end-of-season television
cliffhanger, the film starts off in Ice Age Texas, where aliens
lurk in wait for Early Man. Thirty-seven thousand years later,
Texas has heated up, but the aliens' modus operandi hasn't much
changed.
</P>
<P>
   A nicely diabolical early scene shows a little boy savaged by
the invasive virus nicknamed the black oil. Typically, as it works
to cover too many bases, the film mentions the virus again but
never follows through on one of its best special-effects tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's off to Dallas, where FBI agents Mulder (David
Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) trade affectionate
wisecracks atop a Dallas office building. The X-file investigation
into alien activity is now officially closed (as if!), so they have
been newly assigned to antiterrorist vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   They spot the bomb, but it goes off anyway, shearing off half of
a government building. That allusion to Oklahoma City could have
been the film's most shameless or daring aspect, but proves to be
neither.
</P>
<P>
   The film avoids real political conspiracies in favor of a
pie-in-the-sky thesis that the building was destroyed to hide
evidence of alien activity, and that aliens have subverted the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's also jokey enough to wink at this notion, make fun
of the stars' somber manner ``Y'alllook like door-to-door
salesmen''), recall that Mulder is nicknamed Spooky and let him
happen to urinate on an ``Independence Day'' poster in a dark
alley.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Chris Carter, the heart of ``The X-Files,'' from a
story he wrote with Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Rob Bowman, who
has done many episodes of the series, the new film strains to
involve as many familiar elements as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So a number of series fixtures (like the trio called the Lone
Gunmen) make minor appearances, while Martin Landau, Blythe Danner
and Armin Mueller-Stahl establish new characters. (Mueller-Stahl's
German mastermind, advocating the strangest of appeasement
policies, is the most intriguing of these.)
</P>
<P>
   Bees and cornstalks figure peculiarly in the story. The movie
also appropriates a bit of ``Alien'' for its ideas about
space-monster propagation. And thank a product tie-in for
automobiles for the specious scene that shows off a car.
</P>
<P>
   But the touch of X-iness that will matter most to both diehards
and neophytes is the film's promise of heightened conspiratorial
activity between Scully and Mulder. And here's where it does the
most mischievous teasing, since the story's big Antarctic spectacle
still seems warmer than the not-quite-love-affair.
</P>
<P>
   The film contrives a fairly strangled declaration of fondness
from Mulder, a near-clinch and a wild idea of how to get a heroine
out of her clothes. This last episode, unfolding in a huge set that
resembles a giant carburetor, doesn't actually glimpse Scully in
the nude or goad Mulder into anything more daring than a Sir Walter
Raleigh imitation. But as on-the-job rescue efforts go, it does
qualify as a fetishist's delight.
</P>
<P>
   Though both stars are sometimes eclipsed when the film strains
for action episodes, Duchovny sustains enough cool, deadpan
intellect and suppressed passion to give the story a center. Ms.
Anderson has the harsher, more restrictive role, but she plays it
with familiar hardboiled glamour.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors are more at ease with either bantering dialogue
or X-ish hyperbole (``like nothing we've ever seen before!'') than
with the screenplay's more fulsome touches.
</P>
<P>
   Like the title phrase, which comes from this exchange: ``What
has he seen? Of the whole he has seen but pieces.'' ``He is but one
man. One man cannot fight ... the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files: Fight the Future'' is rated PG-13 (Parents
strongly cautioned). It includes profanity, grisly corpses, ugly
violence and the suggestion of nudity.
</P>

METEORITES ALREADY PELTING EARTH _ CONSTANTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If Hollywood's current fascination with menacing
meteorites has you hunkered down waiting for the big one to hit, we
have news for you: We're already being bombarded. Every day. By
billions of meteorite fragments tiny enough to be invisible to the
naked eye but numerous enough to add something like 910 metric tons
each year to the weight of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the meteoritic matter that hits Earth is
microscopic in size. But it's only a matter of time, of course,
before something big _ say, the size of your average dining-room
table _ survives its fiery journey through Earth's atmosphere and
crashes into our planet.
</P>
<P>
   Check your neighborhood multiplex for details. In May a team of
heroic astronauts barely averted a collision between Earth and a
comet in ``Deep Impact.'' In the next couple of weeks another team
of astronauts will pull off a nearly identical feat in
``Armageddon'' _ except that will involve an asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   Just how often Earth has been walloped by meteorites or other
space objects is hard to say. But the evidence for, and scientific
belief in, such collisions seems to be mounting, according to
Wakefield Dort. He's a University of Kansas geology professor who
officially studies erosion and other ``surface processes,'' but
would much rather hunt for impact craters and other evidence of
meteorite strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, Dort said, ``world-famous geologists ... became
frothing at the mouth when the suggestion was made that an
extraterrestrial body could hit the Earth. As recently as the 1940s
there was violent debate about whether these holes were from
meteorites or volcanoes or gas bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meteorite theory gained credence, researchers began to
compile an occasional list of ``accepted impact craters.'' Twenty
years ago five or 10 holes were on the list, Dort said. Today there
are about 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``With satellite images they're finding a few a year, in very
remote places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foremost examples in the United States is the
so-called Meteor Crater in Arizona, which measures about 4,150 feet
across and 570 feet deep. There also are some fine specimens in
northern Ontario, according to Dort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meteorites have of course struck Kansas. But they were very
small and disappeared through regular use. You have to get a big
one for it to last, or a young one, for it to be visible on the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   (At least one record-holding meteorite did survive its trip to a
Kansas farm _ see accompanying story.)
</P>
<P>
   Craters are difficult to identify on Earth, as compared to the
moon, Dort said, because of foliage or other features covering the
surface. In addition, he said, many craters have been partly or
completed eroded away or filled in through human activities and
normal geological processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the ones that are buried, probably a very low percentage of
them have been identified,'' he said. And those have been found
through some serendipitous means. A couple of craters in Iowa and
Oklahoma were discovered in the course of drilling for oil,
according to Dort.
</P>
<P>
   He and a couple of his KU colleagues think they have found an
impact crater to call their own in central Nebraska. It's about 1
mile across, 70 feet deep and ``looks like no other feature in the
Plains area.'' However, they haven't persuaded NASA to provide a
grant to support their research, nor have they convinced other
scientists of their find, Dort said. However, they plan to gather
more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorites also generate plenty of interest and have become
collectors' items. One type contains a combination of many
different elements. The other type is made largely of iron, with a
pinch of nickel thrown in. Most meteorites, but not all, contain
some iridium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are quite expensive because there are not many of them,''
Dort said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest meteorite ever found in the United States is the
Willamette Meteorite, which is 118 inches long, weighs 14 metric
tons and is deeply pitted and scarred on one side. It was found in
Oregon's Willamette Valley in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorites ``can range in size, about as small as the tip of a
finger, or as big as this table. Nothing bigger than that has
survived passage through the atmosphere,'' Dort said.
</P>
<P>
   They generally are errant bits of asteroids or comets and are
pulled out of their orbit by the gravitational force of a nearby
planet, toward which they eventually hurtle.
</P>
<P>
   When it meets Earth's dense atmosphere, a meteorite, traveling
at perhaps 20 or 30 miles per second, encounters a lot of friction,
which causes it to heat up, melt and break into pieces, Dort said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a meteorite will explode upon hitting Earth's
atmosphere. The resulting shards, as well as the force of such an
explosion close to Earth's surface, can create a large hole in the
Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   But really, what are the odds of such a catastrophe in the
lifetime of anyone now living?
</P>
<P>
   Dort thinks that we must scan the skies for objects headed our
way and that we should work on developing a system for intercepting
anything deemed to be on a collision course.

   ``There is no sense of urgency, which is perhaps reasonable.
It's not urgent, but it takes time to understand what's going on in
space.''

ONE FINAL CHORE FOR DAD: CLEANING OUT A BUREAU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MELANIE GRAY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: There we stood. The two of us. Strangers. In a
strangely familiar place. Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well get started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   My sister looked at me. I looked at my sister. I looked at
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout the bureau?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   I walked over and pulled out a top drawer. The old blond dresser
had been in the dining room for as long as I can remember _ and
I'll be 38 this fall. So ... maybe 30 years? 32?
</P>
<P>
   Inside were hundreds and hundreds of ballpoint pens.
``Compliments of First National Bank of York.'' ``Brannen's
Radiator Repair. Don't Let a Drip Spoil Your Trip.'' ``Air
Products.''
</P>
<P>
   I clicked one on and scribbled on a scratch pad. No ink. Nothing
but that horrible sound of dry tip against dry paper. And a maze of
colorless ruts. I clicked on another. Nothing. And another. And
another.
</P>
<P>
   My sister laughed. I did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   I picked out a couple of pocketknives and three compasses. Then
I turned the whole drawer upside-down in the trash bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   The stuff in this one wasn't so worthless. A black-and-white
graduation picture of our cousin Jeanne from 1965. My third-grade
class picture. A VFW medallion. A miniature American flag. Lots
more pictures. Old pictures.
</P>
<P>
   She carefully sorts what I pull out. One box for the personal
things. Another for stuff that can go to Goodwill or some other
place like that.
</P>
<P>
   The third drawer goes faster. We're getting down a system here.
I pull, she sorts. She always has been the patient one, the
organized one.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time we're silent. And there's no background noise.
No radio. No TV.
</P>
<P>
   At first I feel funny. Uncomfortable. Pretty soon, though, I get
caught up in the pulling. She doesn't say how she feels _ and I
don't ask because I'm afraid to. I don't want to know. Not yet at
least. Anyway, she's probably caught up in sorting like I am in
pulling.
</P>
<P>
   Drawer four. More junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toss it.''
</P>
<P>
   I do. Five, six, seven, eight.
</P>
<P>
   An hour and a half has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how fast this is going.'' I sound almost
giddy.
</P>
<P>
   She's not mean about it, but she sets me straight. Like when we
were kids. The older one telling the younger one exactly how it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but we've still got the bedrooms, the living room, the
basement. And don't forget the attic.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right, of course. We have only just started. We have the
whole rest of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right.''
</P>
<P>
   She must hear how stupid I feel. Or feel tense like I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, though. We have made a lot of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   For some odd, silly little reason, I feel so much better after
she says that. But my feeling better doesn't have anything to do
with the cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   She must know that, too.
</P>
<P>
   I head for the old blond dresser's mate across the room. I pull
out a top drawer _ and she starts sorting.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Gray is an editor at The Star. Her sister, Sandra
Osentowski, lives in their hometown of York, Neb. Their father,
Raymond Gray, died Oct. 28, 1997, and it took the Gray ``girls''
about three months to clean out the family home of 50 years. In May
a young man from Minnesota rented the house. They hope he finds it
as snug and comfortable as they did. These days the sisters talk _
at length _ almost every day.

LYONDELL TO BUY ARCO CHEMICAL FOR $5.6 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas, Alaska)   (bl)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lyondell Petrochemical Co. agreed Thursday to buy ARCO Chemical
Co. from the Atlantic Richfield Company for $5.6 billion in cash, a
deal that would triple Lyondell's size and make it a major provider
of chemicals used in everyday products such as plastics, detergents
and paints.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement effectively reunites ARCO Chemical with Lyondell,
itself a former Atlantic Richfield subsidiary. Lyondell will pay
$57.75 a share for the outstanding shares of ARCO Chemical, which
is 82.2 percent owned by Atlantic Richfield.
</P>
<P>
   Lyondell will also assume $870 million of ARCO Chemical's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was not a surprise since Atlantic Richfield, a major
oil company based in Los Angeles, has been reducing its chemical
business as part of a broader strategy to focus on oil exploration
and production.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield chairman and chief executive Mike Bowlin said
Thursday that it was more attractive to sell the whole stake in
that business. He said the money would be used to reduce debt
incurred from the acquisition of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, an
independent oil company, which Atlantic Richfield agreed to buy
last month for $2.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield has also begun an aggressive exploration
drive overseas to find new reserves of oil, since production at its
huge oil fields in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, has been falling.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin has set a goal of increasing crude oil production by
about 5 percent annually over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The ARCO Chemical deal is the latest in a series of asset sales
by Atlantic Richfield. Last September the oil company sold the
remainder of its stake in Lyondell, and reached a deal to sell its
coal business to a New York investment firm last February.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ARCO Chemical surged on word of an impending deal,
first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. ARCO Chemical
finished at $57.0625 a share, up $6.50, or 12.9 percent. Lyondell
rose $1.25, to $29, while Atlantic Richfield fell $1.625, to
$78.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Lyondell, based in Houston, had sales of $2.3 billion last year.
It makes basic chemicals such as ethylene and propylene, which are
used in a wide variety of consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Lyondell president and chief executive officer Dan Smith said
the acquisition ``is a major step in our strategy to grow and
diversify Lyondell's earnings base.''
</P>
<P>
   ARCO Chemical, based in Newton Square, Pa., had sales of $4
billion last year. It is a major producer of propylene oxide, used
to make a range of products such as coolants, paints and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mitsch, an analyst of the chemical industry for Deutsche
Bank Securities, said the acquisition reflected shrewd timing by
Smith, since prices for chemical assets have been in a cyclical
decline and were likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The investment bank advising Lyondell was J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Lyondell has been seeking to cut costs and improve earnings by
entering into joint ventures with other chemical makers. In one
such venture last March, Lyondell joined Millennium Chemicals Inc.
to buy the petrochemical business from Occidental Petroleum Corp.
for $425 million.

FORMER WAL-MART EXECUTIVE TO LEAD PAYLESS CASHWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Payless Cashways Inc. has hired Millard
Barron, a former high-ranking Wal-Mart executive, as its new
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Barron joins the struggling Kansas City-based buildings supply
retailer seven months after it emerged from a fast-track Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The news Wednesday comes one day after Payless announced its
first positive quarter in a year and a half. It reported
second-quarter net income of $732,000, compared with a loss of
$13.2 million in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Barron takes over the positions once held by David Stanley,
former chief executive officer, and Susan Stanton, former
president. Stanley and Stanton left Payless in January shortly
after a new board was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Donald E. Roller, who has been acting chief executive officer
and president, will stay on as a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Barron most recently was head of Zellers, the
general-merchandise discount retail chain owned by Hudson's Bay Co.
of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Zellers lured Barron away from Wal-Mart, where he was senior
vice president and chief operating officer of Wal-Mart
International and where he played a major role in Wal-Mart's
aggressive expansion into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wal-Mart entered Canada in 1994, Zellers accounted for 70
percent of Hudson's Bay profits. By this spring, it had dropped to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem at Zellers was a poor
inventory-management system, analyst William Chisholm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he came in at a tough time in Canadian retailing,''
Chisholm said.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm said a lot of turnaround programs that Barron initiated
never were implemented, partly because of new management at
Hudson's Bay, including the appointment of Bill Fields, another
former top Wal-Mart executive, as president and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was Mr. Barron's failure to execute those programs
or if it was because of a change in senior management who wanted to
put a halt on things, I don't know,'' Chisholm said. ``I think a
bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Barron left Zellers earlier this year because he
and his family wanted to return to the United States, Payless
spokeswoman Linda Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Before working in Wal-Mart's international division, Barron was
a vice president of operations for Wal-Mart's U.S. stores. Barron
joined Wal-Mart after working 20 years at Hills Department Stores
Inc. in Massachusetts, where he rose to executive vice president of
store operations.

AN URGE TO LEAVE ALL THE FAULTY DOORKNOBS BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: ``We have to sell the house,'' I told my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened?'' she wanted to know. ``Did you go to the
casino? Have you been fired, or what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't live here anymore, that's all. We have to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You said that. I want a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The doorknobs,'' I whined. ``They come off in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it _ the whole thing? The doorknobs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enough,'' I said. ``You go in a room, and the knob comes
off. There you are, standing there holding it, and you never know
if you'll be able to get out again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But didn't we pay a man to fix them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter. They still come off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not all. But the ones that don't come off you have to
fiddle with to make the door latch at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't get so worked up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's worked up? Listen, I spent my whole boyhood in a modest
little bungalow. There was a big depression. Times were hard. There
wasn't any extra money. But at least the knobs stayed on the
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father probably kept them working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a chance!'' I said. ``He was a fine man, but he was not
gifted with his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's genetic then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that supposed to mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing. I'm sure you could fix those knobs if you wanted
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``If I wanted to. And if I had the tools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a screwdriver once.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, but it's gotten away somewhere. And what's the use,
anyway? Fix the doorknobs, and the faucet washers go. Replace
those, and light bulbs burn out. It's endless,'' I declared. ``The
place is just wearing out and running down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we pack up and move,'' she said, ``what if I just call
another man to try to fix the knobs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And change the washers? And replace the bulbs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' she said. ``It's worth a try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right. We can have one more crack at it. But if the knobs
still aren't right, we're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To where?'' she said. ``Maybe the country. We could have a
barn with a hundred cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And since nobody in the country locks the house, we could
leave the doors open, and knobs wouldn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could have a workshop. You could get power tools and
take up crafts. You might even overcome your handicap about working
with your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   I said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, you don't look excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not especially,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what did you have in mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, I was thinking more along the lines of
a nice motel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come out of your office,'' she said, ``and we'll have lunch
and talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem,'' I told her. ``I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   This room where I work has a door with glass panes, and she
looked through the glass at the knob I was holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' she said. ``Then I'll see what I can slide under
the door.''

COLIN MONTGOMERIE: `QUITE GOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Colin Montgomerie explains why he's been a
runner-up in many recent golf tournaments: ``Well,'' he said. ``I
am quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly one way to look at it and that other three-time
U.S. Open groomsman, Tom Lehman, who has been no worse than tied
for the lead after the first three rounds of the last three Opens,
yet failed to even equal par on the final Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs are the voices of near-winning-experience at this 98th
U.S. Open, which opened Thursday on the Olympic Club's Lake Course.
And, in a game where the mind can be the enemy, both golfers have
spun sad moments into positive memories.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't lose the Open, they'd tell you: They nearly won it,
and came away with nothing less than the power to win it this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been tormented by it, ever,'' Lehman said. ``They
are good memories. There are not many people who have a chance to
play in the last group of a U.S. Open, much less three years in a
row. And not many guys go to the 72nd hole with a chance to win,
ever, much less two straight years. I think my memories have been
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, 34, has been the favorite of the media to win here,
perhaps because he sounded eerily like Mark O'Meara did on the eve
of his first majors victory, the 1998 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I had to get over it within hours or days or months or
whatever, I will always take good memories from coming close to
winning major championships, I think,'' Montgomerie said. ``And I
am very proud of what I have achieved not only in major
championships but other tournaments as well. ... If I never make a
cut again or never hit a golf ball again, I will always have had a
successful career. That is what I am looking back at now, instead
of worrying about not having won a major.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was crying behind the 18th green last year after Ernie
Els made par to beat him by a stroke. Just a hole earlier,
Montgomerie stood over a 5-foot birdie putt that would have tied
him for the lead. He stood and stood, waiting for the rowdy
Americans at Congressional Country Club in Maryland to hush. And
then he missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting me down now, this majors business,'' he said
then, after his emotions subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says, ``This major bug that people talk about _ and thank
you for bringing it up again _ is a problem that I am coping with
better than I did before. The more success I have around the world
limits the (emphasis on) lack of a major success.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie's recent successes include finishing in the top 10
in three of his five PGA Tour events this year and all five of his
European Tour events, which helps explain his confidence in his
game and his chances here.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, 38, has been having a different kind of year. He's
finished in the top 10 in only three of his 14 events and won none,
but was buoyed (also soaked) by a third-place finish at wet
Westchester last weekend.
</P>

   Unlike Montgomerie, he has won a major _ the British Open in
1996 _ so he comes saddled with a lighter load of ``best player who
never won a (fill-in-the-blank)'' labels despite his Open
near-misses.

   ``I think I know what it is that got me into contention, and so
I feel like that is something that I can just try to repeat, and
that if I'm playing well, staying patient _ like I have been the
last three, four years _ then I will probably be in contention
again,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, like Montgomerie, trailed Els by a shot at the 17th tee
last year. But he followed a perfect drive by splashing a 7-iron
into a water hazard, and wound up finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman lived. Lehman learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you kind of get to the end, you feel like you have a
chance to win, (you get) a little too aggressive, trying to force
it,'' he said. ``Instead (you should be) trying to keep on hitting
conservatively, good shots, and letting somebody else make the
mistakes. So I think if I can get in that situation again this
year, I am just going to be looking toward more the middle of the
greens.''

CHINA SPELLS OUT RULES ON NEW NATIONAL HOUSING POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (also see CHINA-MIDDLECLASS) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government has formally spelled out its
radical new housing policy, under which the hallowed right of
workers to virtually cost-free apartments will be ended this year.
Under the new guidelines, detailed this week in the state-run news
media, most of China's urban residents will be required either to
buy their homes or pay much higher rents.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale change in housing is widely seen as potentially
one of the most far-reaching of China's economic reforms, one that
can spur entire new service industries, like home repair and
decoration and mortgage banking, as well as create a growing class
of independent homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important reform in China today is housing reform,''
said Yukon Huang, chief of the World Bank mission here, in an
interview. Until recently, factories, schools, government agencies
and other state work places have provided housing for their
employees, charging rents of only a few dollars a month but
exerting tremendous control over their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidy of housing and other social welfare benefits has
been a crushing burden on companies here, Huang said, and must be
ended if Chinese enterprises are to compete globally.
</P>
<P>
   A freer housing market will also promote the development of
private enterprise and labor mobility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new housing policy will be highlighted during President
Clinton's visit to China, which starts next week, with a visit to
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, the shift toward private home-ownership had
already begun in the last few years. Some work units began selling
apartments to workers, and stopped allocating housing to new
employees. Another factor has been the gradual spread of private
companies and foreign joint ventures, which provide far fewer
social benefits like housing to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last March, in his first statement as prime minister, Zhu
Rongji declared that the longstanding system of subsidized housing
would quickly be ended altogether.
</P>
<P>
   City governments and work units began hashing out rules for the
transition, including purchase prices and restraints on resale and
rental.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week, at a closed three-day conference of public officials,
national guidelines for the change were spelled out, but provinces
and local governments were given leeway in the timing and specific
rules, according to reports Thursday in the state-run press.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the government is pushing banks to offer
home mortgages, a novel concept here. Rents, for those who do not
buy, will multiply by several times, but subsidies will still be
given to those with the lowest incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In general, purchase prices are being set at what might appear
to be bargain levels _ $10,000 may be typical for a two-bedroom
apartment in Beijing _ with deductions according to length of
service in state agencies or companies, and the age of the
dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   But with many urban families earning only a few thousand dollars
a year, if that, the prices are still a strain and since March,
housing questions have preoccupied many.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seem enthusiastic about the idea of home ownership,
and many have been scrambling to pull together down payments of
perhaps 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the relative financial merits of the offered choices have
often seemed confusing, and people are rightly worried about future
maintenance costs in poorly constructed buildings. In Beijing, an
initial deadline of July 1 for commitments to purchase at
subsidized prices had to be postponed until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Rao Jianhong, 32, and his wife, Li Juan, 31, both assistant
professors at Beijing Business College and parents of a 4-year-old
girl, said they were delighted to have the chance to buy their
two-bedroom apartment for just over $10,000. With their extra
income from teaching night classes, Rao said, they would just be
able to make their mortgage payments of $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new system will give people more freedom of choice,'' Rao
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once they own or have rental rights to their apartments,
independently of their workplace, people will be more free to seek
different jobs, work in private industry or move, for example.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Debate continues in some work units over who should be able to
buy or rent newer apartments, and whether resales should eventually
be opened to any customers. Work-unit housing is often clustered
around the company or even inside the work unit's walled compound.
</P>
<P>
   Shao Yamin, a retired worker from the China International Book
Trading Corporation, has already decided not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I have been saving all our lifetime for our old
age, and we don't want to spend all our savings on the house,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife now pay rent of $8.50 a month. They live on
combined pensions of $182 a month, and worry about how high their
rent may go.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new policy is a giant step toward a free market,
rules commonly dictate across-the-board sale prices with little
regard for any market, and impose restrictions, such as five-year
moratoriums, on the resale or legal subletting of units.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions will undercut the broader benefits of the new
policy, said Huang of the World Bank. But he predicted that
impatient purchasers will prove a strong force.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people own their own houses, we can expect
overwhelming pressure on the government to allow them to more
quickly sell and rent,'' he said.

MEETINGS BRING OUT THE KID IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A disclaimer: Generalizations and stereotypes
follow. You've been warned.
</P>
<P>
   I spent a day last week at a management training seminar in
which a communication expert talked about all the reasons why men
are from Mars and women are from Venus. Or is it the other way
around?
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't the guy who wrote that book _ which, by the way, I
heaved across my bedroom floor in frustration at the apparently
intractable gender differences.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was another ``he said vs. she said''
author//researcher, who said the brains of men and women appear to
be hard-wired differently to begin with. Then we spend our
formative years playing different kinds of games that push us
further apart.
</P>
<P>
   Then we go to work. And _ surprise, surprise _ the two genders
might as well be speaking separate languages, we hear each other so
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Take meetings. All the former little boys _ who grew up
practicing team sports so they had all their strategies in place
before the game _ wouldn't dream of going into meetings without
their teammates aligned and the agenda set.
</P>
<P>
   The former little girls _ who grew up playing house and putting
clothes on dolls and taking them off again just for the pleasure of
the process _ think a meeting is for talking. There's no strategy
for dolls, right?
</P>
<P>
   The former little boys go to the meeting because the boss called
it, not because they want to discuss things. Their teams are
primed. The former little girls, on the other hand, actually think
they're going to talk about something.
</P>
<P>
   They have the meeting anyway. This is business in America.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranking former little boy makes a declarative statement.
The former little girls nod their heads, not necessarily because
they agree but just to show him they're listening politely.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the former little girls asks a question. The former
little boys shift in their seats. The head guy wishes the impudent
wench would be a good team player and not question the coach. And
why had she nodded her head, anyway, if she didn't agree?
</P>
<P>
   Then another former little girl begins, ``I don't know if this
will work...'' and ends with her voice rising ``...do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Pffft. Write her off, some of the former little boys think to
themselves. She's so tentative. Unsure. Wimpy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the former little boys liked her idea, though. He makes a
statement _ saying the same thing she hid between her
self-effacement and a collegial question. The former little girls
nod some more, and one or two guys hear the ``new'' idea for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the former little boys figure the boss is going to
win, so they cast their vote with the winner. It's a slam dunk. Two
of the little girls also vote with the boss. End of meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The former little boys _ no matter who voted for what _ head
across the street for a beer. It's a strategic-alliance Kodak
moment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the former little girls isn't speaking to another because
she feels betrayed by a friend. Another sheds conflict-inspired
tears in the restroom. Two continue talking at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   And another day on the office playground draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   (Thanks to Pat Heim, author//researcher//seminar presenter, for
column fuel on how team sports and playing dolls prepare people for
the workplace.)

THIS POSTMAN DELIVERS, IF NOT MAIL, AT LEAST THE MOVIE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Junk Mail,'' a comedy//thriller, is unrated. It contains some
nudity, violence and profanity. Running time is 1 hour 23 minutes.
In Norwegian with English subtitles. Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Edvard Munch was a cockeyed optimist.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the painter of the existential icon ``The Scream''
seems like an optimist compared to the creator of ``Junk Mail,''
the new comedy//thriller from his native Norway.
</P>
<P>
   This glumly amusing effort from writer//director Pal Sletaune
fairly oozes Scandinavian angst, from the pasty, beard-stubbled
visages of its characters to the slumlike buildings in which it
unfolds and the unrelenting gray atmosphere, which baths every
scene in a sort of dull, color-draining fluorescent light.
</P>
<P>
   It's so dank and grim and Orwellian, in fact, that the film's
very joylessness becomes an intentional joke.
</P>
<P>
   Roy (Robert Skjaerstad) is a furtive, sullen, thoroughly
miserable fellow. He's a postman, but you can forget the old
rain-snow-dark-of-night bit. When his bag gets too heavy, he simply
dumps the excess mail in a railway tunnel. Nor is he beyond
relieving his boredom by steaming open his customers' letters and
looking into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When a young woman, Line (Andrine Saether), forgetfully leaves
her apartment keys dangling in her mailbox lock, Roy can't help
himself. He snatches them, sneaks upstairs and invades her home,
snooping through her cupboards, stealing a photo of her from a
scrapbook and, most intriguingly, stumbling across a plastic trash
sack filled with cash.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, taking a nap when Line returns. Hiding beneath
her bed, he's got a ringside seat for her attempted suicide. After
a moment's indecision, Roy pulls the unconscious woman from her
bath, phones rescuers, then flees before they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But having saved Line's life, Roy feels weirdly obligated to her
_ and romantically stirred. Before long he is defending the young
woman from her venal boyfriend, George (Per Egil Aske). The money
in the bag is a result of George's criminal activities, and when it
turns up missing, Roy has to play the hero.
</P>
<P>
   As thrillers go, ``Junk Mail'' is low-key. Its main attraction
is Sletaune's tongue-in-cheek depiction of a society without
pleasure or gaiety. A scene in the world's most depressing karaoke
bar sums it up: A blotchy-skinned, pale-haired, bug-eyed young man
is attempting to sing ``Born to Be Wild'' as though in a Thorazine
haze.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Roy decides to risk his neck to save Line. What with
the deadly dull world around him, flirting with death may be the
only way he'll ever feel alive.

`THE OPPOSITE OF SEX' EMBRACES THE OUTRAGEOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Opposite of Sex,'' a black comedy, is rated R for strong
language and sex-related dialogue and sexuality. Running time is 1
hour 40 minutes. Two and a half out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things teen siren Dedee Truitt tells us in her
voice-over narration for ``The Opposite of Sex'' is that she hates
movies with voice-over narration.
</P>
<P>
   Dedee, played with sneering voluptuousness by Christina Ricci,
doesn't like movie cliches. But then Dedee doesn't like much of
anything, including those of us in the audience, whom she addresses
with undisguised contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think I'm just plucky and scrappy and all I need is
love, you're in over your head,'' she informs us. Later she tells
us to relax because ``there are lots of nice people coming up. We
call them losers.''
</P>
<P>
   This prime slice of 16-year-old trailer-court trash is the most
outrageous character in writer//director Don Roos' comedy of bad
manners, but she manages to bring out edgy behavior in just about
everyone she encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Witheringly sarcastic, sexually provocative and utterly
opportunistic, Dedee blows into other people's lives like a
hurricane, knocking relationships off their foundations and
flattening everything in her path.
</P>
<P>
   As the film begins she's run away from her Louisiana home (after
desecrating the grave of her molesting stepfather) and high-tailed
it to Indiana to pay an unannounced visit to her older half-brother
Bill (Martin Donovan), whom she has seen only once before.
</P>
<P>
   Bill turns out to be a sincere, sympathetic high-school teacher
_ and gay. He and his hunky//dense boyfriend, Matt (Ivan Sergei),
invite the long-lost relative to make herself at home. Dedee
readily accepts, noting that gay men are much cleaner than their
straight counterparts, ``if you don't count viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately zeroing in on the weakest person in sight, she gets
to work on the slow-witted Matt, bullying him into exploring his
latent heterosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Dedee's little-girl-lost routine fails to impress Bill's friend
and fellow teacher Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), whose late brother was
Bill's longtime companion. A bitter, unloved woman with such a bad
body image that she's uncomfortable even gesturing with her hands,
Lucia is an expert on the deviousness of teen-age girls. She
immediately labels Dedee ``a human tabloid.''
</P>
<P>
   When Matt announces that Dedee is pregnant and he's now
bisexual, Lucia snorts: ``Please. I went to a bar mitzvah once.
That doesn't make me Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long Dedee has fled with Matt to California _ after
cleaning out Bill's bank account. The jilted Bill and Lucia give
chase, only to discover the very swollen Dedee cheating on Matt
with her old boyfriend from Louisiana, a violence-prone Christian
fundamentalist (William Scott Lee).
</P>
<P>
   Although it's got some flat patches and erratic pacing, Roos'
directing debut is noteworthy not just for flirting with
outrageousness, but for embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the movie exudes a pull-no-punches gay sensibility
even as it refuses to let characters off the hook just because
they're gay.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing is that despite the mantle of cynicism in which
he drapes his effort, Roos is below the surface quite charitable to
his characters _ even the hair-raising Dedee.
</P>
<P>
   If he occasionally struggles to maintain a consistent tone, Roos
allows his players to have a field day. Ricci, a former child star
who played Wednesday in the ``Addams Family'' movies, is riveting
as the evil//seductive Dedee, a walking cartoon of teen pulchritude
who, despite her vile behavior, manages somehow to be sympathetic.
Donovan, one of the most substantial leading men in independent
films, brings just the right amount of decency, grim humor and
weary resignation to the battered Bill.
</P>
<P>
   The real surprise is Kudrow, whose Lucia is about 180 degrees
removed from her dizzy Phoebe on TV's ``Friends.'' Prickly and
sardonic, this brittle character evokes both pity and amusement,
and her eventual sexual liberation (at the hands of an odd cop
played by Lyle Lovett) is cause for celebration.

DANGER. THESE FIREWORKS AREN'T TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fireworks,'' a drama, is unrated. It contains graphic
violence. Running time is 1 hour 47 minutes. Three and a half out
of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of violence in ``Fireworks'' as shocking and
unsettling as anything dished out by Quentin Tarantino.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the overwhelming emotion at the end of ``Fireworks'' is
not of cathartic release but of sadness and regret, tempered with a
sort of tarnished nobility.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely melding of Ingmar Bergman and John Woo,
``Fireworks'' comes very close to being a one-man movie. It has
been written, directed and edited by Japanese personality Takeshi
Kitano (known to his fans worldwide as ``Beat'' Takeshi), who also
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano is a true renaissance man. He's best-known in his native
Japan as a comedian, but he's also written and//or illustrated at
least four dozen books. He emcees several TV shows. And as if that
wasn't enough, ``Fireworks'' is the first Japanese work to win the
Venice Film Festival's grand prize since ``Rashomon'' in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a straightforward synopsis: Angst-riddled police
detective Nishi (Takeshi) is besieged in both his professional and
personal lives. His wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) is dying of leukemia,
his partner Horibe (Ren Osugi) is paralyzed after being shot by a
suspect. Nishi also is being badgered by loan sharks from whom he
has borrowed money to pay for his wife's hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the film the normally unsentimental Nishi will
devote himself to his wife, inspire the embittered Horibe to take
up painting, ruthlessly track down the punk responsible for his
partner's plight, and bloodily eradicate the gangsters who keep
popping up to demand their money.
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, ``Fireworks'' is anything but straightforward. It's a
dizzying whirlwind of contradictory tones and images that employs a
convoluted time frame and often slows to a crawl to meditate on
Horibe's simple but evocative artwork (created by Takeshi).
``Fireworks'' fascinates with its juxtaposition of extremes,
zigzagging between horrifying violence and aching tenderness,
beween glittering hope and the blackest ennui.
</P>
<P>
   At the center is Nishi, played by Takeshi as something of a
mystery man. At times he seems as easily distracted as a bored
schoolboy; at other times you'd swear he's autistic, so incapable
is he of relating fully with another person. He hardly says a word,
preferring to grunt. He's got a bothersome facial tic that suggests
there's plenty boiling under his blank surface.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is percolating deep inside, it's nasty. With little or
no provocation Nishi explodes in horrifying violence. And yet, when
he and his ailing wife go on a long-delayed vacation _ undoubtedly
their last _ Nishi amuses her by throwing himself into silly
touristy behavior. His efforts at comedy are clumsy _ but
endearing. Clearly, there's love in there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Originality in film is a rare commodity. Despite its many
references to the acion genre, ``Fireworks'' is about as original
as they come.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SLIAMMON INDIAN RESERVE, British Columbia _ One morning
recently, Evan Adams, a 31-year-old American Indian actor, was
telling stories in the small living room of his parents' home on
this beautiful, heavily wooded stretch of the Canadian coast.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his mother, three sisters and a brother, he
explained in his singsong voice how he had terrified some of the
participants in a first-aid course he had taken by reacting with
passionate alarm toward a doll that was supposedly choking and its
inflatable mother.
</P>
<P>
   He was telling the story as a testament to his acting ability,
but his normally soft-spoken sister Maureen slyly deflated the
boast by asking, ``Was it acting or were you excited about that
blow-up doll?''
</P>
<P>
   This gentle gibe brought gales of laughter from Adams' family,
and it was just one episode in a day of wordplay among a group of
people clearly comfortable communicating through sometimes bawdy
humor and irony. That, of course, would be unremarkable in such a
close-knit family except for the fact that Indians have generally
been depicted in popular culture, and especially in movies, as
earnest and stoic, sometimes pathetic and at times bloodthirsty,
but rarely wry.
</P>
<P>
   Indians have also been pictured as living in poor, if not
squalid conditions. And in fact Adams, a Coast Salish Indian, said
that he had eaten so much salmon as a child growing up in a
subsistence economy based on fishing that he took to calling it
``Indian bologna.'' But the economic poverty has often been
interpreted as cultural impoverishment _ as an implication that
Indian culture lacks a playful or a cerebral dimension.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason the new movie in which Adams is a co-star,
``Smoke Signals,'' which opens Friday, is so distinctive. It's
funny and complex, as well as poignant, casting a new light on the
Indian sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' based on a book of short stories by Sherman
Alexie, is the first feature-length movie written, directed and
acted by American Indians. But the film, which won two awards for
best drama at the Sundance festival in January and has already been
widely acclaimed by critics, is something more too: it is a step by
a new generation of Indian artists toward finding an idiom for
exploring their individual and cultural identities without
resorting to self-pity, political correctness or Hollywood cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of ``Smoke Signals,'' which documents the unexpected
ways two young men living on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in Idaho
come to terms with absent fathers, is brash and self-confident in
its self-examination. In one scene, for instance, Thomas
Builds-the-Fire (Adams) notes as he watches a western, ``The only
thing more pathetic than Indians on TV is Indians watching Indians
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   This movie, which was directed by Chris Eyre, 28, is the work
not just of a group of creative people with full hearts but of
aggressive achievers determined to stake their claim to high ground
on the American cultural map.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of them is Alexie. A 31-year-old novelist and
poet who grew up on the Spokane reservation in Washington, he was a
producer of ``Smoke Signals'' and wrote its screenplay and is also
producing a movie adapted from his recent novel ``Indian Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that one of his primary goals was to
take away from so-called white experts the responsibility for
describing contemporary Indian culture. His aim, he said, is not to
avoid criticism of Indian society but to make sure that it is
Indians doing the criticizing and interpreting.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, an athletic-looking man with a broad smile, a long
ponytail and wire-framed glasses, is also a good example of
restless ambition _ but with a twist. He has acted in four
full-length features; he will appear in ``Indian Killer,'' and he
is completing a script for a movie in which he will also act later
this year, with Loretta Todd, a Cree from Northern Alberta,
directing.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all that, Adams _ whose grandparents and several
aunts died of tuberculosis _ will begin medical school at the
University of Calgary this fall, to fulfill a goal of bringing
something back to his reservation, a hamlet of 650 people about 100
miles north of Vancouver amid mountains, towering cedars and rich
blue waters.
</P>
<P>
   The people involved in ``Smoke Signals'' are not, in short,
willing to passively accept conventional images of Indian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is a slow-moving, often wistful drama that
turns into a road movie as Thomas, a confident nerd who maintains
his people's storytelling tradition in an offbeat manner,
accompanies the angry, self-conscious Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) on
a journey to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is consistently enlivened by a self-deprecating
sense of humor, one of the most enduring Indian cultural
characteristics, particularly on the reservations, according to the
makers of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' is clearly a product of a post-Wounded Knee
generation. The filmmakers paid tribute to the American Indian
Movement, saying that those angry demonstrators of the 1970s had
helped establish a contemporary tradition of Indian pride that made
a movie like ``Smoke Signals'' possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the film has a far different sensibility. The characters are
angry, but they're also silly, loving, careless, vulnerable, witty
and persistent. They play basketball. They laugh at their squalor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the only way they can go forward is by driving a
car backward. They mock Indian stereotypes, and they embrace them.
In fact, they are much like the group of people who made the film.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eyre, a graduate of the film school at New York University, is a
Cheyenne-Arapaho who was adopted as a baby and brought up by a
white family in Oregon. He has spent the last few years tracking
down his biological parents and embracing his Indian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' the first feature he has directed, was
integral to that process. ``In this movie, we're all searching for
home to different degrees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beach, 25, an Ojibway from north of Winnipeg, bluntly described
how much of his own personal history was reflected in that of his
character, Victor, who is haunted by the absence of a parent. He
said the defining element of his early life was the death of his
mother, who was killed by a drunken driver when he was 8; she was
eight months pregnant at the time. His father drowned two months
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with that loss and not understanding it, you kind of
feel you're not in the right place,'' said Beach, an avid hockey
player and rock musician. ``I'm kind of looking for the right place
in this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Beach also described the making of ``Smoke Signals'' as a means
by which he could confront his own anger about the loss of his
parents. ``It was the first time in my life I was able to get that
out of myself,'' said Beach in describing the filming of the
tearful closing sequence of the movie. ``I remember I was crying on
Chris' shoulder and saying, `It still hurts.' And he'd say, `Well,
you have to go do it again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Adams, who has been almost frenetic in his
efforts both to investigate his culture through writing and acting
and to serve his people as a doctor. His parallel career paths
reflect a tension that runs through the lives of many Indians, he
said: whether to concentrate on articulating a distinct cultural
vision to the world outside the reservations or to focus on their
own people.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is still undecided on which path will win out in his case,
but he seems to be leaning in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love acting and I'm working at it, but there are only a
few times in an actor's career when he can do movies that are life
changing or magical,'' he said. ``That's not enough for me. I need
to do something that really helps my people all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' father, Les, the captain of a tugboat, said he had long
contemplated these issues. As he sat bobbing on his boat, he
explained that he knew many years ago that Evan was capable of
extraordinary accomplishments. And he said that he had sternly
instructed his son to focus his ambition on the world beyond the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   But, he admitted, Evan made it clear early on that he had his
own ideas about heritage and creativity. As a teen-ager, for
example, Evan learned and performed traditional dances that had
been little seen for years. Les Adams recalled bringing a friend,
the chief of a nearby tribe, to one of Evan's performances and
being struck to see his friend cry at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had not seen those dances since he was a boy and
that he never expected to see them again in his life,'' said Adams.
``He was impressed that these young people wanted to bring them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan did go away to a private high school when he was 14 and
then to McGill University in Montreal. His father said he was
crushed when Evan announced that he was leaving McGill after a
year, to pursue acting.
</P>
<P>
   Evan said that part of his struggle over the years had come from
his mixed feelings about living in a dominantly white society.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family had a very high status on the reservation,'' said
Adams, whose father was the elected chief of his tribe for a number
of years. ``I was low status in the town. It was a constant source
of irritation and humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Adams enrolled at the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver and completed his premed studies, while continuing to
write and act, doing everything from Shakespeare to a play he
wrote, ``Snapshots,'' about how two Indian families deal with
illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   He described his swings from one world to the other while
showing a reporter an extraordinary collection of totem poles,
masks and other ceremonial objects preserved in the glass and
concrete Museum of Anthropology on the University of British
Columbia campus. He insisted that he was trying to find a way of
revering the past while shaping a new kind of future that was true
to both the Indian spirit and the modern spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian way,'' he concluded, ``is being adaptable and
flexible.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Every Friday afternoon, dozens of late-model cars pull
up to the iron gate of the 3-year-old 21st-Century Experimental
School, one of this city's new private schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where sturdy black bicycles are still the favored mode
of transportation and horse-drawn carts ply the streets, men in
suits and women wearing diamonds alight from Fords, Jeeps and BMWs,
rushing excitedly into the building to pick up their children _
some as young as 5 _ who board at the school from Monday to Friday
at a cost of $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It is a substantial sum in a country where the average annual
income is $1,000. And tuition does not include the $10,000
``contribution'' that parents generally make when their children
enroll. But parents fight to have their children here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tuition is high,'' said Du Juan, with bobbed hair, a cell
phone, and a stylish jean vest, who owns an information consulting
business. ``But it's worth it for my daughter's future. The
teachers, the environment and the equipment are better here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of communism, the last few
years have seen the a stunning growth of a flourishing Chinese
middle class. Ten years ago, this group did not exist, but now its
core of independent businessmen has been joined by a growing number
of private-sector lawyers, artists and employees of joint-venture
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is first defined by what its members have: computers,
microwaves, interior decorators and, increasingly, cars and homes.
On Saturday nights they go to concerts and in winter they vacation
in Thailand. But the rapid accumulation of material things has left
its psychological mark as well, infusing this group with a kind of
independence, and carefree optimism, that has not existed in China
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people the change in the last decade has really been
tremendous _ so tremendous it's hard to measure,'' said Conghua Li,
a Beijing-born analyst at Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group in
Toronto. ``Every time I go back, I'm shocked and surprised, mostly
in a good way.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no one statistic that defines this group, which broadly
includes both company presidents (who seem to have it all) and
graduating college students who've just bought their first computer
(and want it all, someday). They are people who work hard for what
they achieve, for the most part without the family ties to the
Communist Party leadership that have long defined China's most
privileged class.
</P>
<P>
   The group portrait is best created like a pointillist painting
from scores of small facts: 10 years ago, 95 percent of passengers
on airline flights in China were foreigners, but today, 95 percent
are Chinese. In 1990 there were no cellular phones in China, now
there are almost 17 million.
</P>
<P>
   The middle class is admired by college students who hope to join
its ranks and, as of last year, has even been embraced by the
Communist Party for its contributions to China's modernization. The
Chinese government has even arranged for President Clinton to meet
private businessmen during his state visit, which begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social status of people like me has improved a lot in the
last few years,'' said Fang Zeng, 33, a soft-spoken real estate
developer. ``And that's a really big change.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fang was sent to represent China at an international
business conference and was tapped to be a delegate to the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body of
distinguished non-Communist Party members.
</P>
<P>
   Fang and his wife, who teaches at Beijing University, each have
their own cars. For next year's vacation, they are deliberating
between Europe and Australia. They have donated money to establish
university scholarships and children's libraries in Beijing, among
other causes. And, although they now live in a one-bedroom
apartment provided by Beijing University, they are contemplating
ownership once they have a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have imagined I would be where I am today,''
said Fang. ``I have so many capabilities and choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his has been a complicated transformation, given the
country's egalitarian tradition under communism, because the wave
of prosperity that has created a middle class has not carried all
Chinese equally. For every 30-year-old entrepreneur who has moved
up in social status, there are many more workers laid off from
ailing state-owned factories who have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The income gap between China's rich and poor is widening fast.
In Beijing last year, the average annual salary for bosses of
private companies was about $8,000 and for workers only $1,000,
said Dai Jianzheng, a sociologist at the Beijing Academy of Social
Science. The difference is even greater in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years there are a lot of people who have
gotten rich very quickly,'' said Dai. ``But the tension between
wealth and social inequality has not been addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the new middle class say they feel the anger of
those left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among writers there was a lot of discussion when I bought a
car,'' said Zhang Kangkang, a well-known novelist who bought a
Japanese car in 1996 for $20,000. ``Many seemed to resent it. They
said I was cutting myself off from the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when her husband, a university professor, took the
$15,000, in cash, that she was paid for a screenplay to a local
bank recently, the other customers cursed him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese entrepreneurs began accumulating money in the
late 1980s, it was not until the mid-'90s that the accoutrements of
middle-class life _ cell phones, microwaves and a wide range of
cars _ were readily available for purchase in China. Then the
middle class really took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the year everyone in our compound bought cars,''
said Ms. Zhang, displaying the newly expanded parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the earliest entrants to the middle class, generally
young high-tech entrepreneurs who quit state enterprises to start
private companies nearly a decade ago, are now wealthy by any
country's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Yan Junjie and Zhang Can were college sweethearts who began a
computer company in 1990, when China was ``starting to transform
from a planned to a market economy and was full of opportunity,''
Yan said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Dyne Group, with revenues of $240 million last year, now
sells computer systems and pharmaceuticals, and is branching out
into furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the commercialization of housing this year I think
Chinese will be buying nicer furniture for their homes,'' Zhang
explained, referring to the government plan to allow Chinese to
purchase their government-supplied apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yan and Zhang live a life unthinkable a decade ago, with two
Mercedes, one Lincoln, one Ford and a villa in Beijing, a country
house and a third in Freemont, Calif., where their company has its
American office. Although Zhang would not disclose his own income,
he said that many of his senior executives now own houses. The
couple have been to Europe and Singapore, and only their busy work
schedule keeps them from traveling more often.
</P>
<P>
   Like many newly rich Chinese they seem vaguely uncomfortable
when asked about wealth. Their favorite activity remains walking in
the mountains near Beijing and, following a common Chinese
practice, their 9-year-old daughter lives with her grandmother in
another part of Beijing, where she attends a public school.
</P>
<P>
   For most Chinese the move into the middle class is still a
step-by-step process, with each choosing the components of
middle-class life he can afford.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m. on a recent Saturday morning a group of 20 friends and
colleagues boarded a bus for a resort near Baihuashan, for a
weekend of hiking, boating and karaoke. Young professionals in
their 20s and 30s, they had each paid $50 to join this rite of the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``My living standard has raised a lot,'' said Zhang Guoliang,
33, an affable lawyer with a video camera slung over his shoulder,
who bought a Chinese-made Volkswagen last year. ``When I have the
opportunity I will buy a villa in the suburbs, I don't want to just
buy an apartment in town with all the noise and pollution here.''
</P>
<P>
   Three rows behind him, Xu Guangli, an administrator and a joint
venture company, and Sun Huawei, an assistant to a labor
arbitrator, both 24, discussed their weekend plans. They can not
afford to go abroad, they said, but try to take weekend trips each
month, either on organized tours or by renting cars with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Fei Zinggang, the hand-shaking manager of Tai He Travel, said
his small state-owned travel agency started offering weekend tours
last June when it sensed a market demand and in peak season now
sends out up to 80 travelers a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The travel is quite striking,'' said Conghua Li. ``Ten years
ago `vacation' was not a concept in China; there was just no such
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the change involves a shift in mindset as well. ``There is
now a significant middle-class market emerging,'' said Yukon Huang,
head of the World Bank office in China. ``As in other countries,
the middle class is more independent, more mobile and more
politically active.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents at the 21st-Century Experimental School say they
selected the school for its emphasis on creative thinking and
independence _ not traditional Chinese values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public schools focus only on exams,'' said Zhang Jieting, 34,
the businessman who founded the school. ``We focus on developing
the child to meet the needs of the modern Chinese economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And middle-class Chinese bring with them the same sort of
optimism that characterized Americans after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Zang, the real-estate entrepreneur, who is an avid reader, said
that one of the biggest excitements for him is no longer having to
check the price of books before buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang, the writer, sounds like an excited teenager as she
describes the sense of freedom that has come with her car: trips to
galleries and to plays, carefree jaunts around a homeland that she
had never explored before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about money,'' she said. ``It's about a
better quality of life. And it moves us toward greater spiritual
and political freedom.''

ANALYSIS: FOR JAPANESE, ECONOMIC SITUATION IS NO EMERGENCY

<P>
   TOKYO _ In a few weeks, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will
face nationwide elections as he presides over the worst recession
in more than 50 years, a limp stock market and the highest
unemployment rate since records began to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts overwhelmingly expect his governing Liberal
Democratic Party to do very well. The latest polls show it with
more than five times as much support as any other party.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hashimoto is more likely to do better than ever, for
President Clinton handed him a political gift on Wednesday by
agreeing to a joint U.S.-Japanese campaign to bolster the sagging
yen. Whether or not the jawboning and billions of dollars in
foreign-exchange intervention succeed in propping up the yen, they
will almost certainly succeed in propping up Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hashimoto's relative popularity may be part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Clinton's decision to go to Hashimoto's aid was
that Japan would take, as Clinton put it, aggressive and bold steps
that would justify a higher rate for the yen. But many analysts
here say that the Japanese political process militates against
fundamental change and that Hashimoto's relative popularity
suggests that the public wants someone like him, a repairman for
the old system rather than an architect for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally it comes down to the fact that people in Japan
generally don't think that things are so bad that they need to have
fundamental change,'' the president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Japan, Glenn S. Fukushima, said. ``They realize that
there are difficulties, that they need to handle them, and they are
prepared to make certain changes. But change will often result in
disruption of the current system, and I think that is something
that people want to avoid as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   All this raises some puzzling questions about the Japanese
political process. In most countries there is a built-in corrective
mechanism when an economy veers off course. Disgruntled voters
evict the old team and choose new leaders who promise to do things
differently. Yet despite eight years of economic stagnation the
Japanese political system has not responded in that way.
</P>
<P>
   One common explanation is that Japan has established an
elaborate series of safety nets, so that even in a recession no one
feels deeply distressed. Ronald A. Morse, a professor of economics
and business administration at Reitaku University near Tokyo, calls
Japan ``an air bag society,'' because people are so protected from
the effects of recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has jobs, everybody has health care, and nobody's
out on the street,'' Morse said. ``Even companies that are losing
money aren't laying people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Japan does not have the feel of a country in a severe
downturn. There are few homeless people, soup kitchens,
bankruptcies or vacant buildings. Although there are some
differences in measurements, the record unemployment rate in Japan
is still 4.1 percent, less than the 4.3 rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An old saying defines a recession as when your neighbor is laid
off. When you are laid off it is a depression. By those
definitions, for the great majority of Japanese this is still not a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf in perceptions inside and outside Japan on the
seriousness of the economic situation here is difficult to
exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans and many Asians these days it sometimes seems that
Japan's economy is burning and is threatening to ignite all of Asia
and, perhaps, the United States and Europe, as well. For those
fearing a global economic conflagration, nothing is more
infuriating than the sight of Hashimoto passively watching the
flames and seeming to do little more than blithely insisting that
the fire will eventually subside.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar situation Nero fiddled, but not for eight years _
that is the kind of grumbling one hears from U.S. officials these
days.
</P>
<P>
   To Japanese officials the foreign carping seems foolish and
petulant. Some say the U.S. government is simply nervous about its
own bubble economy and is looking for a scapegoat to blame when
stock prices inevitably collapse. And most Japanese say the risks
are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realities of Japan's economy are not as bad as the world
thinks,'' said Jiro Ushio, chairman of the influential Japan
Association of Corporate Executives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many Japanese insist that their country is seriously
addressing the recession and the Asian crisis. They note that the
Japanese government has begun a huge stimulus package, the biggest
in the nation's history, and that the government has contributed
far more to Asian bailouts than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that we might be oblivious is not, I think, well
founded,'' said Sadaaki Numata, the chief spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Japan has worked out a series of measures to combat
the recession, he added, ``We will implement the measures as soon
as possible and we do hope that there will be a recovery and that
the markets will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, for all the bewilderment and anger at Japan's
reluctance to do more to stimulate its economy, Hashimoto's
behavior, viewed from a Japanese perspective, makes some sense and
appears in keeping with the public mood. After all, he just
celebrated the Liberal Democratic Party's latest victory, on Sunday
in a parliamentary by-election.
</P>
<P>
   That was the sixth consecutive victory in by-elections for the
Liberal Democrats, and polls suggest that they will also do very
well in elections for the upper house on July 12. The upper house
is much less significant than the lower house, but the election
will nonetheless be an important test of sentiment, and Hashimoto
seems ready to pass with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this week in the Yomiuri newspaper, taken just before the
intervention to support the yen, found that the support for
Hashimoto's government had fallen, to 30 percent. But perhaps more
important, 29 percent of those interviewed said they still
supported the Liberal Democrats, compared to 5.5 percent for the
leading opposition group, the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party, which advocates precisely the far-reaching
economic reorganization and stimulus policies that Washington would
like to see in Japan, had the support of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There have been widespread hints that Hashimoto will be more
aggressive in tackling Japan's financial problems immediately after
the election. But that, too, tells something about the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of promising before the election to address the economic
mess and the mountain of bad bank loans, the speculation is that he
will tackle these issues only after he no longer has to face the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Morse argues that Japan suffers from cronyism and structural
economic problems quite similar to those of South Korea and
Indonesia. Those countries were bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund on the condition that they accept painful
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan has not collapsed in the way that South Korea or
Indonesia did, so Morse said he believed that the political process
would not lead to a fundamental overhaul of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF should have come into Japan, but it didn't,'' he said.
``Japan is too big for anyone to mess with.''

RAJPUT LOVE PAINTINGS: HEROINES AND PRINCES IN GARDEN OF DELIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ India has produced countless styles of manuscript
painting. Among the most poetic, and certainly the most popular
outside India itself, are those that emerged in the 17th century in
the Hindu Rajput kingdoms nestled in the remote mountain valleys of
the Himalayan foothills.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings from the Punjab hills, or Pahari paintings, with their
palettes of vegetable green, dusky orange, and afterglow lavender,
are soaked in a spirit of place. In them, days are lambent, nights
hushed and star-strewn. Figures have a serene perfection. Slender
women wear neat, fitted dresses. Men and gods, adhering to an
ultrastylish ideal of sartorial machismo, sport garlands and
turbans and pearl-drop earrings.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a peaceable kingdom, it would seem, this is
it. Yet for all their lyricism, these paintings are often shot
through with unsettled passions. Characters depicted are skittishly
seductive or gripped by panic. Many are obsessed by one overarching
theme: the heartache and joy of religious and erotic desire.
</P>
<P>
   A swoony little exhibition titled ``Sakhi: Friend and Messenger
in Rajput Love Paintings,'' at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery,
brings together nearly three dozen such Pahari works. And with
their keyed-up emotions and gorgeous images, they create a quietly
pulsating, pocket-size Summer of Love within quiet museum walls.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the paintings in the show, which has been organized by
Vidya Dehejia, associate director and chief curator of the Sackler
and the Freer Gallery of Art, are from the plains of Rajasthan in
northwestern India.
</P>
<P>
   But most are from the hills, and many can be traced to the
kingdom of Kangra, where a single royal patron, Raja Sansar Chand
(who reigned from 1775 to 1823), nurtured a distinctive house
style, one that blended Mughal naturalism and stylized Rajput
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Chand was an ardent worshipper of the god Vishnu, who appeared
in the guise of the blue-skinned cowherd, the deity Krishna; his
cult was widespread in aristocratic circles. And Krishna himself is
the subject of nearly every work here. For without exception these
paintings are illustrations for love poetry in which he plays a
central role.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the poetry was religious, as in the case of the
devotional lyric known as ``Gita Govinda,'' or ``Song of the Dark
Lord.'' Written by the 12th-century poet Jayadeva, it recounts the
amorous adventures of Krishna and his consort, Radha, and presents
them both as earthly lovers and as metaphors for God and the human
soul, locked in a torturous drama of separation and reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Other poems, some of them derived from the ``Gita Govinda,''
were secular in nature. They included the ``Rasamanjari,'' or
``Garland of Delights,'' by the 15th-century poet Bhanudatta, the
``Rasikapriya,'' by Keshavadasa, and the ``Satasai,'' or ``700
Verses,'' by the court poet Bihari (1595-1664). Krishna and Radha
are the stars here, too, but less as spiritual symbols than as
patrician role models, offering object lessons in emotional
etiquette and amorous comportment.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the poems and illustrations, a second female
character appears, the sakhi or the companion to the heroine. And
she, in her various roles as adviser, comforter, go-between and
witness, provides the thematic link in the Sackler exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In a late Kangra-style ``Gita Govinda'' painting from around
1820-1825, for example, the sakhi has been importuned by Krishna
himself to persuade the heroine to surrender to him.
</P>
<P>
   While he lies on the ground, listless with longing, on one side
of the picture, the sakhi kneels gesturing before a nervous Radha
on the other. Meanwhile, the landscape around them is vibrant with
expectation, from the outsize lotuses bobbing away in a pool to the
thickets of trees in every shade of green, their branches swollen
with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But the romantic meeting is tantalizingly delayed. In an oval
painting from around 1780-90, the heroine is seen wandering off in
a drugged, somnambulistic daze under moonlight, trailing her shadow
behind her, as the sakhi dashes in, having tracked down her young
charge by her fragrance alone.
</P>
<P>
   In another image, Krishna sits by himself in a kind of
spoiled-child funk on a hillside, his garland and cowherd's staff
thrown down, as a sapling bends over him, sympathetically echoing
his dejection.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a ``Gita Govinda'' page from around 1775, the emotional
tide turns. The two women are shown walking together through the
night. The heroine fearfully muffles herself in her shawl; the
sakhi places a solicitous arm around her shoulder and guides her
toward a bower of trees where Krishna, his skin the color of rain
clouds, his gown a radiant marigold yellow, awaits their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In this beautiful image, the trees surrounding the god take on a
twisting, embracing sexualized life of their own, as if
anticipating the rapturous activity soon to follow. And such
eroticism, explicit or merely implied, accounts for much of the
charm of these paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Scene after scene has a hectic, grand-opera tension, with
plaintive arias, love duets and mad scenes in which characters
assume codified gestures of desire and despair. And when love
finally sings out at full cry, its force is overpowering. Women
dance like bacchantes under a night sky; Krishna and Radha make
love on a bed of leaves. And in one of the show's earliest works,
dated around 1640 and from the state of Mewar in Rajasthan, the
entire universe seems to have burst into flower.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although art from both Mewar and Kangra is well known, dozens of
other Rajput courts supported workshops and produced distinctive
painting styles, many of which have yet to be discovered or
properly defined by scholars. Women may well have played an
important role in manuscript production, both as audiences and as
commissioners of books, and this possibility gives paintings like
those at the Sackler a particularly provocative edge.
</P>
<P>
   Radha, in the ``Gita Govinda,'' is a married women, and for this
reason both her agonized resistance to Krishna and her final
capitulation have a genuine urgency. Within the context of Hindu
moral codes, her infidelity is a deeply transgressive, and
potentially life-threatening adventure. And it is not hard to
imagine women of the Rajput courts tasting a vicarious measure of
emotional independence through identification with her risks and
triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end, it is the sakhi who functions as the stand-in
for most viewers of these paintings. She is part of the drama, but
also removed. She approaches the events as a concerned friend, but
also a voyeur, an amused attendant in the school of love.
</P>
<P>
   Through her eyes we see the story shift back and forth between
sacred and profane. One minute Krishna is God, his blue skin
symbolic of infinite space. The next, he is a pouty Leonardo
DiCaprio-style princeling peeved not to get his way with his lady
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Such shifting expressive temperatures are found everywhere in
Indian art, and Ms. Dehejia has splendidly suggested their range in
a modestly scaled exhibition much enlivened by wall panels carrying
excerpts from the poems illustrated in each painting.
</P>
<P>
   Her next project at the Sackler, incidentally, is a major
exhibition titled ``Devi: The Great Goddess,'' scheduled to appear
next year. The Pahari paintings, with their fertile landscapes and
dauntless heroines, have sources in that rich subject, and one
looks forward to Ms. Dehejia's show with eager impatience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sakhi: Friend and Messenger in Rajput Love Paintings'' remains
at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution,
Independence Avenue at 12th Street SW, Washington, through July 7.

decorators and increasingly, cars and homes. On Saturday nights
they go to concerts; in winter they vacation in Thailand. But the

A BAD IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As legislation to overhaul the nation's schools
moves toward final approval in Congress, President Clinton and the
Republican majority on Capitol Hill remain far apart on a key
issue, frozen in the ice of uncompromising positions.
</P>
<P>
   In this showdown, the president's veto pen will temporarily win,
and should. But a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court decision has
energized the opposition and suggests that the stalemate could be
as permanently damaging as that over abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides have many philosophical and practical
differences over education, the most contentious question is that
of taxpayer-funded vouchers to encourage children of low-income
families to attend private secular or religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed tax-free savings accounts of up to $2,000 a year for
school expenses for families of all incomes, including tuition at
parochial schools, are a variation on the same theme.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP devotion to the concept of subsidizing parents to flee
the public schools is matched in fervor only by the president's
conviction that such a shift would undermine the free public school
system he rightly considers a fundamental bulwark of democracy. It
would divert limited public resources in an always-tight federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the House approved an education bill that includes
provisions to pay for tax-free savings accounts and vouchers,
deliberately defying the president's threat to veto the entire bill
if they are included. The Senate is due to vote on the measure
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent measure provided for vouchers specifically for
low-income families in the District of Columbia. Clinton vetoed it,
as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-tobacco bill blocked Wednesday in the Senate included
school vouchers for students who have been crime victims on school
grounds. The overall measure was popular with Democrats and was the
most likely vehicle for Republicans to sneak vouchers past Clinton,
but it is a dead issue now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that voucher
programs can get around the constitutional separation of church and
state by giving public tuition funds directly to parents rather
than to the parochial schools. This dodge enabled the court to
interpret the program's primary purpose as helping parents make
wider choices rather than advancing religion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately resolve the issue. It is
unrealistic to believe that taxpayer subsidies would not promote a
new elitist state-supported private education system with religious
overtones. But the high bench, in its legal isolation, has not
always understood how scholarly decisions impact on real life.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher proponents claim private schools do a better job of
teaching children than the public schools, and maybe they do.
</P>
<P>
   But private schools have no public accountability. They can be
selective. They can reject for admission students with low grades
or troubled personalities.
</P>
<P>
   They can expel unsatisfactory pupils. They can pay whatever
salaries they want to their teachers. They do not have to provide
special instruction to disabled students.
</P>
<P>
   If a parochial school wants to promote a specific religion, the
state cannot say no.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools, by contrast, must by law serve every kid in the
neighborhood. They can't discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   They provide a great, stimulating social mixing bowl _ rich and
poor, clever and dense, together in class. It's the American way.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, usually stable middle-class communities, this
ideal still works. Where it doesn't, where cops must patrol the
corridors, the public schools ought to be fixed. The way to do it
is by giving them more care and attention, not less.

PENALTIES HEAVY AS FRANCE DOWNS SAUDI TEAM, 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Referees remained on center stage at the
World Cup Thursday. After FIFA president-elect Sepp Blatter
declared a further crackdown on rough tackles, referees ejected
five players in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter said he did not want Brazilian Ronaldo to have his
career ended by injuries, similar to Dutchman Marco Van Basten. But
Ronaldo has not seemed in much danger in this tournament. The play
in this World Cup has mostly been wide open, mostly ``fair,''
according to accepted worldwide standards. And referees had already
been doing some ``cracking down,'' delivering four ejections in the
first nine days.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks from Blatter have created an atmosphere of near
hysteria. Five red cards were shown Thursday. Any close call became
subject to the strongest judgment. And if Blatter wanted someone to
carry out his directive, he found the right person in Mexican
referee Arturo Brizio Carter during France's 4-0 victory over Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Brizio Carter, who red-carded Italy's GianFranco Zola at Foxboro
Stadium in the 1994 World Cup, ejected Mohammed Al Khlaiwi of Saudi
Arabia early in the game and Zinedine Zidane of France midway
through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The French, inspired by a capacity crowd of countrymen waving
the tricolor and singing ``Les Marseillaise'' at the Stade de
France, qualified for the second round with a concise, spectacular
performance.
</P>
<P>
   They won in style, exploiting great spaces in the Saudi defense
and their physical superiority, enhanced by the 18th-minute
expulsion of Al Khlaiwi for a tackle on Bixente Lizarazu.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis could not contain Zidane. And when the team needed an
injection of midfield inspiration, Youri Djorkaeff entered early in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal seemed inevitable. The Saudis, hampered by the
ejection and discouraged by France's back four, could not sustain
attacks. This allowed French defenders to advance. Lilian Thuram
made a strong run on the right side and drilled a cross through
Mohammed Al Dayea's hands. David Trezeguet, who had several chances
after replacing the injured Christophe Dugarry (right hamstring) in
the first half, finally converted with a header from the goal area.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane's dribbling skills and the runs on the wings by Bernard
Diomede Thierry Henry highlighted the French performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis, a finesse team influenced greatly by the Brazilian
style, were unable to threaten with 10 men. When they attempted to
retaliate, their defense was exposed further.
</P>
<P>
   France could have scored several more goals. The third came
after goalkeeper Fabian Barthez's long clearance was taken by
Henry, who outraced the tiring Saudi defense in the 35th minute.
Seven minutes later, Lizarazu scored off a play started by
Djorkaeff.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane was ejected in the 27th minute after colliding with a
defender and appearing to step on him. Zidane will miss Wednesday's
game against Denmark in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great player but sometimes he loses his head,''
captain Didier Deschamps said of Zidane. ``Losing him is like being
cut open.''
</P>
<P>
   France certainly deserved to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a very good team; they move the ball extremely
well,'' Saudi coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. ``Their
confidence is building and they have a long way to go in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of allowing the players and teams to be in the
spotlight, Blatter and his obsessions with refereeing are in danger
of upstaging them.

OPERA REVIEW: `KATYA,' `FAUST' AND `DON PASQUALE' IN ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Opera Theater of St. Louis has grown remarkably
since Richard Gaddes founded it in 1976 as a Midwestern oasis of
contemporary works, operatic rarities and standard repertory,
performed in English by young singers at the beginning of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's budget was $139,000 that first season; in recent
years, it has hovered around $5 million. Today, the directorial
reins are held by a triumvirate _ Charles MacKay, general director;
Colin Graham, artistic director, and Stephen Lord, music director _
but the original vision has remained largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become a popular draw: the 30 performances at the
950-seat Loretto-Hilton Center at Webster University are virtually
sold out, meaning that around 30,000 tickets have been sold for the
four productions the festival is offering. This year's program
includes two 20th-century works _ Janacek's ``Katya Kabanova'' and
Alexander Goehr's reimagining of a lost Monteverdi work,
``Arianna'' (which will be heard later) _ and two classics,
Donizetti's ``Don Pasquale'' and Gounod's ``Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Katya,'' heard on Tuesday evening, ``Faust,'' on Wednesday
afternoon and ``Don Pasquale,'' on Wednesday evening, showed the
company to be in generally fine artistic health. That said, the
slightest work has the most opulent production: where ``Katya'' and
``Faust'' unfolded on spare sets that presumably telegraphed the
desperation of their principal characters, ``Don Pasquale,'' a
romantic comedy that serves mainly as a frame for coloratura
fireworks, was a picture of bright-hued realism.
</P>
<P>
   John Going, the stage director, had some innocent fun with the
work, moving it from Italy to Buenos Aires but keeping it in the
mid-19th century. If there is no reason for the move, there is also
nothing objectionable about it, and Phyllis Mead took the new
location into account in her amusing and often freewheeling
translation. The set, by James Wolk, offers a panoramic view of
Buenos Aires harbor as a backdrop, with walls, gates and palm trees
defining Don Pasquale's estate. Liz Covey's costumes _ ornate for
the gentry, motley for the household staff _ completed the picture.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this production a joy is an ensemble that is vocally
secure and adept at comic timing and interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Dunleavy negotiated the high-flying arias that Donizetti
created for Norina with technical ease and interpretive subtlety.
She also moved comfortably between the two characterizations
demanded of her: that of the graceful young lover and the demanding
shrew. Gregory Turay, a tenor with an attractive timbre and plenty
of power, sang Ernesto's music sensitively. Timothy Nolen played
the title role with a broader range of emotions than is typical,
and Jeff Mattsey was a suitably conspiratorial Dr. Malatesta.
</P>
<P>
   In his program notes, Going wrote of a thematic link between
``Don Pasquale'' and ``Faust,'' the point being that the aging
title character in each seeks to preserve his youth. But there are
stronger and deeper links between ``Faust'' and ``Katya.'' Katya
makes every effort to be a devoted wife, but her neglect by Tichon
and the abuse of her overbearing mother-in-law, Kabanicha, drive
her into the arms of Boris, whereupon guilt drives her to suicide.
Marguerite is driven mad by the consequences of her relationship
with Faust. In both cases, salvation is available only in death.
</P>
<P>
   These emotionally bleak stories inspired extraordinary music
from both Janacek and Gounod. When Katya is at her most conflicted,
the music conveys a great deal more about her turmoil and passion
than the libretto (heard in a translation by Norman Tucker). Gounod
achieved a similar effect in a more constricted harmonic language.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnne Akalaitis directs the ``Katya'' production, with sets by
John Conklin. Conklin usually achieves a lot with limited
resources, but he was not at his most imaginative here. The sets
are mainly concrete slabs, chairs and projected collages of birds,
trees and water that drill home aspects of Katya's hopelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Plette sang Katya's music with the intensity and dimension
it demands, and was closely matched in both vocal power and
purposefulness by Robert Brubaker, as Boris, and Sari Gruber, as
Tichon's sympathetic sister Varvara. Michael Hayes as Tichon and
Kathryn Day as Kabanicha provided the necessary texture and
familial counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's striking production of ``Faust,'' with sets by Erhard
Rom, and in a translation by Edmund Tracey, underscored the work's
religious component: in his finale, he has both Faust and
Marguerite shot by a firing squad, and Marguerite rising from the
dead to bask in the sound of the Heavenly choir as she cradles
Faust, pieta-like.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Mills conveyed Marguerite's youthfulness and faith
compellingly, and sang with a touching warmth and beauty. As Faust,
John Fowler was vocally strained, particularly at the top of his
range, and dramatically overwrought, but that made him a good foil
for David Pittsinger's spectacularly agile portrayal of
Mephistopheles.
</P>
<P>
   The cast also included Franco Pomponi, as the hot-headed
Valentin, and Valerie Komar, who sang nicely but tended to overact,
as Siebel, Marguerite's hapless suitor.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra for these productions is drawn from the St. Louis
Symphony. It played beautifully for David Loebel, in ``Don
Pasquale,'' and for Lord, in ``Katya.'' In ``Faust,'' which was
conducted with considerable energy by Emmanuel Villaume, the
playing was less consistently polished. ``Katya'' runs through June
26; ``Faust'' and ``Don Pasquale'' run through June 27.

BRUINS NETMINDER DAFOE HAS SHOULDER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Training camp is less than three months away, but the Bruins
were forced to slap an early question mark over their net Thursday
when their No. 1 goaltender, Byron Dafoe, underwent surgery to
repair a slightly torn shoulder capsule.
</P>
<P>
   According to club president/general manager Harry Sinden, the
27-year-old Dafoe was experiencing pain and soreness in recent
weeks while lifting weights at his offseason home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A slight tear in Dafoe's left shoulder capsule was repaired
early Thursday morning by Dr. Ron Kvitne, and Dafoe is expected to
need up to 12 weeks to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything we know, he should be all set by training
camp, but this is going to give us cause to go over things again,''
said Sinden, referring to the general state of the Bruins'
netminding as the club prepares for next week's expansion draft and
the annual entry draft. ``I think we're going to have to look
around and see who else might be available. He should be OK, but
what if he isn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tallas spent most of last season as Dafoe's backup after Jim
Carey was demoted to Providence and soon thereafter required
season-ending shoulder surgery. The untested John Grahame, son of
former Boston netminder Ron Grahame, ranks third or fourth on the
netminding depth chart, depending on whether the out-of-favor Carey
is considered a viable option to play here again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd do anything until after the draft,'' said
Sinden. ``We'll have to talk. Mike O'Connell (Sinden's top aide) is
on vacation, and we talk every day, but this is so sudden ... Mike
doesn't even know yet. We've been talking about protecting two
goalies (in next Friday's expansion draft that will stock
Nashville), and we probably still will, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe and Tallas almost certainly would be the two netminders
protected. Grahame is exempt, having turned pro a year ago. Carey,
owed $5 million over the next two seasons, likely wouldn't interest
the Predators, whose boss is David Poile, the former Capitals
general manager who dealt him from Washington to the Bruins in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins look for some insurance in net, said Sinden, they
won't be shopping in the unrestricted free agent market that
includes the likes of Curtis Joseph, Mike Richter, John
Vanbiesbrouck, and Sean Burke. They more likely would be hunting
for someone who has been a backup elsewhere, someone like Dafoe,
who wasn't considered a No. 1 with the Kings when LA dealt him
here. Dafoe sparkled for much of the 1997-98 season, compiling a
30-25-9 mark and a 2.24 goals-against average.

health, Boeing's vice president for marketing predicted yesterday.
Boeing's look 20 years into the future also shows growth of 5

TAXES, POLITICS UNDERMINED TOBACCO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the great congressional smokeout of 1998, fear
of taxes trumped fear of cancer _ and that's a lesson lawmakers,
congressional challengers, and political consultants will apply to
Washington battles and local campaigns in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the antitobacco crusade this week was more
significant as a lesson in political science than as one in public
health. Although proponents of the bill spoke gravely about
tobacco's costs, the proposal failed largely because of fears,
stoked deftly by the tobacco industry, that the bill's new taxes
would provide money for new government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation tried to portray it as a victim of
Big Money, but the opponents prevailed by saying that the measure
was a stalking horse for Big Brother _ and Big Government.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the tobacco bill ends one of the two debates the
Republican Congress didn't want to have, but had anyway. The other
one, on the effort to overhaul the nation's campaign-finance
system, will almost surely dribble to a close in the next few
weeks, almost certainly with the same result.
</P>
<P>
   Like the campaign-finance bill, the tobacco legislation was
principally a Democratic initiative in a chamber controlled by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Like the campaign-finance bill, the tobacco legislation was a
symbol of the power of money in politics. The tobacco companies
pumped millions into their fight against the bill, blanketing the
country with advertisements at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very clear lobby campaign with a very clear
lesson,'' said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for
Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in
Washington. ``If you want to win an issue, you have to do what the
tobacco industry did _ not only lobby, but do grass-roots work and
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton swiftly promised retribution against the
opponents of the tobacco legislation, saying he would try to make
the death of the bill an issue in the midterm congressional
elections. Republicans ``may believe that the $40 million in
advertising by the tobacco companies changed public opinion
irrevocably and permanently, and therefore, it's safe to walk away
from the biggest public health obligation that this country has
today,'' he said. ``I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   But as combatants on both sides hurled charges and
countercharges Thursday, there were few indications that tobacco
would emerge as a major issue in November's elections. There are
few congressional races where the tobacco bill is much of an issue,
and in those places _ principally tobacco states such as North
Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky _ the major candidates almost
uniformly opposed the tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no national issue here,'' said Burdett Loomis, a
political scientist at the University of Kansas. ``An occasional
candidate might be able to make something out of this, but not
many. And people had no expectation that this bill would pass
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the end of the tobacco bill may help some congressional
challengers portray their rivals as tools of big-money interests.
In the Seattle suburbs, for example, former Democratic
Representative Jay Inslee has been describing two-term GOP
Representative Rick White, who opposed the measure, as out of touch
with his constituents and too cozy with special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the bitter divisions produced by the tobacco debate _
divisions produced by classic conflicts between freedom and
responsibility _ underscore the potency that taxes have had in the
American political discourse since colonial days. In the past
quarter-century, moreover, the pressure against hiking taxes has
grown substantially, as the public increasingly has adopted the
view that taxes are the oxygen of big government.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that taxes themselves are as much an infringement of
personal liberty as other forms of government oppression was once
the province of conservative theorists. But it was popularized by
Ronald Reagan and then adopted gradually across the political
spectrum _ so much so that when the tobacco companies searched for
a weapon to defeat the Senate bill, they gladly picked up the
anti-tax cudgel.
</P>
<P>
   Even proponents of the tobacco measure acknowledged this week
that once the legislation was transformed in the public debate into
a tax bill, the effort was lost. By acknowledging that the tobacco
bill would increase revenues, its proponents made the legislation
vulnerable to charges that it was a means of financing new
government spending.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the financial scope of the legislation ballooned _ so
much so that it popped. The bill the Senate walked away from this
week was around $150 billion bigger than the original agreement
worked out with state attorneys general one year ago this Saturday.
Most of that money was to be paid by consumers, not the tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It quacked like a tax increase and waddled like a tax increase _
and in the end, it died like a tax increase.

STEVIE NICKS: ETHEREAL SIREN IN THE EYES OF HER FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The audience squealed with pleasure every time Stevie
Nicks twirled in the spotlight at Radio City Music Hall on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing long Renaissance-princess dresses of velvet and sequins,
stroking the ribbons that dangled from her microphone and changing
shawls with nearly every song _ gold for ``Gold Dust Woman,'' white
for the ``white-winged dove'' of ``Nightbird'' _ Ms. Nicks was
still, for her fans, the otherworldly siren who sang ``Rhiannon''
with Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A less worshipful listener heard something else: a singer with
an out-of-tune croak enthusiastically working her way through two
decades' of dewy-eyed narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial blockbuster of Fleetwood Mac's reunion
tour, Ms. Nicks is on the road with her own band, reveling in the
spotlight. ``The greatest pleasure I've ever had onstage is to be
able to actually talk to my audience,'' she chattered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nicks has been praised by performers from Sheryl Crow to
Courtney Love as a feminine, sensual, self-possessed pioneer. On
her solo recordings, which have been anthologized on ``Enchanted''
(Atlantic), Ms. Nicks has moved between earthy directness and goofy
invocations of rain, doves and angels.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ms. Nicks identifies with elusive temptresses;
sometimes she tears apart a rival; sometimes she proffers sisterly
compassion. Her best songs, like ``Stand Back,'' tap into lovers'
contradictory impulses, with pop hooks holding together
stream-of-consciousness confessions.
</P>
<P>
   More came across as rambling adolescent diary entries. But as
long as her audience wants to believe, she can still play at being
a princess.

CLINTON PANEL MAY SEEK PERMANENT RACE COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Starting to wrap up its work, President Clinton's
race advisory board hinted Thursday it may ask him to create a
``president's council'' on race, similar to the Fitness Council or
the Council of Economic Advisers, to ensure that racial
reconciliation remains on the White House agenda.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent presidential council would bring sustaining power to
race matters and make it harder for future presidents to disband
the panel without being accused of abandoning the goal of racial
harmony, said the Rev. Suzan D. Johnson Cook, a board member from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member advisory board, appointed a year ago by
Clinton, is completing recommendations to help the president
identify ways to promote racial harmony and equal opportunity. The
board's final recommendations will be turned over to Clinton before
its one-year charter expires Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   At its final meeting Thursday, the board discussed a number of
ideas, including increasing spending on school construction,
boosting the minimum wage and promoting multi-lingualism as a way
to counter calls to make English the official language.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those ideas may make their way into a report that
Clinton will issue this winter. That report will outline not only
the president's vision but also a work plan for the public and
private sectors to help equalize opportunities across the race
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what we're hoping is that when the president turns to
the work of putting together his report to the American people that
he will be bold, and we will encourage him to be bold,'' said board
member Angela E. Oh, a lawyer from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean, a
Republican, said Clinton should seek far more than the $5 billion
over five years for school construction contained in his fiscal
1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense at all to have the schools for our poorest
children getting less resources. It should be other way around,''
Kean said.
</P>
<P>
   Without providing a figure, he suggested that additional federal
funding for school construction be explored for urban and rural
school districts in high-poverty areas and that those funds be
matched by the states. He also suggested that the federal
government work with higher education institutions to better
prepare teachers. Kean said Clinton should find a way to ensure
that academic tracking, for placing students according to test
scores, does not result in the resegregation of classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions were that Clinton seek an unspecified minimum
wage increase to boost the income of low-wage workers who are
disproportionately minorities, support collective bargaining to
ensure greater equality of pay, and strengthen enforcement of
anti-discrimination laws, all steps that Clinton has already begun
to take.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said Clinton should urge the media, particularly
television networks, to improve the portrayal of minorities. Board
member Oh suggested that Clinton should encourage English-speaking
Americans to learn another language to help reduce hostilities
against immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael D. McCurry said, ``The president
will look for ways to build on the work the advisory board has
done.'' But, he added, ``I don't want to speculate on what
direction the initiative might take.''

ANALYSIS: IN DETROIT, DIFFERENT LABOR STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Ga., Canada)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ This city's auto executives have a strong herd
instinct, imitating one another's most popular car designs and
living in the same neighborhoods, but they could not be more
different in their approaches to labor relations as this month's
strike against General Motors has shown.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in its 16th strike in the last five years, GM has publicly
lashed out this week at the United Automobile Workers. By contrast,
Ford has not had a strike in 12 years and its executives play golf
with UAW leaders. Chrysler's approach to labor relations lies
somewhere in between, with prolonged periods of calm interrupted by
occasional strikes that are usually settled behind closed doors
with little public acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Each strategy has its defenders, and there has been no sign that
any of the automakers plans to change course. GM contends that
because it produces fewer cars per worker than its rivals, it must
insist that the union allow more flexible work practices and a
steady decline in employment through attrition. GM executives have
vehemently criticized the union even as the company tries to end a
crippling strike at two parts factories in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dispute here about a local union leadership's failure
to improve some noncompetitive work practices,'' such as workers
who collect a full day's pay for half a day of work, Donald
Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American cars, said
in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The union contends that their members work hard and that GM has
broken promises to invest more money in the parts factories. The
walkouts have forced the closing of 21 of GM's 28 North American
assembly plants, including the shutdown Thursday of a
midsized-sedan factory in Oklahoma City and a minivan factory in
Doraville, Ga. GM has temporarily laid off 88,800 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sees its labor harmony as a competitive advantage, allowing
it to improve quality and transfer workers more easily from ailing
car factories to ones that make more lucrative pickup trucks and
sport utility vehicles. Chrysler works with the union most of the
time but has sometimes tried to punish local union officials who
lead wildcat strikes or take other steps that could hurt
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign automakers building cars and trucks in the United States
have kept unions out of their factories, with the exception of
their joint ventures with the Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Three's contrasting approaches to labor relations start
with the people who run them. Ford has entrusted the task since
1982 to Peter Pestillo, one of Ford's four executive vice
presidents, who is a regular golf partner and close friend of
Stephen Yokich, the president of the UAW. Chrysler has Dennis
Pawley, one of its six executive vice presidents, a rare top auto
executive who worked his way up from the factory floor and a
well-known figure among union leaders as a result. Pestillo and
Pawley both have subordinates who manage the day-to-day
relationship with the union, but they stay in touch with union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   GM's labor relations have been managed for the last several
years by Gerald Knechtel, one of its 49 vice presidents and a
target of union criticism. Union officials complain that promises
are made by many levels of GM officials with little coordination
and that bitterness results when some of these promises are not
kept.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders also complain that GM executives ignore them
except during strikes. Basil Hargrove, the president of the
Canadian Auto Workers union, said that while Knechtel's predecessor
had come to Canada twice a year to meet with union officials,
Knechtel had showed up only during the union's 1996 strike against
GM, which lasted three weeks and shut down almost all GM production
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Knechtel declined to comment, following his practice during
labor disputes. But Hackworth said that GM's frictions with the UAW
were the inevitable result of GM's need for changes and not the
result of the company's management style. GM produces more of its
own parts than Ford or Chrysler and so has higher overall labor
costs, he said. Outside suppliers of parts tend not to be unionized
and pay much lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford and Chrysler still made most of their own parts,
``they'd have a fair amount of tension in the system,'' Hackworth
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street analysts say GM is overstaffed because its
market share in the United States has dwindled for lack of popular
auto designs. Fewer workers are needed to build the shrinking
number of family vehicles that GM sells.
</P>
<P>
   GM sold 6.3 million cars and light trucks in 1985 and 4.7
million last year. By contrast, Ford's sales rose to 3.8 million
last year from 3.3 million in 1985. Chrysler's sales edged up to
2.3 million from 2.2 million in 1985 after adjusting for Chrysler's
purchase in 1987 of American Motors Corp.

NEXT CHIEF MAY LEAD MILITARY PULLBACK FROM TURKISH POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turks who believe that the military has
become too deeply involved in politics here are hoping that the
emergence of a new military commander in August will have a
profound effect on national life.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year term of Turkey's Chief of Staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki
Karadayi, who has led the military deeply into politics in an
effort to stem what he says is the rise of religious
fundamentalism, expires on Aug. 30. His successor is likely to be
an officer who believes that the military should stay closer to its
barracks and further away from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has had weak and fragmented governments for the last five
years. This week the latest in the line of embattled prime
ministers, Mesut Yilmaz, announced that he would resign at the end
of this year and that new national elections would be held in
April.
</P>
<P>
   As civilian leaders have proved unable to overcome personal and
political rivalries, the role of the military has increased
considerably. It is now the country's most potent political force,
as it showed last year by forcing the resignation of Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, whom officers accused of supporting
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   The military has also taken over principal responsibility for
Turkey's relations with Greece and other nearby countries, as well
as for policy toward Cyprus and toward this country's Kurdish
minority. It encourages prosecutors to pursue cases against
writers, journalists and politicians who express heretical views on
these or other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have compiled a list of businesses that
government agencies should boycott because they have been deemed
favorable to political Islam. They are pressing Parliament to pass
a series of anti-fundamentalist laws, including curbs on Islamic
foundations and new restrictions on the construction of mosques.
</P>
<P>
   With the military now so involved in civilian policy, and with
political parties so weak and fragmented, a change in the top
military command might have a far more profound effect on Turkish
life than an election.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish military command operates under strictly observed
rules and traditions. They dictate that Karadayi will step down in
August and that he will be replaced by the army commander, Gen.
Huseyin Kivrikoglu.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kivrikoglu has kept a low public profile and declines
requests for interviews, officers who know him and commentators who
monitor the army believe that he will seek to curb the military's
political role. Some speculate that he will transfer senior
officers who have directed the anti-fundamentalist campaign and
will abolish the West Working Group, a military intelligence unit
that closely monitors Islamic trends in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kivrikoglu gets the job, and I think he will, the army will
begin pulling back from politics,'' said a veteran newspaper and
television commentator who asked not to be identified. ``He is a
secularist and against Islamic politics, like all top military
people. But he's not an activist. He takes a more limited view of
what role the military should play in Turkish politics and
society.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The final decision about changes in the military command will be
made at the end of August by the Supreme Military Council, a panel
composed of top military and civilian leaders and headed by Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have become impatient with Yilmaz for his
failure to press harder against fundamentalism, a policy he has
adopted partly because he does not want to alienate
Islamic-oriented voters. Kivrikoglu is considered not only less
insistently anti-fundamentalist but also more positive toward
Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
   The accord this week calling for national elections in April
reflected the weakness of the Yilmaz government, which does not
have a majority in Parliament and must therefore cater to a variety
of factional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The government is so divided that its second-ranking figure,
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, said he had not signed the
accord and was not certain there would actually be elections in
April.
</P>
<P>
   As bickering among civilian leaders continued this week, the
military-directed campaign against fundamentalism continued. On
Monday, police officers used tear gas and batons to break up a
demonstration of about 1,000 Muslims who were protesting a new ban
on the wearing of head scarves by female university students. The
banned students and their supporters held more protests later in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   In Ankara, military commanders announced they had cashiered 167
officers for ``Islamist activities and poor discipline.'' As is
usual in such cases, the officers received no explanation of the
reasons for their dismissal. There is no appeal. &QL;

`SMOKE ON THE MOUNTAIN': WILDLY INFECTIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)

 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not far into ``Smoke on the Mountain'' the audience
begins tapping feet, clapping rhythmically and even singing along.
This musical, consisting largely of old hymns, is wildly
infectious. The brainchild of its director, Alan Bailey, with a
script by Connie Ray, ``Smoke'' was first seen at the McCarter
Theater in Princeton, N.J., in 1988 and in 1990 moved to the small
stage at the Lamb's Theater, where it astonished everyone involved
by playing 475 performances.
</P>
<P>
   It is now back at the Lamb's, in the main theater, with a cast
whose members fill the auditorium not only with song but also with
the sounds of piano, bass, fiddle, guitar, banjo, harp, accordion,
harmonica, cymbals, bells, washboards, wooden spoons and slats, and
even a half-filled soda bottle (great train whistle), most of them
moving from one instrument to another without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a deceptively simple comedy about a service in a
Baptist church in rural white North Carolina 60 years ago, a place
and time beautifully evoked by Peter Harrison's set. The minister
(Robert Olsen) struggles to keep control of the proceedings, but
the choir takes over. The choir is the singing Sanders family: the
quiet operator of a general store and gas station (Bobby Taylor);
his bright and slightly dotty wife (Constance Barron); his brother
(John Griffith), who is sullen but softhearted, and three children:
an awkward but very smart daughter who is the only songless Sanders
(Jonah Marsh) and younger twins (Dionne McGuire Gardner and Sean
Dooley) who give the impression that if their leashes were cut they
would steal the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   For all their sly, Bible-quoting efforts to manipulate one
another, these characters share a deep affection, and the actors so
clearly relish inhabiting the characters that the performance
becomes a delightfully engaging revelation of the rich complexity,
and downright orneriness, of simple people whose faith is powerful
but far from unquestioning. The cast is a fine ensemble. They feel
like a warm old-fashioned family, and they know how to make the
audience feel right at home. All that clapping and singing along
seems as natural as breathing.

KOSOVO REBELS START STRIKING BACK AT SERB FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ After taking losses in their fight with
the Yugoslav military, separatist rebels in Kosovo Province have
been bolstered by a huge infusion of weapons and fighters from
Albania and have begun to hit back in recent days, Western
diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army have set up roadblocks
on key roads in the province, setting off frequent clashes with the
Serb forces, the diplomats say. There are also daily skirmishes
near Serb police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the increased fighting, the Serbs have been
forced to move in huge, unwieldy convoys of troops, the diplomats
say. Between 40,000 and 50,000 Serb soldiers and special police
forces are now deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel bands control as much as 40 percent of the province, and
the ranks of the guerrillas have swelled since March from a few
hundred fighters to more than 3,000. Weapons, carried by pack
horses and mules, can be seen arriving nightly across the rugged
border with Albania. There seems to be no shortage of volunteers to
join the burgeoning separatist army.
</P>
<P>
   The United States warned the KLA on Thursday against launching a
fresh offensive, saying could provoke another bloody crackdown by
the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. ``We are aware that the
Kosovo Liberation Army is promising another offensive to make, in
our view, the situation even worse,'' the State Department
spokesman, James Rubin, said, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo Province, the whir of helicopters ferrying wounded
Serbs to army hospitals, and the grim sounds of automatic fire and
mortar rounds can be heard just a few miles from Pristina, the
provincial capital. More than 300 people are said to have died in
the fighting this year, and many suspect that the casualty figures
may be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   As the situation spins out of control, many Western diplomats,
while calling for negotiations, now concede that the only hope of
ending the war will have to come from outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, in a move that brings it closer to an
armed confrontation with NATO, said Thursday that it would not
comply with demands to withdraw some forces from Kosovo and halt
the attacks against ethnic Albanians that have driven tens of
thousands of people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Milosevic to defy the international community
seems certain to foretell another round of fighting in the province
and will make it difficult for NATO commanders to back away from
threatened air strikes, according to Western diplomats. Any attacks
could push Washington into the center of another Balkan conflict,
this time against a Yugoslav military equipped with sophisticated
anti-aircraft systems and a large air force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Information Minister Alexander Vucic, at a news conference in
Pristina, dismissed NATO demands for a withdrawal of the special
police and military units as long as what he called KLA
``terrorists'' were still carrying out attacks. He derided the
ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the 2 million people in
the province, for not seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His message was echoed by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Zivadin
Jovanovic, who held talks with his counterpart in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   when asked if Yugoslavia would consider pulling troops out of
Kosovo, Zivadin, answered: ``It's not a foreign territory. They are
needed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Serb forces is a notorious Yugoslav Special
Operations Unit known as the JSO, which was involved in some of the
worst atrocities of the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Its troops have been using an armored personnel carrier in
Kosovo that was seized from Dutch U.N. peacekeepers during the Serb
massacre of some 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995, according to
Dutch diplomats. Its force of a few hundred men are used to carry
out commando raids, and its presence in Kosovo is seen by many
outsiders as an indication that new attacks are being prepared by
Belgrade against rebel strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting between the rebels, who want to make Kosovo a
separate state, and the government intensified in March after
Belgrade ordered special police units to crush the center of the
rebel operations in Drencia in central Kosovo. The attacks, which
leveled villages and killed more than 80 people, most of them
civilians, enraged a population that had been content to resist
Belgrade through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, after promising U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke last
month that he would begin talks with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova to stave off a threat of sanctions, stepped up his campaign
against the rebels earlier this month. His forces, for the first
time backed by army units, drove some 80,000 people from their
homes along the border with Albania and burned and shelled
villages. The drive was apparently intended to hamper the infusion
of fighters and war materiel into the country.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attacks, which included heavy shelling, led the
Western alliance to threaten Milosevic with air strikes if he did
not withdraw his units, end the attacks and begin talks with Rugova
to return Kosovo's autonomy that was revoked eight years ago by
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, after a Moscow meeting on Tuesday with
President Boris Yeltsin, failed to accept the demands of the
so-called contact group, which includes Russia and five other major
powers, to withdraw his special units. The contact group was formed
to handle the crisis in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO planners had little option but to consider air strikes
against Serb targets in Kosovo,'' said a European diplomat.
``Milosevic only understands one language, and we are not speaking
it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough stance by Belgrade has stiffened the resolve of the
ethnic Albanian leadership and moved it closer to endorsing armed
rebellion. The so-called government in exile for Kosovo Thursday
called on ethnic Albanian villagers in Kosovo to defend themselves
against Serb attacks. The statement, made in Tirana by the five
leading political parties, dealt another blow to Rugova's avowed
pacifism. The parties, however, did not endorse a request by the
KLA leadership to be declared the army of the government, ethnic
Albanian leaders said.

   NEW YORK _ When it comes to considering their own mortality,
there's no people like show people. In the movie ``All That Jazz,''
you may recall, the director and choreographer Bob Fosse turned his
alter-ego's expiring moments into a splashy production number set
to the tune of ``Bye Bye Love.'' Now William Finn, the composer of
the wonderful ``Falsetto'' musicals, translates his
life-threatening experiences on the operating table into an evening
of song and dance called ``A New Brain.'' Kander and Ebb got it
wrong, it seems; it's death that's the cabaret.
</P>
<P>
   ``A New Brain,'' which opened Thursday night at the Mitzi
Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, is the latest in a series of
plays Off Broadway this season that are rimmed in a mortal frost.
Arthur Miller's ``Peters' Connections,'' A.R. Gurney's ``Labor
Day'' and Craig Lucas' deeply provocative ``Dying Gaul'' all, to
some degree, look at life from the brink of the grave. Finn's ``New
Brain,'' in addition to being the most directly autobiographical,
is by far the jauntiest and least probing of the lot. Life is a
gift horse, it seems to say; just accept and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   This affirmative tone should surprise fans of Finn's earlier
work. In ``Falsettos,'' which earned its two Tony Awards, he
explored the dissonance in gay, straight and familial love with a
sharp, deliberately jagged score and lyrics. Though clearly
descended from the school of Sondheim, the show turned neurosis
into song in exhilaratingly original ways. It was the tension and
the sense of struggle in the music that gave it such electric life.
</P>
<P>
   These elements are things to be purged in ``A New Brain,'' which
takes its central character, a composer named Gordon Michael
Schwinn (Malcolm Gets), through a transformational tour of the
valley of death. Inspired by a recent period in Finn's life in
which he was wrongly believed to have an inoperable brain tumor,
the show's dominant tone is of a cosmic gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that for Finn (and probably, alas, for most
people), happiness is definitely a blander muse than anxiety. ``A
New Brain,'' which has been directed with wit and elegance by
Graciela Daniele, has moments of captivating eccentricity. But
watching it is often like passing a group of animated, slightly
drunken revelers on the street: You're glad they have something to
celebrate, but it's a private party, and you walk on by with a
faint smile.
</P>
<P>
   Finn originally conceived what became ``A New Brain'' as a
series of revue numbers, and it might have worked better in that
format. As a story, shaped by Finn and his longtime collaborator,
James Lapine, the show has a spliced-together feeling, a
disjunctive quality at odds with the holistic spirit it seems to be
aiming for. Schwinn's childhood memories, sickbed hallucinations
and encounters with loved ones are all set to music, but they only
rarely acquire the sort of emotional tug that made ``Falsettos'' so
affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The show's framework is provided by a song Schwinn is composing
for a children's television show, which stars a man dressed as a
frog called Bungee. When Schwinn collapses into a plate of ziti
while lunching with his friend Rhoda (Liz Larsen), he has yet to
complete that song (it's about frogs in the springtime) and the
specter of unfinished work will haunt him throughout his ensuing
ordeal of examinations, surgery and recovery in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bungee (amusingly played by Chip Zien), or the fantasy version
of him, is an active presence in these scenes, tooling around on
his green bicycle and offering alternately chirpy and shrill bits
of wisdom. The use of the character is the show's freshest device,
and the frog-man figures prominently in Schwinn's climactic embrace
of childlike wonder. But the fact remains that Bungee is a
loathsome creature, and it would be far more gratifying to see him
strangled.
</P>
<P>
   The evening is most persuasive when its subject is frustration.
The opening number, in which Schwinn is working with disdain and
exasperation on the Bungee song, is charming and funny; so, in a
creepier vein, is the spectacle of Schwinn's doctor (John Jellison)
delivering a muddled diagnosis with a mad-scientist fervor. And two
of Schwinn's hallucinations, respectively embodied by Ms. Larsen
and Michael Mandell, in a scene-stealing turn as a jocular nurse,
have a weird, compelling spikiness.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, ``A New Brain'' finds Finn using smoother, more
conventional harmonies and rhythms than he has before. There's a
strong quotient of gospel, Motown and doo-wop effects. And when the
ensemble bursts into lyrics like ``You gotta have heart and
music/heart and music get along,'' the show bizarrely brings to
mind ``Godspell,'' not the first musical you would have associated
with the creator of ``Falsettos.''
</P>
<P>
   The production, the first to come out of Lincoln Center's
recently established workshop for new musicals, looks great, with a
set by the ever-inventive David Gallo that finds convincing visual
metaphors for the out-of-body experience. And the cast is
top-notch. Gets brings an amiable looseness to his part, a sort of
go-with-the-flow passivity that suits the material without seeming
shapeless. Penny Fuller, as Schwinn's mother, and Christopher
Innvar, as his lover, are appropriate mixtures of prickliness and
comfort. And the invaluable Mary Testa shows up as a homeless woman
who offers a downside philosophy of life that Schwinn must
incorporate (sort of) into his revitalized worldview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniele, too, is in good form, making spirited and ingenious
use of such unlikely props as hospital walkers. Often you feel that
her choreography defines the characters more specifically than what
they sing or say. Presumably, her repeated evocations of Bob Fosse
routines are deliberate, an acknowledgment that it's hard to watch
``A New Brain'' without thinking of ``All That Jazz,'' which
traversed very similar territory with a very different attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse's movie was, on some levels, insufferable, smug and
self-disgusted at the same time. But it had a strident vitality
that kept you hooked, even against your will. Finn's musical is far
more good-hearted and likable, but it feels at best distant and at
worst like a singing, inspirational Hallmark card; it doesn't grab
you while you're watching it or stay with you afterward. This
doesn't seem fair, does it? But as ``A New Brain'' itself observes
on several occasions, human life is strong on neither justice nor
logic.

   French legend has it that the two spurs of rock jutting
ominously from the sea in the ``bay of angels,'' near Nice, are
shaped like the fins of ``angel sharks'' that once upon a time
devoured the bodies of invaders shipwrecked while navigating the
area's treacherous waters. In Manuel Pradal's stunningly beautiful
film, ``Marie Baie des Anges,'' those rocks and the pearly waters
surrounding them become a riveting metaphor for the savagery of
teen-age sexual rites.
</P>
<P>
   In this dizzying paganistic ode to Eros, where the camera almost
never stops moving, the angel sharks have been replaced by the
bodies of restless, hot-blooded adolescents diving and treading
water and nipping on each other in the shadowy depths. The
comparison is made explicit in a scene in which a pubescent swimmer
with an angelic halo of blond hair is shot and the water slowly
turns deep red.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the film _ whose cast largely consists of
nonactors gleaned from French stadiums, beaches, Gypsy camps and
housing projects _ is a brooding, sensual 15-year-old girl named
Marie (Vahina Giocante) who runs wild one summer. Marie snubs the
impoverished local boys in favor of a group of arrogant American
sailors who take her to nightclubs and hotels. Then having had
their way with her, they discard her with brutal contempt, calling
her a Gypsy whore. Marie ends up sharing a brief idyll with Orso
(Frederic Malgras), a rootless, pug-faced petty criminal who robs
houses and hangs around with the local youth gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Baie des Anges'' is filled with ominous images of men in
packs. Whether on the prowl for girls or for a fight, the energy of
their giddy, reckless camaraderie is charged with physical danger.
In one scene, Marie does a wild Gypsy dance for the sailors who
encircle her with a whooping euphoria that you feel could at any
second turn ugly. In another scene, a group of sailors in a car are
chased by the local boys on motorbikes after exchanging insults.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes give you the feeling that gang rape and gang war
are almost the same thing and that given the right circumstances
they are inevitable eruptions of male aggression.
</P>
<P>
   For a movie that celebrates the raw sexual energy of
adolescence, ``Marie Baie des Anges'' is surprisingly unexplicit.
The sexual encounters, instead of being set up the way they are in
most films, are brief gawky episodes in a continual game of
roughhouse. If they're intense, they're also no big deal. They're
simply part of the natural ebb and flow of the characters' animal
exuberance. These youths have no apparent physical
self-consciousness. You sense that none have ever seen a
Stairmaster or lifted a barbell.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, the images of water, rocks and half-naked bodies
merge into a vision of the film's characters as untamed forces of
nature who are the fauna of the environment in which they cavort.
Viewed this way, you begin to stop thinking of them as civilized
humans bound to any social or moral order, even when they commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   This dizzy lyricism comes at a price. The movie has no sense of
time, and its story line isn't always clear. The life it evokes is
one big swirl of ceaseless physical activity and raw sensation. It
is about as far away as you can get from the icky, coy Hollywood
``primitivism'' of ``The Blue Lagoon.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: OH, PROMISE ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton policy for dealing with major dictatorships is now
fully revealed in its magnificent simplicity _ speak softly, throw
away sticks, drop gracefully to one knee, present gifts and sing
``Oh, Promise Me.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some years, the policy has been no secret to the dictators
or those Americans who bother to pay attention. The results have
been productive, no denying that.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For China it produced U.S. satellite technology to sharpen the
aim of its missiles, for North Korea a growing trade in the export
of missiles and for Iraq a free hand to slaughter all Iraqis who
oppose Saddam Hussein and a plan to end sanctions and start again
to rebuild its military power. For America it also produced
something: a trash can full of broken promises.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright added a
high shine to Clintonian appeasement policy by including under its
sheltering arms the government of Iran. Yes, indeed, the Iran that
executed thousands of its own citizens, held 53 Americans hostage
for 444 days in the U.S. Embassy, the same Iran that boasts of its
infiltration of Bosnia, that killed Jews in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, and almost daily sends to Damascus a planeload of
weapons and funds for terrorists around the world.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As arranged, President Clinton, the Great Crooner himself,
joined in the song, asking for ``a sense'' that Iranians ``are
prepared'' to turn away from terrorism and distribution of weapons.
Just promise me a sense; national policy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this followed his decision not to apply sanctions against
Russia and France for providing the money to develop an Iranian gas
field. That was prelude and signal to Albright's offer to work with
Iran on a ``road map'' to friendship if only Iran would behave
better; never mind the murder and hate Iran has spread around the
word.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was supposedly made because Iranians elected a
``moderate'' as president. But the United States and every other
nation knows that political, military and government power is not
held in Iran by President Mohammad Khatami _ who incidentally
spreads non-moderate hatred himself whenever he is in the mood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those powers are held by a regime of fundamentalist ayatollahs
and their security armies, who turned the country into a hell for
Iranians and the command post for international terrorism. As
recently as March 25, Bruce Riedel, the top Iran officer for the
National Security Council, said Iran was the ``principal state
sponsor'' of terrorist groups in the Mideast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clintonian rationalization will be that the choreographed
overture to Iran is support for Iranians who voted for Khatami. In
truth, it will strengthen their tormentors, make it more difficult
to overthrow them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By pretending that the Iranian regime that lives by terrorism
might end it, by absolving countries pouring money into the
government and therefore its killers and floggers, the U.S.
announces it will not try to punish or even hamper the regime, and
despite the past, would help it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why does Clinton do these things _ approve strengthening Chinese
missile forces, permit Saddam to slaughter his people, build the
prestige of the Iranian despotism, court dictators, and earn
nothing much more for the United States than a good view of the
backsides of our European allies as they walk away from us toward
the trade troughs of tyrannies? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let Clinton and his entourage conjure up phony rationalizations
_ but we know, we know and so does Congress. Money.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like most of America's allies and partners, trade is his
overriding goal in dealing with the dictatorships _ trade, not
freedom, not human rights, not principle. He has lined America up
at China's trough, costing America $50 billion a year for the
privilege, and is now jostling for a similar place at Iran's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the mirage of money, under the tutelage and rod of
China-trade lobbies, he leads America to suffer political loss and
humiliation, threats to its security and the end of principle in
foreign policy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wonder _ by now is he even capable of seeing where American
principle lies? After all, it does not show on the balance sheet _
that is, not until some new Pearl Harbor, or invasion of Kuwait, or
some second explosion at the World Trade Center, something like
that.

 &HT;    PSC maps out gas deregulation details
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Companies that plan to participate in Georgia's
soon-to-be deregulated natural gas market are maneuvering for
position with less than one week left before the Public Service
Commission sets ground rules for just how competition will work.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC staff and representatives of the marketing companies,
including Atlanta Gas Light Co., held talks Thursday for the second
straight day, seeking an agreement on operational details of the
new system.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new state law, sales of natural gas will be opened up to
competition later this year, much in the way long-distance
telephone service has been deregulated. Atlanta Gas Light Co. will
become a distribution company responsible for transporting gas to
homes and businesses. Marketing companies will be responsible for
selling gas to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Energy Services Co., a subsidiary of Houston-based Shell
Oil Co., became the third company Thursday to apply for
certification as a marketing company for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Raymond, president of the Shell energy marketing unit, said
the company sees ``an opportunity for a viable business'' and plans
to court all of AGL's 1.4 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Enron Corp. and PG&AMP;E Energy Services of California
have already filed papers. Up to a dozen companies are expected to
apply before the July 16 deadline. Competition begins Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   C. Alan Martin, marketing director at Southern Co., said the
parent of Georgia Power Co. is considering getting into the gas
market. ``It's changing so rapidly,'' he said of the PSC's
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, discussions dealt with such issues as how a
computer system will track gas sales, and the amount of information
marketing companies will get from Atlanta Gas Light Co. on
potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   AGL has also aked for an $18.6 million rate increase, in part
to pay for the transition to competition. But the PSC staff is
expected to recommend a $30 million rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   That issue, along with ground rules for competition, are
expected to be decided by the five-member commission next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission and several marketing companies, however,
expressed concern Thursday that Atlanta Gas Light and its marketing
affiliate may have jumped the gun on the deregulation process.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are about 500 letters sent by Atlanta Gas Light
Services, AGL's marketing affiliate, to prospective business
customers seeking authorization to access their accounts at the gas
company to help prepare sales proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Whisenhunt, president of Atlanta-based PS Energy Group,
said it was ``presumptuous'' for the affiliate to send letters
using the Atlanta Gas Light name before the PSC rules on a
complaint from marketing companies seeking to bar use of the name.
The companies argue the name recognition gives AGL an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sarena D. Burch, associate general counsel at SCANA Energy, said
her South Carolina-based company had been told it was too early to
solicit business and the mailing was ``a violation at least of the
spirit'' of the deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clifton Payne, vice president of Atlanta Gas Light
Services, said the company has a right to use its name of choice.
He also denied the letter was a solicitation. ``We're not making an
offer,'' Payne said. ``We're asking a prospective customer for
information that allows us to tailor a service offer this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Baker, chairman of the PSC, said the mailing appeared
premature and said all marketing companies should be granted equal
access to consumer information.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC staff is expected to make a recommendation soon on
whether Atlanta Gas Light Services can proceed using the AGL name.
Jim Hurt, the state's consumer utility counsel, has recommended the
name be approved.
</P>
<P>
   In another last-minute flareup, Atlanta Gas Light Co. and SCANA
are facing off at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the
federal agency that regulates interstate gas sales, over gas
supplies for the Georgia market.
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Caudill, vice president/rates and regulatory affairs at
AGL Resources Inc., the gas company's parent, said the company is
seeking authorization from FERC to pass along to consumers the
benefits of discounted rates for gas from an interstate pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, SCANA filed a protest that has delayed a decision
in an apparent bid for competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Burch said her South Carolina company simply wants ``more time
to examine'' the issue.

 &HT;    Credit card processor Nova to buy competitor
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Credit card processor Nova Corp. agreed to acquire
Nashville-based rival PMT Services in a stock swap valued at about
$1.23 billion, based on Thursday's closing price of $33.93 3/4 for
Nova's shares, which fell $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   PMT Services jumped $2.31 1/4 to $22.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to be completed in late September or early
October, would make Atlanta-based Nova the nation's fourth-largest
provider of credit card processing for merchants, after First Data,
National Processing and Paymentech. Nova is now fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, with revenue of $1 billion and 1,600
employees, would manage 350,000 accounts on which about $40 billion
is charged a year. First Data, which plans to move its headquarters
to Atlanta from New Jersey, is nearly six times larger, processing
$232 billion in transactions for merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Nova, which said it doesn't plan any layoffs after the merger,
authorizes credit card and debit card transactions for merchants,
captures the data and pays the merchants. It also provides
value-added services, such as information on how frequently
customers shop.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Grzedzinski, Nova's chairman, president and chief
executive, said the companies complement each other and can
continue to grow together.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction ``broadens our distribution in a dramatic way,''
Grzedzinski told Bloomberg News. PMT Services gets clients through
its sales force, and Nova will offer its services largely through
banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nova, which first offered its shares to the public in 1996 at
$19 each, has made more than 90 acquisitions since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a consolidating industry, it's safe to assume we'll be
actively and aggressively pursuing acquisitions of card portfolios
and of companies,'' Grzedzinski said.
</P>
<P>
   PMT Services shareholders will receive 0.715 of a share of Nova
stock for each PMT Services share they hold. All told, Nova plans
to issue a total of 36.2 million shares. Nova now has a similar
number of shares outstanding, said James M. Bahin, vice chairman
and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will boost earnings ``modestly'' in the first year,
Bahin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus estimate among analysts is for Nova to earn
about $1.20 a share in 1999,'' he said. ``What we've indicated is
that _ excluding merger-related costs _ we would be in the 5 to 7
percent range higher than the $1.20 estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The following year, we would expect to be at least 10 percent
higher than the analysts' estimate of about $1.55 a share,'' Bahin
added.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's merger announcement, analysts had expected
Nova to earn 75 cents a share this year, a 29 percent increase from
last year's 58 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the payment processing industry has been stiff,
hurting pricing and profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the case at our end of the business,'' according to
Bahin. ``Both Nova and PMT have focused on small- to medium-sized
merchants, as compared to some of our larger competitors, who focus
on larger chain merchants _ and that is a competitive business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahin said consolidation in the banking industry hasn't hurt
Nova so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, it has impacted us very positively,'' he said. ``We
have aligned ourselves with acquisitive banks, such as First Union
and Regions Financial.''
</P>
<P>
   First Union owns 21 percent of Nova's shares outstanding, Bahin
said. That will drop to about 10 percent when the deal with PMT
Services is completed, he said. First Union got its stake in 1996,
when the two companies combined their merchant processing units.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom, which provided the initial seed money for Nova and
continues to provide the company's telecommunications links, will
see its stake drop to about 2.5 percent from 5 percent, Bahin said.

COMMENTARY: WHAT! NO `DRACULA'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To whip up some chatter about movies, the American Film
Institute polled 1,500 ``prominent'' Americans to select the 100
best American films of all time, and the results are in. So let's
chatter:
</P>
<P>
   Will no one save us from ``It's a Wonderful Life''? Not those
prominent Americans. This sentimental turkey stuffing, which is
served up every December with all the rest of Christmas'
inescapable fixin's, finished at No. 11 in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   It first appeared in 1946 when a generation hardened to reality
by the Depression and war let it pass without saluting. They knew
from bitter experience that the whole town never turns up to
slather its George Baileys in money and love.
</P>
<P>
   The movie caught on only later, in the television age when the
country was far enough removed from hard times to put up with such
hokum about human nature. Now here it is: officially certified by
the American Film Institute as the 11th-best movie of all time.
Mean old Lionel Barrymore, you told it like it was.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of seeming to pick on good, worthy James Stewart,
all connoisseurs of politics will surely agree that ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington'' is the worst movie ever made about a
politician. The portrait of the Senate is absurd and vicious. Mr.
Smith himself is a boob so dense that he should never have been
allowed to go to Podunk, much less Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this childish slur on the American political system finished
as No. 29 in the poll. There are three quite wonderful and very
wise movies about politics _ ``Advise and Consent,'' ``All the
King's Men'' and ``The Great McGinty.'' None make the list.
</P>
<P>
   And where is ``Dracula''? At No. 87 we find the Boris Karloff
``Frankenstein.'' (Hurray!) Yet ``Dracula'' is missing. Instead, at
No. 88 we find ``Easy Rider.'' Couple of guys on dope go around on
motorcycles and, all too briefly, meet Jack Nicholson. It
supposedly spoke eloquently to alienated youth of the 1960s, but so
did ``The Graduate,'' which makes the list as No. 7. How much
eloquent speech does alienated youth deserve now that it's moved on
to disillusioned middle age?
</P>
<P>
   No ``Dracula''! How can we take this list seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Especially when there is no Edward G. Robinson either. We get
two ``Godfathers'' (Brando version plus Part II with De Niro), but
no gangsters at all from the Warner Brothers mob, which included
Robinson, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   The incomparable Cagney barely makes the list with ``Yankee
Doodle Dandy,'' which squeaks in as No. 100.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Little Caesar'' to ``Key Largo,'' there is enough great
gunfire from Robinson to justify consolidating the two
``Godfathers'' into a single entry, thus making room for a figure
far more vital to American culture than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here at No. 53 is ``Amadeus,'' a whimsical fiction based on
the improbable supposition that Mozart might have been murdered by
an envious colleague.
</P>
<P>
   If the voters were trying to prove that Hollywood can do
classical stuff as niftily as it does oaters and capers, it should
have passed up ``Amadeus'' in favor of Max Reinhardt's 1935 version
of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' starring such unlikely and
excellent Shakespeareans as Cagney and Mickey Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Gunga Din'' failed to make the top 100 speaks poorly
about the prominent voters. The greatest boys' adventure movies of
all time are obviously unknown to them.
</P>
<P>
   They also ignore ``The Man Who Would Be King'' and the
unsurpassable ``Prisoner of Zenda'' that starred Ronald Colman,
Madeleine Carroll, Raymond Massey and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Nor do
they list a single one of Sean Connery's James Bond films.
</P>
<P>
   These prominent Americans must have been too busy becoming
prominent ever to have experienced the ecstasy of chewing Jujubes
while Gary Cooper was ordering his pirate's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   But you grown-ups, look at this: Goldwyn's silly 1939 version of
``Wuthering Heights'' is rated the 73rd best American film of all
time. This is the one in which Emily Bronte's monstrous Heathcliff
is turned into smoldering, beautiful, young Laurence Olivier and
ends up cavorting dead in the heather with his beloved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the greatest Hollywood treatment ever of Victorian
fiction is completely overlooked. It is David O. Selznick's ``A
Tale of Two Cities'' with Ronald Colman mounting the guillotine and
Blanche Yurka knitting as heads roll. Just as good as Dickens, and
only half as long.

 &HT;    Chamber trying to get handle on metro congestion problems
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In a conference call meeting of the Sears, Roebuck
board of directors on Thursday, a fellow director asked A.D.
``Pete'' Correll how upset the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce
was to see a section-front story in The Wall Street Journal that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The story's headline was: ``Is Traffic-Clogged Atlanta the New
Los Angeles?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the kind of national story Atlanta boosters want to
read.
</P>
<P>
   For Correll, who is both chairman of the Atlanta chamber and CEO
of Georgia-Pacific, the question was especially timely. Only that
morning, Correll and the chamber unveiled plans for a six-month
effort to come up with an action plan to address the metro area's
transportation and air quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is stepping head-on into an issue that has paralyzed
the community. Despite months of studies and meetings, various
state or regional entities haven't been able to fashion a
resounding consensus on this complex and politically volatile
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber hopes to be the catalyst, as it has in the past when
economic well-being hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the big issues that Atlanta has faced over the
years _ the Olympics, the civil rights movement, issue after issue,
we have solved it through a broad consensus,'' Correll said. ``In
every instance that I'm aware of, the business community has been
at the table and in many cases has organized the forum that led the
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a need for leadership on the issue, the Atlanta chamber
started pushing forward an idea of an influential group of the key
players from both business and government. The prime movers were
Correll and Atlanta Chamber President Sam A. Williams, who was not
present at his chamber board meeting Thursday because of the death
of his 94-year-old father.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber's initiative could fill a vacuum that has existed
for months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta's transportation problems have not been a state
priority, and looming elections don't help. Gov. Zell Miller has
put off much of the issue to the next governor, and other key
offices, such as lieutenant governor, also are on the verge of
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Regional Commission has tried to address the issue
on a metrowide basis, but it lacks the muscle to get its
recommendations sanctioned by state officials or respected by local
developers or government officials. The Regional Business
Coalition, which has been studying the air quality issue, also has
shied away from bringing state agencies to the table to discuss
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal article, a summary of long commute times, air
quality problems and even incidents of road rage, shows the world
is beginning to take notice. And that, as much as anything, may
prod leaders to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue really does threaten our way of life in Atlanta,''
said Correll, who was philosophical about the article. ``When you
are the best _ clearly we are an economic miracle _ you can't
expect to have all favorable press. It's been exacerbated by us
openly addressing the issue. We are a victim of our own success.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the chamber long has been focusing on transportation
problems. Last year its ``Dream Team'' identified transportation
and quality-of-life issues as vital to Atlanta's economic
development future.
</P>
<P>
   When no other group emerged to lead on this issue, Williams and
Correll drafted the respected consulting firm of McKinsey &AMP; Co. to
help distill problems and solutions through the group named
Thursday. They also met two or three times with Miller in the past
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor has kept a low public profile on the issue,
Correll credited him with providing sound advice on how the chamber
should form the group and ensure it produces action.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the group will make its recommendations in early
December _ just after the elections but in time to bring proposals
before the General Assembly in January. That timing enables the
group to approach a newly elected governor and lieutenant governor
somewhat outside the political fray. The group will convene July 1.
The carefully selected members are not allowed to send
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to know if the Atlanta chamber's initiative will
produce the elusive consensus and real solutions. But for the first
time, it will bring key players to the table on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, ARC, the Georgia Department of
Transportation and the Environmental Protection Division will be
there along with key business and political leaders in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The potential is for the group to hand over to the next governor
a game plan he could call his own. Correll said it will be his
major initiative of the year. But as can be said of Atlanta
commutes, getting from here to there won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answers are not obvious,'' Correll said. ``If they were,
we would have done it and implemented them.''

 &HT;    Southern sells controlling stake in U.K. utility
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Southern Co. is now the 49 percent minority owner of
South Western Electricity in Britain after selling a $170 million
stake to a Pennsylvania utility.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern, which bought South Western, or Sweb,
three years ago, announced Thursday it had sold 26 percent of the
utility to a subsidiary of PP&AMP;L Resources.
</P>
<P>
   PP&AMP;L already owned 25 percent. The Allentown, Pa.-based company
now owns 51 percent of Sweb, but Southern retains operational and
managerial control.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Boren, president of Southern Energy Inc., the Southern
subsidiary that operates Sweb, said the transaction is part of the
company's practice of ``seeking strong business partners in our
international investments.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale means the loss of $15 million to $20 million in annual
profits for Southern, Boren said. But there will be ``no real
impact'' on Southern's financial results because the proceeds would
go toward other investments, such as the pending acquisition of a
network of New England power plants for $537 million, Boren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any portfolio,'' he said, ``we're constantly mixing our
assets.'' Southern acquired Bristol, England-based Sweb in
September 1995 for $1.8 billion. It was the first in a series of
high-profile foreign acquisitions that have since landed the
Atlanta company in Germany, China and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   It was also first in a series of investments by U.S. utilities
in Britain's power sector. Since Southern's acquisition, U.S.
electric companies have spent $20 billion on 12 British regional
electric distributors. Many are reportedly reassessing their
positions following disappointing financial results.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Tirello, financial analyst at Bankers Trust New York,
said Southern ``has gotten all their money out'' of its investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the first ones in at the lowest price,'' Tirello
said. ``This is gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Southern's experience in Britain has not been trouble-free.
``There were definitely disappointments,'' Boren conceded.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Conservative government blocked the company's 1996
attempt to take over National Power, a major British power supplier
then valued at $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the newly elected Labor government imposed a
``windfall profits tax'' on utilities privatized by the
Conservative government. Sweb's tax was $155 million, equivalent to
two years' profits. Because Southern had just sold 25 percent of
Sweb to PP&AMP;L for $189 million, its share was $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boren said Sweb has been a major success. Southern has reduced
prices for Sweb's 1.3 million customers, cut staff, improved
customer satisfaction and reduced power outages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's performance record is the reason PP&AMP;L is leaving
current management in place, Boren said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McCarthy, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania company, said
PP&AMP;L didn't want to exert greater control because Sweb has been
successful under Southern.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Southern's stock closed down 25
cents Thursday at $28.06 1/4.

POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS LOST WITH TOBACCO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the tobacco bill killed Wednesday was not as focused on
public-health measures as the one introduced last year, its demise
did spell the death of new funding for programs health officials
say are urgently needed, from treatment of smoking-related diseases
among the uninsured and poor to the prevention of youths from ever
starting to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop called the Senate's
action Wednesday ``public health malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill levied a new, $1.10-a-pack tax over five years, which,
combined with other penalties on tobacco companies, would have paid
for the new measures.
</P>
<P>
   Most prevention programs under the bill would target children
because 99 percent of smokers begin in their youth, according to
studies done by researchers at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to make it more difficult for kids to smoke is to
raise the tax,'' said Dr. David Rosenthal, president of the
American Cancer Society and director of health services at Harvard
University. Children are three times more sensitive to price hikes
than adults, according to the UMass research.
</P>
<P>
   The bill killed Wednesday did not have the public-health
benefits of the original bill drafted last June, which allocated
$500 million to anti-smoking campaigns, $1 billion to smoking
cessation programs and research, $368.5 billion to treat indigent
citizens with tobacco-related disease. That measure also called for
larger warnings on tops and fronts of packages and the disclosure
of all tobacco company research and advertising strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But although senators last week had gutted monies specifically
dedicated to public health measures, lawmakers and health officials
still had hoped to reinstate them in conference committee
negotiations with representatives of the House, after it had passed
a tobacco bill of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Cook, chairman of the board for the National Cancer
Society, called the setback temporary. ``The legislation would have
provided us with public policy,'' she said. ``We can continue to
move in that direction but at a slower pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen states are suing tobacco companies to recover costs
of treating smoking related diseases, with many planning to use
proceeds from the suits for anti-smoking programs as well. Both
California and Massachusetts have already combined anti-smoking
advertising with educational programs to curb smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger promised more
victories in the ``state by state battleground'' Thursday and noted
that ``real people'' would have benefited from this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Amereican Cancer Society, under the
public health provisions of the original bill introduced by Senator
John McCain of Arizona, five million smokers a year would have
received help to stop smoking, more than 20 million teenagers would
have been exposed to anti-smoking advertising, and 50 million
children in grades K-12 would have participated in school based
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope,'' Koop said, ``that the senators who derailed this
bill today lose sleep every night listening to the sound of
children taking their first puff and the sound of emphysema and
cancer patients gasping for their last breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nightmare that hundreds of thousands of American
families live with every night. I hope it keeps the Republican
leadership awake too.''

50 SEASONS OF SCULLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's very difficult to think of the Dodgers
without thinking of Vin Scully.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's be honest. It's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Scully has never thrown a pitch, hit or caught a ball for the
Dodgers. Yet Scully is the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   For so many who have come to know Scully's soothing voice, he is
more than simply a baseball announcer. He is part of the family.
</P>
<P>
   When Scully, 70, gets behind the mike for the first pitch of the
1999 season, it will mark the beginning of his 50th season with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   He has outlasted all the players, general managers, managers,
even the O'Malley family. But Scully is as humble as ever, a man
thankful for his life, his family and for the opportunity he was
given to become one of the best and most famous announcers in the
history of sports broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The following conversation with Scully took place before a game
at Dodger Stadium last week:
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: You got an announcer's job with the Brooklyn Dodgers
in 1950, one year out of Fordham University. In your wildest
dreams, could you have ever imagined your career becoming what it
is?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: Oh, no. You have to remember that I wanted to do this
when I was 8 years old. When I was in college, I got a job in
Washington D.C. as a staff announcer. And that, I thought, was a
major step in the right direction. Then I was offered a permanent
job as a staff announcer in Washington. And each of those steps, I
thought, was the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best. And then, to get the Dodger job was
overwhelming. But to even project beyond my opening day of my first
season, no, you never think what's going to happen, will I survive.
Nothing like that at all, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it more than just a career to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think a man is defined by his job. You say, `There's
so-and-so the doctor, there's so-and-so the lawyer, there's
so-and-so in construction, there's so-and-so the sports announcer.'
I think your job, certainly for a man, becomes part of him, and
vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your voice alone has become such a big part of life for many
people in Southern California. You're in their living rooms via the
television. You're in their cars via the radio. Can you understand
how so many people seem to feel they know you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope they do. I really hope they do. I'm extremely aware of
two things. My good fortune, for which I have overwhelming
gratitude. And the other is I know I have a big responsibility. I
have a responsibility to all those people you just mentioned who
watch and who listen.
</P>
<P>
   I try extremely hard, as best that I can, to come to work well
rested, well studied, having done homework. I try so hard to be as
accurate as humanly possible. All of that because of the
combination of gratitude for the job and also the feeling that I
owe these people. I have a tremendous obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have a favorite Dodger season, a favorite Dodger team
or a favorite Dodger player?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well no, not really. Not to define favorite. I would say --
and I think you could understand -- when I first started, I started
with the Boys of Summer. And so when I look back on those younger,
more impressionable days, that team had a tremendous impact on me.
</P>
<P>
   Campanella, Hodges, Robinson, Reese, Cox, Snider, Furillo,
Newcombe, Erskine, Branca, the list goes on and on. So that team
has meant a great deal. The other thing, that team stayed together
for a while. So that would be a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 team, that seemed to be the most fortunate Dodger team
I've ever seen. I will always think of that team as a team of good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the first time the Dodgers won a championship
here (1959). I will also think of that as something precious and
special.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With so many great moments in Dodgers history, was there ever
a moment when it was nearly impossible for you to remain an
unbiased announcer and not a fan who just wanted to stand up and
cheer and show emotion?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'll put it to you this way. In 1955, I was doing the last
half of the last game when the Dodgers won the World Series. And it
was the only one the Brooklyn Dodgers would win. And they had gone
through a great amount of frustration over the years.
</P>
<P>
   So at the very end, on the last out, the ground ball to short,
the throw to first, I said, very simply, `Ladies and gentlemen, the
Brooklyn Dodgers are the champions of the world.' And all that
winter, people asked me, `How could you have been so calm?' And the
answer was that I wasn't calm at all. But if I had tried to say
another word, I would have broken down and cried, it was so
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Another time certainly would be Kirk Gibson's home run (in the
1988 World Series). The fact that it was such a theatrical home
run. He wasn't on the bench, then he limped out onto the field. A
fellow on one leg swinging really feebly several times. And then to
hit a game-winning World Series home run, that was pretty dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way there have been so many. The three perfect
games, the 20 no-hitters that I've seen. All of those were great
moments. But there are only one or two where I had to hold myself
in check, and certainly, the Brooklyn Dodgers' world championship
and the Kirk Gibson home run would be high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has been the most difficult part of your job? Is it the
travel, the time away from family?
</P>
<P>
   A: Exactly. I think when I'm doing the game, I'm happy, I'm
busy, I'm distracted from anything else because I'm totally
immersed in the game. But you know that's only three or four hours
of a 24-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour day at home is fine. You have plenty of things to
do, obligations, plus your own family. But on the road, those 19,
20 hours grow very heavy. And the older you get, the more you
realize No. 1, the most precious thing is time. And No. 2, when
you're on the road, as well-intentioned as you might be, you still
kill time. And that hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you know when it is time to retire, or will you ever
retire?
</P>
<P>
   A: As of right now, no, I don't think I will. As long as my
health stays, and as long as I still get goosebumps on great plays,
as long as I anticipate a game, then I know all the juices are
still flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The day that I come to the ballpark and sit there and I'm
totally distracted and daydreaming, the day that somehow or other I
say `Oh, so what,' then it would be time. But I haven't experienced
any of that, even close. I'm happiest when I'm actually doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This past year has been so eventful in Dodger history, from
the O'Malleys selling the team to the trade of Mike Piazza. Does it
surprise you or have you been around long enough to come to expect
that the game is going to change?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you get to a point of perspective where you know
nothing is forever, including yourself, including your job,
including anything and everything you see in the material side of
the world. But still, for me it was bittersweet when Peter O'Malley
made the annoucement that he was selling the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   I love the family, he's a particularly close friend of mine, so
I was sad. But at the same time I was happy because if that's what
Peter and Terry wanted, then I was happy for them.
</P>
<P>
   As far as personnel upheavals and changes, that goes with the
territory. Maybe some seem more shocking than others, but they all
come and they all go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the sale of the club have any effect on how long you'll
stay with the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   A: As far as the little relationship we have day-to-day with
News Corp., with Fox, it's been wonderful. I don't have even the
slightest doubt that this is where I want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Baseball has gone from being America's pastime to a sport
that is struggling to compete in popularity with other sports. Is
it still a great game or is money and greed ruining it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's still a great game. In fact, in my own opinion, it's the
best game. However, there are cycles, just like the seasons. There
was a long period of time where baseball was No.1. Then there was a
time, probably in the '60s and '70s, where professional football
was No. 1. Then people got tired of all the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The swing right now is to basketball. Basketball may or may not
have labor problems this summer. Eventually, the pendulum will
swing the other way. And baseball will come back.
</P>
<P>
   The big thing is the game of baseball is bigger and better than
anyone associated with the game. I can remember as a little boy,
one of the first bits of philosophy I've heard. It was: Baseball
has to be a great game to survive the people who run it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can add to that. Baseball has to be a great game to
survive the people who play it. Basically the bottom line is, it is
a great game. And no matter what happens with the labor, with the
money, with the whatever, the game itself is pure enjoyment.

 &HT;    4,000 idled at GM plant
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Kevin White and his 10-year-old daughter were looking
forward to a vacation to Disney World. But the computer installer
at a General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant had to cancel the trip.
He has the time, but not the money.
</P>
<P>
   White left the plant yesterday with about 4,000 other United
Auto Workers who won't be on the job because of a lack of parts
from two striking plants in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came out of nowhere,'' White said, ``but sometimes you
have to go through these things.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, 20 GM assembly lines in the United States, Canada
and Mexico had been idled or slowed by the strikes. An estimated 88
percent of the No. 1 automaker's North American production
capacity, about 20,000 vehicles a day, is now being lost, according
to CSM Forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   While most GM dealers across the country still have several
weeks' supply of new vehicles on their lots, deliveries of new cars
and trucks have nearly ended as the strikes have dried up the
production pipeline. GM stock was down 18 3/4 cents to $69.56 1/4
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued Thursday, but both sides appeared
entrenched as top UAW leaders began leaving Michigan for next
week's triennial convention in Las Vegas. GM's annual two-week
production shutdown begins June 29.
</P>
<P>
   GM uses that time to make adjustments for model changes or
maintenance, said GM spokesman Gerry Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   If there weren't a strike going on, workers would receive
holiday pay for the first week of the shutdown and vacation pay for
the second, he said. To be eligible, they must have worked the
scheduled workday before that holiday. However, this year, that
looks unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If workers are drawing unemployment, they will get that, but
they wouldn't get ... holiday pay,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   While most workers asked said they support the strike in Flint,
their reactions to being out of work were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going fishing or looking for a nice beach to lay on,
because what else can you do?'' said William Daniel. ``GM's got the
ball, and what we need is the parts.''
</P>
<P>
   But not having an average steady paycheck, typically $500 a
week, is causing others to worry. After leaving his shift Thursday,
White went directly to a StaffMark, an employment agency handing
out flyers as workers streamed out of the plant gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'd call me, and they gave me a T-shirt, so I'm
registered with them,'' he said. ``I just want to have enough money
to pay my bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers can file for unemployment benefits, up to $224 a week.
If denied, they can receive strike pay of $150 a week. Although
they are not on strike themselves, they will not receive
supplemental pay from GM, which normally is given during a layoff
period.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REVAMP SUFFERS SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Shays-Meehan campaign finance bill suffered a
setback Thursday when the House voted to change the rules of debate
and allow consideration of 258 amendments during seven more weeks
of floor action.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule was adopted 221-189 on a party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rule is an outrage,'' said Representative Martin T.
Meehan, the Massachusetts Democrat and co-sponsor of the bill that
would outlaw ``soft money,'' the unregulated contributions
collected by political committees. ``We've got to keep going but
this makes it difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, said:
``This would kill an ordinary bill, but this has enough public
support and legs. They think they are killing it, but this will
ultimately pass the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican and
co-sponsor of the bill, joined other Republican moderates in
agreeing to the new rule. He consented after House leaders pledged
to complete work on the legislation by the August recess, said
Shays spokesman Seth Amglott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the moderate Republican three-step,'' said Frank, who was
acting as an adviser on parliamentary questions for supporters of
the campaign finance bill. ``Ineffectual protest, followed by
abject surrender, followed by denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders argued that the campaign finance issue
deserved ``a full and open debate'' and proposed allowing
amendments not directly related to campaign finance. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and his leadership team strongly oppose the
Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   The 258 amendments to be considered for this single issue is
more than the total number of amendments approved for debate by the
House Rules Committee in the past 11/2 years, said lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley of Massachusetets, the top
Democrat on the Rules Committee, said he had never seen so many
amendments allowed for one bill. ``Maybe under Boss Tweed, but not
in my lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was at odds with the usual practice of limiting
debate and amendments since Republicans gained control of the House
in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the tactic was aimed at killing the Shays-Meehan
bill through ``death by amendment.'' They said the addition of new
provisions to the bill eventually would make it impossible to pass.
House minority leader Richard Gephardt said the change in the rules
for debate and amendments was a scheme aimed at ``talking the bill
to death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to delay this process so that this bill cannot
become law this year,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the National
Republican Campaign Committee, said changing the current campaign
laws is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need a massive overhaul of our campaign
finance laws,'' said Linder. ``Let's enforce the current law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan said, ``It is an attempt, and no one is fooled by
this blatant attempt, to drown the Shays-Meehan bill with frivolous
amendments.''

DEFINING THE STRIKE ZONE A MAJOR-LEAGUE MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman teaches
pitchers to throw nothing but strikes. Hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo
emphasizes that hitters should swing at nothing but strikes.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is a strike?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to quantify,'' Bosman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every umpire is different,'' Jaramillo said. ``I don't know
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do you tell hitters?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just swing at strikes,'' Jaramillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Something you can handle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo, who watched as the Rangers accumulated the
second-most walks in the league through Tuesday, isn't the only one
who is mystified. Just exactly what constitutes the strike zone
remains a mystery in the major leagues. Manager Johnny Oates
fiercely debated that point yesterday with plate umpire Ted Barrett
and was ejected for arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Official Baseball Rules define the strike zone as ``that
area over home plate the upper limit of which is a horizontal line
at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the
uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath
the knee cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Another common definition of the upper limit is the ``letters''
of a major-league uniform, meaning the team name across the chest.
But it's generally accepted in the major leagues that any pitch
above the waist is likely to be called a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that would be a high ball,'' outfielder Rusty
Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think the strike zone is at the letters is absurd,''
pitcher John Wetteland said. ``As long as I've been playing
baseball, it's never been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   There should be no doubt about the width of the strike zone but,
as Rangers catcher Bill Haselman said, ``Umpires are pretty
consistent, but some might give the corners more than others.''
</P>
<P>
   A common myth in baseball says the strike zone is higher in the
American League. But John Burkett, who pitched seven seasons in the
National League, said, ``I don't see a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   American League umpire Jim McKean said there was a disparity 20
years ago when AL umpires wore balloon chest protectors outside
their uniforms. ``But it hasn't been the way for a long time,''
McKean said. ``It's the same in both leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual umpires do have different strike zones. In the AL,
John Hirschbeck and Durwood Merrill have a reputation for large
strike zones, while Terry Craft and Al Clark are considered the
toughest on pitchers. One veteran umpire watcher said John Shulock
and Tim Tschida are the best at calling balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's human nature,'' Burkett said. ``If you're sitting
on the bench, there will be one guy who says that pitch was a
strike, and another guy who says no, it was a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Ted Williams used to study umpire tendencies. It
was his belief that taller umpires called more high strikes and
shorter umpires had a lower strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I know what an umpire's strike zone is, I'm fine
with anything anybody wants it to be,'' Wetteland said. ``Different
umpires have different zones, but that's fine as long as they're
consistent. That's all anybody asks of us, it's just fair to ask
them to be consistent too. No one is perfect. Everybody knows I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Another perception is that younger umpires have larger strike
zones, a reputation enhanced when rookie umpire Ed Bean was behind
the plate for Kenny Rogers' perfect game. However, it remains
difficult to get any pitch above the waist called a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, umpires will give a pitcher a little more outside and
take away balls that are up,'' Burkett said.
</P>
<P>
   But any pitcher throwing above the waist without Wetteland's
fastball is asking for serious trouble, whether it's a ball or a
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a successful pitcher, most guys have got to pitch
down,'' Burkett said. ``If I throw a ball thigh-high, I'm going to
get killed. I'm in the love zone. I have to be around the knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer said he shudders at the thought of a 95-mph fastball at
the chest being called a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to hit a 95-mile-an-hour heater at the letters,''
Greer said. ``I know because I've tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosman said the best way to get a generous strike zone from an
umpire is to throw strikes. As Bobby Witt learned early in his
career, hard-throwing pitchers who can't get near the strike zone
get no benefit of the doubt when they occasionally find the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitcher that pitches around the plate gets more pitches
swung at and gets more pitches called,'' Bosman said. ``It's part
of the penalties and rewards of pitching. If you get ahead in the
count, you get to use more of your repertoire and get a bigger
strike zone. If you get behind in the count, you have to use less
of your repertoire and get less of a strike zone.''

RUSSIA TO SEEK UP TO $15 BILLION IN NEW AID FROM IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government announced Thursday that it would
seek $10 billion to $15 billion in additional assistance from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been quietly negotiating with IMF representatives for
weeks over the conditions for additional aid. But Thursday marked
the first time that it has publicly declared its position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be serious talk about resources in the
range of $10 billion to $15 billion,'' said Anatoly Chubais, the
government's new representative for talks with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   With its financial markets still reeling from the flight of
foreign investors from emerging markets, Russia is approaching a
critical round of talks with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the second-ranking IMF official, plans to come
to Moscow early next week to meet with Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and other top aides. The purpose of his visit is take the
measure of President Boris Yeltsin's new team and assess its plans
for dealing with the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is also planning to send a separate team of experts.
But while Russia's officials and Western investment bankers have
been heartened by the reports of the IMF visit, not all the news
was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The new financing Russia is seeking would supplement an earlier
$10 billion IMF loan. But the old loan has not gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the IMF said it was delaying the disbursement of the
next $670 million installment of the $10 billion loan because the
government has not fulfilled all of the conditions for receiving
the money. The IMF indicated, however, that it expected the $670
million to be disbursed next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial markets have continued to be very shaky. One
big concern is that the Central Bank's reserves, which are about
$14.5 billion, are not sufficiently larger to prop up the ruble.
Another worry is that Russia is sitting on a mountain of short-term
debt, which it has financed by selling Treasury Bonds at huge
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, said that what Russia
needed, in effect was a ``credit line.'' The idea is to have enough
money available to reassure foreign investors of the Central Bank's
ability to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is not the only source of financing. Russia has also
sought to sell Eurobonds. Thursday, Russia sold $2.5 billion in new
bonds. But the fund is still a key source of potential financing.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF sent the Russian government a confidential memo last
week outlining its conditions for billions of dollars in new aid.
One major condition was that the government slash its deficit to
2.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product by 1999, well
under the 4.5 percent target originally envisioned by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Some pro-reform officials say they agree in principle with the
requirements but worry that the government may not be able to meet
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund's demands are sensible but also very difficult,'' a
Russian official said. ``It is necessary to do them. The question
is whether it will be possible to do them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, one condition is to enact a new tax code. But that
means winning over a Communist-dominated Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new deficit target is considered to be very ambitious. And a
suggestion that Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, be broken
up is generally considered to be unrealistic by Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais also addressed the IMF requirements Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are conditions _ some of which we will be carrying out
in any case under the government's reform course,'' Chubais said.
``But there are others we will not accept from anyone, not from any
financial organizations.'' &QL;

to make it appear that the defeated anti-tobacco bill was just
another manifestation of lawmakers' greed for more money to

BRITAIN MOVES TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Saying it wanted to end ``the scandal of poverty pay,''
the Labor government announced plans Thursday to establish a
national minimum wage for the first time in British history.
</P>
<P>
   The wage the government has set _ about $6 an hour for adults _
is not as high as union leaders had hoped. But in a country whose
once-powerful unions were all but emasculated by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, the plan was seen as an important
victory for workers' rights. It will take effect next April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard fought over many years,'' said a spokeswoman
for Unison, the country's largest union, which represents some 1.3
million workers in various professions. ``It seems unbelievable
that it should have taken this length of time to get what is a
fundamental right for workers so they do have some minimum level of
protection against being exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the plan, Board of Trade president Margaret
Beckett said the gap between lowest- and highest-paid workers had
almost doubled in the last two decades. She accused the previous
government of abandoning the working poor to the whims of stingy
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain aimed to be the cheapest rather than the best _ no
longer the workshop of the world, but the sweatshop of Western
Europe,'' she told the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, workers aged 22 and older will receive a minimum
of about $6 an hour. Those from 18 to 21 will receive a lower rate,
of about $5 an hour, which will increase to about $5.35 in June
2000. The minimum wage will not apply to younger people or to those
on apprenticeships.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, the government said, will increase the wages of some 2
million people who currently earn less than the proposed minimum,
some of whom are working for less than $1.50 an hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It will help remove the worst cases of exploitation in our
workplace, cases which have no place in modern Britain,'' Mrs.
Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservative Party, which has pressed for a
minimum income level, with pay subsidized by benefits, rather than
a minimum wage, attacked the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left this government with a golden economic legacy,'' said
John Redwood, the Conservatives' spokesman on trade issues. ``Today
the government is doing its best to destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry groups said they felt that they could live with the
new plan. ``Any higher, and we would be moving into more dangerous
territory,'' said Adair Turner, director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, adding that he did not expect
the new wage to lead to major job losses or to exert too much
inflationary pressure on the economy. ``The level announced today
allows for a reasonable and workable way forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Labor government came into power last year, it has
been examining ways of putting a minimum wage in place. But the
question of what the rate would actually be has been the subject of
bitter debate.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Low Pay Commission, set up by the government
to study the issue, recommended that the rate be set at about $6 an
hour, the rate the government has adopted. But union
representatives have pushed for about $7.70 an hour, roughly half
of the median salary for men in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Unison general secretary Rodney Bickerstaffe said the new wage
``should be seen as a starting block, not a finishing line.'' The
union, he said, ``will continue to fight not just for a minimum,
but for a decent minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions have also bitterly opposed the two-tier system under
which younger workers will be subject to a lower minimum wage than
will people over 21. ``Young workers should not be singled out for
second-class treatment,'' Bickerstaffe said. ``Show me the
supermarket which gives discounts to young people or the landlord
who reduces the rent. It's unfair, and we will continue to press
for the rate for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Beckett said the lower rate was necessary to keep young
people working and to encourage employers to train them.

WOODWARD, ON HOME SOIL, SAYS US JUDICIAL SYSTEM FAULTY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ For two years, the loudest voices in the
Louise Woodward saga have belonged to lawyers, judges, the media
and her supporters in her hometown of Elton who chanted, ``Free
Louise!''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after Woodward arrived back in England a convicted
felon, the disillusioned vocals fell &UR;  &LR; silent, and she spoke up for
herself: loudly, boldly and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear voice tinged with an American accent, Woodward
proclaimed her innocence in the death of Matthew Eappen, blamed a
flawed US justice system for her fate and insisted she has not sold
her story to the British press.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward &UR;  &LR; then made it clear: She was not to blame for the
child's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said in a
brief press conference at the Manchester Airport. ``But like I said
time and time again, I had nothing to do with his death. I did not
hurt Matthew and I did not kill baby Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was asked if she had a message for the child's parents,
Sunil and Deborah Eappen, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against her earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' Woodward replied.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the 20-year-old au pair has spoken
publicly since she was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of
Matthew, the 8-month-old infant who died in her care in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief press conference, Woodward and her family
returned to a remarkably subdued reception in Elton.
</P>
<P>
   Though yellow ribbons hung from trees and fence posts and one
sign proclaimed, ``Welcome Home Louise,'' no champagne receptions
greeted her. Reporters, not residents, were the only people
watching as her car passed through the middle of town to her home.
</P>
<P>
   And The Rigger, a pub now famous as headquarters of the Free
Louise campaign, was dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows a very deep respect that people stayed
away,'' said Christine Gray, a member of the local Woodward support
group. ``Everyone is celebrating her arrival behind closed doors
... people just wanted to sit and reflect on it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference and the drive home to Elton ended nearly
four days of pandemonium for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the SJC upheld her manslaughter conviction but
refused to order a new sentence, freeing Woodward to leave Boston
for England. The next day, she caught a first-class seat on a
British Airways overnight flight.
</P>
<P>
   Though several reporters accompanied Woodward on the plane to
London's Heathrow Airport, bodyguards _ including a Massachusetts
state trooper in full uniform paid by the airline _ barred anyone
from getting close to her or her father.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a British cameraman apparently walked by
Woodward's seat and her father jumped up yelling, ``Leave my
daughter alone!''
</P>
<P>
   The first-class tickets, worth $4,200 each, were donated by a
benefactor who wished to remain anonymous, according to Andrew
Miller, the local Member of Parliament for Woodward's home district
of Cheshire. Miller, who organized the press conference at the
Manchester airport, maintained the tickets were not paid for by a
media organization.
</P>
<P>
   When the Woodwards arrived in London, a pack of British and
American reporters and cameramen trampled each other to get as
close as possible to the somber-looking father and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were to fly from London to Manchester in a smaller
jet, British Airways told Woodward and her father that they could
not guarantee security from reporters on the plane. As a result,
Miller drove the Woodwards 200 miles north to Manchester Airport
for the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to more than 100 reporters and photographers, Woodward
said she hopes that since all of her legal appeals have been
exhausted, the ``medical community'' will take up her case, review
the physical evidence of Matthew's death and help exonerate her. On
Tuesday, her lawyers, Harvey Silverglate and Andrew Good, said
evidence would be turned over to independant panel of experts to
prove Woodward's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she wants to ``educate people'' about shaken-baby
syndrome to ``hopefully prevent mistakes being made and rush to
judgment like what happened in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward also insisted she did not get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed ``atrocious'' pre-trial publicity for a ``tainted
jury pool,'' and said politics influenced Middlesex prosecutor
Thomas Reilly's decision to try her for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm upset about the conviction,'' she said. ``It's a
conviction I don't deserve, but I think in time the truth will come
out, in time I will be cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the press conference, Woodward said she plans to
go to college and ``do what any normal 20-year-old would like to
do.'' But she also said her ordeal had changed her and that she's
learned a lot _ ``too much about American law.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said she has agreed to an exclusive interview with the
BBC. The network later confirmed Woodward will talk with Martin
Bashir, the reporter who conducted the only television interview
with the late Diana, Princess of Wales. An air date for the
program, ``Panorama'' had not been set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone in Chicago, Deborah Eappen's brother, Paul
Spellman, critized Woodward for failing to acknowlege his sister
and brother-in-law during the press conference, and said the family
is offended that she still won't acknowlege her responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable what she said; it's all hocus-pocus,''
Spellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Elton, Woodward was escorted by local police to her
front door. She bounded out of a chauffered minibus and hugged her
sister Vicky. Cassie, the family's German shepherd, joined in the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward family then posed for photographers on their front
stoop under rainy and gray skies, then disappeared into the house.
Later, Woodward withdrew to the bedroom she kept as a teenager,
filled with stuffed animals and lined with posters of British rock
groups Pulp and Pet Shop Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's arrival home was greeted with near and deliberate
silence from residents. Few villagers were on the street as
Woodward's calvacade drove by.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they are still embarrassed by images of supporters
quaffing champagne and singing soccer victory songs after
Woodward's conviction was reduced to manslaughter six months ago.
Others said they have become disillusioned after allegations that
the Woodwards misused money in their defense fund, and reports that
one of Woodward's lawyers, under arrest for drunken driving,
blurted out that she had come to believe her client was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a party situation,'' said Sandra McCabe, a family
friend who said she plans to visit the family Friday. ``Matthew is
still dead and Louise is still convicted of his death.''

ADVERTISING: MADISON AVE.'S NEW EXPLICITNESS IS OPEN TO DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new frankness and boldness are transforming the content of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A new vulgarity and tastelessness are transforming the content
of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Stop, as they once exclaimed in Certs commercials: You're both
right. Sales pitches for a wide variety of products are indeed
being infused with increasingly explicit images and language, which
until recently had been considered too daring for conventional
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to be rude, crude and sometimes lewd is bringing the
American advertising sensibility somewhat closer to the attitudes
that have long prevailed in Europe, where consumers are routinely
exposed to naked bodies, swearing and obvious sexual situations in
brand campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Though Americans are still unlikely to see a bare-breasted woman
utter a four-letter word in a commercial, provocative ploys that
were once confined to ads for niche products in fringe media _
baggy jeans advertised in snowboarding magazines aimed at young
men, for instance _ are making their way into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The penchant to test the boundaries of taste is just another
example of how advertisers try to stay contemporary, updating how
they speak and behave to reflect how consumers actually speak and
behave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about relevancy and consumer empathy,'' said Donny
Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at Deutsch Inc. in New York,
an agency known for work that sometimes challenges the limits of
taste, such as a television commercial for Kohler bathroom fixtures
that showed a man reading a magazine on the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slang, bathroom humor, jokes about sex are all part of life,''
Deutsch said. ``Using them says to consumers, `We understand you,
we speak your language, we live in the same world as you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying undraped body parts or using a vernacular term for a
child of unmarried parents is also seen as a method for marketers
to capitalize on the recent loosening of strictures in films,
television programs, music, greeting cards and other forms of
popular culture. Another factor is the increasingly detailed news
coverage of sexual topics ranging from the Monica Lewinsky matter
to the introduction of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other medium, advertising is not something that
operates in a vacuum,'' said Stuart Ewen, chairman of film and
media studies at Hunter College in New York. ``It used to be that
vulgarity had no place in public culture. Now, we live in a time
when if it sells, it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see the increase in foul language, bathroom humor and bawdy
imagery as an inevitable result of the evolution of mass
communications in American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming harder and harder'' for advertisers to attract
attention, said Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies at
New York University. ``A blitzed-out population has become
increasingly blase. So there's an accelerating desperation to make
an impression, to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others condemn the changes as ploys by advertisers to get
noticed in the same manner that children shout dirty words in
public to embarrass their parents. Those critics view the trend as
distressing evidence of the further coarsening of public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disturbing,'' said Ted Sann, co-chief executive
and chief creative officer at the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom
Group, who oversees campaigns for brands like Pepsi-Cola and Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly need to be contemporary and edgy and topical,
and even sometimes controversial,'' he added. ``But it's not
necessary to cross over the line to be in questionable taste. A lot
of people find that offensive. So why go there?''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides point to the same examples to bolster their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Backsides are being bared in advertising for underwear, liquor,
skin lotion and fitness equipment and are invoked in colloquial
expressions about ``kicking butt'' and other synonyms for ``rear
end.'' Other body parts, particularly those that differentiate men
and women, are being uncovered in photographs or referred to in
slang terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Bodily functions from passing gas and urination to vomiting and
defecation are depicted and alluded to in advertising for shoes,
automobiles, software, games _ even food.
</P>
<P>
   Earthy catch phrases or sayings with double meanings are
repeated constantly. ``Are you getting enough?'' an ad for cottage
cheese coyly asks, referring to calcium. ``Zit happens'' is a line
in an ad for acne medication, ``Fit happens'' in an ad for boots
and ``Grease happens'' in an ad for spray cleaner. And it has
become impossible to count all the variations on such lines as
``Size matters'' and ``... or are you just glad to see me?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the more daring sexual imagery, extending far
beyond traditional realms like fashion and fragrance advertising
into such categories as shampoo, beer, video games, cars and
resorts. Some ads flaunt signs of arousal, others are festooned
with phallic symbols while still others present simulations of
sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Though a good deal of this advertising is salacious, in many
instances the ads are meant to be playful, elbowing consumers in
the ribs with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   That was the intent of a campaign last year to promote Bermuda
tourism. These ads showed a lovestruck couple enjoying a vacation
amid exaggerated symbols of amour: windsocks rising in a stiff
breeze, golf balls slowly being sunk, tall lighthouses looming over
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we would admit it was suggestive,'' said Peter Tate,
president of the DDB Needham New York unit of Omnicom, the Bermuda
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he added: ``The aim of the campaign was `Let yourself
go,' not `Let it all hang out.' We meant it to be tongue-in-cheek,
trying to overcome the perception of stuffiness Bermuda can have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if advertisers and agencies are only emulating writers,
musicians and others who shape popular culture, there are those who
declare that Madison Avenue ought to follow a ``higher'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising should be permitted to do what is generally being
permitted by the culture,'' said Diane Cook-Tench, director of the
Virginia Commonwealth University Ad Center in Richmond, Va. ``But
seeing that advertising still ranks low among the respected
professions, it would be smart if people in the business thought a
little harder and took the high road.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Garfield, the critic for the trade publication Advertising
Age, said: ``The relationship people have with advertising is
fundamentally different from their relationship with all other
media. In the other media, you're making a selection of what you
watch and read; there's some expectation of what you'll encounter.
Advertising, by contrast, comes into your living room absolutely
uninvited. There should be a fundamental respect for the people in
whose lives you're intruding.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of questionable material in advertising is not
new, of course. Milder forms of sexual innuendo have been used in
advertising for decades. More recently, many smaller marketers
determined that they could overcome consumer ennui _ as well as the
handicap of being outspent by larger competitors _ by lacing their
campaigns with heavier doses of suggestive material.
</P>
<P>
   Such deliberate efforts to court controversy, which Garfield
decried as ``calculatingly taking license to offend and inflame,''
have often paid off by drawing news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people accuse us of doing that,'' said Sal DeVito,
creative director at DeVito/Verdi in New York, an agency that has
developed a reputation _ and won awards _ for daring campaigns that
dance on the edge of propriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best shock in advertising is an unexpected thought,''
DeVito asserted, ``a graphic, unexpected image that communicates an
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ads by DeVito/Verdi for Daffy's, a chain of
discount clothing stores, mocked the prices charged by department
stores by arranging the sleeves of a shirt so that they made a
dismissive gesture that many consider offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain responsibility you have,'' DeVito said,
``but I'd rather show a naked person in an ad, if there's a reason
to do so, than create a cigarette ad. Which hurts society more?''
</P>
<P>
   The push to get noticed by performing the advertising equivalent
of dropping one's pants has had larger consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marginal, fringe advertisers got so much attention, that
encouraged the mainstream advertisers to misbehave,'' said Garfield
of Advertising Age. ``They began thinking `What taboo can we
break?' rather than `How can we sell product?'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the blue-chip brands that have recently sponsored one or
more ads that in some fashion tested the limits of acceptability
are Altoids, Elizabeth Arden, Audi, Bass, Budweiser, Casio,
Columbia Sportswear, Grey Poupon, Gucci, Kraft, M&AMP;M/Mars, Miller
Lite, Nike and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not every shock ad succeeds in the marketplace. Consumers
``have a litmus test,'' said Deutsch of Deutsch Inc., to assess
whether advertisers have reasons to raise eyebrows. ``They ask,
`Are you just trying to shock me or does it make sense?'''
</P>
<P>
   And the content of advertising has been kept in check by ``the
sensitivities of the clients,'' Deutsch said, as executives in
charge of advertising and marketing for consumer-product companies
_ particularly those selling to mass audiences _ shy from offending
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a CEO and you get one letter from a very real
person that says, `I'm a customer and your ads are turning me off,'
it affects them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito at DeVito/Verdi said clients could overreact to isolated
complaints. ``Some people are offended by anything,'' he said.
``It's ridiculous. They should lighten up a little bit and get a
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the DDB Needham New York campaign for Bermuda with the
lighthearted double-entendres met with what Tate, the president of
the agency, described as ``some negative reaction on the island,
particularly on the part of the editor of The Royal Gazette
newspaper and people in important religious and social positions,
who were uncomfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction _ plus, more important, Tate said, the failure of
the ads to increase tourist traffic to Bermuda substantially _
``led us to reconsider'' the campaign for 1998, he added. It has
been replaced with a much more straightforward campaign with not a
scintilla of sex or suggestiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to date has been extremely encouraging.'' Tate
added.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that the bold and brassy _ or the vulgar and
tasteless _ style of advertising is already going out of style?
Yes, and no.
</P>
<P>
   ``American society tends to pendulum back and forth between
periods of relative license and relative authoritarianism,'' said
Ewen of Hunter College, ``and advertising will always be subject to
that.'' He predicted the coming of ``a cultural terror'' that
``will drive vulgarity back into a more underground realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch agreed to some degree, foreseeing ``a more proper world,
though not puritanical.'' He based his belief, he said, on the
behavior and attitudes of ``kids who today are 12 and 13,'' who
have ``a pure, wholesome, all-American quality'' and would respond
to like-minded communication.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito of DeVito/Verdi was more philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is always changing,'' he said. ``Everything that's
controversial now, that's risque now, will not matter five years
from now.''

   There is a watercolor, painted with her happy blues and reds and
a touch of leaf green (in her work, one often finds leaf green),
that the artist Nelly Toll made as an 8-year-old child in wartime
Poland. It depicts a little girl with a red ribbon in her hair
brushing her big, docile shepherd dog in a large wash basin, while
her mother prepares food in their enormous kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog Is My Friend'' is the name of the story Ms. Toll wrote to
accompany the painting.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Ms. Toll and her mother, in 1943, had no home. Ms.
Toll's younger brother had been one of the first Polish Jews to be
sent to Auschwitz. Her father was in the ghetto, where he would
die. Ms. Toll and her mother spent much of the war hiding from the
Nazis in the two-room apartment of a gentile couple. When there
were visitors, mother and daughter hid in a space so narrow they
had to stand sideways. As for dogs, Ms. Toll had a terror of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were used to hunt Jews,'' she says, viewing slides of her
work at her New Jersey home. ``To this day I am not comfortable
with dogs. But in my picture, the girl has control of the dog. She
is washing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toll has master's degrees in counseling, art therapy and art
history. She slips into the jargon and makes a second getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a duality to my approach to life, you might say,''
Ms. Toll says. ``In my art I was able to separate. It was my escape
to a better world. I would turn every negative into a positive. If
the peasants were hateful, in my pictures they were wonderful. I
had scarlet fever; all my mother could do was put cold compresses
on my head. In my paintings when a little girl is sick, a doctor
comes to see her and she is visited by friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does the trick come from that enables one to do a reverse
print of reality, throwing up pretty watercolors in yellows and
reds when you are living in the colors of genocide and war?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toll painted 64 watercolors in the 13 months she and her
mother were in hiding. (Six will be auctioned at Sotheby's next
Friday.) All show scenes of a happy childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toll, who favors dangling earrings and has an accent
evocative of borscht, is a welcoming, exuberant sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I know you a million years,'' she says a little
while after meeting, which actually is how people feel meeting her.
An hour into lunch, understanding there is no need to ask, Ms. Toll
has moved on to the food on a visitor's plate.
</P>
<P>
   The only things she does not wish to discuss are where she lives
and teaches _ ``Just say a university in New Jersey'' _ and the
horrors of war. Pressed on what she saw as a child in Poland before
she and her mother found refuge, she prefers generalizations:
``Horrible things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ability to convert scenes of war to scenes of seeming
normalcy, Ms. Toll believes, was the gift of her mother, Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She imbued me with a sense of confidence and well-being,
nurturing me, praising me. She gave me a birthday card with little
medals; she painted them.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 54 years since her mother painted the birthday card,
but Ms. Toll remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A medal for being pretty,'' Ms. Toll says, and as she says it,
one realizes that she still is. ``A medal for working hard, for
being polite, for being kind. I wrote a play about all this a few
years ago. Somebody said I made my mother to be too much of a
saint, but that was how I knew her.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Ms. Toll's mother remarried and had another
daughter. The family came to the United States in 1951. Today, Ms.
Toll seems to inhabit the world she painted as a child: leaf-green,
happy domesticity. Married, with two children and five
grandchildren, Ms. Toll lives in a suburb of generous green lawns.
She is an adjunct professor of creative writing. She also lectures
on Holocaust art.
</P>
<P>
   During her time in hiding, did she ever paint a picture that was
not sad?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says. ``I did keep a little diary and I wrote what I
really saw. In my diary, I did two little pictures, one German
soldiers marching, one a girl kneeling. Like in prayer. There had
been a time I had been sent away and had to pretend to be the niece
in a Catholic family. I never showed this diary to my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, did she ever paint a sad picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   A hazy line separates hope from the voguish state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   When she experienced other difficulties in life, did she turn
from them? How did she behave when her mother was dying of cancer,
five years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was realistic,'' Ms. Toll says. ``I did say to her, which my
sister didn't, `You know it could reverse' or that `there will be a
new drug.' I would say this to her to the day she died. Once she
started to talk to me about her funeral and I started crying. After
this she never mentioned it to me again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my pictures once to an art therapist,'' Ms. Toll says.
``She said the girl in the pictures was pretty connected, steady,
adjusted. She is surrounded by friends; there is no sense of
aloneness without others. There was a great deal of love behind
these artworks.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wish to keep where she lives and works out of the papers?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of neo-Nazis and crazy people out there,''
Ms. Toll says. ``Why should they know where I live? Let them look
for me.''

ASTRONAUT IMPOSTOR HELD FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Galveston man who allegedly gained entry to a NASA mission
control room and a Navy flight simulator by claiming to be an
astronaut, an ex-CIA agent and a Medal of Honor winner, will be
held for further psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Calvin Botley
ruled there is probable cause to continue holding Jerry Allen
Whittredge, 49, who was jailed May 30 on a federal criminal
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Schultz said Thursday that
Whittredge will be sent to a federal medical prison facility, such
as one in Fort Worth, for observation by government psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   Public defender Marjorie Meyers contends Whittredge is not
competent for trial, based on the findings of a defense
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Botley approved a 30-day detention that could be extended for
15-day intervals if doctors need the extra time, Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Whittredge is accused of lying to federal agents on several
occasions, punishable on conviction by five years in prison per
count, and of impersonating a federal employee, punishable by three
years per count. Each offense also carries a fine of up to
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   He could be indicted on any of several counts, said Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government normally has 30 days after arrest to
obtain a grand jury indictment, the clock stopped after about two
weeks so that Whittredge's mental state could be evaluated, Schultz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Described by high school classmates in Port Arthur as a talented
orator with an interest in science, Whittredge allegedly talked his
way into a flight simulator at the Naval Air Station at Kingsville
and into NASA's mission control room in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly lied to officials at those sites to obtain access
and later to investigators in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers said family members describe Whittredge as having been
``delusional for years.'' No harm was done, other than the breach
of security, she said.

CLINTON NAMES RICHARDSON TO ENERGY, HOLBROOKE TO U.N. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday named United Nations
Ambassador Bill Richardson as his choice for energy secretary and
tapped veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke for the U.N. post.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his foreign policy team in the Rose Garden, the
president also called on Congress to pass legislation paying the
more than $1 billion the United States owes the United Nations in
back dues. The bill is stalled because conservatives insist on
including anti-abortion language in the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked closely together to make sure that our nation
remains the world's leading force for peace and freedom, for
prosperity and security,'' Clinton said. ``The lineup I announced
today maintains that exceptional standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must confirm the selections.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 50, a former New Mexico congressman who gained a
reputation as an international trouble-shooter prior to being the
U.N. ambassador, will become the highest ranking Hispanic in the
administration. He replaces Federico Pena who served as
transportation secretary and most recently as energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued to signal his emphasis on clean energy
alternatives as he emphasized the issue of climate change in
announcing Richardson's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Congress' support, Bill Richardson will do his part now
to secure our energy future at a time when that is inextricably
bound up with our obligation as Americans to do our part to deal
with the problem of climate change and our obligations . . . to
build a security future for our country that allows economic growth
and protection of the planet,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson thanked Clinton for ``being the most prolific
appointer of Latinos of any American president. Your leadership in
this area is unquestioned.'' Richardson said the Energy Department
must also ``continue its leadership on energy issues because a
healthy energy sector is a critical element of a vibrant and
growing U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson pledged a ``safe and reliable'' nuclear stockpile to
support administration efforts to secure passage of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and a continued emphasis on
cleaning up the environmental hazards created by the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also made a pitch for the United Nations, calling it
``good for America and good for the world.'' The international
organization, he said, advanced U.S. interests in regard to Iraq,
Kosovo, emerging democracies and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, 57, brokered the 1995 Dayton Accord that brought a
restless peace to Bosnia after four years of civil war and most
recently worked on quieting the issue of Cyprus that has long
divided Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ongoing service in the Balkan region has helped to keep
Bosnia's peace on track through some difficult moments. He has
helped advance our efforts to break the stalemate in Cyprus and he
has worked to defuse the alarming tensions and violence still
brewing in Kosovo,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Holbrooke will help fashion a United Nations
``that is leaner, more efficient, better equipped, that fulfills
the best ideals of its founders and meets the challenges of the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, his voice wavering, recalled his father taking him to
see the newly built U.N. buildings as an 8-year-old and telling him
they would become the most important in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father did not live to see how his dream for the U.N.
dissolved in the face of the harsh realities of the Cold War and
the inadequacies of the U.N. system itself. But I never forgot the
initial visit and my father's noble, if openly idealistic, dream.
Despite its many problems and failures, I still believe in the
importance, indeed the necessity, of the United Nations,''
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the announcements to again pressure Congress to
pass the U.N. debt measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where developments beyond our borders have dramatic
implications within them _ from rogue states seeking nuclear
weapons and chemical and biological weapons, to pollution corroding
the atmosphere _ international cooperation is more important than
ever,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Congress to approve the legislation ``without
unrelated issues,'' a reference to the anti-abortion provision, so
the United States can ``live up to our legacy of leadership and pay
our debt to the United Nations.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a congressman and later as the Clinton
administration's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson displayed a flair for missions that required a sense of
derring-do, like the time he persuaded officials in Pyongyang to
release an American who stole into North Korea to convert all its
citizens to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's model as free-form diplomatic troubleshooter has
been as much Indiana Jones as Henry Kissinger as he has traveled to
odd and sometimes fearsome parts of the world, including Sudan,
Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Myanmar, in addition to
North Korea. On many of those missions he has often been successful
in winning the release of hostages from governments and warlords
when traditional diplomacy had failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Richardson to be his new energy secretary, President
Clinton has given him an assignment which traditionally carries far
less glamour and less opportunity for a high public profile. But no
one in the capital expects Richardson to recede into relative
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   But even as people expect him to be confirmed by the Senate, no
one expects that process to occur without its own drama. As U.N.
ambassador, Richardson played an intriguing, perhaps significant,
role in the Monica Lewinsky story and he would likely be questioned
about it at any confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is the former White House intern who is at the
center of the current investigation by Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, of Clinton. Starr is investigating whether the
president had an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, lied
about it under oath and encouraged her to conceal it as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky was leaving a job at the public affairs office
at the Pentagon last fall, Richardson met with her in his official
suite at the Watergate apartments to discuss a possible job for her
the U.S. mission at the United Nations. He offered her a job which
she declined in favor of a corporate post in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to find out if the job offer from
Richardson was part of an inducement for Ms. Lewinsky not to say
anything damaging about the president.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Richardson was first elected to the House of
Representatives from New Mexico in 1982 and subsequently re-elected
seven times. On his diplomatic missions, he has always worn the
same sportcoat, what he has described as his ``lucky blazer.''
</P>
<P>
   William Blaine Richardson was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Nov.
15, 1947, and graduated from the Middlesex School and Tufts
University, both in Massachusetts. As a young man, he was
considered a major-league pitching prospect. He and his wife,
Barbara, who have no children, live in the Waldorf-Astoria
apartment provided for U.N. ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his most celebrated missions, Richardson successfully
negotiated the release of three Westerners including a U.S. pilot
in the middle of the Sudanese desert. He persuaded the rebel
leaders to drop their demand for millions of dollars in exchange
for tons of food along with jeeps and radios.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's U.N. ambassador, Richardson compiled what
diplomats have viewed as an impressive list of achievements,
including persuading the new leader of Congo to allow an
investigation of human rights abuses and as a principal advocate of
a tough U.S. policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He recently has been criticized by some diplomats for failing to
perceive, during a visit to New Delhi, India's intentions to engage
in nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Richardson became the first U.S. Cabinet official to
visit Afghanistan in more than two decades and obtained an
agreement from the warring factions to begin peace talks, and he
was Clinton's choice to try to ease the dying leader of Zaire,
Mobutu Sese Seko, out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was regarded warmly at the United Nations, especially
among the diplomats of the developing world who are often ignored
by U.S. officials, for his backslapping, informal nature and his
political skills. He made much of his part-Hispanic background and
liked socializing with delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the administration criticized him for not focusing
on the sometimes dreary details of policy, and he was not widely
respected among some of the other Security Council delegations.
Many felt he was happier out in the field, in his lucky blazer,
than dealing with the minutiae and tedium of the United Nations,
which is widely known in the government as ``the house of words.''

HOUSE GOP'S TAX-FREE SAVINGS PLAN FOR EDUCATION FACES PRESIDENTIAL
VETO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move certain to draw a presidential veto, the
Republican-controlled House approved legislation Thursday that
would allow parents to set up tax-free savings accounts to help
cover tuition at private or parochial elementary and secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 225-197, would allow parents, relatives,
friends and even corporations to contribute up to $2,000 a year per
child into tax-free savings accounts that could be used for public
school expenses as well.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also expands the amount Congress approved last
year for college and other post-secondary education savings
accounts from $500 to $2,000 per child. The measure also included a
provision offered by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, that will
allow the creation of tax-free, prepaid college tuition plans for
both private and public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to pass the Senate later this month, but
President Clinton has promised to veto it on grounds it would
undermine the public education system by encouraging parents to
send their children to private and religious schools. Clinton
appears at the moment to have the upper hand on the issue because
supporters of the savings accounts do not have the two-thirds vote
needed to override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House vote, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, a key sponsor of the so-called ``A-Plus''
education savings accounts, urged Clinton to back off his veto
threat. Archer said the tax break would be used primarily by
middle-income Americans who will continue to send their children to
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation is designed to give ``a helping hand''
not only to parents but also school systems that lack resources
needed to ensure a ``quality'' education, such as computers,
adequate books and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Archer also emphasized that the savings accounts could be used
to help with school-associated transportation costs and the special
needs of disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason (opponents) of this bill keep saying it will
destroy elementary and secondary education, and nothing could be
further from the truth,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, said the bill would simply give
parents more flexibility in making decisions about what is best for
their children, especially determining ``the best and safest
schools'' for them to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the president to give all children the same
chance to succeed that his daughter had,'' he said, referring to
the fact that Chelsea Clinton attended an exclusive private
secondary school in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the savings accounts measure was mostly along party
lines, with 186 Democrats, 10 Republicans and one independent,
voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents took exception to Archer's contention that
middle-income Americans would benefit most from the tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who benefit from this bill are not ordinary
citizens,'' said Rep. Albert Wynn, D-Md. ``What's wrong is when you
take tax dollars away from public education and give tax relief to
the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an education bill. This is a tax bill that gives a
cut to those with enough money in the bank to be able to afford
it,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The savings account measure is expected to cost the federal
government about $1.6 billion over the next 10 years. Clinton and
other opponents of the bill say that the money could be put to
better use by building more schools to help reduce class sizes and
by hiring more qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Republican leaders in Congress have blocked Democratic
bills that would fund the hiring of 100,000 more teachers and
increase the budget for new schools and expanded child-care
programs. Instead, they've made tax breaks through the savings
accounts the centerpiece of their education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, said one of the
goals of the GOP education agenda is to improve public schools by
making them more competitive. Offering tax breaks, he said, is one
way to accomplish that goal because it pressures public schools
raise their standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is moving in the right direction when it gives
parents more choices, and when it makes the schools more
accountable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill also includes $217 million for the creation
of a literacy program to help train more teachers in reading
instruction. It also encourages states through financial incentives
to establish regular teacher testing programs as well as merit pay
scales to help reward teachers for exceptional work. &QL;

WOODWARD, ON HOME SOIL, SAYS US JUDICIAL SYSTEM FAULTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE AND PEGGY HERNANDEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, England _ For two years, the loudest voices in the
Louise Woodward saga have belonged to lawyers, judges, the media
and her supporters in her hometown of Elton who chanted, ``Free
Louise!''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after Woodward arrived back in England a convicted
felon, the disillusioned vocals fell &UR;  &LR; silent, and she spoke up for
herself: loudly, boldly and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear voice tinged with an American accent, Woodward
proclaimed her innocence in the death of Matthew Eappen, blamed a
flawed US justice system for her fate and insisted she has not sold
her story to the British press.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward &UR;  &LR; then made it clear: She was not to blame for the
child's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorrow for the death of baby Matthew,'' she said in a
brief press conference at the Manchester Airport. ``But like I said
time and time again, I had nothing to do with his death. I did not
hurt Matthew and I did not kill baby Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was asked if she had a message for the child's parents,
Sunil and Deborah Eappen, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against her earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' Woodward replied.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the 20-year-old au pair has spoken
publicly since she was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of
Matthew, the 8-month-old infant who died in her care in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief press conference, Woodward and her family
returned to a remarkably subdued reception in Elton.
</P>
<P>
   Though yellow ribbons hung from trees and fence posts and one
sign proclaimed, ``Welcome Home Louise,'' no champagne receptions
greeted her. Reporters, not residents, were the only people
watching as her car passed through the middle of town to her home.
</P>
<P>
   And The Rigger, a pub now famous as headquarters of the Free
Louise campaign, was dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows a very deep respect that people stayed
away,'' said Christine Gray, a member of the local Woodward support
group. ``Everyone is celebrating her arrival behind closed doors
... people just wanted to sit and reflect on it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference and the drive home to Elton ended nearly
four days of pandemonium for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the SJC upheld her manslaughter conviction but
refused to order a new sentence, freeing Woodward to leave Boston
for England. The next day, she caught a first-class seat on a
British Airways overnight flight.
</P>
<P>
   Though several reporters accompanied Woodward on the plane to
London's Heathrow Airport, bodyguards _ including a Massachusetts
state trooper in full uniform paid by the airline _ barred anyone
from getting close to her or her father.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a British cameraman apparently walked by
Woodward's seat and her father jumped up yelling, ``Leave my
daughter alone!''
</P>
<P>
   The first-class tickets, worth $4,200 each, were donated by a
benefactor who wished to remain anonymous, according to Andrew
Miller, the local Member of Parliament for Woodward's home district
of Cheshire. Miller, who organized the press conference at the
Manchester airport, maintained the tickets were not paid for by a
media organization.
</P>
<P>
   When the Woodwards arrived in London, a pack of British and
American reporters and cameramen trampled each other to get as
close as possible to the somber-looking father and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were to fly from London to Manchester in a smaller
jet, British Airways told Woodward and her father that they could
not guarantee security from reporters on the plane. As a result,
Miller drove the Woodwards 200 miles north to Manchester Airport
for the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to more than 100 reporters and photographers, Woodward
said she hopes that since all of her legal appeals have been
exhausted, the ``medical community'' will take up her case, review
the physical evidence of Matthew's death and help exonerate her. On
Tuesday, her lawyers, Harvey Silverglate and Andrew Good, said
evidence would be turned over to independant panel of experts to
prove Woodward's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she wants to ``educate people'' about shaken-baby
syndrome to ``hopefully prevent mistakes being made and rush to
judgment like what happened in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward also insisted she did not get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed ``atrocious'' pre-trial publicity for a ``tainted
jury pool,'' and said politics influenced Middlesex prosecutor
Thomas Reilly's decision to try her for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm upset about the conviction,'' she said. ``It's a
conviction I don't deserve, but I think in time the truth will come
out, in time I will be cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the press conference, Woodward said she plans to
go to college and ``do what any normal 20-year-old would like to
do.'' But she also said her ordeal had changed her and that she's
learned a lot _ ``too much about American law.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said she has agreed to an exclusive interview with the
BBC. The network later confirmed Woodward will talk with Martin
Bashir, the reporter who conducted the only television interview
with the late Diana, Princess of Wales. An air date for the
program, ``Panorama'' had not been set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone in Chicago, Deborah Eappen's brother, Paul
Spellman, critized Woodward for failing to acknowlege his sister
and brother-in-law during the press conference, and said the family
is offended that she still won't acknowlege her responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable what she said; it's all hocus-pocus,''
Spellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Elton, Woodward was escorted by local police to her
front door. She bounded out of a chauffered minibus and hugged her
sister Vicky. Cassie, the family's German shepherd, joined in the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward family then posed for photographers on their front
stoop under rainy and gray skies, then disappeared into the house.
Later, Woodward withdrew to the bedroom she kept as a teenager,
filled with stuffed animals and lined with posters of British rock
groups Pulp and Pet Shop Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's arrival home was greeted with near and deliberate
silence from residents. Few villagers were on the street as
Woodward's calvacade drove by.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they are still embarrassed by images of supporters
quaffing champagne and singing soccer victory songs after
Woodward's conviction was reduced to manslaughter six months ago.
Others said they have become disillusioned after allegations that
the Woodwards misused money in their defense fund, and reports that
one of Woodward's lawyers, under arrest for drunken driving,
blurted out that she had come to believe her client was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a party situation,'' said Sandra McCabe, a family
friend who said she plans to visit the family Friday. ``Matthew is
still dead and Louise is still convicted of his death.''

PERRY, SHARP TIED FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Rick Perry and Democrat John Sharp are
virtually tied in their race for lieutenant governor with a third
of the likely voters undecided, the Texas Poll indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lead all the other campaigns for statewide executive
offices, the poll showed, except for the attorney general's race,
where Democrat Jim Mattox is trying to reclaim the post he held for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox has a 9-point lead over Republican John Cornyn, a former
Texas Supreme Court justice, with 18 percent of voters undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 691 likely voters was conducted June 1-12 by
Scripps Howard and the Office of Survey Research at the University
of Texas. It did not include judicial races.
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, Republicans have never held the posts of
lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller or land
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the current state agriculture commissioner, leads Sharp,
the state comptroller, 35 percent to 31 percent, in the race to
succeed Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who is retiring in January.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is virtually within the poll's margin of error of
3.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two percent of the respondents were undecided on the next
lieutenant governor, while 2 percent liked neither candidate or
didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's support was identical to the 35 percent he received in a
Texas Poll conducted in March, but Sharp dropped 10 percentage
points from his March showing. The level of undecided voters,
meanwhile, increased from 19 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp campaign said the survey undercounted Democratic
voters. A Perry spokesman said Sharp's support was ``plummeting''
because the Democratic nominee ``lacks issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin political analyst George Christian said Republican
candidates were benefiting from Gov. George W. Bush's popularity at
the top of the GOP ticket. Bush has a 53-point lead over Democratic
challenger Garry Mauro, according to the same poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The massive Bush lead is having an influence on all this. It's
giving the whole election a Republican veneer,'' Christian said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairman Bill White disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox's lead of 44 percent to 35 percent over Cornyn, White
said, ``shows that Bush has no coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian said Mattox, who won two races for attorney general in
the 1980s and ran unsuccessfully for governor and U.S. senator
since then, led partly because he is better known than Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also indicates that:
</P>
<P>
   1) Republican Carole Keeton Rylander, a Texas Railroad
commissioner, leads Democrat Paul Hobby, a Houston businessman, by
38 percent to 26 percent in the race for state comptroller.
Thirty-five percent of respondents are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   2) Republican David Dewhurst, a Houston businessman, is backed
by 37 percent of likely voters in the land commissioner's race.
Twenty-four percent favor state Rep. Richard Raymond of Benavides,
the Democratic nominee. Thirty-eight percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   3) Former Secretary of State Tony Garza, the Republican nominee,
leads Democrat Joe B. Henderson, 43 percent to 23 percent, for the
Texas Railroad Commission, with 33 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   4) Former state Rep. Susan Combs of Austin, the Republican
nominee for agriculture commissioner, leads state Rep. Pete
Patterson of Brookston, the Democratic candidate, 39 percent to 27
percent with 33 percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the lieutenant governor's race, Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan
said the Republican nominee still had to overcome Sharp's higher
name identification with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said voters' familiarity with Sharp was one reason that
the number of undecided voters, rather than Perry's poll numbers,
had risen while Sharp's had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharp is still better known than Rick, and that will remain
the case until we go on TV,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp spokesman Kelly Fero said Perry's ``slim margin in
this poll is due exclusively to the fact that they polled more
Republicans than Democrats this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the March poll sample and the current poll sample included
31 percent Republicans, poll director Ty Meighan said. But the
share of Democratic respondents dropped from 34 percent in March to
25 percent in this survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for Sharp is that he has a commanding lead among
independent voters,'' Fero said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Poll, Sharp, who has been trying to
distance his campaign from that of Mauro, the Democratic
gubernatorial nominee, is favored by 30 percent of independent
voters, who are key to statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four percent of independents favor Perry, and 43 percent
are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox said he was ``delighted'' with the poll results in the
attorney general's race. He said Texans ``trust me as an
experienced leader who will make decisions based not on politics,
but what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said Mattox's lead was ``purely a matter of name
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, we're going in one direction, and that's
up. I'm pleased that things are this close at this point,'' Cornyn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox leads Cornyn, 45 percent to 29 percent, among independent
voters, with 25 percent of independents undecided on the attorney
general's race.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox also had stronger support among Democratic voters, 78
percent, than Cornyn showed among Republican voters, 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, Rylander's son and campaign manager, said the
survey shows the Republican candidate for comptroller has a
``common sense, conservative record of achievement and a clear
vision for the future of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Justus, a spokeswoman for Democratic nominee Hobby, son
of former Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby, said undecided voters will ``embrace
Paul's fresh business approach'' to government.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, who is trying to become the first Hispanic Republican
elected to statewide office in Texas, has a 48 percent to 31
percent lead over Henderson among Hispanic voters and a 43 percent
to 21 percent lead among Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has a narrow, 31 percent to 29 percent, edge among
black voters.

TOBACCO BILL DEFERRED, POLITICIANS MANEUVER FOR POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional leaders from
both parties jockeyed Thursday for political advantage from the
Senate's votes Wednesday night to shelve comprehensive tobacco
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Without offering many details, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
that he would put forward next week a low-budget alternative to the
Senate bill, a measure that would be tightly focused on
discouraging teen-agers from smoking. Gingrich said the bill would
go before the House for a vote in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the president will join us on behalf of children,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, fielding questions from reporters at the White House,
said he was not giving up on the Senate bill. ``It's dead today,''
he declared. ``It may not be dead tomorrow. And it's not dead over
the long run, because the public health need is great. I've never
quit on anything this important in my life, and I don't intend to
stop now.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, Clinton said, are wrong if they assume that ``it's
safe to walk away from the biggest public health obligation that
this country has today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would have raised the price of cigarettes by at
least $1.10 a package over five years, allowed the Food and Drug
Administration to regulate cigarette advertising and marketing and
forced the tobacco companies to pay stiff penalties if the level of
teen-age smoking did not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   After debating the bill for a month, the Senate set it aside
Wednesday night. An effort by supporters to win the 60 votes
necessary to cut off debate and bring the measure to a final vote
fell 3 votes short. All but two Democrats voted to stop the debate,
but they were joined by only 14 of the 54 Republicans who voted.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats swore that they would bring up the measure again and
again this year, but a vote Thursday illustrated how dim the
prospects are that they will succeed in getting the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle offered the original Senate
bill as an amendment to a bill providing money for energy and water
projects. The Daschle effort was blocked, 54-44, on a party-line
vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a joint news conference, Daschle and House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt struggled for new ways to attack the Republican
opponents of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP is a subsidiary of RJR,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said House Democrats would fight Gingrich's approach to
tobacco legislation. He said, ``We're not going to vote for a
fig-leaf bill so they can say they've passed anti-smoking
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich gave only a scant description of what his bill would
entail. He said that it would cost little and would not raise the
price of cigarettes. ``The Senate bill drowned in a sea of money,''
Gingrich asserted.
</P>
<P>
   His bill, Gingrich said, would give the Food and Drug
Administration new authority to regulate the marketing of
cigarettes and would have provisions to restrict teen-agers' access
to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio, who heads the Republicans' group
developing the bill, said that the measure would also offer
inducements to states to withdraw the driver's licenses of
teen-agers caught buying or possessing cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Democrats and representatives of public health
organizations had said they would fight the slimmed-down Republican
approach, Gingrich asked, ``Why would you rather have no bill at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Republican senators would
go along with Gingrich's ``clean and simple'' legislation and that
he expected such a bill to be enacted this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats just want an issue, they they've got their
issue,'' Lott said. ``If they want to get something done for the
American people, they're going to have to work with me.''

FEWER FATHERS IN MASSACHUSETTS HOMES, AGENCY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly three out of every 10 households with children
in Massachusetts have no father in the home, according to a report
released Thursday by the Massachusetts Family Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a historically high level in this state,'' said
Matthew E. Daniels, president of the institute and author of the
report. ``We want people to recognize things are getting worse, not
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second annual report on Massachusetts families, the
institute estimated that 29 percent of families had no fathers
living with them in 1997, up 2 percent since 1995 and almost
quadruple the percentage in 1960. &UR;  &LR; The estimates were generated for
the institute by the Massachusetts Institute for Social and
Economic Research in Amherst using US Census data. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In 1990, 20 percent of families in Massachusetts were headed
by single parents, according to the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said the continuing decline of two-parent families has
social costs, including higher rates of crime, child poverty,
welfare dependency, and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce fatherlessness, the institute advocated tax relief for
families, better child support enforcement, toughening penalties
for statutory rape, battling gambling addiction, and making it
easier for married couples to adopt children. The institute
describes itself as ``dedicated to strengthening families in
Massachusetts and restoring Judeo-Christian values to our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Jetta Bernier, executive director of the Massachusetts Committee
for Children and Youth, said the issue of fatherlessness resonates
with many child and family advocacy groups, liberal and
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, lack of education and job training, and the
failure of wages to keep pace with inflation, have made it
difficult for low-income men to form stable, strong relationships
with their children and their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the work of the (institute) appears to be useful,''
said Bernier. ``They are clearly identifying some public policy
issues. But it is simply not enough for us to be blaming fathers,
particularly if we are not addressing the economic difficulties
they face to family formation.''

REPORT WARNS ABOUT SWITCHING HEART MEDICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of patients who were taking a blood pressure drug
called Posicor _ which was withdrawn from the market on June 8
because of dangerous interactions with many other medications _ are
at risk of life-threatening reactions if doctors abruptly switch
them to alternate medications, researchers warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Four such cases, including one 79-year-old woman who died, will
be reported next week in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. The journal released the report a week early Thursday
``because of its public health importance.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 Americans, and 400,000 worldwide, were
taking Posicor before the manufacturer withdrew it earlier this
month. The drug had been approved only a year earlier for high
blood pressure and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   In requesting its withdrawal, the US Food and Drug
Administration cited serious side-effects when patients took
Posicor along with at least 26 other medications. The agency said
the ``number and diversity of drugs'' that interact unfavorably
with Posicor would require warning labels too complex for doctors
and patients to interpret.
</P>
<P>
   Posicor's manufacturer, Roche Laboratories, has recently
confiscated supplies of Posicor from pharmacies and hospitals. But
an unknown number of patients still may have unused supplies of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some specialists said, many doctors may not realize
the dangers of switching abruptly from Posicor to another drug of
the same type, known as calcium channel blockers.
</P>
<P>
   It was already known that Posicor, known generically as
mibefradil, should never be taken along with two widely prescribed
calcium channel blockers called verapamil (brand names Calan,
Isoptin or Verelan) or diltiazem (Cardizem).
</P>
<P>
   However, the authors of the upcoming AMA Journal report said no
one had realized the risk of switching to other calcium channel
blockers before Posicor had been flushed from patients' systems.
Among those other drugs are nifedipine (Adalat or Procardia),
felodipine (Plendil), and nimodipine (Nimotop).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised to see that a single dose of a new calcium
channel blocker could cause dramatic drops in heart rate and blood
pressure,'' said Dr. Zane Horowitz, medical director of the Oregon
Poison Center, an author of the upcoming report.
</P>
<P>
   The three patients who survived after experiencing these
reactions required intensive treatment, Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety conclusion we'd like to convey is that patients
should stop taking mibefradil (Posicor), but should not be switched
to another calcium channel blocker,'' Horowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that patients who had been taking Posicor should
probably not be taking another heart and blood pressure drug called
a beta blocker, such as timolol (Blocadren) or propranolol
(Inderal), for at least 14 days after stopping Posicor.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, experts said, is that Posicor lingers in the body
for days. Roche issued a letter to doctors a week ago advising a
delay of seven days after discontinuing Posicor before beginning
treatment with most other calcium channel blockers or beta
blockers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon researchers, who said they first noted the problem
with abrupt switchovers in February and March, said Roche knew
about ``these and similar cases'' prior to the company's June 12
letter. However, the cases are not mentioned in that advisory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inconceivable that they didn't know last Friday about
these cases,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Health Research Group,
a part of Ralph Nader's organization. ``So why is their letter of
that date missing any information about those cases or the death?''
</P>
<P>
   No comment was available Thursday evening from Roche, a
Swiss-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz said patients could safely be switched from Posicor to
other types of blood pressure drugs, called ACE inhibitors or
angiotensin-II inhibitors. However, Dr. Irene Gavras of Boston
Medical Center said it most patients should wait for Posicor to be
washed out of their system before beginning any other drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a compelling reason, such as immediate heart
failure or hypertensive crisis, it is better to wait and allow a
washout of the drug, even if the blood pressure goes a little
higher,'' Gavras said.

<P>
   ``I think he's got to take care of the issue of the ownership of
the Brewers,'' said the official, who insisted on anonymity. ``That
may take a little time. That, and I don't think he wants it to
interfere with the All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement Thursday, Selig said that discussion of his
willingness to take the job was premature and that he had not yet
accepted it. An article in The New York Times on Thursday said
Selig had decided to accept the position full time.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and officials throughout baseball said Wednesday, and
others confirmed Thursday, that Selig had responded to a large
group of owners who want him to be commissioner by signaling his
intention to accept the job.
</P>
<P>
   Major league rules stipulate that a vote for commissioner has to
be done with a written ballot. Since the owners' next quarterly
meeting is not until September, Selig is expected to call a special
meeting to hold the election. He has to give the owners 10 days'
notice.
</P>
<P>
   If Selig had decided not to accept the job, Jerry McMorris of
the Colorado Rockies, the search committee chairman, would have
presented four candidates to the ruling executive council,
according to one official close to the commissioner search.
National League president Leonard Coleman was the only one of the
four who is already in baseball. The official did not identify the
three people outside baseball.
</P>
<P>
   McMorris declined to comment on the candidates. He also declined
to discuss Selig as commissioner because, he said, the Milwaukee
Brewers' owner has not told him he wants the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, there's been a tremendous Bud movement, and that's
gotten stronger and louder,'' McMorris said by telephone from
Denver. ``My sense is they have Bud's ear. But he's the only one
who can speak for Bud. If the votes are there, the process can be
brought to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Selig owns one of the teams he would be overseeing, he
is expected to take some action regarding the Brewers. The most
likely option is that he would put his share of the team into a
trust.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second search since Fay Vincent resigned as
commissioner in September 1992 that has ended without a candidate
other than Selig being considered by the executive council.
</P>
<P>
   The Selig movement, another official said, ``kind of meandered
beginning with his core support.'' With that core group favoring
Selig, the official added, it would have been impossible for anyone
else to get enough votes to be elected.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Selig acknowledged that there ``is a greater
sense of urgency now'' to fill the role of commissioner ``and the
matter will have to be addressed soon.''

DEMOCRATS PLAN TO POUND GOP OVER SMOKING ISSUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the smoke cleared Thursday from the Senate
Republicans' demolition of a massive anti-tobacco measure, two
things became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats plan to pound the Republicans on the smoking issue
through the November elections, arguing that they are doing the
bidding of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican leadership will buck any attempt to resurrect
the $516 billion anti-smoking legislation that would have raised
cigarette prices by a $1.10 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will likely offer a modest anti-smoking and
anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga, said a plan to be debated
next month would likely include an anti-smoking advertising
campaign and provide incentives to states to discourage teen-age
smoking, such as denying driver's licenses to underage smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also give the Food and Drug Administration the
authority to regulate tobacco products and would curb tobacco
marketing to teens. However, it would not include the hefty price
increases that public health advocates say is necessary to
discourage teens from buying cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after four weeks of debate, a minority of senators
were able to avoid a straight up or down vote on the anti-tobacco
bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and effectively kill
the measure through parliamentary maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
signaled that his party intended to keep the issue alive by trying
to attach the anti-smoking bill to an unrelated appropriations
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed. But Daschle sounded the theme echoed
throughout the day by fellow Democrats _ that tobacco industry
contributions to the GOP played a big role in the legislation's
demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think yesterday it became entirely clear that in this merger
era that we're in, RJR merged with the GOP,'' Daschle said,
referring to one of the largest tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton suggested that the
Republicans had responded to a $40 million tobacco advertising
campaign which portrayed the bill as a big-tax, big-government
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   But the president said that he had heard that a bipartisan group
of eight senators may be formed to try and salvage the anti-tobacco
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if that's a good faith effort . . . that's certainly one
option that I would consider,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., suggested
that while some senators might look at a slimmed-down tobacco bill,
``nothing like the McCain bill is going to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi lawmaker insisted he did everything possible to
facilitate the tobacco measure but because of lobbying by public
health advocates and others the measure had become ``weighed down''
with unrelated provisions.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of the extras tacked onto the bill had been pushed
by Lott's fellow Republicans, including Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
who tied up the Senate for days over his proposal to cut taxes for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Democrats
are not likely to go along with what he described as a ``fig leaf
bill'' being offered in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to vote for a blank piece of paper so they can
say they passed anti-smoking legislation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public health advocates, still reeling from the defeat of a bill
they have labored over for much of the year, also said they are
unlikely to support measures that do not substantially increase the
price of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   They added that they plan to make the public aware of the 42
senators who helped bury the tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to go out there and name names,'' said Bill
Novelli, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.
</P>
<P>
   The public health organizations have spent about $2 million on
public relations campaigning, but have been far outspent by the
tobacco giants.
</P>
<P>
   A tobacco industry lobbyist said the TV, radio and newspaper ad
campaign will likely continue as the House considers legislation
and possibly into the election period to help boost lawmakers who
opposed the McCain bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the tobacco executives dodged a sizeable financial hit
with the death of the McCain bill, they still must deal with the
numerous state lawsuits that would have been settled by the McCain
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has already reached settlements with
Minnesota, Texas, Florida and Mississippi for a total of $36.5
billion in damages. The death of the Senate bill will not affect
those payments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans leaders say they do not believe the tobacco issue
will resonate with voters in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent poll by the independent Pew Research Center found
that by 62 percent to 29 percent the public favors the government
taking some sort of action against the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Poll director Andrew Kohut said that the Democratic argument
that the GOP is tied to the tobacco industry could hurt Republicans
because it confirms voter suspicion that the party is beholden to
big business.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kohut said that support for action against tobacco
companies tends to decline somewhat when specifics, such as raising
taxes, are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   GOP pollster Bill McInturff said that while the McCain bill was
probably too big and complex, Republicans would be misreading
public sentiment if they believed the public opposed doing
something about tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the data is clear. People do not have the same
feelings about raising price of cigarettes as they do about other
tax increases,'' he said.

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DEFEND SATELLITE EXPORT POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif.)  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Thursday mounted its
most detailed defense of its satellite export control policy, as
three top officials said that China's military had not benefited
from transfers of sensitive American technology and that safeguards
were in place to prevent any such leakage.
</P>
<P>
   The spirited rebuttals by senior officials from the departments
of Commerce, State and Defense marked a counteroffensive against a
growing Republican-led attack on the administration's handling of
satellite exports to China, a policy that Republicans have charged
threatens American national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that the commercial space launch activities
that have been authorized by licenses and monitored under these
procedures have benefited China's missile or military satellite
companies,'' John Holum, an acting undersecretary of state, told a
House hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And Jan Lodal, the principal deputy undersecretary of defense
for policy, said, ``The current system protects national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the united front, cracks of dissension within the
Administration's ranks and among usually loyal Democrats broke
through.
</P>
<P>
   The government's arms control agency warned last year that
waiving a ban on satellite exports to China to entice Beijing to
curb missile sales had accomplished ``nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
contained in a memorandum apparently sent to State Department
officials, was made public at the House hearing. The memo undercut
one of the White House's fundamental reasons for granting waivers
to allow satellite exports to China despite a ban imposed after the
1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has proven that the only time we have gotten movement
from the Chinese on missile proliferation has been in the face of a
penalty being imposed,'' the memo said. ``Carrots have gotten us
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's advisory was not included in the State
Department's official recommendation to the White House earlier
this year. President Clinton approved the waiver last February,
despite objections from the Justice Department that it would
undermine an ongoing criminal inquiry into whether two satellite
makers divulged sensitive information to Chinese rocket scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Holum, who also heads the arms control agency, told an unusual
joint hearing of two House committees, National Security and
International Relations, that the warning was not adopted because
``it would have been very disruptive'' to broader American
commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon Senate hearing, Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., became
one of the first Democrats to openly criticize the shift of
licensing authority for commercial satellites to the Commerce
Department from the State Department in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more and more concern about Commerce becoming the
lead dog here,'' said Cleland. ``I'd rather hedge my bets and put
national security first and commerce second.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The back-to-back hearings featuring the administration witnesses
capped a frenzied day on Capitol Hill over the wide-ranging China
accusations, which comes just a week before Clinton visits China.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, updated the
House Intelligence Committee in a closed, 2-hour 30-minute briefing
on a series of conflicting government assessments as to whether two
satellite makers who are the focus of the Justice inquiry _ Loral
Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes Electronics _ jeopardized
national security by discussing the results of their independent
review of a failed launch of one of their satellites on a Chinese
Long March missile in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With little dissension, the House on Thursday approved a
resolution, 409-10, to create a special select committee to lead
the House inquiry into the China accusations. The 10 who voted
against the resolution were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that our technology store is open and the
Chinese have been buying,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., who
heads the House Rules Committee. ``They have been buying the future
security of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resolution's bipartisan backing, Democrats
criticized Republicans during the debate for spending too much
money on duplicate investigations of Clinton and Democratic
fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   And they expressed concern that the work of the select committee
would fall captive to what they called a Republican witch hunt to
tarnish Clinton and curry favor with conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   At the House and Senate hearings, administration officials said
that allowing American satellites to be launched on Chinese rockets
was a ``wise'' policy initially set by Presidents Ronald Reagan and
George Bush, both Republicans, to help make up for a shortage of
American launching services.
</P>
<P>
   And by transferring commercial satellite licensing authority to
the Commerce Department, the Clinton aides said, the administration
was completing a shift that Bush started in late 1992. In a
nutshell, the State Department considers national security
implications for sensitive exports, while the Commerce Department
also weighs American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Or as William Reinsch, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, told senators: ``Commerce's is an open,
transparent, time-sensitive approach. State's is not. We've
developed a `process-friendly' '' approach.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said this shift in licensing
authority had loosened controls of satellite exports. But Reinsch
disagreed, saying the administration had added safeguards,
including a broader role for the Pentagon and intelligence agencies
to review export applications. Critics say these protections still
fall short of the State Department's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing Commerce licensing system fully protects our
national security and foreign policy concerns,'' Reinsch said. &QL;

JAPANESE HAVE PLAN TO END BURDEN OF BAD DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: JAPAN-ASSESS, KOREA-ECON, ECON-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By SHERYL WUDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's prime minister is furiously thrashing out the
details of what the government hopes will emerge as a landmark
blueprint to clean up the nation's bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the plan are being closely guarded, but the prime
minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, referred to it obliquely at a news
conference Thursday, pledging that the government ``will take
drastic measures to resolve the bad-loan problem, which has been
considerably dragging economic recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   And the blueprint is likely to be an important topic during
talks when the deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers,
meets with Japanese government officials and party leaders on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After playing down the bad-loan problem for years, the
government now acknowledges that clearing away the loans may be the
single most important factor in building confidence overseas and in
giving a lift to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem loans, which have swelled to more than $600 billion
_ more than the size of the entire Chinese economy _ have been a
drag on the economy for years but now the government seems
increasingly determined to clean up the mess over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economic recovery and disposal of bad loans go hand in
hand,'' Hashimoto said at the news conference Thursday. He
suggested that he would call a special session of Parliament late
next month, after elections for the upper house on July 12,
apparently to turn the plan into law.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign investors are wary of new promises from the
government because they have been let down so many times. But other
analysts and economists say that while enormous uncertainties
remain, there are signs that the government may finally be ready to
implement the Total Plan, as it is being called here.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would take time but they could result in a sounder
banking sector, a more vibrant real estate market and a healthier
economy overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, Hashimoto's commitment to do something is getting
stronger and stronger,'' said Masaru Yoshitomi, chief economist at
the Long-Term Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshitomi argues that up until now, only the politicians
have broken from the pack to tackle the bad debt while the
regulators and the banks themselves have shown enormous reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Plan is being hammered out by about two dozen
high-level Liberal Democrat politicians and bureaucrats, who will
convene a major session next Tuesday to review a draft. The
chairman is Okiharu Yasuoka, a Liberal Democrat member of the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being done at a very top level,'' said a senior
government official. ``Few people know the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been through many versions and is still changing,
and about $17 billion has been set aside for it in the government's
$123 billion stimulus package. As described by government
officials, economists and bankers, the Total Plan focuses on the
bad loans and on the properties Japanese banks are stuck with
because they were the collateral for the loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past banks have often set aside reserves for questionable
loans but they generally have not sold those properties or
liquidated the bad loans. One result has been a huge drag on the
property market and a continuing burden on the banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Plan calls for measures to encourage the banks to sell
the properties and remove both the loans and the collateral from
their books. This may be a wrenching process, for the sale of so
much real estate could drive property prices lower, and the
obligation to face up to the problems could force weak banks out of
business. This could be another blow to confidence in the Japanese
economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But supporters say that the plan at least offers a way out of
the mess, even if it is a risky and laborious passage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial proposals _ it is not yet part of
the government plan _ is to set up a ``bridge bank'' that would
essentially absorb the business of failed banks. The bridge bank
would take over the good loans and deposits of failed banks and
continue lending to their clients in order to minimize the
disruption in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the clearest break from the current system in
which all banks, strong and weak, are pulled along together by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need a bridge bank,'' said Yoshitomi, a fervent
advocate of an expanded version of the Total Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The government already has a Resolution and Collection Bank,
which can absorb failed institutions, but its activities are not
comprehensive enough to deal fully with bankrupt banks.
</P>
<P>
   Ryuji Konishi, an economic consultant and former banking
executive who favors the idea, compares the bridge bank to a
fishnet that catched only the fish too weak to swim away on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong fish will jump over the net and survive, and the
shrimps and sardines will have to go into the net,'' he said.
``Unless you have a net, you can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the weak banks are extremely sensitive to this
proposal because they do not want to be, in effect, taken over by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government also put together a $221
billion bank bailout that would support depositors and help the
banks rebuild their capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the banks have drawn only 1.8 trillion yen. Weak banks are
reluctant to ask for money for fear that such an admission of
weakness would drive down their share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign investors would like to see the government put up
even more than 30 trillion yen, either through a bridge bank or
another rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's not regarded as enough,'' said an executive at a
foreign asset-management company. He said Japan needs a bigger
bail-out in which the weak banks would go out of business once and
for all. ``Many people would like to see some of these banks go to
the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some bankers say the bridge bank is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time they really seem serious and are taking appropriate
action,'' said a senior bank officer at a large Japanese bank.
``What are the implications? The government is going to take
action. Maybe the government will close weak banks after it
prepares some structure to take over'' questionable assets.

TWO MAJOR BROKERAGES CITE BIG EARNINGS GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A surge in companies issuing stock for the first time
and a raging pace of corporate takeovers powered robust
second-quarter earnings at two leading brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the second-largest American
investment bank by capital after Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said earnings
for the period ended May 31 jumped 45 percent, compared with a year
ago, to $854 million, or $1.37 a fully diluted share. Lehman
Brothers Holdings, the fourth-largest brokerage firm, said earnings
rose 168 percent from a year earlier, to $324 million, or $2.12 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said a blistering pace of mergers and
acquisitions in America and overseas bolstered advisory fees. The
companies also reported sharp increases in equity and debt issues
and trading.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs that the long-running bull market in stocks may be
slowing, both companies said record backlogs of new debt and equity
issues and ongoing mergers promise continued strong earnings growth
into the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some signs recently that the markets may be a little
tired of absorbing new issues, but hopefully it's a temporary case
of indigestion,'' said Robert Scott, Morgan Stanley's chief
financial officer. ``As long as the new issues market holds up
relatively well, I think the stage is set for continuation.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the sharp gains was the record pace of merger and
acquisition activity. Morgan told Wall Street analysts in a
conference call that the value of deals in which companies bought
other companies totaled $1 trillion in the first half of this year.
Companies also sold nearly half a trillion dollars in securities
during the first half. Both figures were records.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies benefited from a strong international presence.
Even in Asia, where financial markets have plunged, results were
sharply higher. That is because volatility in those markets means a
sharply higher pace of selling and buying, and the brokerage
companies earn their fees based on transaction volume.
</P>
<P>
   Like the United States, Europe has had a strong stock market,
but that market is seen as at an earlier stage in its rally.
Moreover, market activity looks set to increase in the run-up to
European monetary union early next year, with some American
securities companies well placed to benefit from that surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extraordinary markets, both Europe and Asia,'' said
Sallie Krawcheck, who follows brokerage firms at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``Both of these companies are well positioned to
benefit from the growth overseas. They are not just domestic
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's strong performance comes about one year after the
institutional business of Morgan Stanley merged with the retail
brokerage operations of Dean Witter. Both sides of the business
reported record earnings, Scott, the chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lehman, which become an independent listed company when it
was spun off by American Express Co. in 1994, this year's second
quarter continued a string of strong growth that has seen its
annual profits rise to $647 million in 1997 from $113 million in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman chief administrative officer John Cecil said he
attributed the strong earnings to the company's ability to keep a
tight lid on expenses even as revenue and the number of people
employed grew. ``When you do that, you can produce wonderful
results,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraq is smuggling large volumes of oil into Turkey
in violation of U.N. sanctions, U.S. and Turkish officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say the Clinton administration has chosen to look
the other way, aware that the smuggling benefits Turkey, a crucial
ally in the American policy toward Iraq, and Kurds who deny the
Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein control over northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the region is replete with double-dealing and surprising
alliances, and administration officials acknowledge that the
Kurdish leader benefiting from the smuggling betrayed the United
States less than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The operation involves thousands of trucks transporting millions
of tons of oil, diesel fuel and other refined products annually,
openly traversing roads that U.S. and allied warplanes fly over in
northern Iraq, officials acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling conduit into Turkey is enriching Saddam's
government and family, these officials say, at a time when he is
chafing under U.N. restrictions on official oil exports, which have
been in place since the end of the Persian Gulf War eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until the United Nations determines that the Iraqi government
has eliminated programs to develop weapons of mass destruction, it
has prohibited Iraq from exporting oil except through a limited
program to raise humanitarian relief money.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has decided not to try to stop
the smuggling even though the United States is trying to hold
together a coalition in support of economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling, which has been going on for years, has become so
lucrative that Turkish truckers have welded external fuel-storage
tanks onto their trucks to cash in on the business.
</P>
<P>
   Much larger tanker trucks are also involved, according to
Turkish and Kurdish officials. At times, the trucks involved in the
smuggling have been so numerous that they have clogged traffic. The
smuggling operation is primarily funneled across the Turkish border
at the Khabour Bridge near the southeastern Turkish town of Silopi,
according to U.S., Turkish and Kurdish officials.
</P>
<P>
   One energy expert in the Turkish government who spoke on the
condition of anonymity estimated that Iraqi smuggling now accounts
for about 25 percent of the Turkish fuel market, making it a
significant concern to international oil companies trying to
compete in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish government officials, meanwhile, have been meeting to
discuss ways to control the smuggling, in conjunction with their
efforts to deregulate the country's fuel markets, Turkish officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the U.N. prohibits all Iraqi oil exports except
those that generate money for humanitarian aid in Iraq as well as
for Gulf war victims. In May, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
approved Iraq's plan for distributing food and medicine purchased
under this program, paving the way for Iraq to increase the amount
of oil that Iraq could export under the plan from $2 billion to
$5.2 billion worth of oil over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   All other Iraqi oil exports are officially banned, but in
addition to the smuggling through Turkey and the Persian Gulf, Iraq
ships about 100,000 barrels of oil a day to Jordan. Jordan is
almost completely dependent on Iraqi oil, and the shipments to
Jordan have been informally accepted by the United Nations, U.S.
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Clinton administration has never moved to curb
the smuggling, choosing instead to appease the Turks and the
Kurdish faction that controls the northern Iraqi territory and the
border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency has been to turn a blind eye because the Turks
are benefiting from it at a time when the Turks are complaining
anyway about sanctions on Iraq,'' said one administration official.
``While Saddam is making money on it, the Turks and Kurds are
too.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials add that other important nations involved in
enforcing the U.N. sanctions against Iraq have also quietly decided
to ignore the smuggling. ``I think the international community has
decided not to object, not just us,'' one Administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say that the origins of the
smuggling date back to 1992 and the aftermath of the Gulf war. They
stress that when the smuggling began, the Bush administration was
in office, and it also ignored the Turkish smuggling. ``I think
this administration inherited a decision from the Bush
administration not to object,'' said one administration official.
</P>
<P>
   But the smuggling has clearly gone from being a minor loophole
in the embargo against Iraqi oil into a much more significant
source of income for Saddam and a well entrenched outlet for the
Iraqis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With no American or allied effort to impede the traffic, between
50,000 and 60,000 barrels of Iraqi oil and fuel products a day are
now being smuggled along the Turkish route, Clinton administration
officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also smuggles oil by water, to Iran, Dubai and other spots.
The Turkish and Persian Gulf routes smuggle roughly equal amounts
of oil and together account for up to 10 percent of Iraq's export
capacity, U.S. officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. warships, as part of a multinational force, have been
trying for several years to curb sea-borne smuggling, stopping some
barges and other vessels in international waters in the Persian
Gulf, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Iran briefly curbed the Iraqi oil smuggling
trade along its waterways, but U.S. officials say the smuggling
through the Gulf route is now surging once again.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they believe that Saddam gets a
smaller cut of the profits from the Turkish operation than from the
Gulf operation. Kurdish leaders, Turkish trucking interests _ and
undoubtedly Turkish governmental officials along the border _ skim
off levies on the smuggling, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that Turkey has suffered so
severely as a result of international sanctions on Iraq that the
United States has decided to continue allowing the Turks to benefit
from Iraqi oil smuggling. In addition, administration officials
say, the smuggling benefits the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, which taxes the oil as it passes
through its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has paid a severe price for enforcing the sanctions
against Iraq, and this offered a way for Turkey to get some
recompense,'' said an administration official. ``This helps the
economy of southern Turkey and it helps Barzani,'' the official
added. ``It makes a small income for the government of Iraq. It
does not substantially increase the economy of Iraq in comparison
to the pre-war income it generated from oil exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kurdish leaders from the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
complain that the Clinton administration's decision to allow
Barzani to benefit from the smuggling is enriching a Kurdish leader
who betrayed the United States less than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barzani, who was formerly on the CIA's payroll, double-crossed
the agency by inviting the Iraqi army into his territory in August
1996, crushing a U.S. covert action program that was based on
Kurdish support, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   Barzani's actions led to the scattering of thousands of Kurds
and other dissidents who had supported the U.S. effort to undermine
support for Saddam. About 6,000 Kurds were eventually provided
refuge in the United States after Barzani's betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials say they believe Barzani was
enmeshed in Iraqi oil smuggling even when he was on the CIA
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Now, rival Kurdish leaders say that the smuggling business is
earning Barzani millions of dollars, while putting him directly
into business with Uday Hussein, Saddam's son. The rival Kurds say
that at least part of the Barzani group's revenues are paid as
kickbacks to Uday Hussein. Independent oil experts agree that Uday
Hussein appears to be in overall charge of smuggling operations. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Commerce Department released trade statistics
Thursday showing that the U.S. economy was taking a bigger knock
from Asia's financial crisis than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The department reported that the trade deficit for April
expanded to a new monthly high of $14.5 billion, well above the
$13.3 billion projected by many economists, and up sharply from
$13.2 billion in March.
</P>
<P>
   The rise was partly accounted for by technical changes in the
way the government measures aircraft exports, and reflected the
swollen value of the dollar in relation to Asian currencies. But
the figures showed that the deepening economic slump through much
of Asia was drying up demand for many types of goods, costing U.S.
exporters orders in what had been one of their fastest-growing
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Total exports in April fell by 2.5 percent, to $77.1 billion,
the lowest level in 14 months. Imports decreased eight-tenths of 1
percent, to $91.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in exports suggested that economic growth was slowing
from a robust pace earlier in the year. A slowdown would reduce the
risks of an increase in inflation, which many analysts think is the
main threat to sustained economic health. But it would also cut
into job creation and further bite into corporate profits, a
prospect that is already souring the partylike atmosphere on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' largest exporter, Boeing Co. of Seattle, said
Thursday that it expected a deepening recession in Asia to cost it
orders for 90 aircraft over the next five years. Although the
company said no Asian airlines had yet canceled any orders, Boeing
has already announced plans to slow production of its flagship 747
jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, manufacturers of industrial materials and automakers
are also affected particularly hard by the export crunch, the
Commerce Department said. Texas Instruments, the technology
company, said Thursday that it would cut 3,500 jobs worldwide _ 8
percent of its work force _ because of weak demand for
semiconductors from Asia and deep price cuts by Asian competitors
struggling to survive the downturns in their home markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade situation has to have a real impact, and it points
to a substantial slowdown in the U.S.,'' said Jim Glassman, an
economist at Chase Securities in New York. ``This is a serious
shock we're having to absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassman said he expects growth to slow to 1.5 percent in the
second quarter from 4.8 percent in the first quarter, and to be
roughly flat in the second half of the year before rebounding in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are less pessimistic, saying the economy is
likely to continue growing, albeit at a more moderate pace, through
the second half. And debate continues among economists about
whether Asia's effects alone will cool the domestic economy
sufficiently to avert the need for an inflation-fighting
interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade figures underscored the stake the United States
has in helping to bring Asia's downward economic spiral under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's troubles have so far brought as many benefits as
drawbacks to the United States, including lower interest rates that
have helped fuel a housing boom and allowed many homeowners to save
money by refinancing their mortgages. But in the long run,
economists said, the nation needs financial stability and economic
growth abroad to sustain the vibrant domestic expansion that began
in 1991.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fearful that a long slide in the value of the Japanese currency
could exacerbate Asia's problems and infect the rest of the world,
the Clinton administration joined with the Japanese government on
Wednesday to buy yen, a move that administration officials
acknowledged was only a temporary measure.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been pushing Japan to do more to revive its
own economy and help the rest of Asia. And the administration has
been pressing Congress to provide more financing for the
International Monetary Fund in case the financial instability
spreads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is we've got to see other economies around the world
begin to come back, especially in Asia,'' said Commerce Secretary
William Daley, ``in order for U.S. exports, which have become a
main part of the U.S. economic success of the last five years, to
continue to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit has grown steadily throughout this year as
Japan slipped into recession and the economies of Indonesia,
Thailand, South Korea and other big markets spiraled downward.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the deficit has been pushed along in recent months
by the steep decline in the yen's value, reflecting the deep-rooted
financial and economic problems bedeviling Japan at a time when the
United States has been enjoying steady growth and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the dollar relative to the yen makes American
products more expensive in Japan and makes Japanese products less
expensive in the United States. Although the trade deficit with
Japan narrowed in April, to $5.4 billion from $5.8 billion in
March, economists said they expect the deficit to increase in
coming months, reflecting the sharp runup in the dollar relative to
the yen between April and this week's intervention in the currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit with China expanded to $4.3 billion in April from
$3.8 billion a month earlier. President Clinton leaves next week on
a trip to China, and he is expected to press China to lower trade
barriers to improve its chances of joining the World Trade
Organization and help defuse political tensions with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative worldwide deficit for the first four months of
the year stood at $49.3 billion, 33 percent higher than for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative deficit with the Pacific Rim nations alone for
the first four months of this year was $46.7 billion, a 38 percent
increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department also said Thursday that the nation's
current account deficit, a broader measure of trade performance,
expanded to $47.2 billion in the first quarter from $45 billion in
the fourth quarter of 1997.

GATES AND OTHERS TO BUY BRITISH HOTEL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A consortium of American investors, including Microsoft
Corp.'s co-founder, Bill Gates, said Thursday that it had agreed to
acquire the British luxury hotel company Cliveden PLC for 42.8
million pounds, or $71.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium consists of Destination Europe Ltd., which is
owned by two real estate investment firms, Lowe Enterprises and LF
Strategic Realty Investors, in addition to Cascade, the personal
investment company of Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Cliveden is best known for the Cliveden Hotel in Berkshire, near
London, a stately home set on a 375-acre estate on the bank of the
Thames. It was built in the middle of the last century for the Duke
of Sutherland and became the home of the Astor family and the site
of glittering parties in the Edwardian era. The estate gained
notoriety in 1963 when Harold Macmillan's minister of war, John
Profumo, was found having an affair there with Christine Keeler, a
call girl.
</P>
<P>
   The British hotel company also owns the Cliveden Town House near
Sloan Square in London and the Royal Crescent Hotel in Bath. The
company is also currently in the process of converting the former
headquarters of Scottish Equitable in Edinburgh into a luxury hotel
scheduled to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The company had sales of 11.6 million pounds last year and made
a pretax profit of 2 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition comes amid a flurry of investment this year by
American companies in Britain's hotel business. In April,
Blackstone Group paid 520 million pounds, and Patriot American
Hospitality bought Arcadian for 92 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   LF Strategic Realty Investors owns 65 percent of Destination
Europe USA, the holding company for Destination Europe Ltd.; Lowe
Enterprises owns 25 percent of the company, and Cascade holds 10
percent.

15,000 WORLD CUP TICKETS REPORTED STOLEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ An American tour company said Thursday that 15,000 World
Cup tickets were stolen from its Paris office Thursday morning, the
latest twist in the uproar over the sale of tickets for the
monthlong tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Pattison, a spokeswoman for Prime Sports International,
said burglars broke into the company's offices early Thursday,
smashed a safe, grabbed cash worth over $560,000 and made off with
tickets for most of the remaining matches, including the final in
St.-Denis on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Police confirmed that the robbery had taken place. But it was
not clear why the company, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., had so
much cash or so many tickets in its office.
</P>
<P>
   A news release from the company offered a no-questions-asked
reward of one million francs ($166,500) for information leading to
the return of the tickets. It quoted a company official, Steve
Yovetich, as saying the tickets, all promised to customers, were
``important to our reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yovetich declined to respond to a telephone call, and Pattison
said she could not elaborate beyond saying that all the tickets had
been sold to ``overseas customers'' who would be reimbursed if the
tickets were not recovered. Matt Thacker, an official at Prime
Sports International in Beverly Hills, said he had no information,
adding, ``We are a little in the dark because of the time
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The theft came as complaints continued to pour in from thousands
of fans, including large Belgian, Brazilian and Japanese
contingents, who say tour operators have promised them tickets that
have not been delivered.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Paris hotel had to call police to calm an irate
crowd of Brazilians whose promised tickets for the opening match 10
days ago had not appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors have opened investigations into possible
fraud that have already led to the arrest of two officials linked
to ISL Worldwide, the official marketing agency of the
international soccer federation, FIFA, which organizes the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary in France with ongoing investigations, police
have declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup, held every four years, has turned into an
enormous business, with FIFA reaping large payments from the sale
of television rights and sponsoring contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As the fever to get tickets for games has mounted, prices for
tickets have soared, with some reports suggesting that tickets for
the final on July 12 may fetch over $15,000 each. There appear to
be fortunes to be made on the black market, and advertisements have
begun to appear daily in newspapers from people seeking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   To date, police and judicial investigations here have focused on
ISL France, the French subsidiary of ISL Worldwide, which is based
in Switzerland. The general director of the subsidiary, Marc
Loison, and a consultant, Gilles Favard, have both been detained by
police for questioning on the possible fraudulent sale of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed a lawsuit filed by a French lawyer, Francis
Debacker, representing four Japanese tour operators who said they
had paid for 15,000 tickets that were promised by Favard but never
delivered. In theory, ISL France is supposed to market the World
Cup but not sell any tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of tickets was directed by France's central organizing
committee for the World Cup, which was further embarrassed Thursday
by reports that a confidential phone number leaked to a few
privileged fans allowed them to buy huge blocks of seats when
170,000 tickets were put up for sale on a first-come, first-served
basis on April 22.
</P>

<P>
   Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said
the committee had asked France Telecom, the country's main
telephone company, to conduct an investigation into the existence
of a secret number and would file charges if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Official phone lines were constantly busy when the tickets went
on sale, and newspapers here were full of calculations from
mathematicians putting the odds of getting through at one in
several million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system of ticket sales was not organized in a perfect
manner,'' said Sepp Blatter, the president of FIFA. ``Indeed it was
far from perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ticket scandal raged, police moved to stop trouble on
another front. The sale of alcohol around a Paris stadium, the Parc
des Princes, was banned during matches and for several hours before
and after them. During the Germany-U.S. game on Monday, a number of
German fans outside the stadium were arrested after minor clashes
with police.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol sales were also banned in the vicinity of five large
video screens erected in the capital to show the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reassure Parisians of their security,'' Philippe
Massoni, the chief of police, said. English soccer hooligans have
not yet disturbed the peace of Paris, but reports of their behavior
in the southern city of Marseilles have caused concern here,
despite the fact that England's next two games are in Toulouse and
Lens.

   PORTAGE, Ind. _ Three people were killed and five others injured
Thursday morning when a Chicago-bound commuter train struck a
tractor-trailer truck that had been stuck at a crossing.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, the truck, which was delivering
three 40,000-pound steel coils, had crossed the commuter tracks as
it entered a steel mill in Portage, 30 miles southeast of Chicago.
However, a freight train running on tracks parallel to the South
Shore Railroad train had tripped its crossing gates and trapped the
tail end of the double-wide truck between the two tracks.
</P>
<P>
   While it was stopped at the crossing waiting for the freight
train to clear, authorities said, the commuter train approached and
slammed into the overlapping trailer, dragging it close to 400
feet. The impact launched one of the steel coils into the front car
of the train, killing three of the passengers, William McCombs of
Laporte, Ind., Gary Berndt of Michigan City, ind., and Glenn Walker
of Baroda, Mich., an off-duty employee of the railroad. The five
other passengers received minor injuries. The truck driver was not
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The two-car train, which originated in Michigan City, Ind., was
the first of 10 morning trains carrying people to Chicago. The
collision occurred at 4:35 a.m., stopping service on the line that
shuttles between South Bend, Ind., and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dave Eggers, a trooper with the Indiana State
Police, the driver of the truck, Keith Lintz of Niles, Mich., was
cited for several violations. The most serious of the citations was
an overweight violation, since Lintz did not have the proper permit
required to carry such a heavy load.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers declined to say that any of the violations contributed to
the collision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board were
on the scene leading the investigation. Michael Martino, the
investigator in charge, said they planned to recreate the crash
Saturday, by which time they would have a better idea of what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the Northern Indiana Commuter
Transportation District, which owns and operates the South Shore
line, where the collision occurred, the engineer saw the truck and
applied the emergency brake. ``He then left the cab and tried to
warn people in the front car, but he only had a matter of
seconds,'' said the spokesman, John Parsons. He added the train was
traveling about 45 miles per hour, well below the normal speed,
limit because a portion of the line that merges down to one track
was approaching. He said about 20 passengers were aboard the train,
which had made only three stops before the collision.
</P>
<P>
   (Train passengers were also injured in two other collisions
Thursday. In Durham, N.C., an Amtrak train heading for New York
with about 200 on board hit a tractor-trailer at a downtown
crossing, critically injuring the truck driver and slightly
injuring two in the train crew. The 18-wheel tractor-trailer
wrapped around the front of the locomotive and briefly caught fire.
The locomotive derailed, though it remained upright.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, two subway trains collided at one of the city's
busiest stations during lunch hour. Transportation officials say at
least 10 people were hurt, but none of the injuries were
life-threatening. One Green Line train slammed into the back of
another at the Government Center station, witnesses said.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, two South Shore trains collided in Gary, Ind., killing
seven and injuring more than 60. In that accident, federal
authorities said, an engineer had disregarded a signal to stop.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a congressman and later as the Clinton
administration's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson displayed a flair for missions that required a sense of
derring-do, like the time he persuaded officials in Pyongyang to
release an American who stole into North Korea to convert all its
citizens to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's model as free-form diplomatic troubleshooter has
been as much Indiana Jones as Henry Kissinger as he has traveled to
odd and sometimes fearsome parts of the world, including Sudan,
Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Myanmar, in addition to
North Korea. On many of those missions he has often been successful
in winning the release of hostages from governments and warlords
when traditional diplomacy had failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Richardson to be his new energy secretary, President
Clinton has given him an assignment which traditionally carries far
less glamour and less opportunity for a high public profile. But no
one in the capital expects Richardson to recede into relative
obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   But even as people expect him to be confirmed by the Senate, no
one expects that process to occur without its own drama. As U.N.
ambassador, Richardson played an intriguing, perhaps significant,
role in the Monica Lewinsky story and he would likely be questioned
about it at any confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is the former White House intern who is at the
center of the current investigation by Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, of Clinton. Starr is investigating whether the
president had an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, lied
about it under oath and encouraged her to conceal it as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky was leaving a job at the public affairs office
at the Pentagon last fall, Richardson met with her in his official
suite at the Watergate apartments to discuss a possible job for her
the U.S. mission at the United Nations. He offered her a job which
she declined in favor of a corporate post in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to find out if the job offer from
Richardson was part of an inducement for Ms. Lewinsky not to say
anything damaging about the president.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Richardson was first elected to the House of
Representatives from New Mexico in 1982 and subsequently re-elected
seven times. On his diplomatic missions, he has always worn the
same sportcoat, what he has described as his ``lucky blazer.''
</P>
<P>
   William Blaine Richardson was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Nov.
15, 1947, and graduated from the Middlesex School and Tufts
University, both in Massachusetts. As a young man, he was
considered a major-league pitching prospect. He and his wife,
Barbara, who have no children, live in the Waldorf-Astoria
apartment provided for U.N. ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his most celebrated missions, Richardson successfully
negotiated the release of three Westerners including a U.S. pilot
in the middle of the Sudanese desert in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded the rebel leaders to drop their demand for millions
of dollars in exchange for tons of food along with jeeps and
radios.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's U.N. ambassador, Richardson compiled what
diplomats have viewed as an impressive list of achievements,
including persuading the new leader of Congo, formerly Zaire, to
allow an investigation of human rights abuses and as a principal
advocate of a tough U.S. policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He recently has been criticized by some diplomats for failing to
perceive, during a visit to New Delhi, India's intentions to engage
in nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Richardson became the first U.S. Cabinet official to
visit Afghanistan in more than two decades and obtained an
agreement from the warring factions to begin peace talks, and he
was Clinton's choice to try to ease the dying leader of Zaire,
Mobutu Sese Seko, out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was regarded warmly at the United Nations, especially
among the diplomats of the developing world who are often ignored
by U.S. officials, for his backslapping, informal nature and his
political skills. He made much of his part-Hispanic background and
liked socializing with delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the administration criticized him for not focusing
on the sometimes dreary details of policy, and he was not widely
respected among some of the other Security Council delegations.
Many felt he was happier out in the field, in his lucky blazer,
than dealing with the minutiae and tedium of the United Nations,
which is widely known in the government as ``the house of words.''

MARKET PLACE: AMEX-NASDAQ MERGER FACES ANOTHER CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when it looked as if the proposed merger between
the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market had won the
dissidents over, another critic has popped up. And this one is
bringing the specter of antitrust into the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the deal by American Stock Exchange seat-holders,
scheduled for next Thursday, appeared to be in the bag earlier this
week. That was when Paul Liang, one of the exchange's largest
seat-holders and biggest critics of the deal, sold his 18 seats to
a big specialist firm, Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg. A vote of no by
Liang could have jeopardized the two-thirds majority needed to
approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, a new critic of the combination emerged.
Patrick Healy, president of the Issuer Network in Chevy Chase, Md.,
a consulting firm that advises public companies on where they
should list their company's shares for trading, had supported the
merger initially. But he withdrew his support after Nasdaq
officials refused to address corporate discontent over the stock
market's decision to increase listing fees by an average of 56
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
   He now worries that a combination of the two exchanges may lead,
down the road, to unfairly high fees for companies that list their
shares for trading on either the Nasdaq or the American Stock
Exchange. He has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to review
the merger with this anti-competitive issue in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jones, senior vice president of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which oversees Nasdaq trading, said, ``The
NASD has no plans to raise fees on American Stock Exchange
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Healy, the camel's nose may be under the tent.
``The time to address this issue is when Nasdaq needs regulatory
approval,'' Healy said. ``Subsequent to the merger, you have a lot
less leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   How much a company pays each year to list and trade its stock on
an exchange has become more of an issue as the United States' stock
and option exchanges consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pending American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq
merger, just last week the American Stock Exchange and the
Philadelphia Option Exchange agreed in principle to merge. With
fewer listing alternatives available to companies, the opportunity
to jack up issuer prices increases.
</P>
<P>
   Issuer or listing fees typically include a hefty initial charge
when a company lists its shares, an annual fee and additional
charges if a company issues new shares of stock. Exchanges usually
base their fees on how many shares a company has outstanding.
Regardless of a company's size, fees are highest on the New York
Stock Exchange and lowest on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, for instance, a company with 5 million to 6
million shares outstanding would pay an annual charge of at least
$16,170. On the American Stock Exchange, it would pay $9,000. On
Nasdaq, it would pay $12,000, up 54 percent from the $7,750 charged
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although this may seem like pocket change, these fees can be a
significant cost of doing business for the small concerns that have
made Nasdaq their home because they do not meet the Big Board's
more stringent listing requirements or do not want to pay its high
fees.
</P>
<P>
   And the annual fees come on top of Nasdaq's original listing
fees of almost $60,000 for a firm of that size. Original listing
charges for such a firm would be as much as $88,100 on the Big
Board and $27,500 on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the bigger the exchange, the more important
listing fees are to its overall financial picture. Last year, for
example, 41 percent of the New York Stock Exchange's revenues came
from listing fees: $261 million in total.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's issuer fees totaled $113 million in 1997, 18 percent of
its revenues. The American Stock Exchange took in $16 million in
such fees, 8 percent of its total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that list their shares on Nasdaq have experienced
the heftiest increase in fees. According to a study that Healy
conducted for his clients, Nasdaq's listing fees increased by
almost 500 percent from 1990 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small portion of the increase can be attributed to more
listing companies: The number of issuers rose only 34 percent
during the period. Most of the growth in issuer revenues came from
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in January, Nasdaq raised issuer fees again, this time by
an average of 56 percent, according to Healy. ``Issuers are being
overtaxed on Nasdaq,'' he said. ``But since Nasdaq has been
unwilling to even discuss, much less negotiate, these fee
increases, issuers have a right to wonder what will happen in the
future when the Nasdaq and American exchanges are under the same
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq said that it had to increase its issuer fees to cover new
information services _ including its World Wide Web site and online
services _ developed for issuers and investors. The fee increase
also went toward investment in technology for Nasdaq's market
surveillance system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because its fees remain below those on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nasdaq says its charges are reasonable. But comparisons
with the Big Board are irrelevant to most of its issuers because
most do not meet the New York Stock Exchange's listing requirements
and therefore could not list their shares there.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq sent two letters to its issuing companies about the
coming fee increases. And as is always the case with such a
proposed fee increase, the SEC asked for public comment on it. But
companies were asked only in the Federal Register for comment, and
many remained in the dark. When companies got their bills from
Nasdaq in February, some were surprised by the higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were small companies, with 1 million to 10 million
shares outstanding. They saw their charges jump 33 percent to 104
percent. Which means that if the American Stock Exchange-Nasdaq
merger goes through, one unintended consequence may be a surge of
companies moving their listings to the American Stock Exchange.
That is, if the exchange keeps its fees low.

CITIES ARE DOING BETTER BUT STILL FACE CHRONIC PROBLEMS, REPORT
SAYS

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A study of American cities by the Clinton
administration says the strong national economy has left most of
them in their best financial shape in decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, ``The State of the Cities 1998,'' also finds
that the nation's urban centers are still suffering from chronic
problems afflicting the poor _ unemployment, inadequate housing and
substandard education _ that could grow worse over the next five
years as hundreds of thousands of city residents move off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   To help the welfare recipients as well as the low-income wage
earners they will be competing with for employment, the
administration has asked Congress to approve an array of new and
expanded programs as part of the 1999 fiscal year budget for what
the White House calls ``the most wide-ranging budget for cities in
more than a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of the request comes from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, which is seeking $1.8 billion in new
spending beyond the appropriation of $24 billion it has received in
each of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the Clinton economy has meant real progress for
America's cities,'' said Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and
urban development. ``The president's urban agenda is helping cities
to continue to recover from years of decline and making them better
places to live and work. This is a mid-term report card with an A
grade for cities, but there is still homework to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   While Congress is projecting a budget surplus of as much as $100
billion for 1999, it will not be easy for the administration to get
additional money for new programs. Among other reasons, Republicans
in both houses are eager to use some of the surplus to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional aide familiar with the housing budget
negotiations that are now under way predicted that Congress would
likely authorize new spending for core programs, like additional
vouchers to allow inner-city residents to live closer to jobs or
transportation lines. But money for new ``bells and whistles''
programs, he added, will be harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is to be presented by Cuomo this weekend at
the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual convention in Reno, Nev.,
provides ample evidence that the country's economic growth in
recent years has dramatically improved conditions in cities of all
size around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major findings are a 10.4 percent increase in
employment in cities over the last five years, and a 34 percent
increase in new low-skilled jobs from 1994 to 1995, compared with a
13 percent increase from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains pale beside job growth in suburban areas, the
report says, a disparity that triggers a domino effect of adverse
consequences for cities. As urban problems like crime and poor
schools steadily persuade many middle-class residents to leave for
the suburbs, commercial investment follows, draining cities of
their job base and tax base.
</P>
<P>
   The report contends that the people who are hurt most are the
lowest-wage earners, who have fewer job opportunities and, often,
no practical means of transportation to reach jobs in the suburbs.
The report contends that over the next five years, their ranks will
increase by 353,000 as current welfare recipients join the search
for work.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent study of 74 urban areas by the conference of
mayors, the administration's report says that employers are likely
to find at least two applicants for the same low-paying job over
the next five years, and some cities, like Cleveland; Newark, N.J.,
and Providence, R.I., are projecting 10 or more more.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's budget request seeks to aid those people
with a holistic economic approach, using urban programs that would
stimulate job growth, improve public schools and educational
programs and create 100,000 new vouchers for low-income city
residents so they can move closer to higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is not working at the low end,'' said William
Apgar, a senior housing department official who wrote the report.
''For those people, we need to have an extra push. The good news is
that cities are clearly doing better, but the hard-core issues are
not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   These are among the most ambitious of the programs proposed by
the Administration and their projected costs:
</P>
<P>
   _ The housing department is seeking $400 million for a new
Community Empowerment Fund, which would be used to leverage $2
billion in private-sector loans to create 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The department is also requesting $283 milion in new
low-income housing vouchers to make it easier for 50,000 welfare
recipients to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Department of Education wants $1.5 billion over five years
to create Education Opportunity Zones in high poverty areas and
$7.3 billion over the same period to hire new teachers to reduce
the class size in grades 1 through 3.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Tiger Woods attempted once again to grasp
that greatness that flashed across Augusta National 14 months ago,
the result was a peculiar mix _ Woods's demeanor was consistent,
even if his golf was far from it.
</P>
<P>
   The context must be set first: As Woods teed it up on the
433-yard, par-4 ninth hole in Thursday's first round of the US
Open, he was already 2 under par and had just missed being 3 under
``when I hit a good putt on the eighth and it went right around the
edge and stayed out. I thought it was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   All was well, though. Woods seemed well on his way to a solid
round and a high rung on the leaderboard. And perhaps he might have
been well on his way toward winning his second major, a feat few in
golf thought would require a year-and-thensome, as now is the case,
since his epic triumph in the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Woods reached the ninth green in regulation two and was faced
with a 25-footer for birdie. But his round was to turn completely
here as Woods needed four putts to get off the green and an ungodly
three to traverse the final 2 feet. From that green onward, Woods
would play The Olympic Club in a far-from-great 6 over par.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done and had climbed that steep hill behind the 18th
green to meet the media, Woods said time and again that he was not
unhappy with his golf and that ``I didn't play that badly.'' It
seemed peculiarly upsetting that Woods was not upset; a 4-over 74
might have been acceptable for a club pro from Davenport, Iowa, but
for Tiger?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd-scoring 74 that I shot,'' said Woods, ``and I'm
not upset with it. I had two bad putts. Other than that, I felt I
hit great putts, but they never seemed to fall in for me. I was
burning the edge (of the hole) all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Few golfers have not uttered those words. Still, the ninth green
was a sore sight, and not just because playing partner Tom Watson
also three-putted from 12 feet. Woods's second putt, the one 2 feet
from the hole, did him in. ``That was a putt that you either find
the bottom of the hole,'' he said, ``or you're 8 feet by if you
miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was 8 feet by.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger used his driver on only three holes _ the first, 11th, and
17th _ but when he pulled his driver out on the 11th, he brought
out more than a few gasps from the crowd, driving the ball 290
yards down the fairway. Yet he could come home only with a par as
the greens mastered Woods this day instead of Woods mastering
Olympic, as had been expected by some because he played the
Lakeside Course many times as an undergraduate at nearby Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played here mainly in the fall and winter, and in the
spring, we were usually traveling and didn't play it,'' said Woods.
``When we played it, the fog would roll in and it was usually cold
and wet. We used the driver every hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, though, Woods could be a carefree college student.
Back then, Woods had not yet flashed across the sky with a stunning
and overwhelming win at the '97 Masters. Back then, Woods was
carrying merely the potential of greatness on his shoulders, not
the weight of greatness on demand.
</P>
<P>
   But greatness cannot be demanded. On the 12th hole, a 416-yard
par 4, Woods found the right bunker and could not get up and down.
Bogey. On the next hole, a par 3, Woods three-putted from 24 feet
for another bogey, bogeys and worse being his nemesis in the majors
since the 1997 Masters. Woods has gone 26 strokes over par on 11
holes at various junctures of the 1997 US and British Opens, the
'97 PGA, and now the 1998 US Open.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th, of course, is made for Tiger, a 609-yard killer that
even Woods needed a 2-iron, 2-iron, and 9-iron to reach in
regulation three. But there was Woods's ball, 24 feet above the cup
for a birdie bid to begin his creep back to competitiveness. Tiger
_ yet again _ needed three strokes on the green to find the hole.
</P>
<P>
   A fortunate bogey came on the 17th (``I was happy to make a 5
there'') when Woods flailed from the right fairway rough, only to
find deeper rough to the right of the green, and his putt for bogey
``burned the edge of the hole,'' making a full circuit before
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistent golf was followed by the consistent words. ``I
left a lot of shots out there,'' said Woods, ``but I didn't play
that bad.'' Then came a few words about the course: ``I was
surprised they had the pins placed so difficult on the first day''
and ``I just played the way the golf course allowed me to play.''
</P>
<P>
   So consistent the words from Woods's mouth. So unlike the golf
from Woods's sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Woods hit 11 of a possible 14 fairways _ decent enough, given
the customary Open rough _ but he missed five of 18 greens in
regulation. And the putting? Not good, not at all, Woods needing 33
to find the 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played very well,'' Woods said again. ``I hit the ball when
I wanted to. Unfortunately, I didn't make the putts.
</P>
<P>
   Woods maintained the same methodical voice. ``Right now I'm just
playing within myself,'' came the words, ``and I feel I hit the
ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Greatness seemed more than a year-and-thensome away.

sticking. But then again, sudden stops or sharp turns could

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Carter was standing behind home plate at Baltimore's Camden
Yards last month, sermonizing about his bat. Carter, nearly
reverential, told how it was more durable, how it allowed him to
whip through the strike zone faster and how other major-leaguers
will ultimately want one.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, bat evangelist as well as a member of the Orioles, at
last persuaded Pat Borders of the Cleveland Indians _ formerly his
teammate in Toronto _ to take a swing. Borders swung the bat once,
twice, three times and then nodded his acceptance. Carter cackled
with knowing approval, then shared his wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first use them, it's a totally different feel from a
normal bat,'' Carter said. ``I mean, totally different. After you
use them, you don't want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the secret? Why does Carter, a potential Hall of Famer
who has knocked in at least 100 runs in 11 of his 16 seasons, adore
a bat that he did not begin using until last season while with the
Blue Jays, a bat he sneaked into at least one game in 1997 before
it was officially approved by major-league baseball?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maple,'' Carter revealed. ``They're made out of maple.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the holy secret in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is the most vocal of the two dozen major-league clients
of Sam Holman, a waggish 53-year-old from Ottawa who responded to a
bar challenge from a baseball scout two years ago by carving a bat
from rock maple wood, not the northern ash wood from which
virtually all bats are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't make a better ash tree,'' Holman said, ``and I knew
there was more than one way to make a bat.''
</P>
<P>
   So Holman formed Original Maple Bat Corp. and has devoted the
last two years to making maple bats and trying to gain a slice of a
market dominated by Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, a 115-year-old Louisville,
Ky., company that provides Louisville Sluggers to almost 70 percent
of major-league players. Trying to break into a sport steeped in
tradition and superstition, Holman has a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too superstitious,'' Mark McGwire told Holman when he gave
the St. Cardinal slugger a maple bat two months ago. ``I've been
using the same bat since 1985.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holman tells players that maple bats, denser and
stronger, can last a full month. Ash bats last from a day to a
week, rarely survive a month and must be discarded anyway because
the barrels become dented. The maple bats are sleeker because they
have tighter grains, a smoother finish and a thinner barrel,
usually measuring 2\ inches instead of 2{.
</P>
<P>
   Although thinner barrels can frighten hitters _ less bat surface
with which to make contact _ Holman stressed that bat speed will
increase. Holman, who calls his products Sam Bats, said that they
traveled through the strike zone faster because they were lighter,
and that contact with a ball was made on a harder surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aerodynamics of a cylinder can only be improved by
reducing the diameter,'' Holman said. ``The barrel is 2\ inches,
not 2{, so you're not pushing as much wood through the air. That's
bat speed. That's an edge they could all have.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman is one of about 20 smaller manufacturers who provide bats
for players, but he is the only one using maple. Bill Williams, a
spokesman for H&AMP;B, said the company has experimented with all types
of wood and even made some maple bats for Little Leaguers in the
early 1990s, but has no plans to switch from ash. Ash, he said, is
the best for duplicating the thin handles and thick barrels most
major-leaguers became accustomed to through years of using aluminum
bats in Little League, high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said if God wanted to make a bat out of a tree, he
would use an ash tree,'' explained Williams, who said
major-leaguers use 90 to 100 ash bats a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, why did it take decades for someone to consistently
use maple to make bats? It is not Kryptonite, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, I guess that is a little strange,''
said Toronto outfielder Shawn Green, who has used maple bats in
practice. ``You'd think it would have happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman, a former stagehand with the National Arts Center in
Ottawa, said that bat manufacturers apparently shied away from the
heavier wood because it is known for being ``too brittle'' and
difficult to control because of its density. Still, the durability
of Holman's bat barrel is unparalleled. Ed Sprague said that five
Blue Jays used one bat during two months of daily batting practice
last year before it finally shattered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It just faded from the sun,'' marveled Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who was batting .266 with nine home runs and 26 runs
batted in going into last night's game, is Holman's most loyal
client on a gradually growing list that includes Toronto's Jose
Canseco, Baltimore's Mike Bordick and Houston's Brad Ausmus. Holman
has filled orders for Colorado's Larry Walker and Houston's Craig
Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, and dozens of other players have sampled
the maple bats but have been hesitant to switch.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, meanwhile, is a walking infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels better in my hand, and I can get just as good a wood
and use a lighter bat,'' Carter said. ``I can use a 31- or 32-ounce
bat and still get the same type of wood as if I'd used a 35-ounce
Louisville Slugger.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Alex Gonzalez raved about how the bats do not chafe
like ash bats and said: ``If you don't get jammed, you can stay
with the same bat for three or four weeks. I like the longevity of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus, who started the season with maple before returning to
ash because he slumped, did not blame the bats and said: ``I like
them. I like the feel. If you hit the ball on the sweet spot, it's
sweeter.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bill MacKenzie, a friend of Holman's who scouts for the
Colorado Rockies, complained about how many broken bats he had seen
in spring training in 1996, Holman took it as a challenge. He
searched for stronger wood and wound up with maple, which is so
sturdy that it is used to build airplane propellers. The first
maple bat was made out of a piece of railing from Holman's home and
was given to an 11-year-old named Adam Healy. The boy slept with it
and homered in his next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That told me we had something,'' said Holman, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Holman purchased a rare Italian lathe that was being used to
make ax handles, turned his garage into a workshop and began
testing and marketing Sam Bats.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Murray, baseball's director of operations, said it does not
approve new bat makers once a season starts because umpires are
given a list of sanctioned equipment companies and it would be
chaotic to continually add names. Consequently, it took more than a
year for Sam Bats to receive approval.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jays told Holman that Carter used one in a game against the
Kansas City Royals last year and catcher Mike Sweeney asked the
plate umpire about it. Carter said, ``It's the new Sam Bat,'' the
umpire nodded and Carter then homered. That is why Carter implored
Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operations officer and a former
Toronto executive, to support the bats. They were approved this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, if you had a lathe in your garage and made bats, as
long as they were solid one piece of wood, weren't synthetic or
glued together and complied to the sizing requirements, they would
get approved,'' Murray said. ``It's relatively simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But making a profit is not. Holman, who answers his own
telephone and eats lunch while his pregnant cat, Marbles, meows in
the former garage, is essentially a one-man company. Hillerich &AMP;
Bradsby dwarfs the competition by producing almost a million bats
per year, which are sold to pro players at $30.50 a bat. Teams buy
the bats, and players who have contracts with H&AMP;B receive a nominal
fee. Holman has made about 450 bats this year at a cost of $43
each, up from 400 last year, but he is $40,000 in debt after
investing $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's eating money right now,'' Holman said of the few checks
he has received or expects from the Astros, Orioles, Twins and Blue
Jays. ``I haven't had enough of a demand to mass-produce the
bats.''
</P>
<P>
   That presents another thorny problem. Because Holman makes every
bat by hand, cutting the wood, shaping it and sanding it, no two
bats are exactly alike. He tries to adhere to the specific
measurements ordered by each player and was working on Canseco's on
a recent weekend, but he cannot duplicate each bat, and that has
irritated some players.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who recently ordered from Holman after watching Canseco
thrive with maple bats, said last month: ``Getting the bat shaped
the way you want it is hard. Players want the handle the right way,
the barrel the right way, and they've had a hard time doing that.
You might get one that feels good, but you're not going to get six
that are exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman conceded: ``That is my inconsistency. I won't deny that.
I've had to learn a lot about copying.''
</P>
<P>
   Holman hopes to survive, then thrive, and he studies games

Little League, high school and college teams to switch from
aluminum to maple.

   ``I feel like a DC-3 on the world's longest takeoff and I
sometimes think I might be running out of gas,'' he said. ``But
from the response I get from people, I'll keep going.''

HABIBIE APPOINTS OFFICER TIED TO '91 MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., New Zealand)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, has
appointed as a senior military adviser a retired army general who
was ordered by a U.S. court to pay millions of dollars in damages
for his involvement in a 1991 massacre in which 270 people were
estimated to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the retired officer, Lt. Gen. Sintong
Panjaitan, could result in early strains in the relationship
between the United States and Habibie, who came to office last
month with promises of an improvement in Indonesia's human rights
record and in its ties with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Panjaitan oversaw troops who carried out the November 1991
massacre in East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that was
invaded by Indonesia in the 1970s and annexed despite international
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers opened fire on demonstrators who had gathered at a
graveyard for the funeral of a young East Timorese man who had been
killed by soldiers two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Panjaitan was ordered by a U.S. District Court judge in
Boston to pay $14 million in damages to the mother of a 20-year-old
New Zealand man who was among those killed. The suit was filed in
Boston by human rights activists after Panjaitan moved there for
studies at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   The general, who was removed from his military post after the
massacre, never appeared in court to answer the charges and
returned home to Indonesia in 1992 to join the staff of Habibie,
who was then technology minister.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports in Indonesia, Panjaitan has had a long
association with Habibie and has been appointed to the post of
``expert on security and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, the former vice president, became president after the
resignation of President Suharto, who was forced from power in a
popular uprising against his 32 years of often brutal authoritarian
rule in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over this spring, Habibie has promised a crackdown
on human-rights abuses by the Indonesian military and has hinted
that he may be willing to grant some degree of autonomy to East
Timor. Last week he freed 12 political prisoners associated with
the independence movement on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ratner, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional
Rights, a New York-based group that brought the case against
Panjaitan, said his appointment by Habibie ``does not bode well for
East Timor or for the human rights situation in Indonesia _ it
indicates business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said the United States should ``absolutely pressure
Indonesia to get rid of this guy _ the idea that a new government
in Indonesia that claims to be turning over a new leaf would have
this guy as its military adviser is pretty outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the Indonesian Embassy in Washington
had no immediate comment on the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition that he not
be identified, said the department was aware that the general ``is
presently an adviser to Habibie and has been an adviser for some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston lawsuit against the general was brought on behalf of
the mother of Kamal Bamadhaj, a university student from New Zealand
who was traveling through East Timor and was killed by Indonesian
soldiers when he became caught up in the graveyard demonstration.
Video of the massacre was smuggled out of Indonesia and showed
soldiers opening fire on unarmed demonstrators without provocation.

 &HT;    The numbers game
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It used to be that the only numbers people routinely
checked for health were the ones on their bathroom scales.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are re-evaluating their recommendations on such
topics as weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, exercise and diet to
determine what really leads to healthy living. And after grinding
through the statistics, they've reached at least one conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines by the numbers are not guarantees that someone will
dodge an early death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to look at a number of variables to determine
whether we're living a healthy lifestyle,'' said Dr. Henry Kahn, an
associate professor of family and preventive medicine at Emory
University's School of Medicine and a Grady Hospital physician.
``It's not just a matter of having the right body mass index or
cholesterol level. ... Things just aren't that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the past decade, patients have become increasingly
interested in living life by the numbers. They want to know what
their blood pressure or blood sugar rates are. They weigh their
food and calculate their body fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned is if people can personalize healthy
living, if they can see how they are affected by what they do, then
they get a better overall sense of control,'' said Dr. James Marks,
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's health
promotion division. ``It makes it easier for them to focus, easier
to empower themselves to change.''
</P>
<P>
   An explosion of new data has resulted in some recent changes in
the benchmarks of good health _ causing confusion and frustration
for some. This month, the National Institutes of Health officially
deemed many of us still too fat to be in good health. At the same
time, a new study suggested blood pressure levels of 140/90 _ long
considered the target range _ are still too high, and people should
be getting to 120/80.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind the changing numbers is a growing sophistication
in preventive health strategies. And in many cases, what once was
viewed as medical gospel is being cast aside or challenged by new
medical knowledge. For example:
</P>
<P>
   Dietitians are re-evaluating the role of fat in the diet. After
a decade of recommending low-fat diets, most dietitians now believe
fat is critical in maintaining blood sugars. Instead, attention has
been turned toward whether people consume too many carbohydrates
and get too little exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors still believe that a normal cholesterol level
should be below 200, but a growing number of heart doctors and
alternative medicine specialists believe the number should be below
150.
</P>
<P>
   Some exercise experts believe that what matters is not what you
weigh on the scale, but how fit you are. And they are challenging
the movement to get people to lose weight. It is inactivity, not
pounds, that leads to sickness and early death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish this country would get over its love affair with the
scale,'' said Glenn Gaesser, associate professor of exercise
physiology at the University of Virginia and author of ``Big Fat
Lies: The Truth About Your Weight and Your Health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thin people don't have the monopoly on fitness. ... And let's
remember that thin people get sick too.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the increasing focus on health-related number
guidelines is that more Americans are taking charge of their health
and looking for ways to improve their diets and live healthier,
more active lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just researchers and doctors, but patients are more
interested in what needs to be done to stay well,'' said Dr.
Andrienne Mims, chief of prevention and health promotion and
research of Georgia Kaiser Permanente.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Astrid Jackson of Druid Hills, both in their 60s,
think they can have an impact on their health.
</P>
<P>
   Active all their lives, the couple now attend the YWCA's senior
swim aerobics class. ``If you want to take good care of yourself,
you have to work at it,'' said Astrid Jackson. ``You have to watch
the stress, get enough sleep and watch what you eat.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief is also driving changes in the medical marketplace.
Managed care, the health trend du jour, is built on the philosophy
that the best way to save health care dollars is to keep people
healthy through disease prevention. Offering everything from cancer
screenings at malls to well-baby checkups to reminder cards for eye
exams to diabetics, managed care at its best has pushed preventive
care to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   But as the field _ and health guidelines _ change, how reliable
are the numbers, graphs and charts we study? And which guidelines
are the most important to follow?
</P>
<P>
   Generally, there is consensus on a handful of specific
health-related numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and physicians from all walks of life and
philosophies tout the value of regular exercise _ at least 20
minutes a day _ for improved cardiac function and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all health experts believe the ratio of HDL, or ``good''
cholesterol, to LDL, or ``bad'' cholesterol, is the best indicator
of health; the more ``good'' cholesterol the better, but there
should be at least a 1:4 ration of good to bad.
</P>
<P>
   And the body mass index _ a ratio of height and weight _ is only
useful as a general tool for the average population; it does not
indicate any kind of health status for those who either are thin,
but are inactive or for serious athletes. Better indicators are the
waist-to-thigh ratio or body fat content measurements, which gauge
a person's fat and fitness levels.
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Exercise points out, for example, that
Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers, home-run hitter Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Detroit Lions running back
Barry Sanders would all be deemed overweight or obese by the body
mass index _ which fails to distinguish between muscle and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also say most of the guidelines are merely cutoff points
defining the line between someone being healthy and someone
starting to show signs of chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals, therefore, need to monitor their own health and
work with their doctors to determine their own personal norms _ in
terms of cholesterol, weight and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Conley, 77, has exercised all her life. And although her
blood pressure has recently registered higher than normal, she is
still diligent in swimming at the YWCA three times a week and doing
at least 20 minutes of stretching each day.
</P>
<P>
   For her, it's a regimen that works on a personal level, and it's
also right in line with what the experts advise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've taken pretty good care of myself,'' she said.
``And when it comes right down to it, that's what's important.''

 &HT;    The creator: The truth is in there _ in Carter's head, that is
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- To fans, ``X-Files'' creator Chris
Carter is part god, part imp. Godlike, he controls the destiny of
the series. But he sometimes seems almost mischievous in the way he
dribbles out information according to some secret agenda in his
head, sometimes leading the obsessed followers in one direction,
then reversing himself. He sat down recently to answer, in his
sometime elliptical way, some questions about the series and the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much of the overall conspiracy was mapped out when you
started and how much has been flying by the seat of your pants?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a combination. I had a rough idea where we were going,
but to tell you the truth, I discover new things all the time to
add in. By choice, I didn't want to create a bible so that I could
find my way through the process. It's like Lewis and Clark. I know
the direction I'm going, but I don't quite know what I'm going to
encounter on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you balance pleasing the die-hard fans with attracting
newcomers?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was considered and calculated. You want to make it a great
movie experience for anyone who doesn't watch television. I think
you can completely enjoy the movie without knowing anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Die-hard fans sometimes get turned off when you get really
murky. Do you just like to mess with people's minds?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do. I always think you'd be much more irritated if I made
it simplistic than if I made it complex. It's a risky run.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much longer do you see the show going?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know for sure. I see it going at least seven years
(next season will be No. 6), and anything on top of that will be
gravy. I'd like to see the TV series become a movie series. It all
depends on the success of this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will those last episodes have to be like to satisfy the
hard-core fans?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm excited about the idea that I'll have a place to go. What
I'll end up getting to do is set up the next movie by what I do in
those TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've tried to keep everything secret, so what's with the
hidden track at the end of the CD? (At the end of the movie
soundtrack, Carter talks for a few minutes about the conspiracy.)
</P>
<P>
   A: It really tells you what you've seen in the series. It
doesn't tell you anything that you see in the movie. I thought it
was an opportunity to give something a little special to people who
were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Why do you think ``The X-Files'' is so popular?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sometimes I wonder. The show has been a miracle in many ways.
So many things have gone right that could have gone wrong. I think
its timing was perfect. The advances in science we are conducting
right now make it possible. Imagine trying to do this show without
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you get a fiendish glee out of all the blind alleys that
fans pursue on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A:Absolutely. It's so weird to me to have created something that
has spawned so much speculation, so much talk. It just blows my
mind when I go on the Internet and see people chatting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've got the whole mythology in your head. Who else knows
it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Co-executive producer Frank Spotnitz knows it as much as
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what happens, God forbid, if you get hit by a bus
tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   A: Frank takes over and he'll do a fine job. Wouldn't that be a
story, though?
</P>
<P>
   Q: But do you have it written down somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's best kept a secret. You write things down, they tend to
get stale, like bread. Ideas should be kept fresh in your head and
never let out until the point you're ready to use them. If you tell
too many people, it dissipates the energy. And no one can steal
them if they're in your head.

MAN WINS $800,000 IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a landmark sexual harassment case, a Massachusetts man has
won more than $800,000 from the Norton Company, where he claims he
was harassed on the job by another man for 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The case _ the first jury verdict on same-sex harassment in
Massachusetts _ comes on the heels of a US Supreme Court ruling in
March that federal law prohibiting gender bias applies to same-sex
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Belanger claimed in Worcester (Mass.) Superior Court that
the Norton Company created an intimidating, hostile, humiliating,
and sexually offensive workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, a former quality control inspector, said that
beginning in 1991, a coworker, Carlo Trafecante, began making
unwelcome sexual advances, which he reported to his supervisor. The
supervisor, Alan Harty, not only failed to address the situation,
he repeatedly enjoined Belanger to ``turn the other cheek'' and
``be a Christian,'' Belanger claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Wackerman, vice president of communications for Norton,
would not comment on details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say we acted in good faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wackerman said Norton has filed post-trial motions claiming the
evidence did not support the verdict and aiming to reduce the
judgment. &UR;  &LR; Depending on the outcome of those motions, she said, an
appeal may be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Eight women and four men in May awarded $843,313 in damages and
interest, plus undetermined legal fees which could put the
settlement close to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger left the company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment, he claimed, began with an unwelcome advance
outside the workplace. A few days later, Trafecante told him he
loved him and wanted to have sex with him, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment increased with time. Trafecante allegedly began
following him into the men's room, made sexual gestures in the
company gym, and once grabbed his genitals, Belanger claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Trafecante could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that this man was a predator and I was his prey,''
Belanger said.
</P>
<P>
   After Trafecante was suspended in 1994, Belanger was admitted to
the psychiatric ward at Memorial Hospital in Worcester for a week,
and did not return to work that summer.

 &HT;    The wonderful world of `Mulan'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Let's not mince words. ``Mulan'' is the best Disney
animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast'' or ``The Lion
King.''
</P>
<P>
   A quantum leap beyond the labored pretentiousness of ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' or the self-conscious chic of
``Hercules,'' Disney's 36th full-length animated movie is far more
than a grand family film. It's a grand film, period.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a Chinese legend that dates to the fourth century,
``Mulan,'' opening today, is a timeless tale of individualism,
courage, brains-over-brawn and love between fathers and daughters.
Our heroine (voice by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga) doesn't fit
in with Chinese culture's expectations of a proper young lady;
namely, that the only way a daughter can honor her family is by
making a good marriage. Impetuous, curious and a tad rebellious,
Mulan makes a mess of her matchmaking session. She has the
requisite tiny waist, but she's not very good at the calm and
obedient part.
</P>
<P>
   Fate intervenes when the neighboring Huns invade. The emperor
(Pat Morita) decrees that every family must send one male to the
country's defense. Mulan's father, a war hero, is willing but
hardly able. He's elderly and infirm. So she pulls a National
Velvet _ cuts her hair, dresses like a guy and reports for duty.
</P>
<P>
   But now she's in double jeopardy. Not only could she be killed,
but if her disguise is discovered, the law mandates that she be
executed by her commanding officer, who just happens to be an
inviting young hunk named Shang (B.D. Wong/Donny Osmond).
</P>
<P>
   Good thing her ancestral spirits have sent along some
protection. Well, not protection so much as a disgraced little red
dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), trying to prove himself worthy
of said spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The story and characters are irresistible. Mulan differs from
earlier Disney heroines like Ariel (``The Little Mermaid'') and
Belle (``Beauty and the Beast''). She's not dreamy/spunky; she's
more fast-talking and quick-witted. Her foray into a male domain is
less to prove anything than it is to save her father. She's not
trying to win medals or be a role model; she just wants to pass.
And Murphy, handed the comic sidekick role, is a glorious surprise.
He's as funky and funny as Robin Williams was as the genie in
``Aladdin.'' When Mulan heads off into combat, he nearly swoons
with pride: ``My little baby off to destroy people!''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a terrific story and great characters, the look
of ``Mulan'' is astonishing. It's completely unlike any previous
Disney effort. On one hand, there's the exquisite delicacy of a
falling cherry blossom; on the other, there's the thundering
excitement of the invading horde. The basic-training segments are
as slapstick silly as an old World War II comedy, and there's a
touch of Looney Tunes throughout (Mushu's double takes are worthy
of Daffy Duck). Yet there's also the Great Wall of China and the
Forbidden City, as awe-inspiring as outtakes from ``The Last
Emperor.'' And just look at the animated horses. The Chinese steeds
look like they're right off a silk screen or some ancient Chinese
porcelain. The enemies' mounts are much like the Mongolian ponies
that still roam the steppes.
</P>
<P>
   The score may be more witty than memorable, but it's a plus. So
are the film's enduring themes: girl power, special father-daughter
bonds, how ``being a man'' is more than just handling a sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is one of those small miracles the movies bring us
every once in a while. Don't miss it.

 &HT;    Osmond goes a bit Disney in `Mulan'
 &HT;    BySteve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The first thing Donny Osmond wants to know is if
Rupert's is still open. ``I remember doing a show there in '89,''
he says by phone. ``That was a cool place.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no more. The Atlanta dance club is now Atlanta Live.
</P>
<P>
   Now on to the main topic: His one-song performance in ``Mulan,''
the new animated Disney feature.
</P>
<P>
   He got the job after losing out on last year's ``Hercules.'' He
auditioned for it, ``but they told me my voice was a little too
deep. I was really depressed, because I wanted to do it so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, they kept his tape, and found that it matched nicely
with the hero of ``Mulan,'' an army captain whose speaking voice is
performed by Broadway and film actor B.D. Wong.
</P>
<P>
   Osmond showed up at the studio to record, but first spent an
hour with the movie's producers ... who gave him too much
information. ``All they had at the time were pencil sketches of the
character. So they explained his background, his personality. They
said, `He's a little bit vulnerable but also strong, and he's
training an army. Now go sing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though some boys may think ``Mulan'' looks like a chick flick,
Osmond got the thumbs up from his 13-year-old son (one of his five
boys, ranging in age from newborn to 19). ``I watched him while he
was watching the movie. It was a great barometer to see how that
age range reacts. I asked him what he liked about it, and he said
he thought the story was fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect with a family of five kids, Osmond's house is
full of Disney videotapes. His personal favorite?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love `Toy Story.' I think it's my favorite Disney classic.
And I know it sounds biased, but `Mulan' runs a very close
second.''

 &HT;    Group's angst is plenty uninvolving
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Since the hero is named Lee Plenty, and the heroine
is Havilland (a.k.a. ``Hav''), you'll feel pretty sure you know
where a movie called ``Hav Plenty'' is going.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot's feature debut
manages to subvert those expectations, but for the most part is low
on originality. It mainly proves that African-American filmmakers
are just as proficient at aimless romantic navel-gazing as their
white colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' introduces us to Lee (Cherot), dateless in New
York on New Year's Eve. He happily accepts an invitation to a party
when his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he secretly
adores, calls from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish name-dropper, Havilland mentions parties with Eddie
Murphy and Quentin Tarantino. She's just broken up with a rising
pop musician (Hill Harper) who makes other women swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's life, in contrast, is far from glam. A writer whose latest
book deal has fallen through, he lives in friends' apartments and
scrapes by as a teacher's assistant at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Down in D.C., in a house that proves to be the movie's
claustrophobic primary location, we meet Hav's arch friend Caroline
(Tammi Katherine Jones) and sister Leigh (Robbine Lee).
</P>
<P>
   Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have the movie
star wattage or sly charm his role needs. Maxwell can't do much
with her character, written as a chilly and sour woman.
</P>
<P>
   Shot unimaginatively, with the flat lighting and composition of
an industrial commercial, ``Hav Plenty'' perks up slightly with an
enigmatic ending, a film-within-the-film featuring some amusing
cameos. Unfortunately, the snippet we see of the faux flick looks a
lot more interesting than the main feature.

 &HT;    Wolfe's latest gives Atlanta a starring role
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Tom Wolfe's big novel on big men and big money in
Atlanta will not be published until Nov. 12, but readers can get a
preview of ``A Man in Full'' in the July 9 issue of Rolling Stone,
which hits some newsstands today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27.50), Wolfe's
first major work since ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' 11 years
ago, traces the convergence of the lives of three men: Charlie
Croker, an Atlanta real estate developer and conglomerate magnate;
Roger White, a black lawyer in a white-glove Atlanta firm; and
Conrad Hensley, the 23-year-old son of hippie parents.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any mention of Atlanta or any of the Georgia
characters in this excerpt, however. They won't appear until
October, when the next two chapters are published in Rolling Stone
and Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first installment, titled ``The Suicidal Freezer Unit,''
we meet Conrad Hensley as he reports to work as an ``ice weevil''
at a San Francisco frozen food warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, a young father with two children, is working the
$14-an-hour job in hopes of buying a condo. But he soon learns his
future at Croker Global Foods Warehouse is as precarious as the
footing on the ice-patched floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrad burrowed on, a weevil with the best of them, into the
Salisbury steaks, fish, burgers, gravy stock, ice cream, orange
juice, cut fava beans, margarine, pepperoni pizza, chipped beef,
bacon and waffles, and the ruckus rose, and the cries rang out _
Crash 'n' burn! _ and the produce crashed, and the pickers yahooed,
and Dom's big voice bellowed over the speakers: ``Cleanup! Cleanup!
Kilo 9! Kilo 9! Come on, Ferdi! You, too, Birdie! On the double!' _
and the light-night frenzy ran through the chamber like a rogue
hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Conrad struggles to keep his job, a continent away the
owner of Croker Global Foods Warehouse is enmeshed in his own
personal and financial problems. Croker, a middle-aged former
football hero, has a 28,000-acre South Georgia plantation, a young
and demanding ``trophy wife,'' a half-empty office tower in Atlanta
and a huge amount of debt.
</P>
<P>
   As Croker's financial woes intensify, Atlanta is thrust into a
racial crisis when Fareek Fanon, a young man who scratched his way
out of the slums to become a star college football player, is
accused of raping an Atlanta blue blood's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all the tight-lipped publisher has revealed so far.
According to Rolling Stone, the novel is still a work in progress.
``I don't have much more to go,'' says Wolfe, 67. Meanwhile,
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux has planned a 1.2 million-copy first
printing and a major media blitz this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Having his books serialized in Rolling Stone has become a
regular event for Wolfe. His nonfiction best seller ``The Right
Stuff'' began as a four-part feature commissioned by the magazine
in 1973. ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was serialized in 27
installments in 1984 and 1985. And in 1996, Wolfe's novella
``Ambush at Fort Bragg,'' which was released on audiotape, was
published in two parts in the magazine but never as a book.

 &HT;    Too earnest for its own good
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The importance of being Oscar _ Oscar Wilde, that is
_ has varied over the years. There's Oscar Wilde the esteemed
playwright (``The Importance of Being Earnest'') and novelist
(``The Portrait of Dorian Gray''). There's Oscar Wilde the
world-renowned wit and elegantly foppish, self-impressed
man-about-London. And finally, there's Oscar Wilde the early martyr
for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third Wilde who dominates director Brian Gilbert's
``Wilde,'' a well-intentioned and well-made movie that, alas, gives
Wilde's colorful life a kind of
not-that-there's-anything-wrong-with-that whitewash. Oh, it shows
pretty boys together and gives an occasional glimpse of the full
monty, but overall the picture is so sympathetic, so compassionate
and so decorous that it verges on dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde's'' most daring gambit is its opening scene. We're in
the wide open spaces of the Wild West. Or rather, the Wilde West.
The writer visited America in 1882, and the picture starts in
Leadville, Colo., where a mine shaft is dedicated to him while he
discreetly ogles the brawny miners.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in his life, however, Wilde (Stephen Frye) is
still very much in the closet _ even to himself. What many people
probably don't know, and what this movie manages to convey in its
Cliffs Notes way, is that he tried Victorian conformity. He marries
and has two children. But one night while his wife (Jennifer Ehle)
is upstairs in the nursery, a houseguest (Michael Sheen) introduces
Oscar to his true sexual inclination.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster strikes when Oscar falls hard for handsome, heartless
Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law), a petulant brat with a title and a
tyrannical father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson).
Oscar's toxic infatuation leads to his becoming a pawn in a
poisonous struggle between a nasty son and a nastier father. The
result? Victorian England's trial of the century.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, ``Wilde'' is a safe gloss on a life that was
anything but. However, at its center is a gem of a performance.
Frye, best known to American audiences as Peter in``Peter's
Friends,'' gives a sweet, regretful portrayal that has all the
nuance and intelligence his movie lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilde'' is dutiful and well-behaved. Wilde was neither. It
makes a difference.

STUDY SAYS MORE FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS ARE WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., La., Md., Ore., Wis., Texas, Conn.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of people have left the welfare rolls
since Congress overhauled the federal program two years ago, but
what happened to them has been a puzzle for policy-makers. Now, the
most comprehensive study of the new system says more and more are
going to work.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress,
said Thursday that there had been sharp increases in the proportion
of welfare recipients being placed in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The findings address one of the biggest questions about social
welfare policy in America. Officials have expressed many opinions,
but until now had only sketchy, incomplete information about what
happened to the people leaving welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton took office, the number of people on
welfare has fallen 37 percent, to 8.9 million in March 1998 from
14.1 million in January 1993. The number has dropped 27 percent
since August 1996, when Clinton signed a bill ending the federal
guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office examined the experiences of seven states
chosen to be representative of the nation as a whole. In five of
the states, it found ``significant increases'' in the proportion of
welfare recipients who obtained jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``California, Louisiana and Maryland more than doubled their job
placement rates from 1995 to 1997, and Oregon and Wisconsin
increased their rates by more than 70 percent,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had a slight decline in the proportion of welfare
recipients who found jobs. Data from Connecticut, while not exactly
comparable, showed a substantial increase in the number of families
leaving welfare because of increased earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office reported that 17 percent of
Maryland's welfare recipients were placed in jobs in 1997, up from
4 percent in 1995. In Louisiana, the proportion rose to 17 percent,
from 6 percent, while in California it rose to 19 percent from 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many more people, beyond those who found employment, were
required to participate in ``work activities'' that prepare them
for jobs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House
subcommittee responsible for welfare legislation, reacted to the
report with cautious optimism. ``So far, so good,'' he said, ``but
there's much left to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, opponents of the welfare bill predicted that
states would try to outdo one another in cutting welfare benefits
and adopting punitive measures to keep poor people away. In an
interview Thursday, Levin said, ``We have not seen a race to the
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levin said that the progress of the last two years would be
jeopardized if House Republicans cut spending on programs for poor
people, as required under the budget blueprint approved by the
House on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee,
welcomed the report as evidence that ``welfare reform is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Authors of the report were quick to point out that some
important questions remained unanswered. The report does not show
the effects of the 1996 law on the well-being of children. It does
not measure the extent of hunger or homelessness among people
removed from the welfare rolls. Nor does it show what will happen
if the economy, now booming, turns sour.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said that the people who left welfare in
the last few years were ``the most readily employable,'' while
those remaining on the rolls may have more difficulty getting jobs
because they have fewer skills, less education or more serious
medical problems. In Oregon, for example, officials estimated that
half of the adults on welfare required drug or alcohol treatment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its report, the accounting office also made these points:
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-two states have liberalized their rules on earned income
so that welfare recipients can keep more of their monthly cash
assistance payments after they begin working. Nearly all states
have increased their limits on the value of automobiles and other
assets that people can own while receiving public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proportion of adult welfare recipients who are told to
pursue education and job training has declined in the last three
years. Instead, people are routinely told to get jobs as soon as
they apply for welfare.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decline in the welfare rolls is accelerating.
Three-fourths of the reduction from January 1993 to March 1998
occurred after January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nineteen states have adopted stricter time limits on welfare
than the five-year limit set by the 1996 federal law. But most of
these states make exceptions in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, welfare recipients in Connecticut may obtain a
six-month extension of the state's 21-month time limit if they
``have made a good-faith effort to comply with work requirements,
but have been unable to find employment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the General Accounting Office found that 2,667
families had reached the 21-month time limit by December 1997. In
this group, 1,666 families lost welfare benefits, but the other
1,001 families, representing more than one-third of the total, got
extensions allowing them to continue receiving cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the people removed from the rolls _ 972 of the
1,666 families _ did not request an extension. Almost all the
people who unsuccessfully sought a continuation of their welfare
benefits had earnings or other household income.

 &HT;    Bad blood, serious consequences
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- ``Character'' is a dour yet compelling movie, laden
with Dickensian incident and a Kafkaesque sense of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1920s Rotterdam, director Mike van Diem's debut feature
manages an adroit mixture of passion and repression, destiny and
character study. It's not exactly a lighthearted romp, and it
leaves a strong impression as well as a sense of a filmmaker with
something more on his mind than merchandise tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   The picture opens with a tense confrontation between an
emotional young man named Jacob Willem Katadreuffe (Fedja van Huet)
and a powerful older man, Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir). What's
immediately clear is that there's bad blood between them.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the police station. Dreverhaven, a heartless and
much-feared bailiff who prides himself on his lack of compassion
for the poor, has been murdered. Katadreuffe is the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   We soon learn, via flashbacks framed by the police
interrogation, that there was more than bad blood between the two:
There was shared blood. Katadreuffe is Dreverhaven's illegitimate
son, the issue of a near-rape committed against his stone-faced
housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman).
</P>
<P>
   What ensues, for the most part, are Katadreuffe's bitter
memories of the relentless war waged between father and son. At
every turn, the son seems somehow thwarted by his father. Are these
cruelties meant to be character-revealing (of the father) or
character-building (for the son)? Perhaps a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   Van Diem somewhat overdoes the Oedipal sturm und drang that
colors their bitter conflict. However, so much happens so quickly
that you barely have time to worry about it. Van Huet is determined
and sympathetic as the abandoned son driven to distraction (and
murder?) by his formidable father's notions of tough love. Decleir
is equally forceful in a more one-dimensional role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character'' has a uniquely European ferocity and despair. And
though it may be a bit too broodingly ambitious for its own good
(remember, it's a first film), it still makes you grateful that not
everyone in movies these days is recycling '60s TV series and '50s
Japanese monster movies.

 &HT;    The movie: Amid action,few answers
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- ``The X-Files'' is like a weird fan dancer, a
sexy-creepy performer who obscures as much as she (he? it?)
reveals. First we see a sexy glimmer of leg, next a hairy hand
holding a pistol, next the rubbery belly of a monster fluke worm.
Glimpses, never the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way creator Chris Carter likes it. His movie is more
of the same. It's a chimeric beast, fusing Nixon-era conspiracy
paranoia with a millennial dread of biological warfare, domestic
terrorism and little green men from outer space. Oh, and there's a
sexy lead couple to keep our eyes soothed when the plot gets too
shaggy.
</P>
<P>
   As FBI agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian
Anderson take a smooth step up from television to the big screen.
The script tweaks their patented deadpan style without veering into
camp. As for those Internet rumors of romance, the movie handles
the characters' celebrated sexual tension with a scene that's the
equivalent of a knowing wink.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cheesy old ``Star Trek's'' transition to this glossier
medium, ``The X-Files'' translates smoothly. That's no surprise,
since the show's rich, dusky production values give it a visual
edge over standard TV fare.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but you're wondering what the movie is about?
</P>
<P>
   Well, as a fan of the show, the last thing I want is a bunch of
``X''-ers angry at me for giving stuff away. So forgive me if this
review remains as opaque as a typical episode.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a variation of the show's ``mythology'' plot lines.
More complicated than ``Twin Peaks'' ever was, the mythology
presents a shadowy network of corrupt men in power (played here by
Martin Landau, John Neville and Armin Mueller-Stahl), somehow
involved with a planetary colonizing project involving alien life
forms. The movie draws on staples from past shows, including that
pesky alien ``black oil,'' virus-laced bees and that uber-villain,
the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis).
</P>
<P>
   It also tries to give good ``boo'' value with a brutal species
of aliens. Unfortunately, these mean E.T.'s, whose icky treatment
of humans owes a debt to the ``Alien'' franchise, never turn into
the super-scary monsters the movie needs.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the problems here. ``The X-Files'' film is bigger
than the TV show, but not significantly better. It has more gore
and the occasional profanity. But it never accelerates to that
stratospheric level of action, suspense or awe that we hope for in
a summer movie. It's well-made but feels long. And it depends on
coincidences we're less likely to question on the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   You may wonder about logistics, for instance. How does Mulder
get so easily from D.C. to Antarctica when his every move is being
watched? You may also marvel at his knack for always choosing the
right direction during a chase and his luck at literally stumbling
into a secret entrance to a vast military site.
</P>
<P>
   The film may seem too familiar to series fans, too confusing to
newcomers. A colleague who doesn't watch the show followed the plot
OK. But she was bothered that Mulder and Scully acted so surprised
by the conspiracy and alien elements. Haven't they been
investigating these things for five years? While she had a fine
time watching, nothing about the movie made her eager to tune into
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Fans may get a headache from trying to match the film's
semi-explanation of things with the hints and snippets the series
has dropped. The movie does not tie up a lot of loose ends. After
all, the series is committed for another two years; creator Carter
isn't ready to knock down his own house of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a better analogy for ``The X-Files'' would be to call
it a shell game. No matter how many times we get cheated, it makes
us want to play one more round. The film is a disappointment, but
in the same way that explains the success of the series: It leaves
us wanting more. It's a tease, always promising to show us the end
of the world, then having us make do with some running, some
gunfire, some explosions ... and a kiss that never quite happens.

 &HT;    Catching up: An X-tremely weird world
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For five years, fans of the ``The X-Files'' have been
slowly immersed in a byzantine world of aliens (good and bad),
genetic engineering, shadowy government operatives and massive
cover-ups. Creator Chris Carter has concocted one of the most
diabolically complicated worlds ever created for the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   If you're coming to the movie ``The X-Files: Fight the Future''
as a neophyte, or have followed the show without obsessing on how
it all fits together, here's a quick cheat sheet to get you up to
speed on what's known and what's conjectured.
</P>
<P>
   Who's who
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) _ Brilliant but
darkly obsessed agent who believes his sister, Samantha, was
abducted by aliens as a child. On his quest, he is uncovering
pieces of a far-reaching conspiracy involving an alien attempt to
colonize Earth and powerful men who are helping the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) _ Mulder's
partner, who usually plays a scientific and rational role to his
intuitive, seat-of-the-pants style.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) _ Mulder
and Scully's boss, he's mainly a benevolent protector who looks out
for them, but sometimes tries to rein them in.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) _ Shadowy unnamed
figure who's somehow a key. Works for the Syndicate (see below) but
may have his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Well-Manicured Man (John Neville) _ Minor character in the
series becomes crucial in the movie. Unnamed British Syndicate
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Syndicate _ Top-secret international cabal that has
conspired with aliens to take over and colonize Earth.
</P>
<P>
   What's what
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files _ Secret FBI files on cases involving unexplained
phenomena (X  &QC;  unexplained). On the series, these can involve all
sorts of spooky stuff, including vampires, werewolves, telekinesis,
etc. The important ones are about aliens and are part of the core
mythology of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The aliens _ There are believed to be at least two kinds, maybe
more. The bad aliens are attempting to colonize and enslave Earth
and use their life force, a black, oily substance, to take over
humans. They have been here for thousands of years, although it's
not clear yet what is taking so long. Some good aliens, who are
shape-shifters and can take human form, may be fighting the bad
aliens, but they are involved in the TV series, not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   On the web
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of ``X-Files'' Web sites. A few key ones:
</P>
<P>
   http://www.astolat.demon.co.uk _ A good overview of what's been
figured out and deduced so far on the conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.AnotherUniverse.com/columns/amhh/amvvhh0605982.html _
On the movie soundtrack, Chris Carter recorded a ``hidden track''
at the end, in which he talks about the background of the Syndicate
and the alien takeover. An unofficial transcript (with
misspellings) is available here, on Another Universe's page.

<P>
   http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Cavern/7094/Cafe/cafe.html _
Some of the most thorough and thoughtful episode summaries are done
by Barbara Ruef on her site called Cafe Barbara.

some of the movie's secrets divulged (``spoilers'' in Net jargon),
go here.

</P>
<P>
   http://www.fightthefuture.com _ The movie's official Web site.
It doesn't offer nearly as much information as the unofficial
sites, but you can download the movie trailer if you have a fast
modem and plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   On video
</P>
<P>
   Fox Broadcasting Co. has released 30 ``X-Files'' episodes from
the first three seasons on home video, available for rental or sale
at most major outlets. You can't really get a thorough grounding in
the intricacies of the show's mythology, because several key
episodes from this past season aren't out yet. If you want to get a
taste for the show, just get the pilot episode, which introduces
the major players.

 &HT;    Florida 'overwhelmed' with fires
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALDO, Fla. _ Firefighting teams labored through yet another day
of relentless heat and roaring flames, and somehow managed to avert
major damage to homes and businesses as the Florida wildfire crisis
continued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got so many, we are just overwhelmed,'' said Gov. Lawton
Chiles, who toured the hardest-hit areas in a National Guard
helicopter. ``Our firefighters are exhausted. We've got to have
some federal help.''
</P>
<P>
   Flames bedeviled areas of Jacksonville's west side and flared up
as far south as Brevard County, near Kennedy Space Center. Fires
also continued raging in Charlton County, Ga., just north of the
state line, where some 9,000 acres of timberland have burned near
the town of St. George.
</P>
<P>
   There were small-scale evacuations in Jacksonville, but no
reported damage to structures.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters offered little hope of improved conditions,
predicting that rain would come only in quick, scattered showers
for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural town of Waldo, about 15 miles northeast of
Gainesville, city officials Thursday maintained the evacuation
ordered Wednesday afternoon when flames crept to within 20 feet of
several homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, we came very, very close,'' said Waldo Mayor Louie
Davis. ``We actually had fire inside the city limits, but we only
lost two barns. There were no injuries and no residences burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were helped a little bit Thursday because winds
stayed relatively calm. Earlier in the week, brisk westerly breezes
fanned the flames, making conditions much more tricky and
dangerous. There also were scattered thunderstorms in the area late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the flames have been concentrated in sparsely
populated rural areas, the fires have sent a thick cloud of hazy
smoke over large portions of North and Central Florida. Health
officials are warning people with respiratory problems to remain
indoors with their air conditioners running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cause for concern for everyone, but particularly for
asthmatics or people with other respiratory conditions,'' said
Suvhir Prabahu of the American Lung Association's Jacksonville
office in an interview with a local television station.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the fires are at least 20 to 25 miles inland from
the state's Atlantic beaches, the smoke extended to within a few
miles of the ocean in some spots. Afternoon sea breezes helped push
the smoke back inland.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials in Jacksonville reported a few concerned calls
from people planning to come to their area on vacation. The callers
were assured that the beaches and golf courses have not been
affected by the fires, said Kitty Ratcliffe, president of the
Jacksonville and the Beaches Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have burned across Florida since Memorial Day,
consuming more than 40,000 acres, injuring 13 firefighters and
killing one person. Nearly 80 homes have burned or sustained
damage. Most parts of the state have received no significant
rainfall since March.

   Host team makes French toast of foes
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAINT-DENIS, France _ The Arc de Triomphe stood stately on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   And the French national soccer team stood nearby, under the
stars on a beautiful Paris night Thursday, indeed looking like a
team ready to march under the arc next month triumphantly holding
the World Cup trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for a few little things, I'd say I was completely
happy,'' French coach Aime Jacquet said after a convincing 4-0
victory over Saudi Arabia that guaranteed the host nation a spot in
the next round and eliminated the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ``little things'' to which Jacquet referred were
indeed little.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to pounding out the most one-sided victory of the
tournament thus far, much to the delight of 80,000 adoring,
flag-waving, anthem-singing fans who made for an unforgettable
scene at Stade de France, the French were close to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was surprisingly one-sided considering the expected
strength of the Saudi team. There were spectacular plays that
included long, perfectly placed passes, crisp midfield moves by
superstar Zinedine Zidane and a beautiful back-heel pass from Youri
Djorkaeff to Bixente Lizarazu for France's final goal.
</P>
<P>
   The French took a whopping 16 shots in the game, seven of them
on target and four hitting the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the crowd behind us, and everybody played to the top of
their form,'' Jacquet said. ``It was emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, Zidane was one who seemed to get too caught up in the
emotion in the 70th minute. And Zidane's grave mistake might be the
only reason France today cannot be talked about in the same breath
as Brazil, Germany and Italy, who have had similarly overwhelming
efforts in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane was red-carded by referee Arturo Brizio of Mexico after
an obvious hard tackle from behind. Earlier in the day, FIFA
president Sepp Blatter and France '98 president Michel Platini
scolded referees for not sufficiently enforcing the
tackle-from-behind rule.
</P>
<P>
   Referees listened. In the South Africa-Denmark game earlier in
the day, a nearly unheard-of three red cards were issued. And early
in France's easy victory, Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi was
issued a red.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those calls might have been questionable under some
officials' interpretations. But Zidane, who was playing superbly
well to the 70th minute, did not argue.
</P>
<P>
   The severe foul not only caused France's best player to be
ejected from the game, but by rule Zidane will be ineligible for
the next two games _ the second of which will be a round-of-16
elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zidane deserved to be sent off,'' Jacquet said. ``He should
not have behaved like that on the football pitch. He should have
exercised more control and discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, France can only feel good about Thursday's effort. It is
guaranteed of advancing, and the offense and defense could not have
looked better, after a similarly strong 3-0 victory over South
Africa in France's opener.
</P>
<P>
   Thierry Henry scored France's first goal on a nice feed from
Zidane in just the ninth minute, then young David Trezeguet, 20,
added a nice rip into the net in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Henry added his third goal of the tournament in the 77th minute,
and Lizarazu finished things off after the snazzy pass from
Djorkaeff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well the whole way,'' Jacquet said. ``We are
becoming a formidable team. We're playing with conviction and
ambition.''

 &HT;    Salacious goings-on amid teacupsBy Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think you'll find us very generous,'' says Marjorie Beasley
(Julie Walters) as she welcomes new lodger Harold Guppy (Rupert
Graves) to her home in ``Intimate Relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generous'' is an understatement. Before long, Harold is
sharing bed and board, literally, with his sexually voracious
landlady. On the surface, Marjorie is an average middle-class
British housewife, circa 1954, busy with her sewing, her cups of
cocoa and her 13-year-old daughter, Joyce (Laura Sadler).
</P>
<P>
   But it's no wonder that the aptly named Guppy is soon hooked.
He's got all the comforts of home plus regular sex and some very
nice gifts. Things get more complicated, however, when Joyce
demands her share of the action. Their not-quite menage a trois
becomes a fertile breeding ground for sexual tension, blackmail,
jealousy and worse.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on a true story, ``Intimate Relations'' has been
crisply directed by newcomer Philip Goodhew. Unfortunately, he also
wrote the script, and here he runs into trouble. After a jaunty
beginning, the film turns increasingly bleak. Or rather, events do.
</P>
<P>
   Goodhew, however, remains true to his isn't-this-a-goof tone.
Unlike ``Heavenly Creatures'' or ``The Young Poisoner's
Handbook,''' similarly themed but far more successful films,
``Intimate Relations'' seems either uninterested in or incapable of
getting inside its characters' twisted heads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Walters remains a formidable actress. Her deceptively
matronly Marjorie could whip Glenn Close's ``Fatal Attraction''
fanatic without looking up from her teakettle. But even she can't
save a movie that wears awfully thin without ever deciding what
it's about.

 &HT;    Sound of `Music' rings far from true
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With its lyrical title and a cast including Jude Law
(``Gattaca'') and Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (``Secrets &AMP;
Lies''), ``Music From Another Room'' sounds like a charming
character study, perhaps a sweet romance.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what was intended. But writer-director Charlie
Peters' deeply annoying romantic comedy is mainly an endurance
test. Peters wrote and directed the lame ``Passed Away'' a few
years back. He's also written the clunkers ``Krippendorf's Tribe,''
``My Father the Hero,'' ``3 Men and a Little Lady'' and ``Her
Alibi.'' The list goes on, but those titles should clue you in.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more disturbing film introductions in a while, we
meet 5-year-old Danny shortly before he plunges his hands into a
pregnant neighbor's womb
</P>
<P>
   (Blethyn plays the mom). That's because she's gone into labor
unexpectedly, and it's up to him to disentangle the baby from the
umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is a girl, christened Anna. And Danny swears he'll
someday marry her. Jump ahead 20 years. Danny is now played by Law,
Anna by a lovely but gratingly shrill actress named Gretchen Mol.
</P>
<P>
   Though she's engaged to a rich guy (Jon Tenney), Danny, back
from living abroad for two decades, falls for Anna all over again.
And angles to win her back.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, it's clear that the movie confuses ``character''
with ``quirk.'' It leapfrogs among its various ``wacky'' plot lines
with all the focus of a 4-year-old whose chocolate milk got laced
with coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn is wasted as an exuberant life force saddled with one of
those obscure terminal diseases you only get in movies. Law does
his best to hold onto his dignity in an underwritten, uninteresting
role.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't help but feel some contact humiliation when the
actors have to mouth Peters' empty homilies about love and fate.
The movie is an embarrassment of twitches.

1ST LAWYER FOR LEWINSKY IS QUESTIONED AT GRAND JURY SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal grand jury investigating the
relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky on
Thursday heard from her first lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by the lawyer, Francis Carter, has been sought
from the outset of the inquiry by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr. Carter helped prepare a document on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf in
the Paula Jones lawsuit, in which Ms. Lewinsky denied under oath
that she had had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was referred to Carter by Vernon Jordan, a close
friend of the president. Jordan has said that he took Ms. Lewinsky
to see Carter at about the time he was helping to arrange a job for
her and while she faced a subpoena in the sexual harassment lawsuit
brought by Mrs. Jones against Clinton. The subpoena ordered her to
provide testimony about her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging after a full day before the grand jury, Carter made no
statement and declined to answer reporters' questions. His lawyer,
Charles Ogletree, said that some questions were posed about
Carter's relationship with Jordan, but he declined to provide
details of the testimony or any other questions that his client had
been asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He testified completely, thoroughly and accurately about every
question presented to him,'' Ogletree said. ``It is a bittersweet
experience to on the one hand have to testify against a former
client on the basis of a subpoena but on the other hand, once
you've exhausted your legal options, you have to comply with the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Carter and Ms. Lewinsky had argued that his conversations
with Ms. Lewinsky were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
But a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had presented evidence
that the privilege was not applicable because Ms. Lewinsky might
have used her lawyer to violate federal law, according to lawyers
who have seen the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has surfaced to indicate that Carter did anything
improper in helping Ms. Lewinsky to prepare her affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky asserts that she never had a
sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He did not propose that we have a sexual relationship, he did
not offer me employment or other benefits in exchange for a sexual
relationship, he did not deny me employment or other benefits for
rejecting a sexual relationship,'' Ms. Lewinsky stated in the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   But in immunity talks with prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky's
subsequent lawyers had proposed as part of secret settlement
discussions that she would be willing to testify that she did have
sex with Clinton, according to lawyers involved in those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said she had not
decided whether to open an inquiry following accusations in a new
magazine, Brill's Content, that Starr has made improper disclosures
to reporters about his investigation. Starr has denied those
accusations. Ms. Reno said she had referred the matter to the
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.

ALL-STAR JOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP FEATURES HUMANS _ NOT HORSES _ FOR A
CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ The best jockeys in the United States
typically congregate only at the Kentucky Derby, and occasionally
at the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Stevens put off plans to ride in Europe this month
because the dates conflicted with tonight's NTRA All-Star
Championship at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   He describes last year's event as one of his greatest thrills in
racing, eclipsed only by his first Kentucky Derby victory in 1988
with filly Winning Colors, and by his Triple Crown near-miss with
1997's Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be a part of anything with all those great riders made
it one of the most memorable moments of my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-race competition has proved so popular with the public
and the participants, it has become a national fixture in only its
second season. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the
sport's new marketing arm, is sponsoring this year's renewal and
has brought aboard ESPN2 for a live 9-10 p.m. CDT telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The designated races are the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 7th.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, last year's winner, will return to defend his title
against fellow Hall of Famers Jerry Bailey, Pat Day, Eddie
Delahoussaye, Sandy Hawley, Chris McCarron and Laffit Pincay Jr.
Rounding out the field are Kent Desormeaux, Julie Krone, Shane
Sellers, Mike Smith and Lone Star leading rider Marlon St. Julien.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in this decade, nine of the All-Star jockeys shared a
starting gate. All except Krone, Hawley and St. Julien rode in the
1994 Kentucky Derby, won by McCarron aboard Go for Gin. And all
except Pincay, Hawley and St. Julien were in the 1995 Derby, which
went to Stevens on Thunder Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   But in those major races, the emphasis was more on horses than
jockeys, as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the jockeys will be in the spotlight and the horses
they ride will receive little attention, surprisingly. In fact,
when Lone Star racecaller John Dooley describes the action, he will
again call the names of the riders rather than the horses.
</P>
<P>
   A total of $100,000 in prize money will be distributed, of which
$25,000 goes to the winning jockey and a guaranteed $5,000 to each
rider regardless of finish. Additionally, 1 percent of the total
nationwide betting on the four races will be donated to the
disabled riders' fund administered by the Jockey's Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much depends on the luck of the draw, jockeys regard
the event as more of a showcase than a true championship.
</P>
<P>
   The horses in each of tonight's four races were divided by track
officials into four categories: A, B, C and D, containing three
horses each. Each jockey gets to ride one horse from each category,
with the ``A'' runners considered the best and the ``D'' the worst.
</P>
<P>
   This draw procedure helps even out the competition somewhat, but
luck plays a major role.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one rider might draw a solid 6-to-5 favorite as an
``A'' horse, while another's best mount could be a shaky 4-to-1
third betting choice.
</P>
<P>
   The latter could describe Stevens' plight tonight. He benefited
from a good draw last year, but this time his best mount is Dread
Me Not, the 5-to-1 third favorite in the second race. His other
three mounts are all held at 10-to-1 or higher in the program.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, All-Star newcomer Sandy Hawley, who will
retire next month, might have received a going-away present in the
draw. He picked up Little Guy, a solid second-race favorite, and
also has a chance to win or pick up runner-up points with
consistent First Gold in the fourth race.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys get 12 points for a victory, six points for second, four
for third and three for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this is conjecture, of course, but legendary 51-year-old
Pincay appears to have gotten the worst of the draw for a second
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay didn't score a point last year. And unless he can pull a
rabbit out of his hat with Pops' Po Boy from the unappealing No. 12
post position in the 1 1/16-mile second race, he might not score
tonight, either.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, though, Pincay and the other All-Star riders
said the experience will be an enjoyable and rewarding one.

Cup soccer tournament Sunday. Except when Iraq is in crisis, Iran
is probably the biggest story in the Middle East right now. There
were huge street celebrations when Iran made the tournament. People
said they bordered on political outbursts. Iranian President
Khatami recently threatened an ``explosion'' if the conservative
Islamists don't relax their grip on the public. (Kaplow, Cox News

activate a global re-education campaign when President Bill Clinton
reaches the country on Thursday with an entourage expected here to
number from 1,000 to 3,000 aides, congressmen, journalists,
industrialists and think-tankers. ``The images of China in the
United States are not yet adequate,'' said Zhou Mingwei, director
general of Shanghai's foreign affairs department, a branch of the
Chinese foreign ministry. ``This is the most important opportunity
at this moment, at the end of this century and the beginning of the
new century, for America to have a better idea about China.'' Image

   CHINA-POWER _ HONG KONG _ The company that has called itself the
``900 pound gorilla'' of American electric utilities is finding
Asia a cruel and trackless jungle. Thorns in the form of generator
glitches continue to torment the reliability of Southern Company's
giant Shajiao C power plant here in China's booming southern
industrial strip. Elsewhere throughout the continent, nettles from
the Asian financial crisis have stung the prospects of four of the
five largest future power projects that Southern took on when it
bought control of its Asian subsidiary two years ago.

   With CHINA-POWER-SIDE _ GUANGDONG PROVINCE, China _ ``The people
who run power plants are exactly alike all over the world,'' says
Jim Webber, a 39-year Southern Company veteran who left retirement
to help knock the kinks out of Southern's first power plant in
China. ``I can walk into any plant in the world. I know the
equipment. And if I know a guy's position in the plant, I basically
know how he thinks. It's basically the way I think. This is all a
very large family, if you will. We all have the same purpose in
life, and that is to produce power.'' At 57, Webber is one of five
Southern Company engineers and technicians assigned to monitor
operations in the new Shajiao C coal-fired power plant in Guangdong
Province, about 50 miles north of Hong Kong. When Southern bought
the controlling share of Hong Kong entrepreneur Gordon Wu's Asian
power venture, it inherited a 32-percent interest in this
1,980-megawatt coal-fired power plant. So far, it is Southern's
only beachhead in China. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   CHINA-TRAVEL _ BEIJING _ If you know China, don't bother reading
this. You are already convinced that from megalopolis to
mist-shrouded mountaintop, China is an engaging place. This is
written for the couple of hundred million other Americans who may
love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't yet made it to
the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers spectacular
travel _ riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing thousands of
years, enticing food on almost every corner of every city. If the
news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to China June
25-July 3 intrigues you _ whether it's an aged peasant's creased
smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the hook in
your wanderlust _ make a plan and go for it. In the three months
we've been living and working in China, we've managed a sampling of
some not-to-miss places. China is more tourist-friendly than ever.
(Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With CHINA-TRAVEL-SIDE _ BEIJING _ This is the city central to
your China trip. From the chaotic alleys called hutongs to the
grace of the Forbidden City built for the emperor and his
entourage, China's capital can keep you happily occupied for five
days. After that, it gets to be work. An aimless stroll or float
across the lake in Beihai Park will put you in the company of
Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or try hunting down the Niujie
Mosque, where tranquil gardens date back to the 15th Century, and
the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple to see an ancient spiritual
dimension of modern Chinese life. Here are some recommendations
specific to Beijing touring. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-TRIP _ When he visits China later this month, virtually
everything President Clinton does _ every step he takes, every
place he goes, every bite he eats - will have been choreographed
weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women who will have
scheduled every second of his trip. After spending hours studying
videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret Service agents
will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and air ducts
blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting bombs. His
armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead. Hotels will have
been comandeered for the president and his entourage. Detailed
briefing books will have been prepared for him, providing
classified information on the ranking officials with whom he will
meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the traveling
White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will have been
installed so the media can beam images back to the United States.
In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around the
clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make sure
the whole thing goes off without a hitch. Bob recently represented
the print press corps on a trip to China with about 40 White House
advance people responsible for putting the trip together. This

HABITAT'S RECIPIENTS, VOLUNTEERS LAUD CARTER BUILDING PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
and LISA M. CHMIOLA 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Harry Russell recalled Thursday how his relatively
simple life got complicated in 1994, when he found out he had
throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his wife, Teresa, was recovering from
open-heart surgery. The bills began mounting, and still are. Harry,
69, has lost his voice and has to scribble what he wants to say on
a notepad.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what he says:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we've been given a second chance at life.''
</P>
<P>
   That chance comes from Habitat for Humanity, which is building
low-cost homes for the Russells and 99 other families this week.
About 6,000 volunteers have been working on the Jimmy Carter Work
Project, which is supposed to wrap things up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the fourth day of construction on the sites in
Houston's Second and Fifth Wards, and several volunteers were
excited at the progress being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house was a stack of lumber Monday morning,'' said
Charles A. Saunders, a retired partner of Fulbright and Jaworski
law firm, one of three firms building at one Houston site on
Broyles Street.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said each firm has helped the others at some point,
lending tools or manpower when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   However, a bit of competitive spirit carried over into
construction, said Jim Cash, a systems engineer with the Vinson and
Elkins firm. ``There is a great deal of competition. When one law
firm gets ahead of another, they are sure to point it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of these people had a high level of competition in law
school and there's a lot of demand in the office. When we get here
we keep up that level of energy,'' Cash said.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor heat, however, tends to dampen that energy level.
``About 2 p.m., everyone starts dragging. We could really use a
midafternoon siesta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Future homeowner Jacqueline Edmonds became overheated Tuesday
and made a 30-minute visit to the first aid trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came on me so fast I was surprised and in shock,'' Edwards
said of the headache and dizziness she experienced.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the intensity of the work took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had sore muscles Tuesday morning. When I got up and
walked down the stairs, I thought I was going to die,'' said Rick
Drosche of Baker and Botts L.L.P. law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Other minor injuries included twisted ankles, cuts and heat
rash, said the Rev. Michael Shirl, executive director of Houston
Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem encountered by volunteers was loss of work time
Monday due to excessive morning heat and evening thunderstorms.
Shirl said approximately four hours per house, or 400 hours, of
work was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it up by bringing in lights and working until 1 or 2
in the morning (each night),'' Shirl said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russells said they are grateful for all the volunteers' hard
work. ``There is no doubt that God is in Mr. Carter and all the
people who are working hard,'' Teresa Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Russell said he will not end his work with Habitat once
his house is completed. ``I plan to continue working as long as my
health doesn't stop me,'' he wrote. ``It's been such an amazing
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Other volunteers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day you do this you never want to do it again but
after the first week is over you begin planning for the next
time,'' said Hat Gruver, a volunteer who drove from New York. ``No
matter how tough you are, you still cry at the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruver, who has volunteered for five years, said he initially
became involved with Habitat because of the deep gratification that
comes from giving to someone else. ``It's so touching to see how
much joy people get out of it and it just makes you want to keep
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   All 100 homes are expected to be completed Friday, after
plumbers and electricians complete their work and volunteers
landscape the lots and finish hanging doors. Starting Saturday and
continuing into next week, volunteers and Habitat staff members
will inspect the houses to make sure all is ready for move-in day,
June 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you build in a `blitz build,' you want to go back and
make sure everything's right,'' Shirl said.
</P>
<P>
   For most of those involved, Friday will be the last day of work
on the project. Houses will be dedicated, and homeowners will get a
peek at what will be their new place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Shirl said, ``We've got another day to go. We just need
to have good weather to wrap it up.''

NEW YORK CITY DEVELOPING PLANS TO COUNTER CHEMICAL, GERM ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A version of this story moved last night. Those papers that
did not use it should USE THIS VERSION.) 
(th) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long viewed as one of the world's most attractive
targets for terrorists, New York City has quietly undertaken an
ambitious effort to counter attacks carried out with deadly
chemicals or germs, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The city is buying germ detectors, working out deals with
regional hospitals for emergency care, striking unusual accords
with drug companies to make medicines quickly in an emergency and
taking steps to stockpile medications, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, about 4,000 city police officers and
firefighters have undergone training in reacting to germ or
chemical attacks. And next week, about 1,000 doctors in New York
are to be trained by federal experts.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency planners face bewildering problems in preparing to
deal with germ attacks, the foremost being how to tell if sudden
outbreaks of illness are natural or purposeful. Malicious strikes
are hard to detect rapidly since deadly microbes might incubate in
human bodies for hours, days, weeks or even months before causing
widespread havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with waves of sick or dying victims is a planner's
nightmare, as is cleaning up contaminated areas and buildings. The
spores of anthrax, one of the most common biological warfare
agents, can live for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, city officials began monitoring patterns of
emergency hospitalization so that they can more swiftly determine
if unconventional weapons are used to attack New York. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, officials say, has asked to be personally
informed of any suspicious patterns of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that skillful terrorists in theory could injure or
kill thousands, if not millions, of people, but disagree on the
exact dimensions of the threat. Too little is known of that shadowy
underworld, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local officials have become increasingly worried in
recent years about the possibility of germ and chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the worries stem from American intelligence reports
about terrorists planning attacks and such incidents as a religious
cult's assaults on Tokyo with nerve gas and germs.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the danger from terrorists was driven home in 1993,
when a terrorist bomb planted by Islamic militants exploded under
the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has provided about $100 million to support the training
of local officials nationwide to cope with unconventional terrorist
attacks. But the Pentagon said only 27 of the 120 cities in that
program had received assistance so far. And many have yet to
receive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York has the most elaborate program, Washington, as
the nation's capital, has received special attention along with
other cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, New York City officials said they were torn
between reassuring the public by revealing the defensive
preparations and panicking people with doomsday scenarios that, in
recent attack studies and simulations, have easily overwhelmed the
city's existing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable part of the $17 million that New York has devoted to
emergency preparations has been spent on dealing with
unconventional threats from terrorists. Five of the 50 people in
the city's Office of Emergency Management work full time on the
problem, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's program, which is two years old, is considered the
nation's most advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seen as the model,'' said Dr. Brad Roberts, a germ expert
at the Institute for Defense Analyses, a private group in
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts added that it was impossible to know if New York City
was overreacting to the potential threat. ``There is no concrete
answer to how bad this problem is,'' he said. ``But we can see the
risks of mass-casualty terrorism are rising. That means it's
important to do something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Giuliani has been a driving force behind New
York's heightened preparations. The officials said the city's
planned $15 million crisis control center was described by these
officials as a part of the city's emerging defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to have the ventilation system of the crisis
management center near the World Trade Center adopt a defensive
strategy known as positive pressure, experts say. This precaution
keeps a gentle breeze blowing outward whenever a door or window is
opened, automatically helping to keep out dangerous germs or
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, New York is the capital of the world and as such,
it's always viewed as the city that faces the greatest threat,''
said Jerome Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management. ``While there is no known immediate threat, we would be
irresponsible if we did not plan for one, even though the
likelihood of such an attack is small.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's defenses are being organized by the Office of
Emergency Management. Hauer is also a member of a small group of
scientists and public health officials who have been advising
President Clinton on germ warfare and civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hauer and other local officials have declined to be
specific about the city's preparations. Some of the steps being
taken and their motivation were outlined Tuesday by William Nagle,
a deputy director of the Office of Emergency Planning, at a
conference in Washington, which was sponsored by the Potomac
Institute for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle said the city had already negotiated memorandums of
understanding with several surrounding counties to give the city
access to their hospitals and medical gear in an emergency and was
close to an agreement with at least one drug company to provide
``surge'' capacity for the city in antidotes. A list of drugs that
may be stockpiled at the city's hospitals was being drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Nagle told the 50 experts at the conference, is
``education, education, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 members of the city's police and fire units who have
undergone military instruction of a day or more in how to deal with
germ and chemical attacks, he said, have been taught to fight their
instincts in such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Docs and nurses are all trained to run in and help,'' Nagle
told the meeting. ``If they do that with a bio or chem incident,
they're going to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauer, the office's director, said the city had spent more than
$1 million to buy two mobile emergency trailers filled with
containment vessels of different sizes that can isolate dangerous
germs or chemicals, as well as equipment to respond to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   It has bought several hundred portable detectors to help
identify the exact nature of an infectious strike within as little
as 10 minutes. One type is as small as a matchbook; the other,
known as an immunoassay, is a boxy gadget that uses an antibody to
detect the presence of a dangerous germ. New York is the first city
to acquire the latter, Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is sponsoring five meetings in which New
York and other officials play out what would happen if the city
were attacked with biological weapons. From these exercises,
federal officials plan to glean lessons which are meant to be
applied nationwide, making New York a model.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of these meetings last April, more than 50
scientists, government officials and state and local emergency
preparedness teams met in secret on the outskirts of Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   They were confronted with a chilling scenario: More than a
thousand people in a 15-story office building in mid-town Manhattan
were attacked by a germ disseminated through the unfiltered air
ducts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the script, the spray contained tularemia, a highly
infectious germ that causes chills, fever, muscle aches, fatigue,
pneumonia-like symptoms and can be fatal. The germs spread quickly
throughout the building, whose windows were sealed, as they are in
so many modern buildings. Within 15 minutes, virtually the entire
building was infected.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, 80 people were ill. By Saturday, 450 more were sick;
some showed up at hospital emergency rooms. By Sunday another 550
were sick. Only then did alarm spread through New York's medical
community.
</P>
<P>
   As the exercise unfolded, the experts discovered how unprepared
they were for such an event in New York City, despite the training
of ``first responders,'' police, firemen, emergency medical teams,
and others who would initially be called upon to cope with a germ
attack on New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the war game, officials said, by the time doctors diagnosed
the mysterious illness as tularemia and began prescribing proper
antibiotics, the epidemic had run its course. Because the
hypothetical terrorist had chosen a germ that causes a disease with
a 35 percent mortality rate, only a third of the 1,080 people who
fell ill died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's detectives were really good; so were the firemen.
The mayor's office was extremely impressive, very professional,''
said a federal official who attended the meeting. ``They were great
at controlling crowds and cordoning off areas; they did all the
right things. But still we got the maximum amount of lethality from
the maximum number of infections from the tularemia terrorist
attack. The scenario utterly defeated them.'' &QL;

TO STOP USING RECALLED HEART DRUG HAS RISKS TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.J.)  (af) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten days after the Food and Drug Administration
took the heart medication, Posicor, off the market, a new warning
has been issued about the drug: A team of doctors in Oregon has
reported that four patients who stopped taking Posicor went into
shock after switching to other drugs, and one of them has died as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four cases occurred before Posicor's withdrawal, and
the drug's manufacturer, Roche Laboratories of Nutley, N.J., did
not learn of them until last week. The company has since cautioned
doctors to wait seven days before giving certain drugs _ calcium
channel blockers and beta-blockers _ to patients who have
discontinued Posicor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients need to be carefully tapered off this drug and their
doctors need to know which are the safe alternatives,'' said Dr.
Zane Horowitz, medical director of the Oregon Poison Control
Center, which will report the four cases in the July 8 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Posicor, which treats high blood pressure and the chest pains
known as angina, was pulled off pharmacy shelves in 38 countries on
June 8 because it causes toxic and, in some cases, lethal
interactions with 26 other drugs. It was being taken by 400,000
people around the world, 200,000 of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it was withdrawn, the drug agency and Roche
instructed patients not to stop taking Posicor, but to consult
their doctors about alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, however, Horowitz said Posicor remains
in the bloodstream for so long that it can cause toxic drug
interactions even in patients who have stopped taking it.
</P>
<P>
   The four patients Horowitz identified ranged in age from 55 to
79. In each case, their doctors had stopped prescribing Posicor
because the drug was not working well. Each patient suffered shock,
in which the blood pressure drops to dangerous levels, or other
serious side effects within 12 hours of taking the new drugs. Three
survived after intensive treatment in hospital emergency rooms and
intensive care units; the 79-year-old, a woman, died.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz notified the FDA and had submitted an article to the
Journal of the American Medical Association when Posicor was
withdrawn from the market. Four days later, on June 12, Roche
mailed a warning to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter made no mention of a death, saying only that ``a
few patients have experienced drug interactions upon substituting
alternative therapy for Posicor.'' Sidney M. Wolfe, director of
Public Citizen's Health Research Group, an advocacy organization in
Washington, called the omission ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Hirsch, a spokesman for Hoffman La Roche Inc., the parent
company of Roche Laboratories, said the company had acted as
``responsibly and rapidly as we could. Our sales force personally
went on a massive campaign of speaking with physicians, and we set
up phone lines so we would be prepared to deal very aggressively
with getting the information out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if patients who have stopped taking Posicor since
the drug's withdrawal have suffered any ill effects.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He is the energizer envoy, a nonstop negotiator who
can outflank and outflatter, outbluff and outbully all the other
players in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Now Richard Holbrooke is back _ full time _ as the chief
representative at the United Nations, a job that brings with it
cabinet rank and a seat on the National Security Council.
Holbrooke, who negotiated the Bosnia peace agreement in 1995 and
has carried out diplomatic peacemaking missions to Cyprus and
Kosovo province in Serbia since then, was effusively praised
Thursday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``His remarkable diplomacy in Bosnia helped to stop the
bloodshed, and at the talks in Dayton the force of his
determination was the key to securing peace, restoring hope and
saving lives,'' Clinton said in announcing Holbrooke's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke may have brought a fragile peace to Bosnia, but his
detractors point out that a goal of U.S. policy _ the creation of a
viable and united Bosnian state _ remains unfulfilled. Hundreds of
thousands of refugees and displaced persons have not returned home,
and Bosnia's Croats, Muslims and Serbs refuse to be stitched into a
unified republic.
</P>
<P>
   To move the Bosnian Serbs toward an armistice, but to avoid
having to negotiate with them directly, Holbrooke persuaded Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic to act as their negotiator and
representative.
</P>
<P>
   This dependence on Milosevic to deliver the Bosnian Serbs opened
Holbrooke to intense criticism that he gave away too much to the
man who inspired the Bosnian war, a man whom many believe should
have been indicted as a war criminal, a man whose forces are today
conducting a violent campaign against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, at the National Press Club, Holbrooke defended
himself, saying, ``Whether one likes it or not, as long as
Milosevic is in that job, one's going to negotiate with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the United Nations job _ his third stint in
government _ Holbrooke choked back tears as he described a lifelong
love for the United Nations that was instilled in him as an
8-year-old child visiting the United Nations with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These buildings, my father said, would become the most
important in the world; they would prevent future wars,'' Holbrooke
said, adding that he accepted the job ``with the greatest humility
and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has been a vice chairman of the investment
banking firm Credit Suisse First Boston for more than two years,
was a front-runner for the job of secretary of state in the second
Clinton term. He even interviewed for the post with Clinton, before
the president decided on Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview in 1996 whether he wanted to be secretary
of state, he didn't say no, just that, ``Averell Harriman once said
never turn down a job you haven't been offered.'' As for the United
Nations post, he said at the time, ``I have never expressed any
interest in the U.N. job.''
</P>
<P>
   That job was given to Bill Richardson, who was nominated to be
secretary of energy Thursday. This time around, Holbrooke was
offered _ and immediately accepted _ the job.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's style has been described as both exceedingly
charming and brutally tough. He survives on only a few hours of
sleep a night, can carry on two or three telephone conversations
and monitor television at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raging Bull'' is how his enemies in the Clinton administration
dubbed him during the Bosnia talks.
</P>
<P>
   A French diplomat called him a ``brutal and schizophrenic
Mazarin,'' a reference to Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the crafty
17th-century prelate and statesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Sir John Westin, Britain's chief delegate to the United
Nations, described Holbrooke on Thursday as ``one of the life
forces in the world of foreign policy professionals.'' And
Holbrooke's friends _ ruthlessly loyal _ defend his style of
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Bosnia talks, some of the Europeans called him a
bully,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign
Relations who has known Holbrooke for more than 30 years. ``I call
what he did getting things done. And anyone who gets anything done
in the State Department is called a raging bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke will be a welcome addition to Clinton's inner national
security circle, Gelb added, because, ``Having Dick at a table
creates the kind of sparks that would help them as a team to
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke himself acknowledges that he may bruise feelings in
his drive to get things done. ``It's the outcome that matters, not
the process,'' he said in a telephone interview today.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke was born on April 24, 1941, in
New York City, the elder of two sons of Dan Holbrooke, a doctor,
and Trudi Moos, the daughter of a leather exporter in Germany. Both
his parents, who were Jewish, fled the Nazis in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's father changed his name to Holbrooke when he arrived
in the United States. Holbrooke's mother took her son to Quaker
meetings on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, N.Y., where his
closest friend was David Rusk, the son of Dean Rusk, the secretary
of state in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Foreign Service in 1962 after graduating from
Brown University, and was sent to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1968 he was sent to Paris as a junior member of the
delegation led by W. Averell Harriman to embark on his first
negotiations with the Vietcong.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he left government to become editor of Foreign
Policy Quarterly. After President Jimmy Carter took office in 1977,
Holbrooke came back to government to became assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, the youngest person ever
to hold an assistant secretary post.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 until he was named ambassador to Germany by Clinton in
1993, he was managing director of the New York investment firm
Lehman Brothers. A year later he was recalled to Washington to
become assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian
affairs _ a rank he held almost two decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late summer of 1995, with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's blessing, Holbrooke was handed the most sensitive and
high-profile mission of his diplomatic career: to promote a peace
plan for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke lives with his third wife, the author Kati Marton, and
her two children, Elizabeth Marton Jennings, 18, and Christopher
Marton Jennings, 15, on Central Park West.
</P>
<P>
   His two sons, David, 32, and Anthony, 28, are both television
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the family plans to remain in their apartment;
his official residence as U.N. ambassador _ a $27,000-a-month suite
atop the Waldorf Towers _ will be used for official functions.

AFTER TOBACCO BILL'S FAILURE, RASH OF LAWSUITS LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGRESS-TOBACCO) 
(ps) 
 By BARRY MEIER c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, cigarette-industry executives have said they would
rather fight every lawsuit filed against them than support federal
legislation like the $516 billion tobacco bill introduced by Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. With the scuttling of the McCain bill on
Wednesday, they are now likely to get plenty of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over 800 lawsuits are pending against tobacco companies,
a figure that represents a quadrupling of the number of such cases
in just three years. And along with health-related cases brought by
individual smokers, new groups of claimants _ ranging from
officials of states and cities to insurers and union health plans
to Indian tribes _ have also jumped into the legal chase.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts believe that many of these cases will
disappear or fail because they were filed simply to be in a
position to cash in on a potential congressional settlement of
tobacco litigation. And officials of tobacco companies, which have
been largely unscathed in court, say they are confident they will
continue to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapidly accelerating pace of lawsuits is also producing
a high-speed game of legal Russian roulette for those companies.
And every courtroom wound suffered by the industry, like a recent
$1 million verdict in Florida, is likely to bring still more
lawsuits, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a professor at Stanford University School of Law,
said he believed the industry had the resources to lose half of the
individual lawsuits brought against it as long as the number of
such cases annually ranged from 100 to 200 claims. But Rabin said
he foresees a litigation landslide if juries start giving out large
punitive-damage awards or if class-action claims like one set to
begin in Florida next month succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could provide a major incentive for other litigants to
sue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, producers face the first class-action
lawsuit ever brought to trial on behalf on smokers throughout a
state claiming addiction or tobacco-related injuries. And in
September, the industry faces another legal test when the trial of
a lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Washington state to
recover Medicaid expenses begins.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco-industry lawyers said that they are ready to take on all
comers. And they add the industry's decision to pay out some $35
billion over the past year to settle lawsuits brought by four
states _ Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota _ did not
reflect the weakness of their legal position, but rather the legal
quirks of those cases and the industry's eagerness not to upset
momentum for a national resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there has been an increase in the number of filings
and we have no control over that,'' said Gregory Little, the
associate general counsel of Philip Morris Cos. ``What we do have
control over is how to defend these lawsuits and we will continue
to defend them aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Little and other industry lawyers point to a number of recent
victories in which tobacco companies managed to have thrown out
lawsuits brought by union health plans against them on procedural
grounds or have some of the damage claims in lawsuits brought by
state attorneys general thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   But even some lawyers who have worked closely with the industry
said tobacco makers now faced a new host of legal challenges
because damaging industry documents had been recently disclosed as
part of those settlements and were already being put to use against
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for example, a Florida jury, which reviewed
documents initially obtained by the state of Minnesota, ordered
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. to pay $1 million, including
$500,000 in punitive damages, to the family of a man whose death
from cancer was blamed on cigarettes. And lawyers handling the
Florida class-action claim are now battling in court to use the
Minnesota records in their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry thinks they can beat back a whole new era of
litigation they are dreaming,'' said a former industry lawyer who
would speak only if not named.
</P>
<P>
   It was the desire to end legal uncertainty that led five major
tobacco companies to pursue last June's $368.5 billion settlement
proposal with state attorneys generals and class-action lawyers.
That plan, under which producers agreed to restrict tobacco
advertising and pay penalties if youth smoking did not fall,
settled state lawsuits and barred class-action lawsuits and the
awarding of punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions were critical because compensatory damages in
smoking lawsuit, which have rarely been paid, were small. But a
punitive damage award, which is meant to punish a company, or the
loss of a class-action case could produce significant financial
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the price tag of the June proposal grew in the Senate,
cigarette producers saw the prospects of higher prices for their
products, lowered sales and the loss of lawsuit protections they
had sought.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, a
company that advises institutional investors on legal terms, said
she is not surprised that producers have decided to take their
chances in the courtroom, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the reason that the industry came to the
table,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``They came to get rid of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the McCain bill and the prospect of renewed
courtroom conflict will cause many state attorneys general to
jump-start their lawsuits against producers. A large majority of
the states involved in last June's plan were late in suing
producers and many of those states, expecting the settlement to win
congressional approval, have not done much pretrial work.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in just a few states have introduced bills over the
past year that would make it easier for a state to prevail in a
lawsuit against a cigarette company. Such a bill, which effectively
allows a state to recover collectively rather than pressing
individual claims on behalf of every smoker treated, was considered
instrumental in Florida's ability to negotiate a successful
settlement with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Habush, a lawyer who represents the state of Wisconsin, said
that while some states have lost ground waiting to see what
Congress would do, others like Wisconsin have been proceeding
actively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the industry thinks that proceeding state by
the state is best possible route,'' said Habush. ``But there is no
way they are going to get through this minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Some initial settlement efforts have been made to try and
restart settlement negotiations between the industry and some state
attorneys general, but one industry lawyer called the talks very
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aronson and other legal experts added that while they
believed the industry could overcome many of the claims filed
against it, the legal landscape remained troubling for producers.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that new claimants like health insurers and
union health plans were assaulting cigarette makers for the first
time. And while those actions might not initially succeed, the
success of one could open the door for others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the outpouring of secret industry documents and the
steady drumbeat of negative articles and television programs about
tobacco producers was likely to have an impact on jurors, Ms.
Aronson and others added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, jurors felt that smokers brought on their own
demise and should not be rewarded,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``Now some
juries are willing to take their eyes off the smoker and cast them
on the industry.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in North American Scientific Inc., makers
of radioactive ``seeds'' used to treat prostate cancer, fell 8.5
percent Thursday, bringing the issue's six-day loss to $5, or 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   North American shares have been led down by profit-takers who
have seen the company's stock rise nearly 700 percent in a year,
according to analyst John Calcagnini at CIBC Oppenheimer in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising to see that after it hit $30 (last week),
people have sold a little,'' Calcagnini said. ``We just look at it
as a hell of a buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   North American earlier this week announced that it has increased
its production capacity to make radioactive titanium pellets, or
``seeds,'' used to treat prostate cancer. The seeds, which contain
a form of iodine, are about the size of a grain of rice and are
injected into a diseased prostate to kill its cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
   Because the treatment, known as brachytherapy, has fewer side
effects than surgery, its use is expected to grow significantly in
the coming decade. In addition to North American, just two other
companies currently make the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   North American Scientific shares fell $2.25 Thursday to close at
$24.25. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in North American Scientific Inc., makers
of radioactive ``seeds'' used to treat prostate cancer, fell 8.5
percent Thursday, bringing the issue's six-day loss to $5, or 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   North American shares have been led down by profit-takers who
have seen the company's stock rise nearly 700 percent in a year,
according to analyst John Calcagnini at CIBC Oppenheimer in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising to see that after it hit $30 (last week),
people have sold a little,'' Calcagnini said. ``We just look at it
as a hell of a buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   North American earlier this week announced that it has increased
its production capacity to make radioactive titanium pellets, or
``seeds,'' used to treat prostate cancer. The seeds, which contain
a form of iodine, are about the size of a grain of rice and are
injected into a diseased prostate to kill its cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
   Because the treatment, known as brachytherapy, has fewer side
effects than surgery, its use is expected to grow significantly in
the coming decade. In addition to North American, just two other
companies currently make the seeds.

SHORT SUPPLIES IMPERIL YEAR-END CLOSEOUT

<P>
   DETROIT _ The best time to buy a new car is August or September,
right? Perhaps not this year: The end-of-the-model-year clearance
may have already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers usually offer their best deals in late summer and early
fall, as dealers try to clear their lots and showrooms to make room
for the next year's models. This year, however, supplies are
already low, thanks to a hearty economy, near-record vehicle sales,
generous sales incentives and a spreading autoworker strike against
General Motors Corp. With fewer cars to sell, manufacturers are
likely to cut back on their inducements to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The axiom that the best deals of the year are in the third
quarter, at the end of the model year, could take a hiatus this
year,'' George Pipas, a Ford Motor Co. spokesman, said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. vehicle sales reached 1.5 million cars and trucks in May,
making it the strongest month since September 1986. The seasonally
adjusted annual selling rate reached 16.3 million, the best level
since October 1987, and the trend appears to be continuing this
month.
</P>
<P>
   James Holden, Chrysler Corp.'s executive vice president for
sales and marketing, said Chrysler's sales have been strong this
month. In May, Chrysler sold 250,000 cars and trucks, a one-month
record.
</P>
<P>
   The strong car and truck sales are set against the backdrop of a
robust economy, and low interest rates have brought a wave of
mortgage refinancings, putting more money in Americans' pockets.
But vehicle manufacturers have also offered sweeteners, spending as
much as $1,700 a vehicle on sales incentives like cash rebates,
low-interest loans and discount coupons in May and June, up from
about $1,100 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In April, after GM's share of the U.S. vehicle market fell below
30 percent, the company sent previous customers certificates of
$500 to $1,000 to use toward the purchase of 50 models, above and
beyond other incentives. Ford and Chrysler matched GM's program
with their own loyalty incentives and agreed to accept GM's
certificates. GM has declined to take coupons from Ford and
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The loyalty programs expire on July 2 and are unlikely to be
continued in their current form. ``My guess is they will expire and
be replaced with something else that is not quite as expensive for
the automakers,'' said David Healy, the auto analyst for Burnham
Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is now closely watching strike developments at GM,
the largest automaker. Since workers at two Michigan parts
factories walked out two weeks ago, 21 of GM's North American
assembly plants have shut down, idling more than 80,000 workers.
Analysts say that if the strike is not settled soon it is likely to
last into mid-July, when a two-week plant shutdown was previously
scheduled. The strike, along with healthy spring sales, have caused
supplies of GM's cars and trucks, especially the most popular
models, to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Inventories are particularly low of two all-new compact cars,
the Pontiac Grand Am/Oldsmobile Alero, that were just introduced;
of the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon sport utilities, and of the
Chevrolet Malibu sedan. If the strike continues, it could interfere
with production of GM's most important models: all-new, full-size
Chevrolet and GMC pickups that replace the company's highly
profitable, best-selling vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the strike lasts, the more dealers will find
themselves short of popular models,'' Healy said. ``GM will have
nothing to sell, so it won't need incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that incentives will disappear. The intense
competition of 1998 may well intensify in the 1999 model year,
which begins in October. ``I don't think the long-term landscape
has changed that much, but the short-term landscape may well
change,'' Pipas said.
</P>
<P>
   As Holden put it: ``Consumer incentives will continue, but the
war is over.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON - An evening with Gov. George W. Bush was the hot
ticket in the nation's capital Thursday as he flew in for a
get-together with his family's longtime political supporters, a
two-event reunion expected to boost his campaign treasury by more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although the money was earmarked for his re-election bid, the
response from Washington lobbyists, Republican activists and
officials from his father's White House hampered Bush's efforts to
knock down talk of his being a contender for the presidency in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a governor come to this city and raise this kind of
money, I think is unprecedented,'' said fund-raiser Fred Bush, who
is no relation but says that over the years he has organized about
300 events for Bush family members, including Thursday's
$500-a-person reception and $5,000-a-plate dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Responses to an invitation to dine with the governor over corn
chowder and beef medallions was so great that the $5,000-a-person
event had to be moved to a hotel from the home of Joseph
Gildenhorn, who was ambassador to Switzerland under the governor's
father, former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Originally planned for no more than 80, the dinner list quickly
outgrew the capacity of the Gildenhorn home and early this week
topped out at almost 130 people. ``I saw very quickly that I was
going to have some very angry folks on my hands,'' Fred Bush told
The Washington Post. ``I have never had to move an event of this
price tag because of overwhelming interest.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the guest list for the reception at the swank
Willard Hotel was barely more than 500. By the time the governor
arrived in town, more than 800 were ponying up $500 for cocktails
and hors d'ouvres.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was ``mystified'' by the response, but he
acknowledged he is partly responsible for the presidential
speculation because he has ``refused to close the door'' on a run
for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the parties, Bush said that for now his focus is on
Austin, not Washington. He declined several interview requests and
his fund-raisers were closed to the media, but he met briefly with
several Texas reporters. ``I want to be re-elected governor of
Texas,'' he said, repeating what has become a mantra for his
frequent forays outside the state in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving in Washington, Bush was one of the key draws at
a fund-raiser Thursday in Greensboro, N.C., for Sen. Lauch
Faircloth. Bush also has helped raise money for gubernatorial
candidates in California and Ohio, for the Republican National
Committee and the Republican Governors Association. He also
participated in an Arizona fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to potential donors to Thursday's reception,
Washington consultant Ron Kaufman, who served as President Bush's
political director, stressed the need to ``send an important signal
about the strength of the Bush network.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time formal invitations were printed, 156 people had
signed up as hosts or chairmen of the reception and 52 were helping
to put on the dinner along with Gildenhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early donors were former South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, former Virginia Gov. George Allen, former Transportation
Secretary Bill Brock, former Texas Rangers part-owner Fred Malek,
former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray, former White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, former U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills and the Republican Party's top three officials _ Chairman Jim
Nicholson, Co-chairman Pat Harrison and Finance Chairman Mel
Sembler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Who's Who of the Washington influence business,''
said Bill Hogan of the Center for Public Integrity, a non-profit
research group that focuses on ethics and public policy.
``Obviously, many of these people worked in the Bush
administration, but when you put together a roster like this, you
are going to raise money at the stratospheric level.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for every tobacco company were on the list, as were
officials representing dozens of Fortune 500 companies. ``These are
the early bettors on a potential entrant in the presidential
race,'' Hogan said. ``Most big donors like to say we were with you
from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the list of special interest heavy-hitters, Gov.
Bush described them as friends. ``I didn't ask their occupations
before I asked them for money,'' Bush said. ``The point is, these
are friends of mine. They're friends, and I know a lot of them
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The money Bush raised Thursday is expected to push his campaign
treasury past the $16 million mark, which gives him a huge edge
over Democratic rival Garry Mauro. The latest figures available
indicate Mauro, the state land commissioner, has raised $2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a equally lopsided lead over Mauro among the state's
voters, according to the most recent Texas Poll. Published
Thursday, the poll shows Bush favored by 70 percent of the state's
voters compared to 17 percent for Mauro. Mauro says the poll is
flawed and that a Democratic pollster shows him trailing Bush but
by a narrower margin, 63-28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Early next week, Mauro has scheduled his own fund-raising
excursion to Washington, where he will be joined by President
Clinton at a $1,000-a-person reception and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton at a $5,000-a-plate dinner. Vice President Al Gore
will attend a fund-raiser for Mauro in El Paso on June 25. All
three events are expected to raise about $400,000. &QL;

AUTO TECHNOLOGY: UNDER THE HOOD _ COMPUTER NERDS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mich., D.C.)   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Automakers and their dealers are facing a severe shortage of
automobile service technicians _ they used to be called
``mechanics'' before computer chips took over most of a car's
functions. While the auto companies are recruiting newcomers, they
are also looking for ways to help current workers do their jobs
more efficiently and precisely.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, technicians at three Cadillac dealerships are
testing a new computer technology developed by the General Motors
Service Technology Group that lets them call up reams of service
information with a spoken request. Called Smart Mentor, the system
includes a small computer that can be worn by the technician and is
equipped with software that guides him through the diagnostic and
repair process.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its advanced speech-recognition technology, the Smart
Mentor is easy to master even by people who have never used a
personal computer. The technician talks to the computer carried in
a pouch attached to the waist. A portable monitor hooks to the
bumper or fender of a car. The monitor displays text, animation and
video instructions to diagnose and repair the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Roach, senior project engineer for General Motors'
Service Technology Group, demonstrated the system at the New York
auto show in April, by telling the computer that a 1997 Cadillac
Seville had an electrical charging problem. A list of symptoms
popped up on the screen, and Roach selected those that the car was
exhibiting. The computer diagnosed the problem, suggested the tools
the technician needed to make the repair and displayed a diagram of
the area to be worked on.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-free system allows the technician to continue working
without leaving the job to look up information in paper manuals or
a distant computer. In addition, Smart Mentor should help
technicians pinpoint problems more precisely, reducing the
possibility that they will recur.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this good for customer relations, the shortage of
service technicians requires that they work more efficiently. Two
years ago, GM chairman John Smith told the National Automobile
Dealers Association that by the turn of the century, 60,000
technician jobs would go unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is looking to the military to fill some of those
jobs. Indeed, the Smart Mentor system was developed in cooperation
with a consortium that included the Defense Department and military
contractors. The same approach will be used by the military to
repair tanks and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the technician shortage is the increasing complexity
and additional electronics of today's cars and trucks. In 1965,
GM's service manuals contained 5,000 pages of text; the manuals now
run to 120,000 pages, and are likely to reach 200,000 pages within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the system is Coast Cadillac, Sarasota, Fla.; Suburban
Cadillac, Troy, Mich., and Lindsay Cadillac, Washington.

 &HT;    Braves roll as Maddux wins 10th
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Cy Young Award has been passed around for a
couple of years. Greg Maddux apparently would like to have it back
now.
</P>
<P>
   Subdued for five superb innings by Florida rookie Jesus Sanchez,
the Braves turned around Wednesday night with a four-run sixth to
beat the Marlins 6-2 and make Maddux baseball's first 10-game
winner of the year. Scratched for two unearned runs in the fourth
off a Tony Graffanino error, Maddux bore down to hold Florida
scoreless the rest of the way to improve his record to 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   Winning their fourth straight, the Braves finally subdued
Sanchez with a four-run sixth, Gerald Williams' two-run double the
critical blow. Chipper Jones then closed the show with a two-run
homer in the seventh, his 18th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux extended his win streak to eight games, the longest in
the NL this season.
</P>
<P>
   Held scoreless for the first five innings for just the seventh
time this season, the Braves went up 4-2 in the sixth, which Maddux
began with a cue-shot single past first baseman Ryan Jackson. After
Walt Weiss walked on four pitches, Williams ripped Sanchez's first
pitch down the left field line, scoring both men to tie it. The
double was Williams second of the game and his third in his
previous four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, who had struck out twice with men on, hit the
first pitch into the right-center gap for a 3-2 lead and after
Andruw Jones walked to load the bases, Danny Bautista sent a
shallow fly into right field. Chipper Jones tagged up anyway and
scored easily for a 4-2 advantage when Mark Kotsay's throw bounced
twice on the way to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first five innings, Sanchez struck out nine and
although he had allowed a pair of doubles, both times he maneuvered
around the trouble. After Chipper Jones' two-out double in the
first, Sanchez struck out Galarraga to end the inning. After
Williams opened the fourth with a double, Sanchez fanned both Jones
and Galarraga before inducing an inning-ending ground-out from
Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux faced the minimum through the first three innings but
Todd Dunwoody became a problem in the fourth when he reached first
on second baseman Tony Graffanino's fourth error of the season.
Advanced to third by Edgar Renteria's sacrifice and Kotsay's
ground-out, Dunwoody scored the night's first run on Todd Zeile's
single.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, hitting .363 with runners in scoring position and two
outs since joining the Marlins, stole second on a 2-1 pitch to
Cliff Floyd. The Marlins' lead then grew to 2-0 when Floyd sent a
sinking liner into right, which Williams could not handle in a
diving attempt. Both runs were unearned.

 &HT;    Sterilization pill distributor under fire
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ In this region with one of America's fastest
growing Hispanic populations, little-known scientist Stephen D.
Mumford offers an unorthodox solution to the immigration problem he
sees brewing.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that developing nations supply women with tiny pills
that prevent pregnancy by scarring their fallopian tubes_pills that
Mumford already supplies. The permanent sterilization would, in
turn, reduce the number of immigrants to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, quinacrine tablets that Mumford and fellow
contraceptive researcher Elton Kessel have distributed to Third
World countries have been used to sterilize more than 100,000
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this method has great promise,'' Mumford said
Thursday. ``We know what the world needs in the way of a
contraceptive method for women who do not want any more children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Mumford's controversial role in international
contraception was reported in Thursday's editions of The Wall
Street Journal, the phone has been ringing in his brick split-level
house on the outskirts of this university town. Mostly, he said,
news organizations wanted him to elaborate on his views, or appear
on television talk shows where, Mumford concedes, he would likely
be lambasted as inhumane or crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in his living room, decorated in Oriential wall hangings,
drawings and figurines by his Chinese-born wife, Mumford said, ``I
am not anti-immigrant.''
</P>
<P>
   He said much of the U.S. population growth over the next half
century will be driven by immigrants, and he fears they will sap
the nation's resources and drive down the overall standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in America you value is going to be greatly
diminished, including your personal freedom,'' said Mumford. ``If
you want to let this happen, you can live like they do in Mexico or
in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those attacking Mumford's work was Mike Leary, publisher
of the Hispanic newspaper, La Conexion in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going around and disfiguring people is not the answer. That is
heinous,'' Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a vasectomy, and I'm glad I permanently injured my
body,'' said Mumford, 55, thumbing through a stack of scientific
research. He said it indicates that quinacrine sterilization is
safe, despite other findings that quinacrine causes cells to
mutate, possible circumstantial evidence that it may cause cancer.
The chemical is inserted directly into the uterus at the tip of a
long slender tube.
</P>
<P>
   First used by American soldiers in World War II to prevent
malaria, quinacrine is barred in the United States for
sterilizations. Many health organizations question its
effectiveness considering the possible risks.
</P>
<P>
   Funded over the past decade by $1 million from U.S. backers,
including anti-immigration advocates, Mumford's efforts are
familiar to some in the field of population control. The recent
publicity, however, unleashed fresh criticism that repressive
governments can use quinacrine sterilization against women's will.
</P>
<P>
   In his Third World travels, Mumford said, he discovered many
women who welcomed the contraception rather than risking sickness
or death giving birth in unsanitary conditions. ``The benefit is
you avoid surgery; it is much cheaper; it is vastly easier,'' he
said. In the United States, the method is still unproven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that before it should be used in human beings,
it should go through rigorous safety testing that all contraceptive
methods go through,'' said Jo Ann Lewis, senior vice president for
reproductive health programs at Family Health International, a
nonprofit research organization in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mumford worked for the organization , but left in the early
1980s in a rift with more traditional researchers. His views on
immigration illustrate the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the point of departure for most of us working in
international family planning,'' Lewis said. ``Our goal is to make
available safe, effective methods to allow families to determine
the number and spacing of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is planning, but it is personal,'' she said. ``It is not
being dictated by a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumford said he is fighting ``the very strong anti-family
planning movement in America. The science is on our side, except
this claim that it could cause cancer. What they have is political
influence.

 &HT;    Struggling Wohlers off to minors
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Servic
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Mark Wohlers began walking from the bullpen with the
last pitch Thursday and did not stop until he found himself in the
manager's office, asking Bobby Cox to send him to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Braves are uncertain how to handle the transaction,
Wohlers will leave today for the club's minor-league complex in
Orlando, where the deposed closer will attempt to relocate the
strike zone. To remain with the Braves had become a waste of
everyone's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to take a step back to take a step
forward,'' Wohlers said. ``I know if I get a chance to pitch, I'll
be okay. I just want to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves closed out their nine-game homestand with a 3-2 loss
to the Florida Marlins, who beat Tom Glavine (9-3) for their first
road victory since May 18. Atlanta went 5-4 against visiting
Boston, Montreal and Florida, which claimed its sixth away victory
on an RBI single by Todd Ziele off Dennis Martinez with two outs in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta opens a weekend series in Montreal tonight. In the
meanwhile, the Braves are plotting options with Wohlers. The club
could place him on the disabled list again, claiming he is still
unfit to pitch because of the torn left oblique injured on May 4.
He then would be eligible to appear in Gulf Coast (Rookie) League
games with the Gulf Coast Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He also could accept an optional assignment; players with five
years experience first must agree to such a move. But because
Wohlers is 28 and above the rookie-league minimum, he could not
appear in Gulf Coast competition. Guy Hansen, the Braves' special
assistant for scouting and player development, will join him on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk a little more with Mark and work out some
details,'' said Dean Taylor, the team's assistant general manager.
``We should have everything taken care of by game time (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was time to do something,'' said Wohlers, who had
made one appearance _ he threw four straight balls on June 12 and
was pulled by Cox _ in the last nine days. ``When I can't pitch
when we're winning by seven (as happened Tuesday night), when am I
going to pitch? I'm fine with it. I could have continued to hide up
here and pitch once every 10 days, but I'm doing this more for me
than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The assignment is open-ended, and no determination has been made
when Wohlers (0-1, 8-for-8 in save chances, 5.06 ERA) might rejoin
the team. If rumors about his future with the club were moving
before Thursday, they will be flying now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I heard some things? Absolutely,'' Wohlers said.

 &HT;    Wreck takes life of Gilbert cousin
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia linebacker Tony Gilbert might miss Saturday's
game after learning Thursday that his 9-year-old cousin, Maggie
Dunning, was killed in a car accident on I-75 in Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie was one of four passengers in a van returning to Macon
from a baby's christening in Atlanta earlier this week. According
to police reports, the driver of the vehicle, Sally Lary, fell
asleep at the wheel, veered off the road and struck an abandoned
tractor trailer parked in the emergency lane. Maggie was wearing
her seat belt but was killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert did not learn of the accident until Thursday. He was
pulled out of the morning practice to take a telephone call from
his mother. Visibly shaken, Gilbert sat out the rest of the
practice and was consoled by coaches and managers.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert will be a pallbearer at Maggie's funeral at noon
Saturday in Macon. Whether he will return for the 6 p.m. game is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to let Tony do what he feels like he needs to
do,'' Georgia coach Rodney Walker said. ``It's totally up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, a 6-foot-1, 225-pound linebacker from Central Macon
High, is a University of Georgia signee.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales brisk
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Rite Festival officials are hoping for a record crowd
Saturday at the Georgia Dome. Executive director Shelton Stevens
said ticket sales this week are ``ahead of last year'' when 11,200
passed through the turnstiles. He said they're expecting ``a
minimum of 15,000'' for this year's game and are ``hoping for more
than 20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest crowd in the history of the series was 17,652, in
Orlando in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field
</P>
<P>
   The players enjoyed a lighter-than-usual workday Thursday. After
a two-hour practice in shorts and shoulder pads and lunch at Morris
Brown's Hickman Center, the two teams attended the Braves-Marlins
game at Turner Field. They followed that with dinner at the Varsity
and a tour of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the teams have toured the Falcons complex and been to
Stone Mountain Park and Six Flags. Today, the players will visit
with patients at the Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center in the
morning, practice in the afternoon and attend the official All-Star
banquet at Zoo Atlanta tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Piano man
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Ben Claxton is not your average offensive lineman. The
6-3, 280-pound Ole Miss signee from Dublin is an accomplished
pianist who has earned a ``superior ranking'' in competition. He
said his favorite piece is Mozart's Sonata in D minor.
</P>
<P>
   This and that
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-Florida Game will be the last high school assignment
for longtime Washington-Wilkes coach Butch Brooks. He starts his
new job at Georgia Tech as director of high school relations on
July 1. ... Officials for Saturday's game are all from the college
ranks, four from the Southeastern Conference, three from the
Atlantic Coast Conference and one from the Southern Conference. ...
There probably is more interest in the Alabama-Auburn rivalry than
the Florida-Georgia rivalry in the home of Union County High's
Phillip Weeks. The Florida free safety will play for Alabama this
fall. His brother Adrian is an Auburn linebacker.

 &HT;    Florida may opt out of all-star game
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Unless the Scottish Rite Festival expands the annual
Georgia-Florida All-Star Football Game to include a basketball game
or another interstate football game, Florida may choose not to
return to Atlanta after 1999, when the current three-year deal
expires.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Athletic Coaches Association executive director Wink
Barnette said his organization agreed to the pact with the
understanding that Scottish Rite would add a Georgia-Florida
All-Star basketball game and bring football all-star teams from
Tennessee and either Kentucky or Alabama to form a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of pressure on us to bring (the game) back
down here,'' Barnette said Thursday from Florida. ``If those things
don't take place, then that makes it a little tougher for us (to
sign a contract extension).''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-Florida game was played in Florida for 12 years
before flagging ticket sales brought it to Atlanta last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what it takes to keep the game here,'' Scottish Rite
Festival executive director Shelton Stevens said.

 &HT;    Radical dude
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- Chad Smith's got a pierced eyebrow, a tongue ring
and furry spotted pants that are available from his
alternative-clothing company, Vinyl Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he can skate, too, which got him into the ESPN X Games
this weekend. But it's the look that will get him on TV. Air time,
it seems, is an even bigger deal than the $10,000 purse in his
event.
</P>
<P>
   Bogus? Maybe. That's the X Games _ part sport, part made-for-TV
entertainment tailored for the generation it's named for.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's never finished higher than fourth in the downhill
in-line competition, a kamikaze, 40-second bolt down the streets of
San Diego, taking S-turns and corners at 60 mph. But thanks to
reruns of a spectacular spill he took two years ago, Smith is the
self-proclaimed ``X Games Poster Boy.'' He wiped out into some hay
bales, skidded 30 yards and then got back on his skates. The clip
made him the X Games' equivalent to the ``agony of defeat'' skier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I got fifth, and I got more publicity than anyone
else there,'' boasted Smith, 23, of Roswell. ``ESPN will jump on my
clothes company because it's way off the edge and focus on that big
time. It'll be, 'Here's Chad Smith,' with the furry-pants footage.
They'll pump me up. I know that's what they're trying to get, that
aggressive, alternative look.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been called the Dennis Rodman of his sport. ``I know if I
was just like the other in-line skaters, I wouldn't get the
publicity,'' Smith conceded. ``No onegets more write-ups than me,
and I don't even win.''
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees more than Derek Downing of Cumming, who has won
the downhill in-line twice in the three-year X Games history. He's
enjoyed a few perks, like seeing his trophies displayed at the
All-Star Cafe. But in terms of exposure, his friend Smith has him
beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our sport, we've never had the chance to be on TV, and
everyone wants to get on it,'' Downing said. At the X Games, he
says, ``You've got to do what you do to get on TV, either act crazy
_ or win.''
</P>
<P>
   Downing, 24, has a clean-cut look like most professional in-line
skaters. Their corporate backers want to downplay the sport's
danger to parents whose kids are begging for skates. Downing's
spandex Rollerblade uniform hides his pierced nipple because
``sponsors don't want to have someone all freaked-out-looking,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, wildness doesn't get you to the bottom first,''
said Downing.
</P>
<P>
   The prize money, three times larger than what's offered at most
pro skating events, ensures a competitive field _ even though
skaters don't take these kind of risks any other time all year.
Most in-line races are distance events on flatter terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes us go to the extreme and do something we're not
used to,'' said Kim Darnell, 19, of Loganville. ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to see the perceived expression of danger,'' X
Games executive director Jack Weinert said, comparing the X Games
to pro wrestling. ``We are really driven by trying to hold people's
attention. There's not a whole heck of a lot of people who will
stay glued to the set watching someone do a criterium.''
</P>
<P>
   The format, cameras and hype have stamped the X Games as
made-for-TV, a label that makes organizers bristle. Out of the
extreme sports culture, they say, have emerged personalities that
cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing the athletes have figured out is how to get on TV,''
Weinert said. ``We like to exhibit their real personality. If
(downhill skater) Gypsy Tidwell lets out a coyote yell and kisses
the wind, there is no way in the world that's not going to get
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Smith and other X-troverts is staying fresh in
an age in which images are flashed worldwide in seconds. ``Pretty
soon there won't be much that is alternative,'' Smith said,
``because so many people will be doing what we're doing. Then I'll
have to do something else.''

<P>
   Embracing a trend that is rapidly reshaping the Internet, Walt
Disney Co. let it be known Thursday that the Tomorrowland of
cyberspace will be entered through a giant consumer gateway cobbled
with the gadgets of interactive technologies and the proven lure of
traditional media _ news, sports, entertainment and information.
</P>
<P>
   Following a trail blazed by America Online and Yahoo, media and
technology giants alike are rushing to construct these gateways, or
``portals,'' through which people venture into cyberspace. The
reason is simple economics: if they can control traffic, they can
move more people past the billboards that line the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Disney announced a complex deal valued at about
$900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service
that helps guide users to what they want on the World Wide Web. The
announcement capped two weeks of fevered developments across media
and technology industries that were too small to shake the
financial markets but obviously a trend that was too significant to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, General Electric's NBC unit struck a deal to take
control of Snap, an upstart online directory service, for up to $65
million in cash and more than $100 million in free television
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday it was reported that AT&AMP;T had been negotiating to
acquire America Online. And on Tuesday, Microsoft Corp. opened a
public test of its new portal, known as Start, which is expected to
be in full operation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Netscape Communications Corp. is busy shifting
its focus from making browsers to operating a portal site, and
media giants like Time Warner and News Corp. are looking to build
or buy similar services.
</P>
<P>
   While there are tens of thousands of commercial Web sites, most
of the attention is now focused on the handful that help users find
the information, services or entertainment what they are looking
for. Since many people use these sites to start their treks through
cyberspace, they are far and away the most popular places on the
Internet. As a result, they have attracted the lion's share of
advertising as well as investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which 18 months ago was drowning in busy signals
and irate customers, has rebounded into the powerhouse of
cyberspace with 12 million paying customers, a market value of $19
billion and the self assurance to rebuff AT&AMP;T's takeover offer last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the largest of the free, advertiser-supported portal
services, attracts more than 70 million users a month and has a
value of about $6 billion, despite barely breaking even.
</P>
<P>
   As these sites grow rapidly in market value and viewership _ if
not profits _ many media companies are deciding that they need to
buy one quickly, despite the high prices, before they become
unaffordable. More than one media giant has expressed regret for
not having bought America Online when it was much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media companies are starting to wake up and realizing that
the Internet has the reach of a mass medium,'' said Jonathan
Nelson, chief executive of Organic, one of the largest online
advertising agencies
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as television, telephones and computers all converge
into one integrated network of communications and entertainment,
companies of all sorts see portals as a possible keystone to their
future strategy. The power to funnel users to certain advertisers
and content sites is worth millions of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search engines have become to the Internet what Windows is
to the computer desktop,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing director
of Broadview Associates, a technology investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's intention is to create a new Internet service that
combines Infoseek with its existing offerings, which include Web
sites for ABC television, ABC News, the ESPN sports network,
Disney's movies, and a site of original Disney entertainment for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no site that has both the breadth of Infoseek's
search and directory service and the depth of Disney's news,
sports, entertainment and family content,'' said Jake Winebaum,
chairman of Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, like many other media companies, has been talking to a
number of portal services over the last year. A few months ago, it
was close to buying a part of Excite, the No. 2 portal service, but
the deal fell apart over the price, investment bankers said.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock of the search services trading at stratospheric
prices, big companies have been loath to buy them either with cash
or their own, more conventionally valued shares.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's deal gets around this problem by trading some of its
own Internet ventures _ at the high value such companies carry _
for shares in Infoseek. Specifically, Disney will receive 43
percent of Infoseek in return for $70 million in cash and
relinquishing ownership of Starwave, a company that creates
elaborate Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Starwave's biggest venture is the sports site it operates on
behalf of ESPN. Disney bought Starwave in several phases over the
last year from Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. Keith
Benjamin, an analyst for BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, estimated
that Disney paid about $400 million for Starwave and that it would
be worth about $800 million if it were an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement represented something of an about-face
for Disney. When it bought full control of Starwave two months ago,
it announced plans to integrate the Seattle-based technology
company with its own Internet operations in Burbank, Calif. Now,
all of Starwave will become part of Infoseek, which has
headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also agreed to lend Infoseek up to $139 million over the
next five years in return for the option to bring its ownership to
50.1 percent. Disney, however, will get back most of the cash it is
spending, as Infoseek has agreed to buy $165 million in advertising
from Disney over the next three years. That money will buy both
television advertising on ABC and promotion at other Disney
operations, like the Internet pavilion at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great deal for Disney, but not as good a deal for
Infoseek,'' said Benjamin, the analyst. Infoseek should have
started turning a profit this year, Benjamin said, but now the
added expense of buying all that promotion from Disney will keep
Infoseek from breaking even until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best they could get, because without Disney,
Infoseek would languish in fourth or fifth place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NBC's deal to buy a stake in Snap was much more favorable to the
shareholders of Cnet, the company that owned the portal, Benjamin
said. In particular, it will provide more than $100 million in free
television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, however, has much more limited ambitions for Snap, a
service with well-regarded technology and very few users. The
television network hopes that heavy TV promotions will turn Snap
into a popular, stand-alone guide service. NBC's other Internet
activities, especially its MSNBC news service operated with
Microsoft, will remain separate from Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, by contrast, is looking to merge its properties into a
unified service that will have more of the cohesive feel that
America Online has.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, America Online charges users a $22 monthly fee for
both access to the Internet and its own content. Portal services
like Infoseek and Snap have been free to users. But Winebaum of
Disney said the company hopes to come up with extra services for
which users will pay fees. Disney's ESPN site earns half its
revenue, for example, from add-on services like fantasy sports
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the big media companies are buying the existing portal
sites, many other companies of all sorts are jockeying for position
to earn money as Internet Gateways. Smaller sites that began
offering specialized services are now trying to emulate the look
and features of sites like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   And the big technology companies have their own portal
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The most feared is Microsoft's Start, because it will be the
first page seen by users of the Internet Explorer browser software
that is now part of the Windows operating system. Meanwhile
Netscape, whose software business has been devastated by Microsoft,
has been trying to turn its often visited but dreary home page into
a service with as much news and information as the other portal
sites.
</P>
<P>
   And Compaq Computer is even trying to turn its products into
portals by installing several buttons on its computer keyboards
that direct users to certain Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that all these moves represent the massing of
forces for what will shape up to be a long and brutal war over
which two or three portal services will become dominant.
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes in the online world far lower a few years ago,
America Online spent a $1 billion on television advertising and
distribution of sign-up disks to surge past its rivals, Prodigy and
Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Benjamin said, ``it will be much more expensive
for someone else to catch up.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: FOR JAPANESE, ECONOMIC SITUATION IS NO EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for inserts; grafs 6 and 13 are new.)  (See related stories: JAPAN-ECON, KOREA-ECON, ECON-REPORT) 
(lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a few weeks Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will
face nationwide elections as he presides over the worst recession
in more than 50 years, a limp stock market and the highest
unemployment rate since records began to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts overwhelmingly expect his governing Liberal
Democratic Party to do very well. The latest polls show it with
more than five times as much support as any other party.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hashimoto is more likely than ever to do well, for President
Clinton handed him a political gift on Wednesday by agreeing to a
joint U.S.-Japanese campaign to bolster the sagging yen. Whether
the jawboning and billions of dollars in foreign-exchange
intervention succeed in propping up the yen, they will almost
certainly succeed in propping up Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hashimoto's relative popularity may be part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of Clinton's decision to go to Hashimoto's aid was
that Japan would take, as Clinton put it, aggressive and bold steps
that would justify a higher rate for the yen. But many analysts
here say that the Japanese political process militates against
fundamental change and that Hashimoto's relative popularity
suggests that the public wants someone like him, a repairman for
the old system rather than an architect for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, although Americans would like more, some repairs are
still crucial. One that Japanese officials are focusing on would be
for the banking system, and particularly the bad loans that
overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally it comes down to the fact that people in Japan
generally don't think that things are so bad that they need to have
fundamental change,'' the president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Japan, Glenn S. Fukushima, said. ``They realize that
there are difficulties, that they need to handle them, and they are
prepared to make certain changes. But change will often result in
disruption of the current system, and I think that is something
that people want to avoid as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   All this raises puzzling questions about the Japanese political
process. In most industrialized countries there is a built-in
corrective mechanism when an economy veers off course. Disgruntled
voters evict the old team and choose new leaders who promise to do
things differently. Yet despite eight years of economic stagnation
the Japanese political system has not responded in that way.
</P>
<P>
   One common explanation is that Japan has established an
elaborate series of safety nets, so that even in a recession no one
feels deeply distressed. Ronald A. Morse, a professor of economics
and business administration at Reitaku University near Tokyo, calls
Japan ``an air bag society,'' because people are so protected from
the effects of recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has jobs, everybody has health care, and nobody's
out on the street,'' Morse said. ``Even companies that are losing
money aren't laying people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Japan does not have the feel of a country in a severe
downturn. There are very few homeless people, soup kitchens,
bankruptcies or vacant buildings. Although there are some
differences in measurements, the record unemployment rate in Japan
is still 4.1 percent, less than the 4.3 rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An old saying defines a recession as when your neighbor is laid
off. When you are laid off it is a depression. By those
definitions, for the great majority of Japanese this is still not a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The sliding yen had been a visible and humiliating signal of
Japanese economic weakness. But for now the joint U.S.-Japanese
intervention may have arrested the slide. In early Asian trading on
Friday, the yen was quoted at 137.30 to the dollar, compared to 146
before the intervention. The gulf in perceptions inside and outside
Japanese on the seriousness of the economic situation here is
difficult to exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans and many Asians these days it sometimes seems that
Japan's economy is burning and is threatening to ignite all of Asia
and, perhaps, the United States and Europe, as well. For those
fearing a global economic conflagration, nothing is more
infuriating than the sight of Hashimoto as he passively watches the
flames and seeming to do little more than blithely insisting that
the fire will eventually subside.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar situation Nero fiddled, but not for eight years _
that is the kind of grumbling one hears from U.S. officials these
days.
</P>
<P>
   To Japanese officials the foreign carping seems foolish and
petulant. Some say the U.S. government is simply nervous about its
own bubble economy and is looking for a scapegoat to blame when
stock prices inevitably collapse. And most Japanese say the risks
are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The realities of Japan's economy are not as bad as the world
thinks,'' said Jiro Ushio, chairman of the influential Japan
Association of Corporate Executives.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many Japanese insist that their country is seriously
addressing the recession and the Asian crisis. They note that the
Japanese government has put in place a huge stimulus package, the
biggest in the nation's history, and that the government has
contributed far more to Asian bailouts than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that we might be oblivious is not, I think, well
founded,'' said Sadaaki Numata, the chief spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Japan has worked out a series of measures to combat
the recession, he added, ``We will implement the measures as soon
as possible and we do hope that there will be a recovery and that
the markets will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, for all the bewilderment and anger at Japan's
reluctance to do more to stimulate its economy, in Japan
Hashimoto's behavior makes some sense and appears in keeping with
the public mood. After all, he just celebrated the Liberal
Democratic Party's latest victory, on Sunday in a parliamentary
by-election.
</P>
<P>
   That was the sixth consecutive victory in by-elections for the
Liberal Democrats, and polls suggest that they will also do very
well in elections for the upper house on July 12. The upper house
is much less significant than the lower house, but the election
will nonetheless be an important test of sentiment, and Hashimoto
seems ready to pass with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   A poll this week in the Yomiuri newspaper, taken just before the
intervention to support the yen, found that the support for
Hashimoto's government had dipped, from 33 to 30 percent. But
perhaps more important, 29 percent of those interviewed said they
still supported the Liberal Democrats, compared to 5.5 percent for
the leading opposition group, the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party, which advocates precisely the far-reaching
economic reorganization and stimulus policies that Washington would
like to see in Japan, had the support of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There have been widespread hints that Mr. Hashimoto will be more
aggressive in tackling Japan's financial problems immediately after
the election. But that, too, tells something about the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of promising before the election to address the economic
mess and mountain of bad bank loans, the speculation is that he
will tackle these issues only after he no longer has to face the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Morse argues that Japan suffers from cronyism and structural
economic problems quite similar to those of South Korea and
Indonesia. Those countries were bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund on the condition that they accept painful
reorganizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan has not collapsed in the way that South Korea or
Indonesia did, so Morse said he believed that the political process
would not lead to a fundamental overhaul of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF should have come into Japan, but it didn't,'' he said.
``Japan is too big for anyone to mess with.''

<P>
   Tobacco stocks rebounded Thursday, the day after the latest
version of a tobacco-settlement bill was stubbed out like, well, a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Philip Morris Cos., the maker of Marlboro, rose
$1.125, to $39.5625. RJR Nabisco climbed 75 cents, to $25.0625.
Even Brooke Group, the parent of Liggett &AMP; Myers that became
popular recently because of an earlier deal that freed it from tax
penalties proposed in the bill, showed some spark during trading,
though it closed down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Was this a sigh of relief from investors who have been on a
rough ride for the last several years? A momentary uptick in the
sagging fortunes of corporations stuck with products destined for
the ash heap of history? Or was it a long-overdue recognition of
the inherent value of companies like RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris,
regardless of the all-too-visible hand of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   It may be none, or all, of the above. Certainly the biggest
worry for investors _ the threat of interminable litigation and
overwhelming punitive damages from the hundreds of lawsuits that
have been filed against tobacco companies _ remained. Without
restrictions on such lawsuits and awards, many people who might
otherwise buy into tobacco companies were staying away, not wanting
to put their money into companies whose earnings could be siphoned
off by having to make all those payments.
</P>
<P>
   Management itself has not been too encouraging. The 1997 annual
report from Philip Morris stated: ``Management is unable to make a
meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could
result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation.'' The
report, though, does suggest that the original tobacco pact _
reached 364 days ago, on June 20, 1997 _ would have resolved ``the
most significant tobacco litigation'' facing the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the litigation is a large issue for the industry to
deal with,'' said Jan Smith, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., the cigarette-making branch of RJR Nabisco, based in
Winston-Salem, N.C. ``And the whole youth smoking issue is
something we would like to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues that went away, more or less, along with
the bill, which was sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. One was
the spectre of higher prices for cigarettes, which some feared
would create a contraband market for them. Another was spending for
programs to reduce youth smoking, which was also a major element of
the June 20 plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least, the failure of the Senate effort takes away
a big potential downside in terms of the big tax increase they were
facing,'' said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
who predicts that a much narrower tobacco bill will be combined
with an anti-drug measure in the House and could wind up before
President Clinton by early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the impact of the legislative and executive branches
may have been overstated all along. ``These stocks are being priced
as if what's going on in Washington could cripple the companies,''
said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine Webber in San
Francisco. ``And I think that's very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at what would happen if Philip Morris, say, broke up
into several small companies and eliminated domestic tobacco sales
from its balance sheet. Right away, the remaining businesses _
international tobacco, Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing Co. _ would
be worth about $66 a share, Goldman estimated. Adding a
conservative valuation for domestic tobacco back in would raise the
price by about $12 a share, he said, bringing the price to $78, or
nearly twice what the stock was selling for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to RJR Nabisco, one could do the same. Goldman said the
company without its domestic tobacco business was worth about $47,
and $58 with the domestic tobacco added in.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, investors have shied away, resulting in most of
the tobacco companies sinking to 52-week lows earlier this month.
``This is a very, very unusual situation,'' Goldman said. ``You
don't usually have this kind of uncertainty due to external
factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Where investors go from here will be interesting to watch. RJR
chief executive Steven Goldstone, who was the first of his peer
group to declare the original tobacco settlement dead back in
April, is scheduled to deliver a speech Friday a meeting of
newspaper publishers in Memphis. Originally, the speech was billed
by the RJR public relations team as being all about the current
tobacco legislation. Instead, Goldstone will be speaking on a
related topic: ``What's been going on in Congress,'' as a
spokeswoman put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry continues to support the position it took last
June, wanting a comprehensive bill that contains caps for annual
payouts on damages and liability relief from class-action
lawsuits,'' said Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco
companies in Washington, who, like Goldman, believes the original
settlement proposal will be revived in Congress before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just myriad issues out there,'' Ms. Smith of R.J.
Reynolds said. ``In the meantime, we just have to try and run our
business responsibly.''

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS TO ELIMINATE 3,500 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho)  (lb) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The cutbacks coursing through the chip industry reached
Texas Instruments Inc. on Thursday as the company announced plans
to eliminate 3,500 jobs, or 8 percent of its work force. The
company cited both the recent sale of several divisions and a weak,
glutted market for chips, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The cut follows word in April that National Semiconductor was
chopping 1,400 jobs and Intel 3,000 jobs, and word in June that
Motorola was eliminating 15,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To further protect itself, Texas Instruments reached an
agreement Thursday to sell its computer memory-chip business to
Micron Technology Inc. for about $641 million in stock plus $190
million in debt. The deal, which was expected, will make Micron
Technology the world's largest maker of memory chips, with about 18
percent of the market, several percentage points more than Samsung.
</P>
<P>
   Though Texas Instruments is probably selling its memory-chip
operations at a loss, analysts pointed instead to the avoidance of
continuing losses in that division. ``Do I think it's positive for
TI?'' said John Geraghty of Credit Suisse First Boston.
``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   In having to cut its staff, he added, Texas Instruments is no
different from other chip makers. ``All this capacity comes on
stream and works very well,'' he said. ``All of a sudden everyone
turns around and says, `Oops.'''
</P>
<P>
   The chip companies are facing a global oversupply and falling
prices for their products, aggravated by Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said the worldwide semiconductor market would grow 5
percent or less this year,'' William Aylesworth, chief financial
officer at Texas Instruments, said in an interview. ``We would
certainly emphasize the `or less' today, especially with the
weakness of the yen and other currencies and very depressed
semiconductor prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,500 jobs to be cut, about 2,500 will be in the United
States, including 600 from the closing of a memory-chip plant near
the company's base in Dallas. The cutback will save the company
about $270 million a year before taxes, but incentives and other
costs will roughly equal the savings over the first year. The
company anticipates some layoffs, with the number depending on how
many workers depart voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Having already sold off military electronics and laptop-computer
divisions, Texas Instruments will remain a maker of specialized
chips, primarily those called digital signal processors, which are
used in cellular phones, computer networking equipment, cars and
computer components such as modems and hard drives. Though demand
for these chips is growing rapidly, Aylesworth said that computer
makers already had excessive inventories of components such as hard
drives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Micron Technology plans to capitalize on its position as the
memory-chip industry's low-cost producer. To make the necessary
investments, especially in the purchased operations, Micron
Technology won an agreement to borrow $750 million from Texas
Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments in turn becomes Micron Technology's largest
shareholder, with about 12 percent of the company. Texas
Instruments will hold more than 16 percent if it exercises its
right to convert most of its loan into more shares.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology also reported Thursday a third-quarter loss
that was bigger than expected. The company, which is based in
Boise, Idaho, posted a loss of $106.1 million, compared with
earnings of $96.8 million in the quarter a year earlier.

RANGERS CALL UP IMPROVED VAN POPPEL
</HEADLINE>
 POPPEL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Todd Van Poppel returned to the major leagues
yesterday, older than the first time and more prepared to pitch to
big-league hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a better chance of succeeding now than I
did before,'' Van Poppel said. ``It's the first time in my career
I've been able to throw four pitches for a strike at any time in
the count. Before I was just a fastball pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel, the onetime phenom from Martin High School in
Arlington who made it to the majors with the Oakland Athletics as a
19-year-old, joined the Rangers from Triple-A Oklahoma. His
contract will be officially purchased before he starts tomorrow
night against the Angels in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old right-hander takes the spot in the rotation
vacated when Bobby Witt was designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd Van Poppel's going to get a chance,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``There's no doubt he has a major-league arm. It gets
down to consistent command of his pitches, but I think he can pitch
in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel likely has two chances to fill the spot on a
long-term basis. His second start will probably be Thursday in
Arizona, and Darren Oliver is due back from a stint on the disabled
list the next day. The Rangers would face a decision on whether Van
Poppel or Matt Perisho, Oliver's replacement, sticks in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give Todd a chance to start, and then we'll
adjust,'' Oates said. ``I don't think there's competition with each
other for a starting spot. They can both fit on this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers decide Van Poppel isn't the answer in the
rotation, they will consider keeping him in the bullpen, and not
only because he is out of options and can't be sent back to the
minors without clearing waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could throw 70 pitches today and be ready with the same
stuff tomorrow,'' Oates said. ``That's what I saw in spring
training. He'd come out and air it out one day, and be throwing
just as hard the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think Todd is going to be part of this ballclub for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel is simply glad to be back in the major leagues,
whatever the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``If being in the bullpen helps this team win, that's fine,'' he
said. ``And if I'm in the rotation, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel was 5-5 with a 3.72 earned-run average at Oklahoma,
and 3-0 with a 2.57 ERA in his past four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely been strong,'' said Rick Wrona, the catcher at
Oklahoma before being called up to the Rangers last Friday. ``He's
got four pitches he's throwing for strikes, and that's why he's
been so successful. The last five or six feet that ball really has
a four-seam hop that you just don't see very often. He definitely
still has velocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel was a first-round draft pick of the A's in 1990 after
a stellar career at Martin High. He made it to the majors in
September '91, and struck out five of the first six big-league
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But after 3 1/2 years in the majors, including stints with four
organizations and with a 20-33 record and 6.22 ERA, he was released
by the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed him to a minor-league deal in June 1997, and
sent him to Class A to start again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what I needed to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers simplified his mechanics, and this year he began to
throw a slider for the first time. He began getting hitters out
consistently, earning another chance in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can pitch here,'' Oates said. ``It may not be as a
starter, but that's a good starting point.''

CHINA HALTS SHIPMENT OF OPERA SETS FOR N.Y. FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moving in `e' category) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chinese authorities in Shanghai on Thursday detained
the shipment of sets and equipment for a classic Chinese opera that
is scheduled to be the centerpiece of next month's Lincoln Center
Festival, threatening to disrupt the New York event and start an
international incident.
</P>
<P>
   The action came during a week in which the authorities strongly
criticized the frank sexual content and other aspects of the new
production of the 16th-century opera, ``The Peony Pavilion,'' which
stretches over 20 hours and has rarely if ever been performed in
its entirety in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   When the criticisms first emerged this week, Lincoln Center
informally asked the State Department and the U.S. Information
Agency to follow the situation. After Thursday's action, in which
the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture refused permission for
sets from the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company to leave the airport,
the State Department intervened.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln
Center, sought help from Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of
state, who is a friend of hers. Because the production is scheduled
to move on to the Festival d'Automne in Paris in November, the
French Foreign Ministry has also become involved.
</P>
<P>
   An American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that it was not clear whether the Chinese government, which is
preparing for a visit by President Clinton next week, had played
any part in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment in question, consisting of all the sets, props and
costumes for the production, was ostensibly held back for an
inspection of the contents, according to Lincoln Center officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They heard there was something illicit in the boxes,'' said
Nigel Redden, the festival's director. ``It was a technical matter,
involving the listing of the contents.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities allowed the containers to be reclosed, Redden
said, adding that he hoped they would be shipped on the next
available flight, on Sunday. But he said the authorities still had
objections to the production that could pose further problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion'' is directed by Chen Shi-Zheng, who was
born in China but has lived in New York since 1987 and is an
American citizen. The questions, Redden said, had mainly to do with
the handling of sexuality in Chen's conception and his insertion of
touches of modernity into the production.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview by telephone from Shanghai on Thursday night,
Chen said: ``The people who came to see it criticized it for having
too much life. It was too relaxed, not rigid enough. They basically
told me to come up with a whole new concept or change the title and
call it something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunqu (pronounced kun-SHU) opera, which has historically thrived
mainly around Shanghai, is perhaps the most refined of the more
than 300 styles of Chinese opera and the progenitor of many its
modern varieties, including Peking opera. ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a
work in 55 scenes written by Tang Xianxu in 1598, is considered by
aficionados to be the masterpiece of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its length, the work is typically represented by its
most famous scenes, including the amorous ``Dream Interrupted,'' in
an evening of varied operatic excerpts. Lincoln Center is
presenting the work complete in two cycles, the first over six
evenings, the second in a marathon weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion'' is remarkably frank in its eroticism.
Chen, working with attractive young actors, has done nothing to
mitigate the eroticism, to judge from rehearsals seen in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is scheduled to open Lincoln Center Festival '98 at
the La Guardia Theater on July 7.

HOUSE VOTES TO CONSIDER 258 AMENDMENTS TO CAMPAIGN BILL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Democrats maintaining that the Republican
leadership was once again trying to delay any final vote on
campaign finance, the House voted Thursday to open the debate to a
blizzard of amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure _ rare in a House that is usually controlled
tightly to allow only limited debate and a handful of amendments _
was approved on a near-party-line vote, 221-189. Republican
proponents of overhauling campaign finance law stood with their
party after receiving assurances from the House Majority Leader
Dick Armey that the issue would be brought to a final vote by the
time the House takes its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats called so long a timetable _ and the 258
amendments approved for consideration _ a farce. Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., the minority whip, said ``a lot of these amendments don't
even have anything to do with campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're poison pills,'' Bonior declared. ``They're booby
traps. And each of these amendments, if adopted, could open the
floodgates to even more amendments. ''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, pointed out that on Wednesday, the
Republican leadership ``gave us one hour of debate'' before the
House voted to abolish the current federal tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Frost said, ``they've given us seven weeks of debate on
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the
majority whip, an opponent of the overhaul effort, mocked the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the so-called reformers are complaining,'' DeLay said,
``because the debate will be too open for their taste.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just another moment in the odyssey of campaign finance
overhaul, an issue that has unexpectedly refused to die this year
despite the concerted efforts of Republican leaders in both houses
to block any changes that would erode their party's fund-raising
advantage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to dispense with the matter in
March under rules that never allowed the main, bipartisan overhaul
bill to the floor. But the speaker's tactic boomeranged
politically, giving the overhaul effort new momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Next he promised that the issue would come up in May.
Technically it did _ for several hours of debate and with no votes.
Since then, the House has been meandering through a thicket of
campaign finance proposals, usually at night.
</P>
<P>
   But late Thursday afternoon the House opened debate on the main
bill, sponsored by Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Martin
Meehan, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the favorite of most of the groups seeking to
limit the influence of money in politics, would effectively ban
``soft money,'' the unregulated donations to national and state
political parties from corporations, labor unions and wealthy
individuals. It would also put some restrictions on issue
advertising by advocacy groups and would expand disclosure
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   After Bonior, the Democratic whip, had accused Republicans of
seeking to ``keep the spigots of special-interest money flowing,''
Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., said 57 percent of Bonior's campaign
funds came from political action committees, mostly from organized
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., attributed the demise of
anti-smoking legislation in the Senate to the tobacco industry's
campaign contributions to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the amount of money the tobacco companies have
provided to the Republican committees in 1996,'' she said, pulling
out a chart. ``Four and a half million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to quote from a Wall Street Journal article about
Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., who is running for the Senate. In that
article, Ms. Smith, first elected to the House in 1994, said she
had quickly discovered that it was common practice for Republican
leaders to hold up action on bills while seeking more donations
from interested contributors.

 &HT;    On deck:Montreal Expos
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight and Saturday 7:05 p.m., Sunday 1:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS and WSB-750 AM will broadcast all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight _ RHP Kevin Millwood (9-2,
3.73 ERA; 1-0, 1.00 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Shawn Boskie (0-0,
0.00; 1-4, 4.50 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday _ RHP John Smoltz
(4-1, 3.94; 10-6. 2.56 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. LHP Carlos Perez
(6-5, 3.64; 2-3, 2.98 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday _ LHP Denny
Neagle (8-4, 3.18; 5-6, 3.96 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Dustin
Hermanson (4-6, 3.20; 0-2, 5.40 lifetime vs. Braves).Past meetings:
The Braves have taken 2-of-3 from the Expos twice this season at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Expos leaders: Avg. _ Vladimir Guerrero (.300). HR _ Guerrero
and Rondell White (12). RBI _ White (39). SB _ White (13). W _
Carlos Perez (6). ERA_Ugueth Urbina (1.60). Strikeouts _ Javier
Vazquez (58). Saves _ Urbina (16).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: Tuesday, the Expos optioned right-hander Mike Johnson
to Ottawa and called up veteran Shawn Boskie, who spent last season
with the Cubs, Phillies and Mariners. Johnson was pounded in
Atlanta in his last outing Saturday, giving up eight hits and seven
earned runs in just three innings. . . . The Expos are the
weakest-hitting team in the majors, with a .243 average and just
221 RBIs. Only Cincinnati fields worse than Montreal, which has a
.975 fielding percentage and 67 errors.
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Guerrero leads the club in batting, runs and hits. In
his last 14 games, he's batting .345 (20-for-58) with six doubles,
three homers and 11 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Rookie Vazquez (1-6, 6.00) had lost his last four
decisions and had not won in eight starts (four no-decisions) since
May 1 entering Thursday night's start against the Mets.

 &HT;    Klesko ready to hide after neglecting to slide
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Things had been going so well for the Braves. And
outside of the weather, little was hotter in Atlanta than Ryan
Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't make any difference Thursday at The Ted. Klesko's bat
remains ablaze, but a fourth-inning base-running error, which he
later second-guessed, played a part in the Braves' 3-2 loss to the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes baseball so great,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox said. ``It doesn't matter how things are going, you can be beat
by anybody on a given day.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 2-1, the Braves started the fourth inning with three
straight singles, off the bats of Andres Galarraga, Klesko and Javy
Lopez. Lopez's single up the middle scored Galarraga to tie the
score.
</P>
<P>
   On Lopez's hit, Klesko rounded second and, ignoring third base
coach Bobby Dews, charged into third base standing.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's aggressiveness, however, caused him to stumble over the
base and fall. When he reached back for third, Florida's Todd Zeile
had his glove and the ball there to meet his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down, telling him to slide all the way,'' Dews said. ``I
got down real low. If I had been any closer to the ground, I
would've been under it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Klesko sounded as if he wanted to find a spot
there himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to slide. I kind of got off balance and couldn't
stop in time,'' said Klesko, whose fourth-inning single extended
his career-high hitting streak to 11 games. ``I never should've
changed my mind; I should've just (gone) ahead and slid.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Lopez's single, the third in a row of the inning,
also was the last of the inning. Michael Tucker followed by forcing
Lopez out at second, and Andruw Jones hit a weak grounder to first
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Klesko's faux pas, only two more Braves got as far as
second base. And the Marlins' pitchers hushed all possibilities of
another score.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko is batting .418 (18-for-43) with four homers and 13 RBIs
during his hot stretch. But the blunder?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things that cost us,'' Klesko said. ``You
would hope we'd get a few more runs, but that happens sometimes.''

 &HT;    Latest chapter of `Braves vs. police'
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Braves' dispute with Atlanta officials about
re-routing of pre-game traffic escalated Thursday. The driver of
the Florida Marlins team bus was threatened with arrest after the
removal of some traffic cones while trying to deliver the team to
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police came over yelling and waving their arms,'' said
Tony Perez, the Marlins special assistant to general manager Dave
Dombrowski. ``We were telling them it was important that we get to
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of new traffic restrictions put in place last week, the
club has advised fans to leave 30 to 40 minutes earlier to make the
first pitch. While confused season-tickes holders have been the
ones most affected by the changes _ specifially on the Fulton
Street exit off the connector and on Capitol Avenue _ it was the
first incident involving an official team vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' bus had been turned away from the usual access and
sent on a 15-minute detour to University Avenue that delivered it
to the same entrance. After some passengers removed some cones
blocking access, the team finally reached the players' entrance,
despite the driver's threatened arrest by Atlanta police.
</P>
<P>
   Big Cat's birthday
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga turned 37 Thursday, the oldest position player
on the club, as well as the most productive player at the plate (26
home runs, 67 RBI). Former first baseman Fred McGriff had 22 homers
and 97 RBI in all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie's jaw
</P>
<P>
   After taking a tipped ball to the point of his jaw Wednesday
night, Eddie Perez is waiting to take a second smash to his head to
get rid of the clicking in the hinges of his jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Perez determined that when Todd Dunwoody fouled the ball in the
sixth, the padding across the chin of his mask had been adjusted
too high and the full force of the ball was tranferred directly to
his chin.
</P>
<P>
   His ears began to ring, his jaw went numb, and, for a moment, he
thought his mask must have flown off before the ball hit him.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed in the game, which, in retrospect, might not have
been the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The catcher began to forget what pitch he had called for as soon
as he signaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd signal for a fastball,'' Perez said, ``and then I'd be
waiting for a change-up. That happened twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim's knee
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will be without dugout coach Jim Beauchamp this road
trip, while he recovers from surgery Thursday to repair a torn
tendon in his right knee. The operation, performed by Dr. John
Garrett at St. Joseph's Hospital, will allow Beauchamp to return to
the dugout when the team returns Wednesday, but his field duties
have been doled out until he is mobile again. Third-base coach
Bobby Dews will handle the outfield defensive alignments, Ned Yost
will handle scorecards and first-base coach Pat Corrales will
attend the pre-game exchange of lineups at the plate.

 &HT;    Following the leader? Tough call
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- It seemed the sensible thing to do. In the
first place, picking out a player to follow the first round of a
golf tournament is a crapshoot. The chance of picking the player
who might take the lead is even more uncertain than trying to pick
the winner. This U.S. Open started out with 7,117 applications, and
another 136 came in late, out of which 156 would eventually make
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven are exempt. The rest have to go through qualifying.
Larry Mize missed by a stroke. Fred Funk didn't make it. Trevor
Dodds and Steve Pate, Tour winners, had to survive playoffs. Craig
Stadler and Bruce Lietzke refuse to try any longer.
</P>
<P>
   You decide the wise thing to do is pick a guy with a local
background and see how it works out. Stewart Cink has done well in
the U.S. Open, no worse than 16th place, which in 1996 won an
invitation to the Masters. He was paired with Fuzzy Zoeller,
another pleasant fellow to watch, and Retief Goosen, a young South
African who is beginning to make his home on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Cink and Zoeller both birdie the first hole, Cink out of the
heavy stuff twice. Cink goes 2-under par with a birdie on the 5th
hole and follows that with another from about 15 feet on the 6th.
This is looking good. The early leader board is looking good.
Woods, Couples, Montgomerie, Daly and Verplank are up there.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite a colony of Cink followers in the gallery. They
are feeling good. ``This is his wedding anniversary,'' Cink's aunt
says. She and his mother are twins. ``If you see a woman wearing a
green straw hat who looks like me, that's his mother,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those little one-person carts are trying to making it
around the course. This course isn't friendly to such unstable
toys. You look down from the clubhouse, across the fairways cut
through the huge cypress and pines, the championship course at The
Olympic Club looks like the Grand Canyon of golf. One senior almost
toppled and complained that his sciatica was killing him. My wife
gave him two Advil and told him to call his doctor in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Word just flashed on the board that Tiger Woods had doubled the
shortest hole on the course. It's 137 yards up the hill toward the
clubhouse, No. 8. He later four-putted another hole and soon was
off the board. Cink was now leading the tournament, the same Cink
who had twice beaten Woods while they were in college.
</P>
<P>
   He was 3-under, soon to be joined by a guy playing just ahead of
him, Ted Oh, a 21-year-old Korean from Las Vegas, who shares Butch
Harmon, the professor, with Woods. This was really looking good
now.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the ninth hole rose up and bit Cink. More to the point,
Cink bit himself with a tee shot in the deep spinach. He could only
pitch out and settle for his first bogey. He made the turn two
under par, but Cink's flirtation with the lead was done for the
day. He bogeyed the 11th from the rough, but hell struck on the
16th, 609 yards long, par-5. He left it the rough twice, missed the
green, then two-putted. Double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Players call the 17th, 468 yards long, a slanting fairway that
pitches everything to the right, the toughest hole at Olympic.
Payne Stewart birdied and called it ``an eagle in my mind.'' Cink
was in the rough again, three times and double-bogeyed again. Well,
73 isn't too bad against a par of 70, but oh, what it might have
been is what hurt. And speaking of Oh, he'd slain himself with a 42
on the backside and settled at 74.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson had predicted that the winning score will be over
par. That being the case, Payne Stewart was looking pretty good at
66. He had made his score on the tough holes, 16, 17 and 18, and
probably no player would birdie would birdie the last two holes all
week. As for Cink, he wouldn't even be low Yellow Jacket. That
would be the kid, amateur Matt Kuchar, coming in at even par, still
on his Masters games, flashing his old Masters smile.

 Kaiser Won't Cover Cost Of Viagra   By Carl T. Hall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
After anguishing for weeks over how to cope with Viagra mania,
Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest HMO, will announce today
plans to exclude coverage of the hit blue pill for male impotence.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition, the HMO's new national policy will apply to other
prescription treatments for erectile dysfunction, including
suppositories and pills not yet on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was reached after an unprecedented national policy
review that had a team of physicians, ethicists and pharmacists
delving into such issues as the medical necessity for erections and
the dangers of recreational use of pills like Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning 2 million prescriptions have been written for Pfizer
Inc.'s Viagra since it was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in April _ making Viagra the most successful new
pharmaceutical on record.
</P>
<P>
   It's become a staple of late-night talk-show banter, and it's so
easy to purchase that one can order it over the Internet. But it's
expensive _ selling wholesale for $7 a pill, retail for about $9 or
$10.
</P>
<P>
   In the last analysis, though, economic factors, as opposed to
medical issues, decided the question for Kaiser. Even if users were
limited to 10 pills a month, the HMO estimated that the cost would
exceed $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Kaiser dispensed only $59 million worth of
anti-virals last year, a category that includes all the protease
inhibitors and other expensive drugs used to fight AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could, of course, build the cost of Viagra into everyone's
premium, but is that the right thing to do?'' said Dr. Francis
Crosson, executive director of the Permanente Federation, Kaiser's
national physician organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's decision overrules some regional decisionmakers who had
hoped the HMO would provide at least limited coverage to help
certain patients.
</P>
<P>
   Several other HMOs have adopted rules limiting Viagra coverage
to six pills or so each month. About half of state-run Medicaid
programs provide Viagra benefits. Standard Medicare coverage
doesn't include any self-administered drugs, although some HMO
plans have been extending Viagra benefits that generally match
what's being offered through commercial plans.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra is the only FDA-approved pill affected by the new Kaiser
policy. But at least two other potential impotence treatments,
considered to be a year or two away from the FDA-approval stage,
also will be excluded, along with the so-called Muse suppository,
Kaiser officials said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Supplemental Plan Needed
</P>
<P>
   The policy will take full effect when standard HMO contracts
come up for renewal, generally the first of the year. Employers and
other health-plan purchasers would have to buy an optional
supplemental benefit plan if they want Kaiser to provide the
coverage anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser doctors may continue to write prescriptions for Viagra,
and the drug will be available in the HMO's pharmacies. But the
standard $5 co-payment will not cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, where Kaiser provides HMO coverage to
roughly 2.7 million people, or 1 of every 3 insured residents,
Viagra has never made its way onto the list of reimbursed
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the impact of the new policy, a spokeswoman said,
``Viagra wasn't covered yesterday, and it won't be covered
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, not surprisingly, was looking for a different answer
than what Kaiser came up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed,'' said spokeswoman Mariann
Caprino. ``This is a serious medical condition we're talking about
here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said excluding Viagra is inconsistent with policies that pay
for such things as seasonal allergy medications that also improve
quality of life, even if they don't treat life-threatening
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and advocates specializing in erectile dysfunction
roundly condemned Kaiser's decision, calling it a misguided slap
against those who want erection problems treated as a disease
rather than a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra has been terrific for me,'' said Santa Rosa writer
Eugene Shapiro, 63, who is co-writing a book about the erection
pill with a urologist.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said taking the pill helped him regain not only full
sexual function but also helped him fight bouts of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bruckman, executive director of the American Foundation for
Urologic Disease in Baltimore, Md., said he was ``shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there has been any experimental or recreational use of this
drug, it's been limited and will not be ongoing,'' he said.
``Viagra is a serious drug for a serious medical condition.''

<P>
   ``Strange Inconsistency''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Imholz, senior attorney for Consumers Union in San
Francisco, noted that Kaiser will pay for office treatments and
surgery for erection problems.
</P>
<P>
   The policy banning payments for the drug ``seems to me a strange
inconsistency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the impetus is cost-cutting, but they're going to
still pay for very invasive and costly procedures, and not cover a
safer and less costly medication.''
</P>
<P>
   But some top medical experts took Kaiser's side, maintaining
that all HMO members should not have to bear the cost of the sexual
activities of a few men.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world of limited resources, you have to draw the
line somewhere,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, a former editor of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.

 Web News Goes to Print   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
If newspapers and magazines are an endangered species in the
digital age, why are online news services dying to get into print?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors at print publications shuddered when Internet-based news
organizations like Cnet, Salon and Motley Fool began to crop up in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom was that the traditional press _ derisively
called ``old media'' by its upstart rivals _ would hemorrhage
readers and advertisers to the fledgling ``new media,'' which can
instantly transmit online stories and ads over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the old media's demise.
</P>
<P>
   The new media business isn't as profitable as its proponents had
hoped. That has led many online ventures to peddle their content to
newspapers and magazines in an effort to attract more readers _ and
eventually more advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated online content reaches 10 times more readers in print
than on the Web, even though some publications are hesitant to
carry content from online rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Though syndication fees are nominal _ as little as $50 a week
for a package of news and features _ the potential payoff is
significant for online news operations. Newspaper syndication helps
Web sites build brand-name recognition, reach a broader audience
and pocket some cash in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the information economy, you make money by gathering
information once and then reselling it as often as possible,'' said
Felix Gutierrez, executive director of the Freedom Forum, an
Arlington, Va.-based foundation dedicated to media education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's healthy for any media business to have more than one form
of distribution and revenue,'' said Andrew Ross, managing editor of
Salon in San Francisco. ``To only have one is unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the old and new media is becoming a downright
blur. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Motley Fool, an irreverent financial tip sheet on America
Online and the Web, is the king of new-meets-old media syndication.
It is distributed by Universal Press Syndicate in 136 newspapers _
among them the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Sun-Times, Philadelphia
Inquirer and Detroit Free Press. It is also carried on radio and in
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making some money on syndication, but it's not the main
reason we're in papers,'' said Chris Hill, spokesman for the
Alexandria, Va., company. ``It's a way to reach another 13 million
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Motley Fool online, by comparison, reaches about 750,000 people
per month.
</P>
<P>
   _Salon, an online magazine, offers a weekly package of columns
and features through New York syndication giant United Features.
About 30 North American newspapers carry it, including the New York
Daily News, Hartford Courant and Toronto Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Salon reaches millions of people through its newspaper
syndication deals, dwarfing its Web audience of tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   _Cnet's News.com, a site devoted to computer news, doubles as a
high-tech wire service for the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to market our brand name and show off our
breaking-news coverage to fresh new eyeballs,'' said a spokeswoman
for San Francisco-based Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   _TheStreet.com provides material to the San Francisco Examiner's
Sunday business section and New York Observer. That explains the
reemergence of Herb Greenberg _ The Chronicle's former business
columnist now at TheStreet.com _ whose syndicated ``Herb on the
Street'' musings in the Examiner first appeared last week.
</P>
<P>
   _Yahoo, which has morphed from Web directory to media company,
provides original news content via King Features Syndicate for 15
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a two-way street. Most newspapers and magazines post
stories on their own Web sites. And media giants like Walt Disney
and NBC are snapping up online ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the breathless hype about the Internet, it hasn't
significantly changed Americans' news-reading habits. Many still
rely heavily on their local paper and TV for news, according to a
recent national study by Pew Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We aren't quite at the point where this medium needs to be
in terms of viewers,'' concedes Jim Cramer, co-chairman of
TheStreet.com, an in-your-face New York-based financial news
service. ``There are still a lot of readers who are not technically
savvy and depend on newspapers and TV to get their news.''
</P>
<P>
   Would online firms go after those readers more directly with a
print publication of their own?
</P>
<P>
   Ross says discussions of a hard-copy Salon magazine are ``on and
off. It's always been in the back of our minds, since (the staff)
comes from print publications,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cramer takes a hard-line approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do a print version of Street.com? Absolutely not,''
Cramer says, scoffing. ``It's a waste of time and money. Our best
news is immediate and appears on a computer screen. By the time it
goes into print, it's old and useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why syndicate to newspapers? ``I just think we can't afford
to ignore the non-Web reading crowd,'' he said.

 N.Y. REIT Buying S.F. Developer   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A New York-based real estate investment trust is about to acquire
Vylliam Wilson &AMP; Associates, a big private developer based in San
Mateo, in a deal worth $1.8 billion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The buyer is Cornerstone Properties, a publicly held company
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ which probably will involve the issuance of
Cornerstone securities to Wilson's owners _ is expected to be
sealed over the weekend and officially announced early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Cornerstone nor Wilson would comment, informed
sources confirmed the deal yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the proceeds will go to principal owner and
founder Bill Wilson, a Stanford graduate whose real-estate
associates have included the Rockefeller family, Yale University,
pension funds and various private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Although generally publicity-shy _ ``He's a private guy,'' says
Wilson firm spokeswoman Pam Hittleman _ he serves on the board of
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   William Wilson &AMP; Associates builds, leases and manages
high-quality office buildings _ known in the trade as ``Class A.''
</P>
<P>
   It owns more than 11 million square feet of office space
throughout California, including substantial holdings in San
Francisco and on the Peninsula. It also has properties in the
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The firm built the architecturally striking Oracle Corp.
headquarters complex in Redwood Shores and owns a building occupied
by Gap Inc. in San Mateo. It also owns San Mateo's Borel Office
Center, a multitenant, four-building complex.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it bought the Equitable Life Building at 120
Montgomery St. in San Francisco in a deal reportedly worth &QL; 
$70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Cornerstone _ which also owns about 11 million square
feet of office space _ combined with Gap Chairman Donald Fisher
this year in an unsuccessful bid for San Francisco's 3.76
million-square-foot Embarcadero Center.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder was Massachusetts-based Boston Properties, a
public REIT, which paid $1.22 billion for the property last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cornerstone, which specializes in office properties
in prime metropolitan areas, views Wilson as a more-than-acceptable
consolation prize in its effort to establish a major foothold in
the booming Bay Area office market.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Wilson, now is the ideal time to sell, says James F.
Wilson (no relation), an analyst with Jefferies &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that prices of office properties are soaring and that
private firms ``are finding it tougher to compete with the big
public ones. The big firms have easier access to capital and can
borrow at cheaper rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Rising, president and chief executive of Catellus
Development, a large, publicly held developer based in San
Francisco, said he chatted recently with Bill Wilson about the
Wilson firm's ``options.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising said Bill Wilson was concerned about his ability to
compete in a market increasingly dominated by public REITs. Private
developers ``are all asking themselves whether the trend toward
public ownership of real estate is irreversible,'' Rising remarked.

TEKELEC REMARKS CREATE DECLINE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: Budgeted TEKELEC-SHARES   story.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Shares in telecommunications equipment specialist
Tekelec Inc. fell more than 10 percent Thursday on concern over a
possible dip in the company's second-quarter orders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After opening at $45.50, Tekelec shares lost as much as $5,
before regaining some ground to close down $4.875 at $40.625. More
than 1 million shares traded hands, nearly four times the issue's
six-month average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's drop came a day after Tekelec officials finished a
road show to New York and Boston to introduce analysts and
investors to the firm's new chief executive officer, Michael
Margolis. Margolis replaced retiring CEO Allan Toomer in February.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues on which Margolis was queried by investors was
Tekelec's second quarter book-to-bill ratio, a figure that compares
the dollar amount of new orders coming in to existing orders
shipped over a given period. A ratio of 1 means that the amounts
are equal and implies a steady stream of business.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts have predicted the company's book-to-bill ratio
will drop below 1 for the quarter, though Tekelec has said it
should go down no further than 0.9. That would mean Tekelec is not
getting as many new orders as it's currently filling.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Slocum, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group, said he
blamed his own comments in part on Tekelec's Thursday dip. In a
daily report published by First Call Corp. and distributed to
analysts and investors, Slocum said some investors were disturbed
by the company's likely ratio. But in an interview Thursday
afternoon, Slocum said he personally is unconcerned by the figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't downgrade the stock,'' Slocum said. ``This is a
paranoid market. You say anything and it gets overplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum also said that because Tekelec's business model is based
on long-term contracts, judging its strength by book-to-bill can be
misleading. ``This isn't really a backlog business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Brian Modoff at B.T. Alex Brown Securities in San
Francisco said he too is bullish on Tekelec. ``We're very
comfortable with the business. Their activity is at an all-time
high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec manufactures and services diagnostic testing equipment
for large computer networks, and network switching equipment used
in the telecommunications industry. The company had 1997 revenues
of $125.2 million and has, as of Thursday's close, a market
capitalization of $1.08 billion. &QL;

 PC Expo _ Gospel of Microsoft   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 New York  
 
 
Godzilla made a repeat visit to New York this week in the form of
Microsoft, which stomped into town to take over the big PC Expo
trade show.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evidence of the software monster's brute power was everywhere.
In a keynote address to a capacity crowd, Compaq's silver-haired,
silver-tongued CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer reiterated his allegiance to
``industry standard technology'' a few dozen times. That's a
euphemism for the Microsoft-Intel platform, but especially for
Microsoft's network operating software, Window NT _ which is indeed
becoming the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   It was like listening to a TV evangelist. Let industry standards
into your life, the preacher says, and they'll guide you to
deliverance (not to mention big revenues).
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Novell's Eric Schmidt gave the keynote. His
company sells the ``nonindustry standard'' stuff. The meeting hall
was less than half full for his address. It was obvious that he is
sorely in need of salvation only the industry standard can provide.
But he is blinded by the promise of a false god (Novell's NetWare)
and does not see the light. May Gates have mercy on his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Party Time
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft held a Hollywood-style party Tuesday night near
Lincoln Center to preview the next version of its Office suite,
called Office 2000. (Obviously, it isn't coming out any time soon.)
Office, in case you don't know, is the software package that
includes Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint. All will be integrated
so closely with the Web, they'll make Kentucky cousins look like
distinct family lines.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you'll be able to drag elements of a database and
spreadsheet into a Word document and save the finished product in
HTML (the language of the Web) directly to your company's Intranet.
And that's not all. Because the applications are linked, when you
update information in the original document, it also updates
automatically on the Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something scary: Microsoft said it's making PowerPoint
easier to use for the new version of Office.
</P>
<P>
   PowerPoint, which is used to create slide shows, is perhaps the
most insidious piece of software ever written. Anyone who has had
to sit through a PowerPoint presentation knows what I mean. There's
a slide on the wall, and the guy with the microphone repeats the
information on the slide. This goes on for 20 or 30 slides. Then
they give you a hard copy of the slide show to take home with you.
</P>
<P>
   I have considered mounting a campaign to ban PowerPoint
entirely. But Microsoft probably would squash me like a bug.
``PowerPoint doesn't bore people to death,'' they would argue.
``People bore people to death.'' Next thing you know, there'd be
bumper stickers reading, ``When PowerPoint is outlawed, only
outlaws will have PowerPoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's going to be easier to use. For instance, the size
of the type automatically will adjust to fit the screen as you add
information to a slide.
</P>
<P>
   Let It Be
</P>
<P>
   You have to tip your hat to Jean-Louis Gassee. The former
president of Apple's product division is still out there on the
show floor, flogging his company, Be Inc. At first, Be was an
alternate PC-maker with its own operating system. That didn't work.
Then, Gassee reportedly almost sold Be to Apple when it was fishing
around for a new OS for the Macintosh. But Apple bought Steve Jobs'
NeXT instead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Menlo Park-based Be is trying to make it as an operating
system that does audio and video better than Windows. It's
targeting digital professionals and what Gassee refers to as
``prosumers'' who want to fiddle with their video like pros.
</P>
<P>
   Be actually could have a chance in this new multimedia niche,
especially because the latest version of the Be OS works with
Intel-based computers. (In the past, it was designed only for
PowerPC chips.) You can download the Intel-compatible version of
the Be OS directly from Be's Web site  &LR; (www.be.com). &LR;  It costs $79.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently like Be's prospects, as evidenced by the
$24.4 million that Gassee raised in financing during the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gassee admitted that he should have tied his flag to Intel years
ago. But I guess that's hard for an ex-Apple guy to do.

 Disney to Buy 43% Stake in Infoseek Corp.   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Tomorrowland got a whole new meaning yesterday when Walt Disney Co.
agreed to acquire 43 percent of Infoseek Corp., a leading Internet
search and directory service based in Sunnyvale.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deal, valued at around $860 million, is the latest example
of established media companies expanding to the Web. It also lends
credence to the belief that ``portal'' sites such as Infoseek _
offering news, entertainment and financial services _ may become
the equivalent of online networks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, NBC announced a similar but smaller deal,
acquiring a 5 percent stake in San Francisco's Cnet with the idea
of eventually taking over its fledgling Web directory service,
called Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of yesterday's agreement, Disney will receive 25.8
million shares of newly issued Infoseek stock in return for $70
million in cash plus ownership of Starwave, a Disney subsidiary
that creates and manages Web sites for other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new stock will bring Infoseek's market value to about $2
billion, making Disney's stake worth some $860 million, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also will plunk down $139 million for warrants that will
enable it to amass a majority interest in Infoseek over the next
three years. In the meantime, Disney will get three out of eight
seats on Infoseek's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Infoseek has agreed to buy $165 million in
promotional support from Disney over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   News of the agreement, which had been rumored since the start of
this week, caused Internet stocks to surge in early trading. But by
day's end, concerns over the structure of the deal had damped down
the enthusiasm of investors. Infoseek closed just 63 cents higher
at $35.13, while Disney fell $2.30 to $112.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Keith Benjamin of San Francisco's Robertson Stephens
said the expenses associated with the deal, including the $165
million, will probably mean that Infoseek, which has never posted a
profit, won't make money until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Infoseek officials said they will launch a portal
service later this year combining Starwave's technology with the
best from their existing services. The site, which will retain the
Infoseek name, will feature ABC.com, ABCNEWS.com, Disney.com,
ESPN.com and the official sites of the National Football League,
the National Basketball Association and NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement stakes out an even more ambitious role for
Disney in this promising medium and provides an ideal partnership
for the creating of a new Internet portal service,'' said Disney
chief executive Michael Eisner. ``We've made great strides as a
sports, news and entertainment programmer on the Internet. Through
our association with Infoseek, we are now well-positioned to take
advantage of the Internet as it evolves into commercial maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Winebaum, chairman of Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group,
called the Internet ``mission-critical to us,'' and said the deal
would provide ``rocket fuel to take us to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek is the third most popular search and directory service
behind Excite and top-ranked Yahoo. With Disney on board, Infoseek
officials hope to improve that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other single entity combines the depth of resources with
the breadth of expertise of this partnership,'' said Infoseek CEO
Harry Motro.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem for Infoseek is that yesterday's agreement
does not give it exclusive rights to Disney content. Disney also
provides material to other sites, including Excite and America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek said it will buy up the 3.1 million shares of Starwave
not owned by Disney, giving it complete control of the privately
owned Bellevue, Wash., company formerly controlled by Microsoft
founder Paul Allen.

SATELLITE SENT AROUND THE MOON IS NOW IN USEFUL EARTH ORBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An unusual effort to salvage an errant
communications satellite by slinging it around the Moon has
succeeded in restoring the spacecraft to a ``commercially viable''
orbit around Earth, the satellite's manufacturer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said Mark Skidmore, manager of the rescue
effort at Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.
Skidmore said the mission, which marked the first time a private
company has sent a spacecraft to the Moon, accomplished
``everything we set out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, originally called Asiasat 3, was launched last
December to provide television and telephone service in Asia. But
the Russian-built launcher malfunctioned, leaving the satellite in
an unusable orbit. The satellite was declared a loss, and its
owner, a company based in Hong Kong, received a $200 million
insurance settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes took possession of what looked to be an expensive piece
of space junk. In April it began the seemingly improbably salvage
mission _ to send the satellite around the Moon, some 240,000 miles
away, and back to an Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to have the Moon's gravity provide some of the
energy needed to correct the satellite's orbit, which was inclined
at 51 degrees to the Equator. An ideal orbit would be directly over
the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hughes ended up sending the satellite around the Moon a
second time, something it had not initially planned, to achieve an
even finer correction in the orbit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the satellite entered a geosynchronous orbit,
22,300 miles above Earth. At that altitude, a satellite orbits
Earth at the same speed that the planet rotates. Thus it appears to
hover over a single spot in the sky, making it easy to communicate
with antennas on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The orbit is still slightly inclined to the Equator, however.
Hughes will be able to keep the satellite at a fixed longitude but,
when viewed from Earth, it will drift a few degrees north and south
of the Equator every day.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is not perfectly stationary in the sky, the satellite
cannot be used for certain jobs, such as directly broadcasting
television signals to small home dishes. So Hughes will now face
another challenge: finding a customer or customers to lease or buy
the satellite. The original customer will not take it back.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore said Hughes had received many inquiries. He said many
satellite users, like ships and cable television companies, have
antennas that can track a satellite as it moves in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, which is now parked over the Pacific Ocean, has
enough fuel left to move to a designated longitude and to operate
for 10 to 15 years, Skidmore said. Hughes will split any proceeds
with the insurance companies that paid off the initial loss.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Gentry, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aerospace
consulting firm in Fairfax, Va., said that although there is a
strong demand for new satellites, most big companies have their own
satellites ordered or in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this being an automatic sale to anybody,'' she
said. &QL;

RANGERS' MANAGER EJECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates was ejected from
yesterday's game by home-plate umpire Ted Barrett for arguing balls
and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The ejection came in the first inning after Rusty Greer, the
Rangers' third hitter of the afternoon, took a called strike from
Oakland Athletics pitcher Tom Candiotti. Many on the Rangers' bench
thought it was a ball and voiced their opinion. Oates was singled
out and ejected almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time Oates had been ejected this season, and the
second time in his career by Barrett. Barrett ejected Oates in
1996, also on balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Oates declined to comment on the ejection.
Bizarre play
</P>
<P>
   Oates, a former catcher, said he has been involved in a play
similar to the game-winner yesterday when the Rangers scored two
runs on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I was involved in a play where three runs
scored,'' Oates said. ``It was here at the old stadium. I had a
passed ball that allowed one run to score. Then I got the ball at
the backstop, and I tried to make one of those fabulous throws that
I preach against. The ball ended up in center field.''
Starting and lasting
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starters have had their troubles this season, but Aaron
Sele's 6 2/3 innings yesterday marked the 10th time in the past 14
games a starter has pitched at least six innings. That has helped
the Rangers' bullpen, which Oates worries might be getting
overworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just fine as far as I know,'' reliever Danny Patterson
said. ``I haven't heard anybody complain. Everybody is willing to
take the ball.'' Out of trouble Rangers pitchers worked their way
out of three bases-loaded situations yesterday. Here's the rundown.
</P>
<P>
   First inning _ Sele, with one run home, got Matt Stairs to hit
into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth inning _ Sele kept the Athletics from scoring by getting
Ryan Christenson looking with a curveball for a called third
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh inning _ Xavier Hernandez replaced Scott Bailes and got
Mike Macfarlane to fly out to left, ending the inning.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't have an extra-base hit for the fifth time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland has recorded 20 saves for the seventh consecutive
season, the longest current streak in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin snapped an 0-for-22 slump with a sixth-inning
single.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark is batting .352 with 14 runs batted in during his
past 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 8-9 in one-run games.
Farm report
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): The Drillers (31-41) defeated
Shreveport, 5-3, Wednesday, scoring all five runs in the fourth
inning. Dan Smith (5-7, 6.88) worked six innings for the victory,
allowing three runs on six hits. Also, the Texas League said
pitcher Corey Lee was selected pitcher of the week for June 8-14.
He was 1-0 in two starts, allowing 13 hits in 14 innings, while
striking out 15.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Charlotte (Florida State League): The Rangers (45-23)
lost to Vero Beach, 3-2, Wednesday. Starter Doug Davis (9-3, 3.10
ERA) allowed just one earned run in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Pulaski (Appalachian League): The Rangers (1-0) opened
their season with a 7-3 victory Wednesday against Martinsville.
Third baseman Danny Infante, a 20-year-old native of the Dominican
Republic, went 4-for-5 and Douglas Garcia, a 19-year-old native of
the Dominican Republic, hit a three-run homer.

 Is Korn/Ferry's Expected IPO a Sign the Market Is Near the Top?   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Looking for another ominous sign that a market-top is near?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then look no further than the next blue-chip professional
services concern that wants to go public before the punch bowl gets
taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Korn/Ferry International, the formidable head-hunting firm based
in Los Angeles, is expected to file for an initial public stock
offering sometime this year, a source close to the company says.
</P>
<P>
   If the company follows through, the headhunter's IPO would flash
yet another signal that the suits on Wall Street are starting to
believe the stock market has reached its peak. And that means it's
time for Korn/Ferry's partners to cash in some of their equity.
They seem to be saying that the never-say-die bull-run of the '90s
finally may be losing steam (as if Monday's 207-point drop in the
Dow Jones industrial average wasn't portentous enough to remind
them).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Goldman Sachs' recent decision to go public is widely
viewed as an omen that all good things must (and probably will)
come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when the nation's most prestigious investment bankers
decide that it's time to cash out while the getting is still good,
who's to doubt them? They are the pros from Dover, who have advised
scores of corporations across the globe on how and when to raise
mountains of dough in the public market.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a Korn/Ferry IPO would come on the heels of an
initial stock offering by one of its foremost executive-search
competitors, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles of Chicago. Heidrick reportedly
plans to allow its partners to cash in some of their chips by
selling a minority stake to the public in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And who is likely to underwrite the Heidrick offering? Why
Goldman, of course. (Telephone calls to Heidrick executives were
not returned.)
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a Korn/Ferry spokeswoman would not confirm that her
company plans to go public. ``No decision has been made on that
yet,'' she says. Most of Korn/Ferry's top management were attending
a meeting in Europe and were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors may have good reason to take stock in the
nation's largest executive-search firm. The 29-year-old company
racked up $313 million in revenues in the fiscal year ended April
30. It boasts a client list of 3,000 companies that are served by
70 offices worldwide, and the firm employs more than 1,300 people.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the kicker: Korn/ Ferry could easily be perceived as
yet another Internet play.
</P>
<P>
   Yup. Internet. The magic word in the investment world. And we're
not talking some kind of would-be Zapata here. Korn/ Ferry has
teamed with Dow Jones' Wall Street Journal to form Futurestep, an
Internet-based executive-search service geared toward mid-sized
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the incentive for a public offering is being
driven by Korn/Ferry's desire to raise money to fund Futurestep.
Korn/ Ferry has a majority stake in the startup, which is
headquartered in the L.A. suburb of Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones isn't pumping any of its own capital into the venture
and doesn't have an equity stake. But its partnership with Korn/
Ferry allows Wall Street Journal advertisers exclusive access to
various Futurestep services, such as job-candidate screening and
responding to job applicants. In turn, Korn/Ferry gets access to
the Journal's hefty classified-ad base.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest selling point is that much of Futurestep's
functions are handled via the Internet, says Michael Wilson,
director of classified advertising for the Wall Street Journal.
``And we think that's somewhat sexy,'' Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, will Web-obsessed investors still be lured by the
Internet sizzle if the IPO market starts to chill?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Internet
</P>
<P>
   On the day that search engine also-ran Infoseek sold a hefty
stake to the Mouse (Walt Disney), leading search engine Yahoo
reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to
take a $45 million charge during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time hit will ruin the company's quarterly profit
streak. No matter, says portfolio manager Kevin Landis of Firsthand
Funds in San Jose. Yahoo's unearthly valuation is based on
forward-earnings projections so far out in the future, ``who really
cares if they weaken their quarterly income statement,'' Landis
says.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's only in the short run that shareholders care. Yahoo
closed yesterday at $127.25, down $2.88.
</P>
<P>
   Fashionable Start
</P>
<P>
   Hats off to Bebe chief executive Manny Moushouf. After being
priced at $11 a share, his company's newly minted public shares
closed their first day of trading Wednesday at more than $13. And
the Brisbane clothing retailer kept its momentum yesterday, inching
up another 31 cents a share amid tepid waters for new offerings.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ John Daly was asked about one particular shot on
the fourth hole, out of the rough, which according to U.S. Open
rules, or at least to sadistic tradition, must be deep enough to
hide a Buick. He chopped at the undergrowth like a man cutting
sugar cane and wound up leaving his ball pin-high on the green for
an easy par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Daly said. ``But it looked like two little
cart trails where my ball was on four. So I guess I've got to thank
Casey Martin for that. I mean, it was sitting right in one of those
little cart trails, and I hit a 6-iron out of there. So, thanks a
lot, Casey.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, of course, is the disabled golfer who has become the
cause celebre for handicapped athletes and citizens from all walks
of life for his legal duel with the PGA Tour for the right to use a
golf cart in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the first-day carnival at the Olympic Club had
entered on Martin, who had qualified for the 98th U.S. Open by
winning a regional playoff and teed off late in the afternoon
followed by a large gallery of well-wishers and the kind of media
horde that usually trails the scent of presidential scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute with the U.S. Golf Association over the size of the
cart he would be permitted to use had been resolved and now so much
of the golfing world wanted to watch the gritty young man with the
rare circulatory disorder in his right leg, which makes walking
extremely painful, take his own kind of giant steps into battle.
</P>
<P>
   But there are handicaps and there are handicaps, and several
hours earlier, it was Daly, who has wrestled with his own share of
adversity, rolling in a par putt on No. 18 to finish at 1 under for
a first round that was stunning from several perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   First, this is a course that requires accuracy far more than
brute strength and the grip-it-and-rip-it Daly toured the grounds
without even carrying a driver in his bag. Second, it was just a
year ago at Congressional Country Club for the 97th Open that an
angry, troubled Daly stalked off the course in the middle of the
second round, leaving his playing partners wondering what had
happened and eventually wound up making a return trip to the Betty
Ford Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest chapter in the peaks-and-valleys saga of Daly,
who burst onto the scene by winning the 1991 PGA Championship at
Crooked Stick in Indiana, won the British Open in 1995 and became
one of the most popular figures in the game all while fighting a
long-running battle with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily I'm not walking around this year with the shakes like
I did then,'' Daly said. ``I'm not craving alcohol badly like I did
then. When you play a major, your nerves are already there and then
top it off with the shakes. If you've never been there, you
wouldn't understand. It was a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at Calloway and all my other sponsors, the closest
people around me, said: `You're not ready to play. You are crazy to
play.' And I did anyway. But I learned from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't drink because of what happened. I was proud of myself
for not going to the back nine and basically making an ass of
myself, maybe getting mad and doing something stupid. So, I elected
to withdraw and people in the program I'm in now said it was the
smartest thing I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The big, powerful swing, the awesome club-head speed and the
long drives are one reason that Daly quickly became so popular with
Middle America. But maybe another reason is that he really
represents Middle America more than all of those pretty
flat-bellied boys who win golf tournaments. Here is Daly, with an
expanding waistline and a golf bag full of personal demons, who
doesn't look as though the world is sitting there on a silver tray
for him.
</P>
<P>
   This is a course that is hardly tailored to his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it sucks,'' he said bluntly. ``I mean, I hate it. But it
is challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   So the strongman played the round with a 3-wood instead of his
driver. He stayed within the fairways and within himself. He didn't
crack under the weight of three bogeys on the front nine. He
gathered himself to shoot 32 on the back nine. Just as he didn't
crack back in March when he posted an 18 on one hole at The Players
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned about patience, and I've learned to listen to
other people since that second time in rehab at Betty Ford,'' he
said. ``The first time, I didn't listen to anybody. I didn't want
to be there. But this time was different. I let myself meet people,
allowed myself to go to the meetings. I listened to the stories,
and I learned how many other people have my problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I can't live without those people. The only way I'm going
to stay sober is to stay around those people. I do think a lot of
fans relate, not only in the drinking but in a lot of other things
that have happened in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's 69 was his lowest first-round score in nine trips to the
the Open, and he finds himself right in the hunt. Which is only
appropriate, since the main road that brings you to the Olympic
Club is John Daly Boulevard and the town of Daly City is just a,
well, John Daly tee shot over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' he said. ``They spelled it right. But I
think that guy was probably born about 100 years before me. Still,
it's pretty neat. D-A-L-Y. It is pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly City. A place on the map and a place in the mind. And a
much more laid-back spot these days.
</P>

 N.Y. REIT To Buy Bay Area Developer   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A New York-based real estate investment trust is about to acquire
William Wilson &AMP; Associates, a big private developer based in San
Mateo, in a deal worth $1.8 billion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The buyer is Cornerstone Properties, a publicly held company
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ which probably will involve the issuance of
Cornerstone securities to Wilson's owners _ is expected to be
sealed over the weekend and officially announced early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Cornerstone nor Wilson would comment, informed
sources confirmed the deal yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the proceeds will go to principal owner and
founder Bill Wilson, a Stanford graduate whose real-estate
associates have included the Rockefeller family, Yale University,
pension funds and various private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Although generally publicity-shy _ ``He's a private guy,'' says
Wilson firm spokeswoman Pam Hittleman _ he serves on the board of
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   William Wilson &AMP; Associates builds, leases and manages
high-quality office buildings _ known in the trade as ``Class A.''
</P>
<P>
   It owns more than 11 million square feet of office space
throughout California, including substantial holdings in San
Francisco and on the Peninsula. It also has properties in the
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The firm built the architecturally striking Oracle Corp.
headquarters complex in Redwood Shores and owns a building occupied
by Gap Inc. in San Mateo. It also owns San Mateo's Borel Office
Center, a multitenant, four-building complex.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it bought the Equitable Life Building at 120
Montgomery St. in San Francisco in a deal reportedly worth &QL; 
$70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Cornerstone _ which also owns about 11 million square
feet of office space _ combined with Gap Chairman Donald Fisher
this year in an unsuccessful bid for San Francisco's 3.76
million-square-foot Embarcadero Center.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder was Massachusetts-based Boston Properties, a
public REIT, which paid $1.22 billion for the property last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cornerstone, which specializes in office properties
in prime metropolitan areas, views Wilson as a more-than-acceptable
consolation prize in its effort to establish a major foothold in
the booming Bay Area office market.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Wilson, now is the ideal time to sell, says James F.
Wilson (no relation), an analyst with Jefferies &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that prices of office properties are soaring and that
private firms ``are finding it tougher to compete with the big
public ones. The big firms have easier access to capital and can
borrow at cheaper rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Rising, president and chief executive of Catellus
Development, a large, publicly held developer based in San
Francisco, said he chatted recently with Bill Wilson about the
Wilson firm's ``options.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising said Bill Wilson was concerned about his ability to
compete in a market increasingly dominated by public REITs. Private
developers ``are all asking themselves whether the trend toward
public ownership of real estate is irreversible,'' Rising remarked.

BOSTON GLOBE ASKS COLUMNIST WHO FABRICATED MATERIAL TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A columnist at the Boston Globe, a Pulitzer Prize finalist,
fabricated people and quotations in four of her columns this year
and the newspaper has asked for her resignation, the Globe
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, she made up nearly an entire column about a woman
dying of cancer, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said the columnist, Patricia Smith, 42, a widely
respected figure in the Boston area, had acknowledged the
transgressions. ``There is no middle ground on something like
this,'' said Matthew Storin, the editor of the newspaper. ``That
was self-evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said he had yet to receive Ms. Smith's letter of
resignation. But he said in Ms. Smith's final column, to be
published in Friday's edition of the Globe, ``she does deal with
the fact that her newspaper career is over.'' He said she is
apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith did not return messages left on her voice mail at work
and her home telephone was out of service. Her attorney, Ike
Williams of the Boston firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge, also did not return
voice mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time in Ms. Smith's career that her
credibility has come under fire. As an editorial assistant at the
Chicago Sun Times in the late 1980s, she wrote a review of a
concert that she had not attended. The newspaper ran a correction
but she was not dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about Ms. Smith come just a week after the New
Republic published the results of an investigation into the work of
Stephen Glass, one of its staff writers, whom it said had
fabricated parts or all of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote in two
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, which is owned by the New York Times Co., said
Friday's paper would also include a news article about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we confirmed that we had the problem, we wanted to get
the information out as quickly as we could,'' said Benjamin Taylor,
the publisher of the Globe. ``Credibility with our readership is
the single most important asset that we have and I believe the
credibility of the Globe is and remains very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said it discovered Ms. Smith's fabrications two weeks
ago in the normal course of monitoring by senior editors. Under the
monitoring system, which Storin said he established two and a half
years ago, editors occasionally double check columnists' sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had questions raised from time to time over the years
about metro columnists who have such freedom to write about
whatever they want _ street scenes, slices of life, etc.,'' Storin
said. ``It was on my mind when I returned to the Globe in '93 that
at some point we ought to try to come up with a system for vetting
those columns.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said editors at the Globe discovered the fabrications
earlier this month, while Ms. Smith was on vacation, and waited to
confront her until she returned. ``We detected a few weeks ago that
some quotes seemed too articulate or too polished in certain
circumstances,'' Storin said.
</P>
<P>
   The fabrications appeared in columns published on April 13, 20,
24 and May 11. Storin said further research would be done into Ms.
Smith's work.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fake people quoted in these columns was one named
Janine Byrne, whom Ms. Smith identified as ``a South End
cosmetologist'' in her April 24 article on Stephen Fagan, a man
accused of kidnapping his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Globe said Ms. Smith created a woman named
Dorothy Gibson in her April 13 column about a little girl's Easter
experience. In the article, Ms. Smith gives this quotation from Ms.
Gibson: ```Seems like that girl's feet grew a size since we bought
those,' said Carolyn's mom Dorothy Gibson. `You know, when they get
a certain age, nothing sits still.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gulla, a spokesman for the Globe, said he did not know
whether other people in that article, such as Ms. Gibson's daughter
Carolyn were fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith also acknowledged making up Jim Burke, a worker
erecting barricades at the marathon, in her column of April 20th;
and Claire, for whom Ms. Smith did not give a last name, the
subject of an entire poignant column about a woman with cancer,
published on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claire has been thinking about dying for weeks now,'' Ms.
Smith wrote, ``ever since her doctor said the tragic word, ever
since she found out why she was so woefully tired all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the New Republic's case influenced the Globe's
handling of the situation, Storin said: ``It reinforced the idea
that we had to get to the bottom of it but we were already on that
track. This process was well under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who began her newspaper career as a typist at the
Chicago Daily News, joined the Globe in 1990. She has been writing
a column for the Metro/Region section since 1994. Earlier this
year, she won an award from the American Society of Newspaper
Editors for a series of her columns published in 1997. She was also
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year. A poet,
she has been widely recognized in the Boston arts community for her
public readings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As to whether the Globe knew about the Sun-Times incident upon
hiring Ms. Smith in 1990, Gulla said, ``I have no knowledge of that
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Moore, the Globe's managing editor, said: ``We've tried
to establish that. We don't really know.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin could not be reached for comment on this.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said Ms. Smith admitted the fabrications after being
questioned by Moore. Storin said the Globe initially had questions
about six columns and that Ms. Smith admitted to fabrications in
four of them.
</P>
<P>
   In a noontime meeting Thursday, Storin and Taylor told the news
staff of their request for Ms. Smith's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' Storin said. ``And I feel that we have
handled it in the only way we could and that itself speaks well for
the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement made at the meeting, Storin said ``anything that
further research reveals will be disclosed in a timely manner.'' &QL;

SOUTH KOREA FINDS 55 COMPANIES NONVIABLE IN REVAMPING ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The South Korean government officially decreed 55
troubled companies nonviable Thursday, signaling their likely
demise in hopes of accelerating the revamping of the economy and
ailing financial system.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called ``death list'' issued by the fledgling
Financial Supervisory Commission, a new regulatory watchdog,
includes mostly small, largely unknown subsidiaries of the nation's
large, debt-ridden conglomerates, known as chaebol, that are partly
responsible for South Korea's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To some critics, the list also closely resembled the
heavy-handed tactics used by governments past to guide the economy.
Those tactics are also blamed for creating the mountain of debt and
system of crony capitalism that has contributed to South Korea's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The list was compiled with the assistance of South Korea's
debt-laden banks after a review of 313 troubled companies. It is
aimed at restoring health to the financial system and accelerating
the reorganization in the country's heavily leveraged corporate
sector, which has been slow to pursue change.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes 20 companies that are part of the country's
five largest chaebol _ Samsung group, LG group, Hyundai group,
Daewoo group and SK group. The commission sent an earlier list back
to the banks because it did not include chaebol subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that the top five conglomerates must play a
leading role in restructuring to overcome the current crisis,''
said Lee Hun-jai, chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But only one of the Big Five affiliates on the list _ Hyundai
Livart Co., a furniture manufacturer _ is listed on the Korean
stock exchange. The ax will fall largely on small, virtually
unknown subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I am a little disappointed,'' said Cho In-kwan, head
of corporate finance at Daewoo Securities. ``Some of the biggest
companies in Korea have a truly unsound financial status, but they
were exempted from the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee of the supervisory commission said companies on the list had
little chance of survival because banks and affiliates cannot lend
them money. However, the companies can sell off most of their
assets to survive or can seek merger partners. They also can seek
bankruptcy court protection, although banks are highly unlikely to
agree to such conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many people are employed by the companies
or how many would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes 10 publicly traded companies, and their shares
tumbled before the official announcement was made. The Korea stock
exchange suspended their shares after the announcement, including
Korea Tungsten, Haitai Stores, Haitai Electronics, Haitai
Confectionery, Hanil Synthetic Fiber, Dai Han Wool Textile, Tong
Kook General Electronics, Shinho Electric and Communications and
Young Jin Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of the new president, Kim Dae-jung, the
government has promised to allow market forces to steer the
economy, but the commission's list, dictating the life and death of
scores of companies, seemed to contradict that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep involvement of the government in corporate reform is not
so good,'' said Cho Jang-won, a spokesman for the Samsung group.
``Now that it's involved, the government has another burden.''
</P>
<P>
   But many said that the list was probably necessary. ``Regardless
of the negative implications, the overall effect is a kind of shock
therapy,'' said Lee Jae-moo, who heads the Hanwha group's
restructuring efforts. ``Instead of just guiding, suggesting,
recommending or persuading, I think this kind of drastic action
might be necessary in order to move Korean chaebol out of their old
habits.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some notable absences from the group marked for
extinction. Samsung Motors, a new car manufacturing unit of the
Samsung group, for instance, is clearly not financially viable at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Launched this spring after the Asian financial crisis turned the
South Korean economic miracle into a bust, the car company cost
$4.8 billion to put together and must compete with already
established contenders like Hyundai, Daewoo and bankrupt Kia Motors
in a domestic market now less than half the size of a year ago.
Planning to produce just 80,000 cars this year, the company is not
even close to breaking even.
</P>
<P>
   But Samsung Motors was exempt from the commission's
consideration because it is slated to be part of another effort to
compel the chaebol to restructure called ``the big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the big deal is to push the chaebol into
consolidation by forcing them to swap businesses with each other.
Hyundai Motors, for example, could adopt Samsung Motors in exchange
for its semiconductor business, which could be absorbed by Samsung
Electronics, one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the commission's chairman, said the top five conglomerates
were to come up with revised business plans by the end of July that
would hopefully involve such deals.
</P>
<P>
   But the big chaebol have resisted such consolidation. ``That's a
delicate matter,'' Samsung's Cho said Thursday in a discussion of
Samsung Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers said the list issued Thursday was problematic for those
chaebol that have already begun efforts to sell subsidiaries now
fingered for extermination. The Hanwha group would have liked to
put all or part of the Otron Co., a mobile telephone handset
manufacturer that is on the list, on the block, but now any
disposal would probably be a fire sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the seller in a very weak position,'' said Hanwha's
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The list also is likely to worsen unemployment, which has
already hit more than 1.5 million people this year. While several
chaebol said Thursday that they would try to find jobs for workers
from companies on the list, it will be hard to absorb all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try to minimize laying off people,'' said
Samsung's Cho. ``But others are going to have a harder time, and
the government should share the burden for that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ For more than a decade, Michael
Laudor had wrestled with the demons of schizophrenia, managing to
eke out startling victories over the delusions and hallucinations,
like a degree from Yale Law School and more than $2.1 million in
book and movie contracts for his life story.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the disease seemed to have snatched its own brutal
victory. Laudor was charged with the murder of his 37-year-old
pregnant fiancee, Caroline Costello, a technology administrator at
the Edison Project, the private firm that manages public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, her body, with more than 10 stab wounds in the back
and neck, had been found in the kitchen of the apartment they
shared on the banks of the Hudson in this suburban village, which
had not seen a murder in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A short time before the body was found, Laudor's mother, Ruth,
concerned about a conversation she had had with her son, had called
police and asked them to check on the welfare of her son and Ms.
Costello in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor, 35, was arrested at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.,
a place where, as a teen-ager, he had taken a summer program for
gifted students. For inexplicable reasons, he had fled to Cornell
on Wednesday afternoon, driving Ms. Costello's black Honda to
Binghamton and then catching the 10:15 p.m. Shortline bus to
Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell, he flagged down a patrol car and told an officer
that he had hurt his girlfriend and possibly killed her, said
Simeon Moss, director of the Cornell News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Taken into custody, he was alternately calm and agitated and, at
one point, struck a Cornell police officer, who was be treated at a
local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Laudor, a tall, husky, bearded six-footer
dressed in a blue Ithaca City Jail jumpsuit and bedroom slippers,
was returned to the Hastings police station, next door to where he
lived and visible from his balcony. There, he was formally charged
with Ms. Costello's murder. He had no prior record for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Friends spoke of two setbacks that seemed to weaken him in his
fight against schizophrenia. In 1995, his father, Charles Laudor,
an Adelphi economics professor who often talked him through the
hallucinations and was a stabilizing influence in his life, died of
prostate cancer. In recent months, the antipsychotic medications he
had been taking no longer worked as well and doctors struggled
futilely to find the right prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met him a year ago, the only way I would have known
that something was wrong was that he spoke slowly,'' said a friend
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Other than that he was
unbelievably charismatic, unbelievably bright, someone you'd never
forget. Over the last year he definitely deteriorated. When I left
him at the end of April he seemed diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his recurring mental illness, he was withdrawn
and depressed and making little progress in writing the life story
on which the lucrative movie was going to be based, friends said
Thursday. They said they believed that the pressure of writing,
even as he was unable to land a job as a law professor, contributed
to his decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the book project would be good,'' said Vera Hassner
Sharav, director of an advocacy group for mentally ill patients who
worked on a program with Laudor in 1995. ``But what I didn't like
was that he'd complain that he couldn't get out of bed in the
morning. Writing, especially for someone with his condition, can be
so lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the mentally ill tried Thursday to ward off any
public conclusions that people with schizophrenia needed to be
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill in Washington, said that dramatic shifts in
behavior occurred when people stopped taking their medication.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication from the family and the police, however,
that Laudor had stopped his medication. Yet there were signs that
Laudor had reached a new and distinct crisis. Wednesday, Ms.
Costello, a wisp of a woman who typically worked 60 hours a week,
told co-workers that she could not come in because of ``a personal
emergency,'' said her boss, Tom Boudrot, director of technology at
the Edison Project.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the morning or early afternoon, Laudor had also
spoken by telephone to his mother, who lives in New Rochelle.
Something in the conversation apparently disturbed Mrs. Laudor
because at about 4:20 p.m., in what the police described as a
distraught voice, she called the Hastings police station to let
them know of her conversation with her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things being said may have been delusional and she asked
us to check on their welfare,'' said Lt. Vince Schiavone, executive
officer of the village's Police Department, who spoke to the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the body and decided to go directly to the mother's
New Rochelle home to inform her. Schiavone said that it was clear
to the mother that it was her son who had killed Ms. Costello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she knew,'' the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Ms. Costello's parents, William and Marilyn,
flew in from Newton, Mass., where she grew up, to identify her body
and talk to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor's successes in the face of his schizophrenia were so
striking that he was the subject of an article in The New York
Times in 1995. The story told of a promising childhood in New
Rochelle, where he was regarded as a genius so precocious that he
was reading James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' in high school. With no
apparent symptoms, he breezed through Yale in three years,
graduating summa cum laude in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It was after college while working for a management consultant
firm that he experienced his first brush with illness. He
complained that his phones were tapped. Later, he began to hear
bells in the night and to imagine that his room was in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Banner, a journalist who is a friend of the Laudor family,
said that Michael's father would talk him down from his
hallucinations, asking him, for example, to place his hands in the
flame that he imagined.
</P>
<P>
   His father helped him through Yale Law School, where he
performed so brilliantly he was awarded a postdoctoral
associateship. He also saw himself as a role model for the mentally
ill, and in the Times interview expressed his displeasure with what
he said were stereotypes of schizophrenics as violent.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, despite side effects from medication, he wrote a
book proposal about his struggle with schizophrenia. It won him a
contract from Scribner that was worth more than $600,000 and a $1.5
million movie deal with Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment for a
film called ``Laws of Madness.''

<P>
   You see the reaction again and again when driving Volvo's new
C70 coupe. When you double-park at the dry cleaners, pull into a
parking garage, approach a toll booth, people glance quickly, then
do a double-take. They are puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Instinctively, they know the C70 is a Volvo; the rectangular
grille with its diagonal slash mark could belong to nothing else.
But the lines are sleek and clean, so the C70 genuinely looks like
a car and not, as Volvos have for ages, like the box the car came
in.
</P>
<P>
   The onlookers smile in wonder, as if they have just seen a
Boston terrier tap-dancing or Donald Trump asking for spare change.
They pause; ask what they already know (``Is that a Volvo?'');
affirm their first impression (``Hey, it's nice.''), and consider
themselves in one (``How much?'').
</P>
<P>
   It is then that their expressions darken, when told that prices
start around $39,000 and that the test car brushed $43,000. Some
shake their heads and move on, but a few others, obviously smitten,
ask the follow-up question (``Is it worth it?'').
</P>
<P>
   And then they have me stumped. For while the C70 is eye-catching
and elegant and its turbo-charged engine serves up some serious
fun, it is not particularly enjoyable to drive. It lacks the sharp
reflexes of a BMW 328is, the rock-of-ages rigidity of a Mercedes
CLK320 or the fist-in-a-velvet-glove control of the Lexus SC 300.
</P>
<P>
   The Volvo's combination of high power and front-wheel drive
results _ as is often the case _ in twitchy road manners unbecoming
a serious driver's car. And with aggressive, low-profile tires on
big 18-inch wheels, the test car's rough-and-tumble ride did not
measure up to luxury-car standards.
</P>
<P>
   The C70 is testament to the competitive pressures faced by
relatively small, independent auto makers like Volvo at a time when
Volkswagen has built a lineup from Skodas to Silver Seraphs, when
Daimler-Benz gazed into the future and decided to get there now by
merging with Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   To thrive, Volvo must broaden its lineup, but it lacks a parent
with the deep pockets needed to develop an array of car platforms.
</P>
<P>
   So it has pinned its future on three basic front-wheel-drive
platforms _ the compact 40 series, which arrives in fall 1999; the
midsize 70 series, formerly known as the 850, and a new flagship,
the 80 series, which goes on sale in October.
</P>
<P>
   For the C70, a low-volume car that marks Volvo's first,
tentative steps to move its image up the scale, it borrowed the
structure of its S70 family sedan. Volvo asked Tom Walkinshaw
Racing, a British specialty company, to infuse the workaday
platform with sporting character.
</P>
<P>
   The results are mixed: While the C70 holds its own in track
testing against similarly priced rivals, excelling at acceleration
and road-holding tests, it can feel unpolished on real-world
byways. Inoffensive if not impressive on smooth roads, the C70 is
harsh and jumpy on rough patches.
</P>
<P>
   The steering wheel does not send back much road feel, though the
steering effort is heavy. Nor does the wheel want to return to a
neutral center without some prodding. While a rear-drive BMW grips
corners as if it had claws, the front-drive Volvo is inclined to
plow ahead on turns.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in all, a car that is difficult to drive smoothly. A
balky five-speed manual transmission adds to the hijinks. While
Volvo should be applauded for offering a stick shift _ Mercedes
does not _ the C70 is one of the few cars I'd prefer with an
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Either transmission plays second fiddle to the C70's main
attribute, a turbo-charged screamer of an engine. Shared with
Volvo's sportiest sedan, the S70 T5, the sideways-mounted in-line
five cylinder behaves innocuously most of the time. But a kick of
the accelerator rockets the car ahead like the starship Enterprise
engaging warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   The horsepower rating is deceptively modest, just 236, but the
engine reaches peak torque, 243 foot-pounds, at just 2,700 rpm. If
a tailgate terrorist bears down from behind, the C70 can leave him
in the dust listening to the turbo's throaty roar.
</P>
<P>
   You pay a price for such maneuvers. There is a hint of turbo
lag, a brief, disconcerting pause before the car shoots ahead, and
torque steer, in which the rush of power tugs the driving wheels
from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   Acceleration aside, the C70 has the ponderous feel of a big
American car, and its angular dashboard looks the part. Matte-gray
inserts whisper ``Cutlass Supreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cabin offers delights along with irritations. The
two-tone leather is gorgeous, but the black-stained walnut trim is
rather gloomy. The firm seats, with big side bolsters _ they also
house the side-impact air bags _ are sporty, but
larger-than-average drivers may find them confining.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And my biggest gripe about the C70 is a serious lack of legroom,
a deficiency not apparent in the specifications but one also
noticed by two other 6-foot-1 men who sat behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The head restraints, however, are exemplary _ perhaps the best
on any car. High and close to the head, they should help prevent
whiplash injuries even for tall drivers, and they are comfortable
to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The C70 does have some agreeable amenities. The steering wheel
tilts and telescopes. The Dolby Surround Sound stereo, $595 on top
of the not-so-basic standard system (400-watt amplifier, 10
speakers and a handy, three-disk, in-dash CD changer), is
electrifying _ comparable with the terrific Bose system in the new
Cadillac Seville. But the Volvo unit includes a strange-looking
speaker that protrudes above the dash.
</P>
<P>
   The shift knob is polished wood, but the automatic-transmission
version is ringed with plastic, and that is what your hand feels.
The door pockets are too shallow to be useful, and the console box
under the center armrest is just big enough for a couple of CD
cases. And the armrest/storage lid also houses what may be the
world's dumbest cup holder: It slides out to hold two medium
containers, but should you lift the lid to reach into the box, your
beverage spills onto the passenger.
</P>
<P>
   More thought has gone into the instruments. Markings on the fuel
gauge tell how many gallons of gas remain. The trip computer is a
wonder of simplicity, with various readouts displayed at the twist
of a dial.
</P>
<P>
   And what's this? Instead of the digital mumbo-jumbo, electronic
slide-rules and up-down buttons that have spread like kudzu through
cars, Volvo has come up with a wonderful invention for tuning the
radio, adjusting the volume and setting the temperature. It is
called a knob, and drivers who would rather watch the road than
grope for tiny buttons will find it refreshingly retro.
</P>
<P>
   As for safety, there are front and rear fog lights, daytime
running lights and headlamp washer/wipers. But if the car isn't
started after the doors are unlocked, ostensibly within two
minutes, they re-lock.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague discovered this after tossing keys, purse and money
on the seat, closing the door and walking around the car _ in well
under two minutes, she insists. Locked out and angry, she waited
for a locksmith and wondered what she would have done if a child
had been confined inside.
</P>
<P>
   Configured for four occupants _ there is a mini-console between
the rear foot wells _ this coupe treats rear passengers pretty
well. The biggest problem with the back seat is the front seats _
you need two hands to tilt the heavy, clunky seatbacks. To move the
entire seat forward, you pull up on the latch and hold it for what
seems like ages, since the motorized seat is painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   So is the C70 worth the price? My test drive followed time in
the CLK and a couple of BMWs, and the C70 suffered in comparison in
terms of ride, handling and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's coupe inhabits an uncomfortable niche between sport and
luxury, and it comes off as neither flounder nor pheasant: front
drive inhibits the aggressive engine and the body structure seems
oddly unrefined. The car's luxury pretensions are undercut by a
jumpy rough-road ride.
</P>
<P>
   After driving a car so costly, I'm usually sad to see it go. But
I walked away from the C70, admired the sweep of its sheet metal
one last time, and never looked back.  &QL;

A SWEDISH SUNTAN PRESCRIPTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21)

<P>
   Having developed some eye-catching curves, Volvo is going
topless.
</P>
<P>
   A C70 convertible will go on sale early next month at a price
estimated at $44,000. Options will push fully equipped models close
to $50,000, where the C70 will compete with the Mercedes CLK320
Cabriolet, which arrives in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The C70 is Volvo's first convertible since the plastic-body
Volvo Sport of 1956, and it is a stylish showcase for a company
trying to break out of its safe, staid box.
</P>
<P>
   The top goes up or down at the push of a button, with no latches
to release or covers to snap in place. Touching another button
lowers all four windows simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The well-made top has a glass rear window with a built-in
defroster, but its thick rear ``pillar'' makes the C70 _ so svelte
with the top down _ look a bit flabby. The bulk of that top, along
with the car's high rear deck and smallish back window, also impede
visibility, usually so good in Volvos.
</P>
<P>
   Like the coupe, the convertible is elegantly appointed _ the
test car had unusual, but pleasing, suede-like seat inserts _ but
front legroom is glaringly short. The back seat was a revelation,
though, with plenty of room for two adults whether the top was up
or down.
</P>
<P>
   Twin roll bars pop up behind the rear head restraints if a
sensor detects that the car may roll over. But the mechanics for
the roll bars and the elaborate power top steal much of the trunk
space.
</P>
<P>
   While the C70 convertible looks like the coupe, it uses the less
powerful 2.4-liter five-cylinder from the S70 GLT. With a
light-pressure turbo-charger, it pumps out 190 horsepower, 46 less
than the coupe.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-top comes only with a four-speed automatic
transmission, and its standard tires and wheels are smaller,
16-inch versions. With less power and an extra 250 pounds of
reinforcement, the convertible does not have the coupe's
neck-snapping takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   While Volvo boasts that the convertible is reinforced with tough
Boron steel, in addition to a ``safety cage'' that helps to protect
occupants in a crash, the C70 does not feel as stiff and strong as,
say, the less expensive BMW 328.
</P>
<P>
   The test car had no rattles or squeaks, but slight vibrations
could be felt through the floor pan, doors and steering wheel, and
the suspension was bouncy. Quick stops caused awkward shudders.
</P>
<P>
   While the C70 coupe can't figure out whether it's a lady or a
scamp, the convertible doesn't pretend to be a sports machine. It's
an upscale, head-turning cruiser _ an impress-the-neighbors
alternative to the Chrysler Sebring. Alas, you can have two
Sebrings for the tab of one C70. &QL;

CHINA HALTS SHIPMENT OF OPERA SETS FOR N.Y. FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moving in `i' category) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chinese authorities in Shanghai on Thursday detained
the shipment of sets and equipment for a classic Chinese opera that
is scheduled to be the centerpiece of next month's Lincoln Center
Festival, threatening to disrupt the New York event and start an
international incident.
</P>
<P>
   The action came during a week in which the authorities strongly
criticized the frank sexual content and other aspects of the new
production of the 16th-century opera, ``The Peony Pavilion,'' which
stretches over 20 hours and has rarely if ever been performed in
its entirety in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   When the criticisms first emerged this week, Lincoln Center
informally asked the State Department and the U.S. Information
Agency to follow the situation. After Thursday's action, in which
the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture refused permission for
sets from the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company to leave the airport,
the State Department intervened.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln
Center, sought help from Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of
state, who is a friend of hers. Because the production is scheduled
to move on to the Festival d'Automne in Paris in November, the
French Foreign Ministry has also become involved.
</P>
<P>
   An American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that it was not clear whether the Chinese government, which is
preparing for a visit by President Clinton next week, had played
any part in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment in question, consisting of all the sets, props and
costumes for the production, was ostensibly held back for an
inspection of the contents, according to Lincoln Center officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They heard there was something illicit in the boxes,'' said
Nigel Redden, the festival's director. ``It was a technical matter,
involving the listing of the contents.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities allowed the containers to be reclosed, Redden
said, adding that he hoped they would be shipped on the next
available flight, on Sunday. But he said the authorities still had
objections to the production that could pose further problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion'' is directed by Chen Shi-Zheng, who was
born in China but has lived in New York since 1987 and is an
American citizen. The questions, Redden said, had mainly to do with
the handling of sexuality in Chen's conception and his insertion of
touches of modernity into the production.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview by telephone from Shanghai on Thursday night,
Chen said: ``The people who came to see it criticized it for having
too much life. It was too relaxed, not rigid enough. They basically
told me to come up with a whole new concept or change the title and
call it something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunqu (pronounced kun-SHU) opera, which has historically thrived
mainly around Shanghai, is perhaps the most refined of the more
than 300 styles of Chinese opera and the progenitor of many its
modern varieties, including Peking opera. ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a
work in 55 scenes written by Tang Xianxu in 1598, is considered by
aficionados to be the masterpiece of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its length, the work is typically represented by its
most famous scenes, including the amorous ``Dream Interrupted,'' in
an evening of varied operatic excerpts. Lincoln Center is
presenting the work complete in two cycles, the first over six
evenings, the second in a marathon weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion'' is remarkably frank in its eroticism.
Chen, working with attractive young actors, has done nothing to
mitigate the eroticism, to judge from rehearsals seen in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is scheduled to open Lincoln Center Festival '98 at
the La Guardia Theater on July 7.

AFTER TOBACCO BILL'S FAILURE, RASH OF LAWSUITS LIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new 8th and 9th graf. Adds amount of settlement with
Florida in 4th graf of 2nd take.)  (See also CONGRESS-TOBACCO) 
(lb) 
 By BARRY MEIER c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, cigarette-industry executives have said they would
rather fight every lawsuit filed against them than support federal
legislation like the $516 billion tobacco bill introduced by Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. With the scuttling of the McCain bill on
Wednesday, they are now likely to get plenty of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, over 800 lawsuits are pending against tobacco companies,
a figure that represents a quadrupling of the number of such cases
in just three years. And along with health-related cases brought by
individual smokers, new groups of claimants _ ranging from
officials of states and cities to insurers and union health plans
to Indian tribes _ have also jumped into the legal chase.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts believe that many of these cases will
disappear or fail because they were filed simply to be in a
position to cash in on a potential congressional settlement of
tobacco litigation. And officials of tobacco companies, which have
been largely unscathed in court, say they are confident they will
continue to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapidly accelerating pace of lawsuits is also producing
a high-speed game of legal Russian roulette for those companies.
And every courtroom wound suffered by the industry, like a recent
$1 million verdict in Florida, is likely to bring still more
lawsuits, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a professor at Stanford University School of Law,
said he believed the industry had the resources to lose half of the
individual lawsuits brought against it as long as the number of
such cases annually ranged from 100 to 200 claims. But Rabin said
he foresees a litigation landslide if juries start giving out large
punitive-damage awards or if class-action claims like one set to
begin in Florida next month succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could provide a major incentive for other litigants to
sue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, producers face the first class-action
lawsuit ever brought to trial on behalf on smokers throughout a
state claiming addiction or tobacco-related injuries. And in
September, the industry faces another legal test when the trial of
a lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Washington state to
recover Medicaid expenses begins.
</P>
<P>
   Such state lawsuits are of greatest concern to tobacco
producers. Some preliminary ``feelers'' have been made to restart
talks between the industry and some state attorneys general, one
industry lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rice, a plaintiffs' lawyer from Charleston, S.C., who
represents 29 states, said that he was only aware of court efforts
to mediate state attorneys general lawsuits in Washington and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco-industry lawyers said that they are ready to take on all
comers. And they add the industry's decision to pay out some $35
billion over the past year to settle lawsuits brought by four
states _ Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota _ did not
reflect the weakness of their legal position, but rather the legal
quirks of those cases and the industry's eagerness not to upset
momentum for a national resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there has been an increase in the number of filings
and we have no control over that,'' said Gregory Little, the
associate general counsel of Philip Morris Cos. ``What we do have
control over is how to defend these lawsuits and we will continue
to defend them aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Little and other industry lawyers point to a number of recent
victories in which tobacco companies managed to have thrown out
lawsuits brought by union health plans against them on procedural
grounds or have some of the damage claims in lawsuits brought by
state attorneys general thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   But even some lawyers who have worked closely with the industry
said tobacco makers now faced a new host of legal challenges
because damaging industry documents had been recently disclosed as
part of those settlements and were already being put to use against
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, for example, a Florida jury, which reviewed
documents initially obtained by the state of Minnesota, ordered
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. to pay $1 million, including
$500,000 in punitive damages, to the family of a man whose death
from cancer was blamed on cigarettes. And lawyers handling the
Florida class-action claim are now battling in court to use the
Minnesota records in their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry thinks they can beat back a whole new era of
litigation they are dreaming,'' said a former industry lawyer who
would speak only if not named.
</P>
<P>
   It was the desire to end legal uncertainty that led five major
tobacco companies to pursue last June's $368.5 billion settlement
proposal with state attorneys generals and class-action lawyers.
That plan, under which producers agreed to restrict tobacco
advertising and pay penalties if youth smoking did not fall,
settled state lawsuits and barred class-action lawsuits and the
awarding of punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions were critical because compensatory damages in
smoking lawsuit, which have rarely been paid, were small. But a
punitive damage award, which is meant to punish a company, or the
loss of a class-action case could produce significant financial
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the price tag of the June proposal grew in the Senate,
cigarette producers saw the prospects of higher prices for their
products, lowered sales and the loss of lawsuit protections they
had sought.

she is not surprised that producers have decided to take their
chances in the courtroom, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the reason that the industry came to the
table,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``They came to get rid of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the McCain bill and the prospect of renewed
courtroom conflict will cause many state attorneys general to
jump-start their lawsuits against producers. A large majority of
the states involved in last June's plan were late in suing
producers and many of those states, expecting the settlement to win
congressional approval, have not done much pretrial work.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in just a few states have introduced bills over the
past year that would make it easier for a state to prevail in a
lawsuit against a cigarette company. Such a bill, which effectively
allows a state to recover collectively rather than pressing
individual claims on behalf of every smoker treated, was considered
instrumental in Florida's ability to negotiate an $11.3 billion
settlement with the industry last August.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Habush, a lawyer who represents the state of Wisconsin, said
that while some states have lost ground waiting to see what
Congress would do, others like Wisconsin have been proceeding
actively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the industry thinks that proceeding state by
the state is best possible route,'' said Habush. ``But there is no
way they are going to get through this minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Some initial settlement efforts have been made to try and
restart settlement negotiations between the industry and some state
attorneys general, but one industry lawyer called the talks very
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aronson and other legal experts added that while they
believed the industry could overcome many of the claims filed
against it, the legal landscape remained troubling for producers.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that new claimants like health insurers and
union health plans were assaulting cigarette makers for the first
time. And while those actions might not initially succeed, the
success of one could open the door for others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the outpouring of secret industry documents and the
steady drumbeat of negative articles and television programs about
tobacco producers was likely to have an impact on jurors, Ms.
Aronson and others added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, jurors felt that smokers brought on their own
demise and should not be rewarded,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``Now some
juries are willing to take their eyes off the smoker and cast them
on the industry.''

IRAQ SECRECY MAY IMPERIL DEAL ON SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, France, China)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief U.N. arms inspector for Iraq said
Thursday that a plan for ending sanctions that he and the Iraqis
agreed to last weekend would collapse if the Iraqis withheld
documents or other evidence, something they threatened to do even
while the talks were in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The chief inspector, Richard Butler, sent a report to the
Security Council Thursday that paints a much less optimistic
picture than he or Iraqi officials presented when the Baghdad
meetings ended on Sunday and it appeared that the Iraqis were
within striking distance of the lifting of an oil-sales embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report reveals that Iraq, while agreeing to some
cooperation, is in fact attempting to block all investigations into
other crucial areas, including chemical and biological weaponry,
and wants to defer discussions of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no discrepancy,'' Butler said in a telephone
interview from Canberra, Australia, where he is speaking to a
university forum. He said that he had attempted in brief remarks to
the press in Baghdad and Kuwait to accentuate the positive while
making it clear that the success or failure of the plan was up to
Iraq. He also said that he could not disclose the details of the
talks until he had reported to the Security Council. He will brief
the Council here next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing now hangs by the thread of Iraqi
cooperation,'' Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, said in the interview. ``If it turns out that they've
done this schedule of work with us as some kind of tactical
maneuver rather than a real promise to produce the documents,
produce the goods that we need, then it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report to the Security Council, Butler said that the
Iraqis had agreed to deal with a list of certain outstanding issues
by early August, including providing detailed information on
missile warheads, mustard gas shells and other weaponry, along with
documents. But they flatly refused to address questions about
production of the deadly nerve agent VX.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Iraqi delegation to the talks, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, also told Butler that no more information
would be provided on biological weapons, and demanded another
technical evaluation of biological issues by outsiders, notably
from Russia, France and China, who are the supporters of Iraq on
the Security Council. That evaluation is scheduled to begin in
Baghdad on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq stated that it had already presented all the evidence
available to it, and that no additional information or
documentation would be provided to the commission,'' Butler's
report said of Iraq's response on biological arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In virtually all instances,'' Butler concluded, ``Iraq
remained firm in the position that no relevant documents were
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also refused to discuss the issue of tons of missing rocket
fuel or the government's concealment policies, which arms
inspectors say were formulated systematically to confuse and
mislead them. And the Iraqis once again raised a demand that
American U-2 aircraft stop flying over their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said in the interview Thursday that he had pointed out in
Baghdad that ``Iraq would have to have a serious discussion with us
about this policy and practice of concealment. We would have to be
able to report that it had come to an end.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the talks in Baghdad on June 13 and 14
say that Iraq arrived with huge delegations and videotaped the
proceedings, which at times appeared more staged than real. The
government of President Saddam Hussein, which is distributing the
videotapes to diplomats in Baghdad, apparently believes that the
tapes will convince the world that the disarmament process has
reached its final chapter and that Butler's disarmament commission
has already been sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   The next major sanctions review takes place in the Security
Council in October, more than eight years after an embargo was
imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Iraq wants all
sanctions lifted by the end of the year. Diplomats here say that,
at best, a ban on oil sales could end, but other trade restrictions
would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, who are becoming more and more open about their
alliance with the Russians, French and Chinese in efforts to end
the oil-sales embargo, left U.N. officials and diplomats meeting in
Baghdad with the impression that Iraq thinks that it has enough
political support in the Security Council to defer discussion on
the tough areas they have closed to inspectors for now. Some
Council members have begun to talk about how 100 percent compliance
may not be possible in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that Iraq, which has been skillfully plotting its
way out of sanctions for a year, seems to be counting additionally
on President Clinton's unwillingness to face any major crisis with
Iraq or to take military action in the fall, just before a
congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   After the oil embargo is lifted, Iraq will fall under a
long-term monitoring system rather than active, intrusive
disarmament inspections with orders to search and destroy. Although
the surveillance system set up in Iraq by the Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, would continue to operate _ though perhaps in a
different form _ inspectors are concerned that without direct
Security Council oversight, Iraq will whittle down controls and
find it easier to defy requests for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's report says that Iraqis tried to dismiss as ``trivial''
many of the details the inspectors believe are necessary to
determine exactly how large Iraqi programs were, a prerequisite to
being able to judge whether most weapons and components have been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Iraqi position, Butler wrote that he was told:
``Iraq had destroyed all proscribed weapons, and the details were
unimportant in view of the suffering in Iraq as a consequence of
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz refused to address the question of missing rocket fuel,
saying it could be dealt with later under long-term monitoring. He
said that accounting for missile engines and guidance systems was
not necessary at this point.

RANGERS LEAVE TOWN WITH GIFT FROM ATHLETICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Oakland Athletics left 15 runners on
base. They loaded the bases in three innings and failed to score
each time.
</P>
<P>
   Their downfall was that they couldn't muster the clutch, two-run
strikeout as Will Clark did for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   That freak play, with two runs scoring on a wild-pitch
strikeout, and tough pitching in clutch situations allowed the
Rangers to salvage the final game of a disappointing homestand with
a 3-2 victory against the Athletics yesterday at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought victory, played in 3 hours, 20 minutes in
99-degree heat and a whipping prairie wind, left the Rangers 2-5 on
the homestand. They open a three-game series with the
division-leading Anaheim Angels tonight on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Six Rangers pitchers combined to allow nine hits, eight walks
and one hit batter but limited the Athletics to 3-for-11 hitting
with runners in scoring position. They didn't retire the side in
order until John Wetteland did so in the ninth to earn his 20th
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just needed a victory, period,'' Clark said. ``It wasn't
easy, but we'll take it and go on to Anaheim.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Aaron Sele issued a career-high seven walks but
battled through 6 2/3 innings to get the victory, his 10th of the
year against four losses. It's the earliest a Rangers pitcher has
won his 10th game in a season, and it ties him with Atlanta's Greg
Maddux for the major-league lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to go out there and throw the ball the way I'm
capable,'' said Sele, who had a 9.61 ERA in four previous starts.
``I still don't think I threw the ball that well, but it's getting
better. I was happy with the way I was able to make quality pitches
when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland starter Tom Candiotti, throwing a mean knuckleball, was
just as tough in clutch situations. Actually, he was too tough on
the key play of the game, both for Clark and Oakland rookie catcher
A.J. Hinch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, with the score 1-1, loaded the bases with one out
in the third when Clark struck out on what Hinch called
``Candiotti's nastiest knuckleball of the day.'' The ball came in
on a bounce and rolled several feet away, allowing Tom Goodwin to
dash home from third for one run. When Hinch's return throw got
away from Candiotti, who was covering the plate, Rusty Greer kept
coming around third base and also scored.
</P>
<P>
   It might have made a difference that Candiotti tangled with
home-plate umpire Ted Barrett while retrieving the dropped throw,
because Greer barely slid in under Hinch's tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing,'' Clark said. ``If anybody asks you
to face a knuckleballer in 40 mile per hour wind, tell them no
thank you. The ball I struck out on, it started up at the letters
and dropped down in the dirt. It dropped about five feet.
Fortunately, we got two runs, thanks to good base running.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Greer: ``I wasn't at third base yet when the ball got away,
so I was able to keep going and not break stride. We haven't got a
whole lot of breaks lately but we got one today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele and the bullpen made that play hold up. The Athletics put
together three hits in the fourth to make it 3-2 but couldn't pull
even despite having nine base runners in the final five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day for everybody, I don't care how we did it,''
reliever Danny Patterson said. ``Aaron threw pitches and I don't
know how he did it. It was suffocating out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Johnny Oates: ``We didn't swing the bats well again
today, but Aaron made a lot of quality pitches when he had to. You
need to win one of these once in a while to relax a little bit.''

ENERGY BROKER LINES UP DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first payoff from the state's new utility deregulation
law, a Boston buying cooperative is expected to announce today the
first large contract for commercial and municipal users to buy
electricity on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   National Energy Choice LLC, acting as a broker, said it has
letters of intent with several hundred users _ businesses;
nonprofit organizations; cities and towns in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island _ to purchase electricity from Select Energy, the
unregulated subsidiary of Hartford-based Northeast Utilities, the
largest utility in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The users spent more than $200 million on electricity last year.
</P>
<P>
   The program was made possible after Massachusetts launched
utility deregulation in March. Before that, users had no choice
except their local utility.
</P>
<P>
   The National Energy Choice program would officially start in
January 1999. It would be available initially to businesses and
organizations, but not residential customers. There are plans to
expand the program to residential customers after 2000, said Paul
L. Barrett, a National Energy Choice managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who sign up for the four- or five-year program will
pay about 5 percent less than what they pay utilities now, said
Steven M. Rothstein, managing director of National Energy Choice, a
company backed by Citizens Energy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there will be even greater savings ahead,'' said
Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is similar to _ but potentially larger than _ an
electricity purchase agreement between the Massachusetts Health and
Educational Facilities Authority and PECO Energy Co. of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   National Energy Choice will formally begin signing up customers
next week and will continue until the Sept. 21 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Users that have signed letters of intent include movie theaters,
hotels, associations representing Massachusetts municipalities,
nursing homes, and newspapers, along with 30 school districts in
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about the cost-saving opportunities for our
members,'' said Geoffrey C. Beckwith, executive director of the
Massachusetts Municipal Association, which represents more than 350
cities and towns, of which 200 have signed letters of intent for
the energy discount program.
</P>
<P>
   He said for communities that spend $500,000 per year on
electricity, about 30 percent of that cost will be in electric
generation. Users will save 5 percent on the electric generation
portion. National Energy Choice will earn a monthly fee of 15
percent to 24 percent of the money saved, said Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   However, Select Energy will make most of its money through
energy audits and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also save an additional 5 to 7 percent if they
pursue an optional energy efficiency program aimed at reducing
electrical consumption.
</P>
<P>
   For those savings, Select Energy will conduct an energy audit
that would recommend improvements in heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning systems. Customers could use Select Energy or other
companies to perform the upgrades to qualify for the discount.

NEW YORK CITY DEVELOPING PLANS TO COUNTER CHEMICAL, GERM ATTACKS

(th) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long viewed as one of the world's most attractive
targets for terrorists, New York City has quietly undertaken an
ambitious effort to counter attacks carried out with deadly
chemicals or germs, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The city is buying germ detectors, working out deals with
regional hospitals for emergency care, striking unusual accords
with drug companies to make medicines quickly in an emergency and
taking steps to stockpile medications, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Although no specific threat of a germ or chemical attack has
been detected recently, the city has undertaken an extensive
training program since September, instructing about 4,000 city
police officers and firefighters in how to handle such an
emergency. Next week, about 1,500 doctors and nurses in New York
are to be trained by outside medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency planners face bewildering problems in preparing to
deal with germ attacks, the foremost being how to tell if sudden
outbreaks of illness are natural or purposeful. Malicious strikes
are hard to detect rapidly since deadly microbes might incubate in
human bodies for hours, days, weeks or even months before causing
widespread havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with waves of sick or dying victims is a planner's
nightmare, as is cleaning up contaminated areas and buildings. The
spores of anthrax, one of the most common biological warfare
agents, can live for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, city officials began monitoring patterns of
emergency hospitalization so that they can more swiftly determine
if unconventional weapons are used to attack New York. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, officials say, has asked to be personally
informed of any suspicious patterns of illness.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that skillful terrorists in theory could injure or
kill thousands, if not millions, of people, but disagree on the
exact dimensions of the threat. Too little is known of that shadowy
underworld, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local officials have become increasingly worried in
recent years about the possibility of germ and chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the worries stem from American intelligence reports
about terrorists planning attacks and such incidents as a religious
cult's assaults on Tokyo with nerve gas and germs.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the danger from terrorists was driven home in 1993,
when a terrorist bomb planted by Islamic militants exploded under
the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has provided about $100 million to support the training
of local officials nationwide to cope with unconventional terrorist
attacks. But the Pentagon said only 27 of the 120 cities in that
program had received assistance so far. And many have yet to
receive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York has the most elaborate program, Washington, as
the nation's capital, has received special attention along with
other cities, including Los Angeles, Atlanta and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, New York City officials said they were torn
between reassuring the public by revealing the defensive
preparations and panicking people with doomsday scenarios that, in
recent attack studies and simulations, have easily overwhelmed the
city's existing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable part of the $17 million that New York has devoted to
emergency preparations has been spent on dealing with
unconventional threats from terrorists. Five of the 50 people in
the city's Office of Emergency Management work full time on the
problem, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's program, which is two years old, is considered the
nation's most advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seen as the model,'' said Dr. Brad Roberts, a germ expert
at the Institute for Defense Analyses, a private group in
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts added that it was impossible to know if New York City
was overreacting to the potential threat. ``There is no concrete
answer to how bad this problem is,'' he said. ``But we can see the
risks of mass-casualty terrorism are rising. That means it's
important to do something.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City officials said Giuliani has been a driving force behind New
York's heightened preparations. The officials said the city's
planned $15 million crisis control center was described by these
officials as a part of the city's emerging defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The city plans to have the ventilation system of the crisis
management center near the World Trade Center adopt a defensive
strategy known as positive pressure, experts say. This precaution
keeps a gentle breeze blowing outward whenever a door or window is
opened, automatically helping to keep out dangerous germs or
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, New York is the capital of the world and as such,
it's always viewed as the city that faces the greatest threat,''
said Jerome Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management. ``While there is no known immediate threat, we would be
irresponsible if we did not plan for one, even though the
likelihood of such an attack is small.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's defenses are being organized by the Office of
Emergency Management. Hauer is also a member of a small group of
scientists and public health officials who have been advising
President Clinton on germ warfare and civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hauer and other local officials have declined to be
specific about the city's preparations. Some of the steps being
taken and their motivation were outlined Tuesday by William Nagle,
a deputy director of the Office of Emergency Planning, at a
conference in Washington, which was sponsored by the Potomac
Institute for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle said the city had already negotiated memorandums of
understanding with several surrounding counties to give the city
access to their hospitals and medical gear in an emergency and was
close to an agreement with at least one drug company to provide
``surge'' capacity for the city in antidotes. A list of drugs that
may be stockpiled at the city's hospitals was being drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Nagle told the 50 experts at the conference, is
``education, education, education.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 members of the city's police and fire units who have
undergone military instruction of a day or more in how to deal with
germ and chemical attacks, he said, have been taught to fight their
instincts in such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Docs and nurses are all trained to run in and help,'' Nagle
told the meeting. ``If they do that with a bio or chem incident,
they're going to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauer, the office's director, said the city had spent more than
$1 million to buy two mobile emergency trailers filled with
containment vessels of different sizes that can isolate dangerous
germs or chemicals, as well as equipment to respond to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   It has bought several hundred portable detectors to help
identify the exact nature of an infectious strike within as little
as 10 minutes. One type is as small as a matchbook; the other,
known as an immunoassay, is a boxy gadget that uses an antibody to
detect the presence of a dangerous germ. New York is the first city
to acquire the latter, Hauer said.

<P>
   My father used to read me newspaper stories at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I thought it was weird, too. But I was so enamored of him,
so much the dictionary definition of a daddy's girl, that I
obediently snuggled up 'neath the covers while he cracked open the
city section of the Chicago Daily News and enthusiastically related
tales of robbery, murder, natural disasters, and political
malfeasance. The terse blocked type below the headlines became
living, breathing stories. ``Where do you think this woman was
going when she got robbed?'' my father would ask. ``What was in her
bag? Who was waiting at home for her? Do you think the robber feels
guilty now?'' and the stories would stretch infinitely in either
direction, without clear beginnings or endings.
</P>
<P>
   My daddy gave the newspaper a pulse. He taught me to love its
changing canvas, its omnipotent eye, its infinite throat. And since
one long-ago tabloid featured his obituary, it is much too late to
apologize to him for compromising that love.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not too late to apologize to you.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time in my metro column, to create the desired
impact or slam home a salient point, I attributed quotes to people
who didn't exist. I could give them names, even occupations, but I
couldn't give them what they needed most _ a heartbeat. As anyone
who's ever touched a newspaper knows, that's one of the cardinal
sins of journalism: Thou shall not fabricate. No exceptions. No
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are always excuses. Usually they point to the
cursed fallibility of human beings, our tendency to spit in the
face of common sense, zigging when the world says zag. Sometimes
excuses reveal real or imagined inadequacies, or the belief that
the world, if it is to be conquered, must be conquered
singlehandedly.
</P>
<P>
   I've already heard from dozens of people in search of an
official sound-byte, a hook upon which to hang the newly fallen
wordsmith. The (itals)reason.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   It may ring hollow _ after the fact, excuses always do _ but I
always believed that I needed to do it all. Instead of popping out
of J-school in a nice, neat, byline-ready package, I was fueled by
a heady mixture of naivete, ambition, and an almost insane love for
the powers of language. To make up for the fact that I didn't get
that ``correct'' start in journalism, I set out to be 10 times as
good by doing 10 times as much. Write columns. Author books. Write
and perform poetry. Make films. Pen and star in plays. Gig at
Scullers with a jazz band. And as accolades poured in, I strained
to accomplish more.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't establish priorities, and the first casualty was
time. In Boston, my face was my column. I wanted the pieces to
jolt, to be talked about, to leave the reader indelibly impressed.
And sometimes, as a result of trying to do too much at once and
cutting corners, they didn't. So I tweaked them to make sure they
did. It didn't happen often, but it did happen. And if it had only
happened once, that was one time too many.
</P>
<P>
   I will survive this knowing that the heart of my columns was
honest and heartfelt. None of the pieces considered for the
American Society of Newspaper Editors award or this year's Pulitzer
Prize were doctored in any way. I will write as long as I breathe,
despite the dire predictions that this indiscretion spells the end
of my career. In the course of living this flawed life, I've
stepped into the lives of remarkable people. They will always live
in me.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that changes what happened.
</P>
<P>
   So to the welders, the B-boys, the preachers, and the surgeons,
to the grocery clerks and bartenders and single mothers, to the
politicians, PR flacks, spokespersons and secretaries, to my dear
husband and family and friends, I am sorry for betraying your
trust. To the editors who supported and encouraged me, as well as
those who jumped ship when the mighty USS Smith began to take on
water, thanks for the lessons. To those colleagues and readers who
salivated daily at the thought of my head on a platter, congrats.
And to the hundreds of real people who honored me with their time
and stories, you are my salvation and I will hold you tight during
this trial.
</P>
<P>
   To every single reader, young and old, black and white, who
opened their papers on Monday and Friday and trusted me to be
truth, know this: You were the truth all along.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd like to apologize to the memory of my father, Otis
Douglas Smith. He burns in my soul through this, and beyond this.
</P>
<P>
   And that's his real name. You can check it.

GLOBE COLUMNIST RESIGNS AFTER ADMITTING FABRICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 Eds.: Patricia Smith's final column, Smith-Column, will move in
this cycle under commentary (k) coding.   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin Thursday asked for and
received the resignation of award-winning Metro columnist Patricia
Smith after the paper identified four 1998 columns in which Smith
acknowledged fabricating some characters and quotations.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks he made to the Globe staff, Storin said Smith
``admitted the fabrications after being questioned by her editor,
Greg Moore. ... Obviously, each of the fabrications violates the
sacred trust that the Globe has with its readers. ... I know
Patricia is apologetic and feels terrible about all of this. This
is a painful time for both her and this newspaper.'' Globe
publisher Benjamin B. Taylor called it a ``sad day'' and noted that
``credibility is our most important asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, declined to comment Thursday. But after Storin's
remarks, her attorney and agent, John ``Ike'' Williams, said,
``Patricia has resigned'' and added that she was planning to write
a final column about the situation. ``In that column, I think
whatever anyone needs to know about what happened here will be
explained by Patricia.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who arrived at the Globe in 1990 and began writing her
Metro column in 1994, won this year's American Society of Newspaper
Editors Distinguished Writing Award for commentary and column
writing. In April, she was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist in the
commentary category. She frequently wrote passionately about racial
issues and was a lightning rod for reader approval and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   According to Storin, the columns in question were written in
April and May. One example was a May 11 column that quoted a
fictitious cancer patient named Claire reacting to news of cancer
therapies that showed promise in mice. Claire, the centerpiece of
the story, was quoted as saying, ``I'm not proud. Right away, I
said, `Rub it on my skin, pop it to me in a pill, shoot me up with
it.' If I could find a way to steal it, I would. Hell, if I could
get my hands on it, I'd swallow the whole ... mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said Smith acknowledged the other fabricated characters,
including a worker named Jim Burke, who was erecting barricades for
the Boston Marathon; a woman named Dorothy Gibson, whose young
daughter was getting a painful hair makeover for Easter Sunday; and
a South End cosmetologist named Janine Byrne, who was commenting on
the case involving kidnaping defendant Stephen Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said the paper is reviewing whether any of Smith's
columns submitted to ASNE _ which were also submitted for Pulitzer
consideration _ have similar problems. ``We haven't had a chance to
ask her about them,'' he said. ``We're notifying ASNE.'' He also
indicated that ``anything that further research reveals will be
disclosed in a timely manner.'' Smith's fabrications were
discovered after she was asked to provide proof of existence for
the people she wrote about.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said the paper began monitoring Metro columns for
accuracy several years ago in response to concerns about veracity.
``People would bring up (columnist Mike) Barnicle, a couple of
people brought her up,'' he said. ``I just decided we didn't have a
system'' for checking the columns.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, Storin spoke individually with the Globe's three
Metro columnists _ Smith, Barnicle, and Eileen McNamara _ at which
time he laid out the ``rules of the road'' for each of them. The
main rule was that they were to provide to their editors ``details
about the identity of any significant figure mentioned in a column,
whether by name or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At minimum,'' he added, ``this information should contain the
name of the individual and at least one other item by which this
person can be identified. On occasion, it is possible that this
sourcing would be checked by an editor, but not as a regular
procedure, unless we think there is cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, as no more questions arose about any columns, this
intense scrutiny eased.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Moore, the paper's managing editor, was
alerted to a number of ``troubling'' quotations in several of her
columns. ``They were almost too perfect a fit,'' he said. In some
cases, quotes were attributed to anonymous people. The paper then
instigated a spot-check of her columns over the past four months
for people who were identified by name, occupation, and, often,
place of residence. Various data bases were examined _ voter
registration records, telephone books, and the Registry of Motor
Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers could not document a number of these people,
Moore met with Smith earlier this week, at which time he said that
some questions had been raised about her columns. Editors had
failed in efforts to locate individuals quoted by name in her
column, and now the paper needed reassurance that these people did,
in fact, exist.
</P>
<P>
   He handed her &UR;  &LR; the names of six people, asking her to locate
them and document their existence. Over the course of a two-hour
discussion, Smith acknowledged that only two of the six names
listed were of real people.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's resignation comes soon after the well-publicized firing
of New Republic associate editor Stephen Glass, who was caught
fabricating information in numerous stories. He left the magazine
in May, and The New Republic later issued an explanation and
apology to its readers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Smith episode would damage the Globe's
reputation, Storin said, ``Though painful, I think this actually
will speak well of the Globe. The Globe is populated by human
beings. They make mistakes. I think it is up to the institution to
solve these problems forthrightly. I'm proud of the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Williams said that Smith is ``just showing
what we all have to show at one point in our lives _ our humanity
and our ability to have some flaws.''

   JAPANESE PLEDGE ON BANKS RAISES HOPES FOR OVERHAUL
</P>
<P>
   Japan's prime minister has again pledged to resolve the more
than $600 billion in bad bank loans that have been hampering that
country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Although some foreign investors are wary of new promises from
the government because of past letdowns, analysts and economists
say that while uncertainties remain, there are signs that the
government may finally be ready to put a plan into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ARCO CHEMICAL IN $5.6 BILLION DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Lyondell Petrochemical agreed to buy ARCO Chemical from Atlantic
Richfield for $57.75 a share, or $5.6 billion, plus assumption of
$870 million in debt. The deal will triple Lyondell's size and make
it a leading provider of chemicals used in plastics, detergents and
paints. ARCO Chemical shares rose nearly 13 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA TO SEEK MORE IMF FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government plans to seek $10 billion to $15 billion
in additional assistance from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   WALT DISNEY BUYING 43 PERCENT OF INFOSEEK
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney became the latest media company to seek a gateway
into cyberspace as it announced it would acquire a 43 percent stake
in Infoseek, a service that helps guide users to what they want on
the World Wide Web, in a deal valued at $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS INSTRUMENTS CUTS 3,500 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments plans to cut 3,500 jobs, or 8 percent of its
work force, and sell its computer memory-chip business to Micron
Technology for about $610 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   SHARES OF TOBACCO COMPANIES RISE
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Murphy of RPM Specialist Corp. mimics the ``Call for
Philip Morris'' slogan as he trades in shares of the conglomerate.
Shares of tobacco companies ignited just one day after the Senate
dropped a measure to raise the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack
and discourage teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 lawsuits are pending against tobacco companies, a
figure that represents a quadrupling of the number of such cases in
just three years.
</P>
<P>
   TWO FIRMS REPORT STRONG RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 45 percent, to $854
million. Lehman Brothers Holdings said earnings increased 168
percent, to $324 million. The big Wall Street brokerage firms
attributed the second-quarter results to a blistering pace of
mergers and acquisitions, as well as sharp increases in equity and
debt issues and trading.
</P>
<P>
   LITTLE STAMINA IN STOCK RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks retreated slightly from Wednesday's rally, reflecting
diminished optimism over new pledges of economic reform by Japan
and a possible turnaround in Asia. While stocks in Asia jumped, the
rally faded in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell
207.01 points Monday and surged 164.17 points Wednesday, fell 16.45
points, to 8,813.01. Other indexes were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices edged up. The bond's yield slipped to 5.70
percent, from 5.73 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   BIG THREE DIFFER ON LABOR RELATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The three major U.S. automakers have very different approaches
to labor relations. General Motors has consistently lashed out
against the United Automobile Workers and continues to do so as the
strike at two parts factories continues.
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBIA/HCA DISMISSES PAIR
</P>
<P>
   Columbia/HCA Healthcare has dismissed two executives at a
Tennessee hospital after an investigation concluded they probably
altered records on costs in a manner that may have bilked federal
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP BUYS BRITISH HOTEL CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of American investors, including Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman, has agreed to buy a British luxury hotel chain
for 42.8 million pounds, or $71.1 million.

SELIG IS UNSURE OF JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The pressure seems to be building on Allan (Bud)
Selig. His fellow owners believe he has done such an effective job
in more than five years as baseball's ``interim'' commissioner that
they want him to take the job on a full-time basis. But does he
really want it, especially after five years of insisting that he
didn't?
</P>
<P>
   Responding to two published reports _ by the New York Times and
the Associated Press _ that he is on the verge of becoming
permanent commissioner, Selig told the Globe Thursday that he
remains undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand why this is coming up again,'' he said from
his office in Milwaukee, where he serves as CEO of the Brewers,
though he no longer runs the team on a daily basis. ``It's been out
there for months. I know there are some owners who wish I would
take the job full-time. But I haven't made up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   AP reported that Selig will call an owners' meeting in the next
few weeks to put the matter to a formal vote _ approval of 75
percent of the 30 owners would be necessary for his full-time
hiring. An unidentified member of baseball's ruling Executive
Council told AP that during last week's meetings in Seattle, Selig
decided to become full-time commissioner, at a salary of $1.5
million annually, after he was approached by a group of owners.
Further, the wire service quoted an unidentified council member as
saying that Selig's acceptance ``is just a matter now of the
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   This came on the heels of a Times report that the search
committee appointed in January 1997 has decided there is no one
better qualified for the job than Selig, baseball's acting boss
since the owners forced out the last full-time commissioner, Fay
Vincent, in September 1992. The Times said Selig would assume the
commissionership on a full-time basis this year, perhaps by the
All-Star Game in Denver July 7.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Selig denied the Times report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been and continues to be much speculation that I
will accept the position of Commissioner, and many club owners have
approached me about taking it,'' the statement read. ``There is a
greater degree of urgency now and the matter will have to be
addressed soon. However, all such speculation is premature and the
report that I have accepted the job is simply untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig reinforced that position when contacted by the Globe _
though he did not rule out taking the job at some point.
</P>
<P>
   The owners already have expressed wide backing for one of their
own, though Selig's daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, has been running
the Brewers' operation since her father assumed the commissioner's
duties. And the burden may be reduced because baseball now has its
first full-time CEO, Paul Beeston, in place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Selig obviously has misgivings. In a recent interview,
Selig, 63, said the last five years have been draining on his
family. His commitment to a new Milwaukee stadium, now under
construction, doesn't end until the facility is completed. And he
has just become a grandfather. The next scheduled owners' meeting
is Sept. 15-17 in Milwaukee, so Selig still has time to mull his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The latest call for Selig merely reflects the relative
confidence his fellow owners have in the onetime car dealer from
Milwaukee who rose from relative obscurity in the 1970s to become
perhaps baseball's most powerful owner. Not the richest. Not the
CEO of the biggest and best franchise. But a little guy from the
Midwest who since reestablishing a franchise in Milwaukee in 1970
has somehow managed to hang in with the big boys despite the
changing economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Selig is in demand because he has persuaded ownership in general
that there is no longer any reason to have one omnipotent ruler,
which the commissioner was considered. This became a myth, as
Marvin Miller, former executive director of the Players
Association, expressed it: ``The baseball commissioner is the
commissioner of the owners, not the players. One day they will
admit this.''
</P>
<P>
   It took three court losses on charges of collusion to expose the
commissioner's office as nothing but an extension of ownership.
Vincent was forced out because he dared exercise independent
judgment at a time when ownership wanted a strong front on such
matters as expansion, realignment, and interleague play. Vincent's
departure was baseball's loss.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, ownership turned to Selig and a ruling Executive
Council, which carried the owners' banner on the aforementioned
issues. In appointing Selig, ownership did give the appearance of a
united front. But catastrophic confrontation with the union
followed, and the result was the players' strike of 1994 that wiped
out the World Series and wasn't resolved until the following
spring.

ENBERG, MILLER, NBC ON PAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic Club, site of the 98th US Open, is one of those
courses that command attention. The roughs are extremely thick and
the greens are small, making it difficult for even top
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   In lesser hands, the course would simply become a pretty
background. Not so with NBC's Dick Enberg and former US Open
champion Johnny Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to keeping track of all of the leaders Thursday,
Enberg and Miller paid homage to the course, giving viewers a real
feel for the precision required to beat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par is a very good score,'' Enberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Enberg was right. Only three of the first 63 players in the
156-man field to finish the first round broke par: Payne Stewart,
John Daly, and Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   NBC used computer-generated animation to show each hole. Viewers
saw the angles, the height of the greens, the sand traps, and the
fairways. NBC also used cameras behind golfers to show us what they
saw as they teed off.
</P>
<P>
   The result was very good television.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR MARTIN, A DREAM COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Casey Martin parked his shiny green golf cart
about 20 yards in front of the green on the 438-yard fourth hole at
the Olympic Club Thursday, then limped up the slope and stared
toward the rough that resembled bunches of broccoli on a produce
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a ball over here?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Several people in his gallery pointed to the little blue flag
marker near his ball, barely visible deep down in the broccoli. So
deep that he had to chip out firmly, his ball sliding about five
feet past the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Two putts. Bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the U.S. Open,'' somebody in the gallery mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   But on the 437-yard sixth hole, Martin rolled in a 20-foot putt
for the first Open birdie for the first golfer to play in a U.S.
Open while riding in a cart between shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cart coming through,'' a marshal would say every so often as
Martin steered it near the gallery ropes. ``Cart coming through.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour before his midafternoon tee time, Martin emerged
from the men's locker room, where he has mingled with the best
touring pros for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe it's me sitting there talking to the
great players of the world,'' he said. ``And they know my name
before I even know all of their names.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all those other golfers supported Martin's being allowed to
ride a cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a few of those players that were outspoken,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to name names, but they didn't go out of their
way to say `Hi' or anything. But at the same time they didn't sneer
at me either, so I'm not going to make a big issue of it. I'm just
trying to enjoy the experience. Not get caught up in who said what
or who is for me and who is against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, while offering compassion for Martin, was among
those who feel the game should be played while walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold anything against him for having that angle,''
Martin said during his Tuesday news conference. ``I don't agree
with him, but at the same time it's not like I don't like the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin acknowledged, however, that some golfers' comments have
hurt as much as the circulatory ailment in his right leg known as
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish people could understand what you deal with,'' he
said, alluding to his affliction. ``If they knew that, they
wouldn't say the kind of things they do. I know some things can be
distorted so I try not to be hard on people. I've said a lot of
things I wish I didn't say. So I try not to get mad at someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin rebutted those who feel that walking is a test of the
fatigue factor in tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I go through,'' he said, ``I think I fulfill that
part of a fatigue factor. I know I'm not at an advantage physically
over anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   When not riding in the cart, Martin moves with a noticeable
limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of pain in my leg,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
say all the time but being able to ride the last few months, a lot
of the pain I've been experiencing over the past couple of years
has been definitely reduced due to riding.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where Martin has played, on the Nike Tour or here at
Olympic, he has attracted several disabled people to his gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I'm a role model,'' he said, ``but at the
same time, I guess I am and I want to do a good job with that and
be a good example for kids and, hopefully, to use this situation
for good.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Olympic, with high thick rough created by the winter rain
from El Nino, he planned to hit his 3-wood or his 2-iron off the
majority of the tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wedges aren't my strength anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to hit a lot of mid-irons to long irons. And when you
hit a lot of 3 woods or 2-irons off the tee, you're going to have a
lot of 4-5-or-6 irons into the greens. I feel comfortable doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for him in the amphitheater around the 18th green were
thousands of spectators sitting and standing on the grassy slopes
next to Olympic's stucco Spanish-style clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up the 18th was wonderful,'' he said of his practice
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been 10,000 or 15,000 people there. I hit a
good shot in there so it was fun to hear the crowd roar. That is
stuff I dreamed about 10 years ago or even a few years ago. So it's
a dream come true.''

 IN ALBANy, NEW ERA OF OPENNESS ENDS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS  
 (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This was supposed to be the year that a new sense
of openness was to reign in Albany. There were to be no more secret
meetings between the Capitol's power brokers to decide the outcome
of major legislation. Public business was now to be done in public.
And rank-and-file members of the Legislature suddenly mattered.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, old habits die hard.
</P>
<P>
   As the final grueling hours of the 1998 legislative session
wound down Thursday, it found the State Capitol's ruling
triumvirate _ Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno _ once again cloistered
behind closed doors, cutting deals.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, advocates, reporters and even lawmakers found
themselves huddled outside the governor's office, as if awaiting
the pronouncement of an oracle. It was business as usual and even
comforting to some, particularly lobbyists, who thrive on the
secrecy of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights are out in Albany again,'' said Blair Horner, the
legislative coordinator for the New York Public Interest Group, a
watchdog organization. ``The dark times have returned. The public
better watch its wallet, because Albany's fat cats thrive in
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   The session actually got off to a productive start earlier this
year. The leaders of both houses abandoned their much-maligned
practice of secret budget negotiations and allowed the other
members of the Legislature to negotiate the budget during
conference committees that were open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But those days seem as hazy as a dream now.
</P>
<P>
   The return of secrecy generated the swirl of confusion and panic
that has long marked the end of session. All of a sudden,
unfamiliar bills started to surface, some of them the kind of
contentious ones that flash past bleary-eyed lawmakers who find
themselves having to consider hundreds of pieces of legislation in
the marathon rush to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kink, a lobbyist for Housing Works, an advocacy group
for people with AIDS, said that he had been checking and rechecking
the legislative calendar to monitor the fate of a little-noticed
bill that would allow prison officials to test any inmate for the
virus that cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really bad bill that could pass without any public
scrutiny,'''' he said, citing concerns over privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the exasperation that grips lobbyists this time of
year, he added, ``This is exactly the kind of bill they would try
to sneak under the radar, not because of its merits but because it
allows them to look tough on criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of the legislative leaders was clearly evident in
other intriguing ways, including the use of committees that
function as tools for the leaders of each house because they decide
which bills go to the floor for a vote and which bills are bottled
up.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario played out Thursday at a meeting of the Assembly
Health Committee, where chairman Richard Gottfried was haphazardly
sending some bills to the floor and others to the legislative
purgatory of a committee run by Silver.
</P>
<P>
   That got some committee members on the sidelines grumbling that
Silver was dictating the outcome. Sandra Galef, a Democratic
assemblywoman from Ossining, asked Gottfried to explain the logic
behind his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the professor said early in the Frankenstein movie, `Some
things we were not meant to know,''' Gottfried responded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Galef failed to see the humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm a legislator,'' she said dryly, ``so I'm trying to
figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ordinary people got caught up in the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Janice Grieshaber, a couple from Syracuse, found
themselves ensnared in a political fight in which they had only the
most tenuous connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Grieshabers' daughter, Jenna, was killed in Albany last year
by a felon who was on parole, police say. Pataki seized upon the
case to urge the Legislature, particularly his Democratic rivals in
the Assembly, to end parole for violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   He named his proposal ``Jenna's Law'' and persuaded Mr. and Mrs.
Grieshaber to campaign for the legislation. The couple became
high-profile advocates for the proposal _ speaking emotionally at
news conferences, issuing statements along with the governor and
lobbying individual lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone in an election year in which crime is sure to
be an issue, Silver and the Assembly Democrats came up with their
own version of ``Jenna's Law,'' though it contained provisions that
Pataki clearly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Still the events left the Grieshabers filled with hope that a
measure to end parole would be approved after the differences were
bridged.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out Thursday, ``Jenna's Law'' was among a group
of important measures that the politicians failed to find agreement
on before the session ended.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and angry, the Grieshabers finally spoke out Thursday
afternoon, unexpectedly marching into the Capitol press room to
denounce Silver. They accused the speaker not only of bargaining in
bad faith but also of blocking a vote on the governor's plan, even
though there was widespread support in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from Camillus, N.Y.,'' said Mr. Greishaber, at times
looking as if he was on the verge of tears. ``When people say
things to us, we believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside her husband, Mrs. Grieshaber added: ``This is a
business. We understand that. But when you lose a sense of humanity
in this particular business, then you shouldn't be here anymore.''

A COSTLY VICTORY FOR FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-DENIS, France _ If you glanced quickly at the field at the
end of Thursday night's game, there appeared to be little reason
for any French person to complain.
</P>
<P>
   France had just won, 4-0, over Saudi Arabia to become the second
team to clinch a spot in the second round of the World Cup finals.
There at midfield, under the wonderfully theatrical oval opening in
the roof of the Stade de France, its players _ often treated with
ambivalence in their capital _ were basking in their newfound
popularity as the sellout crowd of nearly 80,000 roared.
</P>
<P>
   But if you looked more closely, there was cause for pessimism.
There on the bench was French striker Christophe Dugarry with
crutches in both hands. Nowhere on the bench or the field was
Dugarry's friend Zinedine Zidane.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of mixed emotions for the host nation. Yes, the
French have soothed some of the fears about their ability to score
and to entertain with seven goals in their first two matches. Yes,
their defensive instincts and organization remain arguably the
world's finest. But they are now running dangerously low on
center-forwards, and they will now have to do without their finest
player, Zidane, for at least one and possibly two games, and
Dugarry for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane was ejected from the game in the 70th minute after he
appeared to dig his cleats willfully into Saudi midfielder Fuad
Amin's leg. Referee Arturo Brizio Carter of Mexico did not hesitate
to show France's artful playmaker a red card, and though Zidane
said afterward that his transgression was inadvertent, his coach,
Aime Jacquet, tellingly did not protest. ``You can't let a gesture
like that go unpunished,'' he said grimly.
</P>
<P>
   What made Zidane's red card more remarkable was that it was the
fifth of the day. Three were awarded in the earlier Group C match
between Denmark and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Two were awarded Thursday night: the first in the 19th minute to
Saudi defender Mohammed al-Jahani after an aggressive late tackle
on Bixente Lizarazu. Clearly, the referees are taking Sepp Blatter,
the new FIFA president, at his word.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter has been trying to rub out dangerous tackling for years,
and reminded officials of his desires Wednesday. Since then, six
red cards have been issued in three matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have insisted on this, and the referees are
trying to comply,'' said the French captain, Didier Deschamps.
``But it's not easy for them. They don't want us finishing with
seven playing against eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, it was 11 Frenchmen against 10 Saudis for much
of the match, and it probably would not have been much of a match
even on equal footing. The French were in control from the start,
and if they had been more decisive offensively, they could have
gotten more than two goals from Thierry Henry, one goal from David
Trezeguet and one from Lizarazu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the result fairly reflects the technical difference
between the teams,'' said Saudi coach Carlos Alberto Parreira with
refreshing candor.
</P>
<P>
   Parreira left the MetroStars to coach the Saudis for a large
fistful of petrodollars. But after two losses, his new team no
longer has any chance of repeating its surprising 1994 performance
of advancing to the second round, and that will not delight the
princes who run Saudi soccer and have a decidedly Steinbrenneresque
approach to hiring and firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is still very clear between Asian football and
European football,'' Parreira said. ``So I think this pressure is
not correct. We should have come and enjoyed the World Cup.''

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO KILL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what has become an annual ritual for the
Republicans in control of Congress, a House subcommittee voted
Thursday to kill the National Endowment for the Arts but the Senate
was expected to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   There was little debate in the House on the reasons for axing
the $98 million in federal money for the arts agency next year.
Republicans on the subcommittee were generally silent as Democrats
branded them as sheep following their leaders' election-year
efforts to satisfy conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, which receives about 23 percent of the
endowment's grants, is the largest beneficiary in the nation. The
endowment subsidizes the New York State Council of the Arts and
such landmark institutions as Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been a favorite punching bag for conservatives,
who object to spending taxpayer dollars for the arts in the first
place and for artistic efforts that they deem obscene and profane.
But moderates and liberals, and many of their constituents, support
it and for the last three years they have overridden conservative
efforts to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the House voted to reduce the endowment's funding to
zero from $99.5 million; in the end, the agency received $98
million.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote got the ball rolling again, but many rank and
file Republicans seemed to have little appetite for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   When the move to eliminate the agency came up in the House
Appropriations subcommittee on Interior, no one complained about
the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue has been around forever,'' Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio, who is chairman of the subcommittee, said in an interview.
The real arguments, Regula said, will be made when the bill is
debated on the House floor later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Regula said that by simply abolishing the agency, the
subcommittee was presenting a neutral stance to the House so that
it could have an untainted debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on the committee, sensing a winning issue for
them, drew out the discussion and tried, in vain, to include the
$98 million in the proposed $13.4 billion Interior spending bill.
The chief purpose of the bill, which is $800 million below
President Clinton's request and $700 million below this year's
appropriation, is to keep the national parks running.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said he understood the Republicans'
desire to ``avoid an argument,'' even as he egged them on. ``I know
there's great resentment _ some of the projects have driven me
bonkers,'' Obey said. ``But the arts are so important to the human
spirit. We have an obligation to take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph McDade of Pennsylvania, a senior Republican on the
subcommittee, told Obey that he was sympathetic with his view and
would vote to support the endowment when the matter reached the
floor. But he said it would be a tactical mistake to try to include
the money in the subcommittee recommendation. He said that such an
effort would be defeated along party lines, making the endowment
even easier to kill on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to support my chairman,'' McDade said.
</P>
<P>
   Obey objected, saying: ``A zero isn't neutral.'' ``Zero is
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Democratic efforts to pay for the agency were
defeated on a voice vote. But whatever the full House does, the
Senate is expected to approve financing for the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a spokesman for the White House, noted that
President Clinton had vowed to veto any bill that did not provide
financing for the agency. ``We trust that the president's views on
this issue have been made clear over the year,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   With tobacco legislation dead, the Senate Thursday quickly
passed the first of the 13 spending bills that both houses are
required to pass to keep the government operating. It approved
$21.7 billion for flood-control, beach, dam and other water
projects in nearly every congressional district, an increase of
$109 million over the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 98 to 1. Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., voted
against it but declined to explain his vote. He is facing a serious
election challenge from Rep. Mark Neumann, a conservative and
ardent opponent of government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will have to be reconciled with a House version. A
major difference is that the Senate would continue the $70 million
taxpayer subsidy of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which the House
would end.

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In less than a minute, the New Jersey Assembly
passed legislation Thursday that would enable Prudential Insurance
Co. of America to convert from a mutual company, owned by
policyholders, to a publicly traded one.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides a framework for compensating Prudential's 11
million policyholders in the form of stock. Consumer advocates have
praised the company for its pledge to return its full value to
policyholders but say the bill contains loopholes that could
shortchange consumers. The bill does not limit executive
compensation and does not detail how the value of the company will
be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers acknowledged none of those concerns Thursday and
approved the bill 73-0 without debate. There were five abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote on an identical bill on Monday.
Elizabeth Randall, the state commissioner of banking and insurance,
must approve the company's final reorganization plan.

TELEPHONE WORKERS IN PUERTO RICO STRIKE TO PREVENT SALE OF COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ More than 6,000 telephone workers went
on an island-wide strike Thursday to try to stop the sale of a
controlling stake of the government-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
to a consortium led by the GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began with several confrontations between picketers
and the police on the same day the Puerto Rico Senate approved the
$1.8 billion sale. The House was expected to do the same by
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the sale, in which GTE has agreed to buy a majority stake in
the telephone company _ 50 percent plus one share _ for $375
million, is not expected to be completed until the end of the year,
pending regulatory approval, including that of the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries where telephone companies have been state
monopolies, particularly in Latin America, are privatizing the
concerns. But the government here has faced heated public
opposition to selling what many view with nationalistic pride as a
profitable public asset that could compete in an open
telecommunications market. Workers also fear massive layoffs from
Connecticut-based GTE, which has said it would honor existing labor
contracts and would not dismiss any employees for at least one
year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Masin, vice chairman of GTE and president of
international operations, said the company had yet to assess
whether dismissals would be required. But he added that the company
planned to offer financial inducements for workers to leave
voluntarily if necessary within the first year.
</P>
<P>
   He called the strike ``unfortunate'' and said GTE was prepared
to sit down with the two striking unions, the Independent
Brotherhood of Telephone Workers with 2,000 members and the
4,400-member Independent Telephone Workers Union, to deal with
their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The strike's first day began on a violent note when shoving
matches broke out broke out between riot police officers escorting
managerial workers to their offices and striking workers who tried
to block their way at several buildings here. In a chaotic
early-morning scene captured by television cameras, police officers
hit and jabbed workers with nightsticks as they clung to an
entrance gate to prevent anyone from entering.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 of a total of 1,800 management employees made it to
work on Thursday, the telephone company said, with some ferried by
helicopters to the roof of the telephone company's headquarters
here. Others rushed through picket lines with food and pillows.
Superintendent Pedro Toledo of the police department recommended
long stays for those working to minimize confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   The police said there had been only one arrest, that of a worker
accused of spraying the police with a substance similar to Mace,
and two incidents of sabotage that left some San Juan neighborhoods
without telephone service. While customers found it hard on
Thursday to get directory assistance and operator service, company
officials said regular phone service was virtually normal
throughout the island of nearly 4 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The partial sale of the telephone company is part of a
privatization program initiated by Gov. Pedro Rossells. In an
interview on Thursday, he said that telecommunications legislation
enacted by Congress in 1996 mandated an end to the telephone
monopoly here and that he envisioned more efficiency, better
service and lower rates after the company passed to private
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no reason for the government to be an additional and
ineffective competitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders, however, have criticized the deal struck with GTE
as too favorable for the buyer, and political opponents have
accused the governor of selling the company short in order to
finance some of his electoral promises.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the government of Puerto Rico
would receive $1.8 billion for the majority share of the company,
of which a consortium that includes GTE, Banco Popular of Puerto
Rico and other local investors would pay $375 million, a cash
figure critics find too low. The other $1.5 billion would come from
a commercial loan taken by the privatized telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Puerto Rico would retain at least 44 percent
ownership after contributing a 3 percent interest to an employee
stock ownership plan and offering to sell an additional 3 percent
interest to employees for that plan.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the sale would go to pay off the telephone
company's current debt, finance certain retirement and health-care
benefits for company employees and establish a $1 billion fund to
invest in public works like sewage systems and water distribution
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked to maintain Puerto Rico Telephone at its
present level and have shown ourselves to be productive workers and
the people of Puerto Rico know it,'' said Olga Grajales, 43, a
striking employee who works in the billing and collections
department. ``The people know that really what they're doing is a
theft.''

SQUEEGEE MAN GIVES ACCOUNT OF POINT-BLANK SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From his hospital bed, the squeegee man who police
say was shot by an off-duty officer in the Bronx on Sunday said in
an interview that the officer flew into a rage and shot him in the
chest at point-blank range even after he offered to remove the soap
he had poured onto the windshield of the officer's car.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has raised new questions about whether the Police
Department does enough to control officers with a history of
brutality complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was shot, Antoine Reid, 38, is in the intensive care
unit at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, where he is listed in
critical but stable condition. He said the incident began as he was
washing windshields at his usual spot on an exit of the Major
Deegan Expressway. As he soaped up the window of one car, he said,
the driver _ identified by the police as Michael W. Meyer, an
off-duty police officer _ cursed him, got out of his car, grabbed
him and then shot him without provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put the gun on my chest and shot it,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Reid's account of the shooting was similar to the
statements that detectives took from several witnesses, according
to three law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. But Meyer and his girlfriend, who was with him at the
time, have yet to provide their accounts and Reid had not yet been
interviewed by police Thursday last night. The officer has been
charged with attempted murder and is free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, whose spleen was removed in surgery and who also suffered
damage to his liver, said Meyer then attempted to make the shooting
seem justified. ``He walked, picked up my squeegee and said, `See
everybody? He tried to rob me,' '' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the shooting, Meyer had been removed from patrol duty and
assigned to the Police Department's maintenance section. Seven
complaints have been filed against him with the Civilian Complaint
Review Board and a $100 million civil suit is pending against him
in federal court in Brooklyn. But Meyer, who comes from a family of
police officers, had a number of commendations and medals for
valor.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has been arrested nine times since 1989, including three
times on felony charges, police officials said. All the charges
were later reduced to misdemeanors, mostly for drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Reid's family announced that they planned to file a
$100 million civil suit against Meyer and the city of New York.
Their lawyers said the city was negligent because it knew of the
allegations of brutality against the officer but did not take away
his service pistol. That gun, a 9-mm semiautomatic, was used in the
shooting, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said he had no reason to
take away Meyer's gun because none of the complaints against him
pertained to the use of a firearm.

SPORTS COLUMN: SELIG'S GREATEST CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major league baseball's odd, and seemingly never-ending, pursuit
of Bud Selig for the position of commissioner has come to an end.
Club owners have finally snared the man who insisted he would not
run if asked and not serve if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, according to high-ranking officials in baseball, will
soon officially be dubbed what he always was _ the man most wanted
by his fellow owners. According to those in the know, the promotion
from mere club owner and interim commissioner to full-time overseer
of his sport should come at or soon after the all-star break next
month, despite Selig's contention Thursday that talk of such a move
was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ends the contrivance of ``the reluctant Bud'' era and the
series of searches that in the end fooled few. Now begins the
unique waltz between the game and the office it created but never
truly corralled or defined.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Selig's greatest challenge not only to figure out all
the required steps, but discern how to not stumble while attempting
the saber dance that has skewered the careers of the most
well-intentioned office-holders. For baseball's highest office
remains so many things to so many people that it is the most
fatally flawed of all such professional sports posts.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball commissioner, similar yet unlike the commissioners
for football, basketball and hockey, is asked to be more than just
a chief executive officer. Rather, he must also be a moral
barometer, public icon, baby sitter, judge and jury, referee,
public punching bag, chief bottle washer and, alas, unwitting pawn,
as commishes too often find out in times of labor strife. Despite
donning all these hats, baseball's top guy is never perceived to be
as effective as, say, Pete Rozelle was when running the National
Football League or David Stern is as he shares the National
Basketball Association with Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, baseball's commissioner is rarely ever as powerful as
those other commissioners, and, embarrassingly, the pretense comes
at times when only potency is needed. That baseball's commissioner
is nonetheless viewed as being all things to all people renders the
office impossible and the situation winless, as most every
commissioners who preceded Selig would attest.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's predecessors rarely left voluntarily. Not many could
brag that they escaped with their hides or pride intact.
</P>
<P>
   All that usually remains are calls to reform the office and
redefine the way baseball is run. And, of course, the
never-changing expectations that usually do in the commissioners
with the best of intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations are never subtle when expressed by a public
thirsty for leadership of their beloved pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, expectations are also a constant with owners,
players and umpires, all of whom should know better since they,
more than any other, are the first to encourage a commissioner to
do the job only to fillet the man for taking up the challenge. One
can almost sense the no-win tag being printed even before Selig's
contract negotiations are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even bigger burden facing Selig is his own passion.
While Selig's baseball politics have been questioned on occasion,
his love for the game rarely is. And that makes him a lock to be
bitten by the worst bug of all _ commissioneritis, a disease that
consumes any office-holder who actually cares. Commissioners who
believe the game should adhere to a higher standard and shoot for
something loftier than the bottom line are especially vulnerable.
Sadly, this malady is rarely avoided, or rewarded, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean Selig should not try.
</P>
<P>
   Do the things that you skewered Fay Vincent, the last idealistic
commissioner, for trying to do. Hold the game's import above all
else. Care as much about the bottom line of the fan, who frets as
much over the cost of cold hot dogs as you do about the battles
between millionaires and billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forsake the moral standard that includes issues ranging
from civil rights in the front offices to the lack of civility that
spitting on umpires suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Be not only a peacemaker but an innovator by insisting the game
stop slaughtering the images of its biggest assets. Promote the
players who are more than worthy of the game's attention. Make kids
want not only to be like Mike, but like McGwire, as well. Make the
Griffeys and Piazzas true partners and allow the players and their
representatives a fair say in growing the game.
</P>
<P>
   Do these things and you will stop the groaning that seems
never-ending if only because the sport stirs so many emotions on so
many different levels and issues on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   None of the above will be easy. It isn't supposed to be. Yet,
since Selig is finally willing to accept the job, he must accept
the challenges to try to make a difference even when intransigence
is the safer bet. That's what constitutes doing what is in the best
interest of baseball, the one element of the job that never
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Selig could be summarily dismissed for succumbing to the
essence of the job. The good ones usually are. But that's okay if
Selig comes and goes never having failed to weigh what is right as
opposed to what is safe. It is all the fans, the owners, the
players, the umpires can and should ask. It is all Bud Selig should
ask of himself.

   The world championships have become the latest battleground in
the labor strife between the players and the owners. After the
players voted unanimously to boycott the event last week in the
event of a lockout, USA Basketball announced Tuesday it would send
an alternate team to Athens, one probably composed of players not
in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player in the NBA, it's a big contradiction for us to go
over there when there is an NBA lockout, if that's what's going to
happen,'' said the Knicks' Allan Houston, who had been selected.
</P>
<P>
   With no deal in sight, the owners are expected to lock out the
players on July 1 _ the day after the collective bargaining
agreement expires.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Commissioner David Stern accused the boycotting
players of ``trashing their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston replied: ``We know what he was saying was just a tactic.
I can tell you by no means are we trying to trash our country.'' &QL;

ANSWER MAN RULES! JUST ASK HIM! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: Like, I am a 17-year-old high
school senior (after I finish summer school) working as a clerk at
a video store. Dude, there is this chick I work with who is, like,
SO hot.
</P>
<P>
   We both have pierced eyelids and navels, both smoke Camels and
think Puffy is the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is, she, like, really thinks the ``Ace
Ventura'' movies suck. Dude, they rule! How could she be so down in
other parts of her life and so off-base on this? She's all,
``You're too immature for me _ I read Sylvia Plath.'' As if.
</P>
<P>
   First off, what should I do? Second, who's Sylvia Plath? I
checked everywhere, even the cut-out bins at the CD store, and
can't find anything by her.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Dude, you rule! &QL; 
_Rockin' Randy &QR;
</P>
<P>
   DEAR RANDY: There is nothing the Answer Man enjoys more than the
romantic entanglements of the immature, self-centered, puerile and
near-illiterate. He has, in fact, considered devoting an entire
column to just this subject, but grew despondent and near-suicidal
when faced with the prospect that there are readers out there who
might actually enjoy reading it.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to you, young man, is to forget the ``Ace Ventura''
debate. Either one enjoys watching a grown man talk out of his
buttocks, or one doesn't. Instead, attempt to shift her
sensibilities into another arena _ Classical music, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Failing this, the Answer Man has always found the combination of
a boss muscle car and painful genital self-piercings to be
well-nigh irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Plath, simply ride out this phase. One can't wear
black for too awfully long without tiring of it. As you might
suggest yourself: Just go do it, dude!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: My mother-in-law doesn't like me.
She thinks I am a shrew and a harpie who married her son for his
looks. I love my husband dearly, but he is 75 pounds overweight,
refuses to wash his hair more than once a week and suffers
near-constant, oozing cold sores on his lips.
</P>
<P>
   How do I know my mother-in-law feels this way? She told me. She
lives with us, complicating matters further. My husband refuses to
take sides, and I'm at my wit's end. You're my last resort. Help! &QL; 
_Pulling Out My Hair &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HAIR: Ah, love is such a fragile gift. Call me
old-fashioned, but I gravitate toward the simple approach. Simply
tell your mother-in-law that you married her son for his money.
Then suggest that she might be more comfortable sleeping in the
cellar or the small closet beneath the stairs. The truth is always
best!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: Settle a bet between my brother and
me. I say watching Roseanne talk while munching on a loose-meat
sandwich would be more disgusting than watching Robin Williams
shave his back; my brother says I'm wrong. A steak dinner is riding
on your answer! &QL; 
_ Manny in Montana &QR;
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MONTANA: Alas, looks like Dutch treat for you two siblings
_ I'll go with Bill Clinton wrestling Ken Starr in Speedos. Bon
apetit!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: We recently adopted an adorable pit
bull-Rottweiler mix. Naturally, he is rambunctious _ he's already
killed three neighborhood cats (he brings them home and leaves them
on the doorstep like gifts, the little dear), and has bitten off
the tips of two of my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   My wife lives in constant fear that little Cupcake will
eventually attack our pet python or eat our collection of scorpions
and tarantulas. Our twin sons, now 6, have had the snake as a pet
for as long as they can remember. Please advise. &QL; 
_Typing Slowly
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SLOWLY: ``To his dog, every man is Napoleon; hence the
constant popularity of dogs.'' _Aldous Huxley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obviously you have a special animal on your hands. I'll be
blunt: You need a larger home. Doubtless, this may seem like a
large investment now, but think of the rewards this little dear
will offer you in the long run!
</P>
<P>
   CONFIDENTIAL TO CURIOUS:
</P>
<P>
   Toupee _ no.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy _ nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bondage _ for shame! Now you're just teasing. &QL;

SUCCOR FOR SICKLY CONTRAPTIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky. Calif., Ohio, N.J., N.Y.0   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Clark, a former computer consultant, joined the Microsoft
Corp.'s help desk last year, purely to get into the company. Now,
he loves it. ``You play with technology and solve problems, but you
don't work 70-hour weeks like the people in development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon L. Allen, a former corporate trainer, knew she would love
the work when she joined IHS Helpdesk Service, which runs corporate
call centers, in 1992. Even after she burned out two years ago _
``Fielding the same questions over and over finally got to me'' _
she stuck with the craft.
</P>
<P>
   She now supervises IHS help desks at Johnson &AMP; Johnson and the
Bellcore unit of the Science Applications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. There are people who really want to be the voices
answering the phone numbers that consumers or co-workers call when
their computers crash or when they can't figure out the tax code,
hook up that printer or get the dishwasher to scrub pots.
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy job. Personnel at help desks, after all, must
soothe angry customers and solve their problems _ and then do it
again, maybe 100 times a day, five days a week. They must
understand all the technical details in a user's manual, yet
explain them in layman's terms.
</P>
<P>
   They must be endlessly patient and polite, even when the caller
is neither. And they must do so in an atmosphere in which their
comings and goings, down to essentials like toilet breaks, are
often rigidly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are married to a console, tethered to a phone, with no
firm promise of upward mobility,'' said Lindsey L. Miller, a human
resources manager at the General Electric Co., whose 17-year-old
Answer Center in Louisville, Ky., is considered a help desk gold
standard. ``They have to really get off on helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such diligent souls are certainly in demand. Personal computers
are ubiquitous. New _ and often bug-ridden _ software floods the
market. Complex technology pervades cars, televisions and other
items that were once relatively easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's products are more complex than the customer's skill
set can handle,'' said Bill Rose, executive director of the
Software Support Professionals Association, a for-profit membership
group in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, customer service is now a mantra throughout industry
and government. Even the Internal Revenue Service, as part of its
much ballyhooed attempt to become user-friendly, is spending
thousands of hours, and millions of dollars, to make the people and
technology in its telephone help operations ``fit our customers'
needs, not our own,'' said Robert C. Wilkerson, the agency's deputy
executive officer for customer services.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ended last Sept. 30 alone, the IRS spent $293.4
million to run its help desk.
</P>
<P>
   Similar objectives are sweeping industry. The result, said
Deborah Ingram, managing partner of AT&AMP;T Solutions, is that the
market for trained help desk personnel _ and for consulting
services like hers, which advises companies on how best to set up
call centers _ is growing more than 30 percent a year. ``Help desks
have gone from nicety to necessity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the work does not pay particularly well. Starting
salaries rarely top $30,000 _ not much for people who often are
middle-aged or college-educated. But as time and expertise accrue,
help desk workers are often promoted to higher levels, at which
they spend less time on the phone and more doing research into
problems. In a few high-technology companies, such support staff
make as much as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The demand is overtaxing the supply. For every help desk
employee who regards the job as a career choice, several more are
just trying to scrape together some extra dollars until a better
position opens up.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover on help desks remains notoriously high. ``Let's face
it, we are education machines, places that train people who move on
to better, higher-paying jobs,'' said Walter Borland, a general
manager of Matrixx Marketing, a subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell that
operates help desks for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even GE, with all its experience, has not licked the
problem. It gets most of its help desk workers on referral from
employees, ``so they know what they are in for,'' Ms. Miller said.
GE trains them, offers tuition refunds, assigns shifts by
seniority, gives them business cards _ all the things the textbooks
say guarantee a cadre of loyal employees. Even so, turnover rarely
falls much below 35 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some help desk employees do stick around, of course. Lee
Burlingame joined the Owens Corning Corp.'s help desk in 1990 to
bide time until he landed a construction management job. He is
still there. ``I found out how much I like solving problems with
roofing and insulation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But such people remain the exception. The AT&AMP;T Corp., for
example, tried to put excess operators onto help desks, with mixed
results. ``Dealing with a supplicant for a phone number is a lot
less nerve-wracking than dealing with an upset customer with a
broken phone,'' said Burke Stinson, an AT&AMP;T spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Help desks are hotbeds of frayed nerves. The Radclyffe Group, a
consulting firm in Fairfield, N.J., recently surveyed 130 call
centers and concluded that 80 percent were dysfunctional places
where employees spent their day ``whining, complaining and
backbiting,'' said Elizabeth Ahearn, Radclyffe's president.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the model of a perfect help desk remains elusive. Some
companies, like GE, run their own. But a growing number, including
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Owens Corning, contract with specialists like
Matrixx in Cincinnati, IHS in New York or Sky Alland Marketing in
Columbia, Md. ``That way, you can be fully staffed at peak times
without firing people during the off-season,'' said Karen Strauss,
director of marketing communications at Owens Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Some help desks have full-timers, others part-timers. Some put
applicants through a battery of personality tests, others hire on
instinct. Some stress technological acumen, others stress patience.
</P>
<P>
   Some offer months of training and extensive mentoring; others
coach people for a few hours and send them to the phones. Some say
a college degree should be required, some call it irrelevant and
still others contend it is a drawback.
</P>
<P>
   And each insists its way is best. ``It's silly not to hire the
smartest people, but you can't expect them to be on the phone for
40 hours a week,'' said Richard T. Hebert, Sky Alland's president,
who hires primarily college-educated part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   IHS, in contrast, hires full-timers. But even though it
specializes in computer-related help desks, it shuns computer
science majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand the innards of a computer, but they rarely
have customer service skills,'' said Eric Rabinowitz, IHS's
president. ``We do better with flight attendants, salespeople, even
bank tellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many help desks now offer frequent raises, bonuses and paid time
off. Many let staff members break from the phones for a few hours
each day to answer e-mail queries or review product literature. And
many now have communications programs, complete with newsletters
and company outings, as well as career-planning sessions.
</P>
<P>
   On the service side, help desk managers are training recruits,
often through role-playing, to manage calls _ say, how to end them
quickly without making a client feel rushed, or how to demonstrate
empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Companies already give help desk employees fingertip access to
electronic manuals. To further ease demands on their help desk
staff, companies post answers to frequently asked questions on
their Web pages, or accept and answer queries by e-mail _ assuming,
of course, that the customer's computer is working.
</P>
<P>
   And they are starting to give call center personnel access to
customer accounts _ help desk staff members at the IRS, for
example, will soon be able to view a caller's tax records and
customize their responses.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are making better use of improved telecommunications
technologies. They are increasingly locating their call centers
near rich veins of potential employees, like suburban homemakers
looking for part-time work. And they are training their employees
to transfer callers with complex questions to specialists located
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, for example, will soon offer 24-hour phone access to
prerecorded answers to common questions. It also is assessing its
more than 25,000 help desk employees, and listing their skills in a
data base. The agency wants to spot which workers need extra
training, and it wants to start routing questions to the person
most likely to know the answers.
</P>
<P>
   That means that a New York taxpayer with a question might wind
up talking to a helper in, say, Puerto Rico _ a call center that
the IRS says employs some of its most sophisticated, best-trained
workers. ``Our goal,'' Wilkerson said, ``is to finally give
taxpayers some options for getting help.''

JOBLESS RATE DROPS IN NEW YORK CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's unemployment rate continues to drop,
according to statistics released Thursday by the state Department
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent in May, from 8.1
percent in April. The office of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said it was
the city's lowest rate since January 1995. The figures still lag
behind the statewide unemployment rate, 5.7 percent, and the
national rate, 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office said 2,900 jobs were created in May, with the
largest numbers generated in sales and in business services, which
include secretarial and clerk-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, however, lost 100 jobs and the
communications and transportation fields lost about 500. Wall
Street's securities business showed a slight rise of 300 jobs. &QL;

THEY ALMOST KILLED `BEST PLACES!' NOW TRY TO FIND IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The July issue of Money magazine contains its 12th annual survey
of the best places to live in America _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Tacked on like an unwanted stepchild, the survey is the last 2
pages of a 21-page section on ``super deals.'' It only lists 12
cities and lacks its usual rich detail, which the magazine advises
readers can be found at its World Wide Web site
(www.money.com/bestplaces), along with the full list of 300 cities
and an interactive feature that lets users pick their own best
places based on personal criteria. This assumes, of course, that
readers have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Money's effort to remake itself and retain its
commanding lead in the increasingly crowded field of
personal-finance magazines. Such ``best places'' articles, which
Money practically invented, have become widespread and overdone in
recent years; some have turned quirky and gimmicky in an effort to
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   All this apparently prompted Money editors to rethink their
approach. Initially they were going to kill the survey, but then
decided to run it in a truncated form.
</P>
<P>
   They may want to think again.
</P>
<P>
   Media reaction around the country has been huge. Local and
regional newspapers gave the survey heavy play, as did did
television and radio news broadcasts. It also made network TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the heavy coverage was because the magazine listed the
Washington metropolitan area as the best big Eastern city in which
to live. And, of course, every city wanted to know its place on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington selection was a surprise to many who were used to
a litany of bad news coming out of the nation's capital about
crime, drugs and schools. But for the city and its suburbs, clean
air, good health care, low property taxes and cultural institutions
helped tip the scale.
</P>
<P>
   Money's favorite Midwest city was Minneapolis; for the West, it
was Seattle, and for the South, Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   So an article that almost wasn't generated a lot of publicity
for Money. By the way, Money's managing editor, Robert Safian, said
he had decided ``right now'' to kill another survey, the magazine's
seven-year-old annual college review, which usually runs in the
September issue. Stand by.
</P>
<P>
   A SECOND LOOK In Worth magazine's July-August issue, Jim Rogers,
an economic columnist and the author of ``Investment Biker,''
believes that despite the bad publicity from its recent nuclear
tests, India is emerging an an economic superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Citing its large middle class and skilled work force, Rogers
thinks India will generate profits for investors over the next 5 to
15 years. He acknowledges however, that this depends on peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic success has a way of making war look like an ever
more costly proposition,'' he writes. ``My guess is that India will
see the light.''
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS AND COMPUTERS July's Smart Money, in a Washington
column by Albert R. Hunt and Alan Murray, points to the political
dangers facing Vice President Albert Gore Jr. if the worst fears
about the so-called millennium bug, or the year 2000 problem, are
realized. If the problem spirals out of control, they argue, the
Clinton administration and especially the vice president _ who has
aligned himself with high-technology issues _ won't escape the
fallout. This is an issue on which the Republicans are already
sharpening their knives.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY FROM WATER The July issue of Individual Investor explores
ways to profit from water, which is getting increasingly expensive
as its demand soars. For instance, the magazines points out that it
takes 40,000 gallons to produce enough steel for just one car. Some
companies it thinks could profit from this growing demand are
American Water Works, Ionics, Nalco Chemical, United Water
Resources and United States Filter.
</P>
<P>
   DEAL TIME If you were prescient _ or lucky _ enough to have
dumped some stock when the Dow topped 9,200 in April and that cash
is burning a hole in your pocket, Money magazine's series of
articles on super deals _ what the editors call great products at
great prices _ may be just your thing.
</P>
<P>
   For bargain-hungry shoppers, Money's pick of a high-end outlet
mall is Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y. If
you're in the market for a diaper bag for the baby, the
recommendation goes to a deluxe model from Lands' End for $49.50.
Looking for something a little more exotic? How about a MIG-15 UTI,
a jet trainer used by the Soviet air force in the 1950s and 1960s?
It can be yours, ready to fly, for $110,000 from Fantasy Flyers in
Sante Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to travel, Money points to a $2,500 around-the-world
ticket offered jointly by Air Canada, Lufthansa, SAS, Thai Airways,
United Airlines and Varig. The ticket is good for up to a year and
you can plan your trip as you go.
</P>
<P>
   The articles have sidebars in which celebrities disclose their
``best deal.'' Some are disingenuous, to say the least. Like Peter
Lynch's collection of 3,116 pennies worth $31.16. Or the model Tyra
Banks's $8.98 purse from Wal-Mart. Or Martha Stewart's $1
heart-shaped garden hoe.
</P>
<P>
   But some are refreshingly honest, like Donald Trump's and
Michael Dell's. The Donald cites 40 Wall Street, an office building
he bought for $1 million two and a half years ago that is estimated
to be worth $100 million today. Dell's best deal? The $1,000 he
invested to found the Dell Computer Corp. on May 2, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ON LINE A new magazine, Online Investor, is aimed at those who
use the Internet for financial research and investing. It is
published every other month by MVP Media in Chicago. Jan Parr, the
editor, said it might go monthly early next year. Money.com, a
one-time special issue by Money magazine on the same subject, will
be on newsstands until Aug. 10. A Money spokeswoman said it could
become a regular publication.
</P>
<P>
   BITS AND PIECES July's Bloomberg Personal explains how to read
between the lines of a company's annual report ... Kiplinger's July
issue lays out more charges and fees that are in the works for
credit card companies' ``profit enemies'' _ users who pay their
bills in full each month.

 (Attn: Mass.)  (ART ADV: Graphic showing funds that closed to new investors will
be sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 21) 
(af) 
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funds are closing at a record rate this year. But according to a
new report issued by the Kobren Insight Group a lot more of them
should be slamming their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren Insight, an investment management firm in Wellesley
Hills, Mass., lists 11 funds that for various reasons it said
should be closed to new investors.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons cited in the report run the gamut from a fund's
ability to maneuver quickly to over-diversification. What's
surprising is the number of high-performance, high-profile funds
that make the list, among them Janus, Vanguard Windsor II, Fidelity
Equity-Income and Mutual Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research suggests that many funds have grown very large,
and their size may begin to have an impact on their performance,''
said Edward R. Goldfarb, portfolio strategist for Kobren Insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these are panic sells, but shareholders would benefit
from sponsors closing the fund and focusing on maximizing the
return on existing assets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies are often loath to close even those funds that
have swollen asset bases because the fees they receive are figured
as a percentage of assets under management. The larger the fund,
the bigger the fund company's pay check.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not one fund company plans to close a fund named on
Kobren Insight's list.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that some of these funds are not still
performing well. In fact, several are rated ``strong buys'' in
Kobren Insight's investment newsletters. But given a good
alternative, Golfarb said, Kobren Insight will always recommend a
smaller fund over one of these behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fidelity Equity-Income holds $24.8 billion in
assets as of May 31, but its performance remains strong and Kobren
Insight rates it a ``strong buy,'' its highest rating.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Goldfarb recommends Warburg Pincus Growth and
Income for investors looking for a solid growth and income
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Warburg Pincus holds less than $1 billion, which gives manager
Brian S. Posner, who used to manage Fidelity Equity-Income II,
opportunities that the Fidelity fund is just too large to grab. The
strategies are similar, although the Warburg fund is slightly more
value oriented than the Fidelity fund, Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren Insight rates these five funds as ``holds'': Twentieth
Century Ultra, Janus, Kaufmann Fund, PBHG Growth and Acorn.
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb said investors should not scramble to buy shares if
these funds announce they will close to new investors. He added
that there's no point in dumping shares, either, if you hold them
in a taxable account and you have large unrealized gains.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century Ultra uses an earnings momentum strategy that
often requires the fund to trade quickly in response to earnings
disappointments or rejiggered forecasts. At $26 billion, it may
soon be too large to move nimbly, Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnar Hughes, a spokesman for American Century, which runs
Twentieth Century Ultra, said the fund has more good investment
ideas now than the money to buy them, and has experienced no
liquidity problems.
</P>
<P>
   The $22 billion Janus fund is not only a giant in its own right,
it also owns many of the same stocks as other Janus funds. In the
aggregate, then, Janus managers may have trouble moving large
blocks of stock without pushing up market prices, Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the $14 billion Janus Worldwide is still accepting new
investments, while Janus Overseas was closed at just $4.3 billion
earlier this year. At the time, Helen Young Hayes, who runs both
funds, said she was concerned that significant cash coming into the
fund would make her job more difficult. Why not close the larger
fund, too, Goldfarb asked.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have voiced similar concerns since Janus Overseas
was closed to maintain the quality of its performance, a Janus
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, Worldwide can own United States stocks as
well as foreign stocks, and that makes it easier for Ms. Hayes to
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially important for small-cap stock funds to keep
their asset bases small. When these funds expand, they often tend
to start buying mid-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They also begin to move more sluggishly, handicapped by their
larger size. Kaufmann is a clear example, said Goldfarb: its
performance has suffered as assets rose to today's $6.4 billion. A
fund official declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.1 billion Acorn fund also owns much larger stocks than it
used to, although manager Ralph Wanger blames that on the
appreciation of the stock market, which he says has gotten
``stupidly overpriced.''
</P>
<P>
   At the $5.3 billion PBHG Growth fund, liquidity is a concern
because the fund needs to be able to move quickly to execute its
earnings momentum driven strategy, Goldfarb said. Gary Pilgrim, the
manager, said liquidity is less of a problem at lower-turnover
funds like his.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.3 billion Mutual Discovery fund has moved to mid-cap
names in the United States, and its size will lessen its ability to
buy the smaller European stocks that had bolstered its performance,
Goldfarb says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedman, a manager of Mutual Discover, conceded that
Discovery has moved into mid-cap stocks, but noted that these tend
to be less volatile and that managers have more clout with
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer size reduces a fund's ability to add value through some
mid-cap and smaller-cap stocks, especially when funds balloon to
$20 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   This includes the $26.6 billion Vanguard Windsor II and
Fidelity's $18.7 billion Equity-Income II fund, which Goldfarb
nonetheless rates as buys because of their strong managers. But he
advised investors to select smaller alternatives, if available.
</P>
<P>
   A Vanguard spokesman noted that Windsor II is run by four
different managers who trade independently, adding flexibility that
other large funds may lack. A Fidelity spokesman said the company
would close its funds if it were in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price International Stock fund's $10.6 billion in assets
has forced it to own a large number of stocks, and lose
flexibility. But Steve Norwitz, a T. Rowe Price spokesman, said
size is not an issue because the fund owns large companies and is
diversified internationally.

STEWART HEATS UP THE FIRST ROUND OF THE US OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The clouds rolled in over the Bay area and the
temperatures plummeted, but Payne Stewart was red hot Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By the shores of Lake Merced, the veteran from steamy Orlando,
Fla., birdied the final three holes as he came in early with a
stunning 4-under-par 66 in the first round of the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Then The Olympic Club's US Open tradition took over. This was
the course were Jack Fleck beat Ben Hogan, where Billy Casper beat
Arnold Palmer, and where Scott Simpson dashed Tom Watson's hopes
for a second national crown.
</P>
<P>
   So enter the long shots, though none could eclipse leader
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Carnevale, who has made only four cuts in 14 PGA Tour
events this year, checked in with a bogey-free round of 67. Joe
Durant, who once was so discouraged that he quit the game and has
made just six cuts in 12 tournaments, walked at Carnevale's side
and posted a 69. That was later matched by Tom Lehman, who has led
this championship the last three years entering the final round but
has come up short every time.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who won the 1991 US Open at Hazeltine in a playoff with
Simpson, took the past two weeks off and went to Aruba to film a
made-for-TV match with Nick Price, then settled by the pool at his
home in Florida. He was totally relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have been out there and walked part of the golf course,
you know that you have got to play from the fairway and be very
patient,'' he said. ``I was in the rough 50 percent of the time off
the tee, but mostly in the short rough.''
</P>
<P>
   After making the turn in 34 and registering six straight pars,
Stewart birdied the 16th (9-iron, 8 inches), 17th (rough, 2-iron,
15 feet), and 18th (2-iron, rough, 8-iron, 12 feet above hole). The
par-4 17th, which stretches for 469 yards, was the key to Stewart's
round. ``I said to my caddie, `Let's just try to chase a 2-iron up
to the gap. If it gets there, fine. If it doesn't, we will try to
get it up and down,''' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This is a par 5, anyway. In my mind, I am approaching
this golf course as if it is a par 71. I really feel that's a par-5
hole. I hit a great drive Thursday in the practice and had a 3-wood
shot to the green. So I made eagle today. I chased this 2-iron and
made a 45-foot putt. In my mind, eagle. On the scorecard, birdie.
Then I get up there and hit the worst shot I hit all day and
shanked it into the rough. I caught a lie. I hit the 8-iron 12 feet
above the hole and bled it down there. Voila _ 66.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnevale, whose father, Ben, led North Carolina to its first
NCAA basketball championship in 1945 and was head coach at Navy for
many years, quit the game to become an insurance broker in the
1980s. He returned to win the Chattanooga Classic in 1992, but his
best finish this year was joint 41st in Phoenix. ``It was a lot of
fun,'' he said of Thursday's round. ``It's only Thursday, but this
is what you struggled all your life to get to. You finally realize,
`Hey, I'm here.'''
</P>
<P>
   His round warmed up on the seventh hole when, from a terrible
lie in the rough, he hit into the fronting bunker and got it up and
down to save par. Then it heated up when he rolled in a downhill
putt from 40 feet on the eighth and made a 15-foot birdie putt on
the ninth to turn in 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I got a little nervous,'' said Carnevale. ``I
think I just realized what was going on and I was a little shaky.''
</P>
<P>
   He settled down, made birdie on the treacherous 17th, and who
knows what's ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Durant stirred things up when he birdied four of the first five
holes and, after a three-putt bogey on the sixth, hit a 9-iron into
the par-3 eighth and made a birdie to turn in 31. When he hit a
wedge into the 12th to within a foot, he was 5 under. Joe Durant?
</P>
<P>
   He returned to earth with a three-putt double bogey on the 14th
but sank a 40-foot birdie putt on the 15th. Bogeys at 16 and 17
clouded his moment in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long, I was struggling with my driver,'' said Durant,
who grew up and lives in the Pensacola, Fla., area and played on
the Nike Tour the past five years. ``Usually, that's my
bread-and-butter. You just realize that if you keep making pars,
pars aren't going to hurt you. This is my first US Open. It was a
Tale of Two Cities. I played the front nine really solid. I made
some not-so-good swings on the back side. To win? I can't even
think that far ahead.''

<P>
   Following a trail blazed by America Online and Yahoo, media and
technology giants alike are rushing to construct these gateways, or
``portals,'' through which people venture into cyberspace. The
reason is simple economics: if they can control traffic, they can
move more people past the billboards that line the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Disney announced a complex deal valued at about
$900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service
that helps guide users to what they want on the World Wide Web. The
announcement capped two weeks of fevered developments across media
and technology industries that were too small to shake the
financial markets but obviously a trend that was too significant to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, General Electric's NBC unit struck a deal to take
control of Snap, an upstart online directory service, for up to $65
million in cash and more than $100 million in free television
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday it was reported that AT&AMP;T had been negotiating to
acquire America Online. And on Tuesday, Microsoft Corp. opened a
public test of its new portal, known as Start, which is expected to
be in full operation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Netscape Communications Corp. is busy shifting
its focus from making browsers to operating a portal site, and
media giants like Time Warner and News Corp. are looking to build
or buy similar services.
</P>
<P>
   While there are tens of thousands of commercial Web sites, most
of the attention is now focused on the handful that help users find
the information, services or entertainment that they are looking
for. Since many people use these sites to start their treks through
cyberspace, they are far and away the most popular places on the
Internet. As a result, they have attracted the lion's share of
advertising as well as investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which 18 months ago was drowning in busy signals
and irate customers, has rebounded into the powerhouse of
cyberspace with 12 million paying customers, a market value of $19
billion and the self assurance to rebuff AT&AMP;T's takeover offer last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the largest of the free, advertiser-supported portal
services, attracts more than 70 million users a month and has a
value of about $6 billion, despite barely breaking even.
</P>
<P>
   As these sites grow rapidly in market value and viewership _ if
not profits _ many media companies are deciding that they need to
buy one quickly, despite the high prices, before they become
unaffordable. More than one media giant has expressed regret for
not having bought America Online when it was much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media companies are starting to wake up and realizing that
the Internet has the reach of a mass medium,'' said Jonathan
Nelson, chief executive of Organic, one of the largest online
advertising agencies
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as television, telephones and computers all converge
into one integrated network of communications and entertainment,
companies of all sorts see portals as a possible keystone to their
future strategy. The power to funnel users to certain advertisers
and content sites is worth millions of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search engines have become to the Internet what Windows is
to the computer desktop,'' said Alec Ellison, a managing director
of Broadview Associates, a technology investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's intention is to create a new Internet service that
combines Infoseek with its existing offerings, which include Web
sites for ABC television, ABC News, the ESPN sports network,
Disney's movies, and a site of original Disney entertainment for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no site that has both the breadth of Infoseek's
search and directory service and the depth of Disney's news,
sports, entertainment and family content,'' said Jake Winebaum,
chairman of Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, like many other media companies, has been talking to a
number of portal services over the last year. A few months ago, it
was close to buying a part of Excite, the No. 2 portal service, but
the deal fell apart over the price, investment bankers said.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock of the search services trading at stratospheric
prices, big companies have been loath to buy them either with cash
or their own, more conventionally valued shares.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's deal gets around this problem by trading some of its
own Internet ventures _ at the high value such companies carry _
for shares in Infoseek. Specifically, Disney will receive 43
percent of Infoseek in return for $70 million in cash and
relinquishing ownership of Starwave, a company that creates
elaborate Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Starwave's biggest venture is the sports site it operates on
behalf of ESPN. Disney bought Starwave in several phases over the
last year from Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. Keith
Benjamin, an analyst for BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, estimated
that Disney paid about $400 million for Starwave and that it would
be worth about $800 million if it were an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement represented something of an about-face
for Disney. When it bought full control of Starwave two months ago,
it announced plans to integrate the Seattle-based technology
company with its own Internet operations in Burbank, Calif. Now,
all of Starwave will become part of Infoseek, which has
headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also agreed to lend Infoseek up to $139 million over the
next five years in return for the option to bring its ownership to
50.1 percent. Disney, however, will get back most of the cash it is
spending, as Infoseek has agreed to buy $165 million in advertising
from Disney over the next three years. That money will buy both
television advertising on ABC and promotion at other Disney
operations, like the Internet pavilion at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great deal for Disney, but not as good a deal for
Infoseek,'' said Benjamin, the analyst. Infoseek should have
started turning a profit this year, Benjamin said, but now the
added expense of buying all that promotion from Disney will keep
Infoseek from breaking even until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best they could get, because without Disney,
Infoseek would languish in fourth or fifth place.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NBC's deal to buy a stake in Snap was much more favorable to the
shareholders of Cnet, the company that owned the portal, Benjamin
said. In particular, it will provide more than $100 million in free
television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, however, has much more limited ambitions for Snap, a
service with well-regarded technology and very few users. The
television network hopes that heavy TV promotions will turn Snap
into a popular, stand-alone guide service. NBC's other Internet
activities, especially its MSNBC news service operated with
Microsoft, will remain separate from Snap.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, by contrast, is looking to merge its properties into a
unified service that will have more of the cohesive feel that
America Online has.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, America Online charges users a $22 monthly fee for
both access to the Internet and its own content. Portal services
like Infoseek and Snap have been free to users. But Winebaum of
Disney said the company hopes to come up with extra services for
which users will pay fees. Disney's ESPN site earns half its
revenue, for example, from add-on services like fantasy sports
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the big media companies are buying the existing portal
sites, many other companies of all sorts are jockeying for position
to earn money as Internet Gateways. Smaller sites that began
offering specialized services are now trying to emulate the look
and features of sites like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   And the big technology companies have their own portal
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The most feared is Microsoft's Start, because it will be the
first page seen by users of the Internet Explorer browser software
that is now part of the Windows operating system. Meanwhile
Netscape, whose software business has been devastated by Microsoft,
has been trying to turn its often visited but dreary home page into
a service with as much news and information as the other portal
sites.
</P>
<P>
   And Compaq Computer is even trying to turn its products into
portals by installing several buttons on its computer keyboards
that direct users to certain Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that all these moves represent the massing of
forces for what will shape up to be a long and brutal war over
which two or three portal services will become dominant.
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes in the online world far lower a few years ago,
America Online spent a $1 billion on television advertising and
distribution of sign-up disks to surge past its rivals, Prodigy and
Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' Benjamin said, ``it will be much more expensive
for someone else to catch up.'' &QL;

CHIDING GOP, D'AMATO PUSHES FOR VOTE ON GAY NOMINEE FOR ENVOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusually sharp rebuke of his party leader,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Thursday urged Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to allow a vote on the nomination of James Hormel as
ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Hormel have charged that his selection is being
opposed mainly because he is openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Hormel, a Democratic contributor from San
Francisco who is heir to the meat-packing fortune, was approved by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a 16-to-2 vote last fall.
But Lott, at the request of a small group of conservative senators,
has refused to move the nomination to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that Mr. Hormel's nomination is being obstructed for
one reason and one reason only: the fact that he is gay,'' D'Amato,
who is facing re-election this year, said in a letter to Lott. ``In
this day and age, when people ably serve our country in so many
capacities without regard to sexual orientation, for the United
States Senate to deny an appointment on that basis is simply
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he believes Hormel is highly qualified for the job
and that a majority of senators support him, D'Amato wrote, ``I am
embarrassed that our Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, is
seen to be the force behind this injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who has supported gay rights in the past, is running
for a fourth term this year and is seeking endorsements from gay
groups. His letter comes four days after Lott said in a television
interview that he considered homosexuality a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Democrats and gay rights groups said D'Amato's letter
provided a much-needed push for the stalled nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very helpful,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who
has been a leading supporter of Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she believed that more than 60 senators support
Hormel, enough votes to overcome any effort to block the nomination
through a filibuster if it reaches the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's office did not return repeated phone calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with one of the groups that D'Amato is courting, Human
Rights Campaign, praised D'Amato's letter and said that he was very
much in the running for their endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Senator D'Amato's record on gay and lesbian issues has
been consistent and has been solid,'' said Winnie Stachelberg,
political director of Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest
lesbian and gay rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stachelberg said D'Amato had opposed efforts to deny federal
financing to organizations that serve homosexuals, and had been a
supporter of homosexuals serving in the military and a sponsor of
legislation to prohibit job discrimination against gay men and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   But officials with a New York gay rights group, Empire State
Pride Agenda, criticized D'Amato on Thursday for not doing enough
to pressure the Republicans who control the New York state Senate
to allow a floor vote on legislation that would prohibit
discrimination against homosexuals. The bill was still locked in
committee Thursday as the Legislature neared the end of this year's
session.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who is viewed as the leader of the state Republican
Party, called Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno last week to urge
him to allow a vote. But he did not lobby individual senators, said
Matt Foreman, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a way for him to demonstrate concretely that he
believes what he says about opposing discrimination, and he didn't
deliver,'' Foreman said. ``This failure certainly is going to have
a major impact on what our board decides to do in this race.''

COMMENTARY: PEDESTRIAN BARRICADES OUTLAST CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1972, Claus Reinisch had an idea for improving the
traffic flow in mid-Manhattan: confine pedestrians to one side of
the street when they are crossing major avenues. For example, they
would have to stick to the north side to get across southbound
Fifth Avenue. That way, he said, cars would have an easier time
turning into the avenue from side streets, and the backup of
crosstown traffic would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Reinisch, who used to be the district manager of Community Board
1 in Manhattan, sent his suggestion to Dry Dock Savings Bank. Dry
Dock, requiescat in pace, was soliciting thoughts on how to unclog
New York's boulevards, sclerotic even then. In February 1972, it
printed 11 proposals in a full-page advertisement in The New York
Times, and one of them was Reinisch's.
</P>
<P>
   If his idea rings a bell, it should. It is the very premise
underlying the ballyhooed pedestrian barriers that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani set up six months ago along 49th and 50th streets. Only
Reinisch thought of it 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Why mention this now? Certainly not to accuse the Police
Department's barricades guru, Chief Allan Hoehl, of stealing
someone else's brainchild. It is merely to keep the record straight
_ no small matter, given how the Giuliani administration wants
everyone to believe that before it came on the scene, City Hall was
an idea-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to puncture their balloon a little bit, and say,
`Hey, this idea was 25 years ahead of your time,''' said Reinisch,
who got a whopping $5 as a prize from Dry Dock. ``It wasn't even
such a brilliant idea. It's a normal thing to do in a dense midtown
area.''
</P>
<P>
   With the mayor backpedaling on his plan to banish sidewalk
vendors from many street corners, it seemed reasonable to check out
other pillars of his vaunted quality-of-life campaign. Might the
bugler be sounding retreat on the midtown barricades, too?
</P>
<P>
   It did not look like it Thursday. They were still there, all
right. So were the usual police officers standing guard, looking
bored and muttering off the record about their talents being
squandered.
</P>
<P>
   But the public outcry of half a year ago has been stilled. A
midtown building owner who sued Giuliani had his case thrown out
this week in state Supreme Court. Advocates for pedestrians have
all but raised the white flag. ``I hope the mayor's satisfied,''
said one of them, Charles Komanoff. ``Because nobody else is.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not entirely accurate. While many New Yorkers still feel
that the barricades were shoved down their throats by a zero-sum
mayor who loves above all to get his way, the police hierarchy
pronounces itself satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic is definitely moving better,'' thanks to the barriers,
said Inspector James McShane, executive officer of the Police
Department's Traffic Control Division. (``We call them
separators,'' he noted. ```Pedestrian facilitators' is even
better.'')
</P>
<P>
   Comparative police studies done in October and January, several
weeks after the, uh, facilitators were installed, found that the
average car speed along 49th Street had increased by 13 percent, to
6.2 mph, from 5.5. The increase was even bigger on 50th Street: 21
percent, to 5.8 mph, from 4.8.
</P>
<P>
   A separate police survey in the barrier area, which stretches
from Third Avenue to Avenue of the Americas, showed that it took
18.2 minutes to make a round trip, back and forth, along 47th and
48th streets. The time for 49th and 50th streets was only 12.7
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But McShane acknowledged that the police had not bothered to
examine how much time pedestrians lose zigzagging their way now
along the barricaded streets. That, you would think, is worth
knowing.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for more recent driving times. Traffic in January
tends to be relatively light, catching its breath after the
pre-Christmas frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have not been to midtown lately, traffic most days is as
congealed as a day-old lamb chop. Reinisch, for one, feels that
little has been done to crack down on the likes of double-parked
limos, tourist buses that sit forever in no-standing zones and
endless street fairs that back up traffic for blocks around.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another idea from the 1972 advertisement: to
restrict, and perhaps even ban, private cars from midtown. How much
has this administration done to block the ever-rising tide of autos
that enter Manhattan? ``Nothing,'' Reinisch replied. ``Absolutely
nothing.''

STEWART, PICTURE PERFECT, IN THE LEAD AT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GLF-ANDERSON-COLUMN) 
(mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a day when it was difficult to birdie any
holes, Payne Stewart did some special things Thursday in the first
round of the U.S. Open. He birdied the final three holes. He made
just one bogey on the picturesque but lethal Lake course at the
Olympic Club, a place that left many competitors complaining,
cursing and putting some strange numbers on their scorecards.
</P>
<P>
   So when the day had ended, Stewart was on top of his game and on
top of the leaderboard. Shooting a well-earned four-under-par 66,
Stewart held a one-stroke lead over the surprising Mark Carnevale.
Tom Lehman and Joe Durant were in a tie for third at 68, with some
golfers still on the course. Other prominent names like John Daly
(69) and Jasper Parnevik (69) lurked within contention.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open is more like a sprint than a marathon, so Stewart
had no plans to begin writing a victory speech. But for Stewart,
who has won two major championships, the 1989 PGA Championship and
the 1991 U.S. Open, Thursday's round was a pleasant reminder that
when at his best, Stewart can play with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a lot of fairways, I hit greens and I was very
patient,'' Stewart said. ``That's what you have to be at the U. S.
Open. There are basic fundamentals to this golf course. First of
all, get it in the fairway. And when you don't get it in the
fairway, don't be stupid. The worst thing you can do is to hit two
conseuctive balls in the fairway. Because if you do that, you're
going to make double-bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart spoke the truth. Some of the game's greatest players
were forced to struggle on some holes like weekend duffers. There
were big numbers all over the board, and some pre-tournament
favorites like David Duval (75), Ernie Els (75), and Davis Love
(78) were in danger of missing Friday's cut. Stewart's playing
partners, Curtis Strange (77) and Hale Irwin (80), both strugggled.
</P>
<P>
   The course played as tough as advertised, with the 6-inch deep
rough, narrow sloping fairways and small greens making every hole
difficult. Heaven forbid if the wind starts to blow this weekend,
because that will make the Olympic Club even more of a torture
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   For Stewart, playing steadily was a strong statement for someone
who has not won on the PGA Tour since the 1995 Shell Houston Open.
There have been times during the past two years when Stewart has
drawn more attention for his knickers than for his game, and it has
been frustrating for him not to play at the level he did during the
late 1980s and early '90s when he was one of the world's best. Yet,
at 42, Stewart has reached a time when his experience is an asset,
and he still has the ability to play at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was one of those days, and his finish was
extraordinary. Reaching the 16th tee at one-under par, Stewart
started his string of three consecutive birdies, a finish that may
not be equaled all week. At the par-5, 609-yard No. 16, Stewart hit
a 9-iron approach shot to within 8 feet, then made the putt. Then
Stewart went to the par-4, 468-yard No. 17, one of the toughest
holes in golf that is usually a par-5 for members. Stewart hit a
driver, then a 2-iron shot that stopped 45-feet in front of the
hole. Stewart lined up the long putt, hit it confidently and made
it. When the putt went in, Stewart shook his body as if he had been
electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he had been electrified, and he knew his round could
be special. ``That reminded me of Hazeltine,'' Stewart said,
referring to his victory at the 1991 U.S. Open. Then at 18, Stewart
closed his special round by making a 12-foot putt for birdie,
pumping his fist as the crowd roared. Stewart got a fortunate
break, because his tee shot landed in the rough, then his 8-iron
approach shot hit a ridge on the green, but bounced right instead
of bouncing left into more rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get breaks at the Open, you have to take advantage of
them,'' Stewart said. ``I did.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart's round was not a total shock, Carnevale's round
was. Carnevale played on the Nike Tour last year, and his best PGA
Tour finish this year is a tie for 41st place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I changed putters about a month and a half ago, and I gained
confidence,'' Carnevale said. ``I was a little nervous today, I
admit. You realize this is where the whole golf world's attention
is. I got a little edgy, but I stayed together.''
</P>
<P>
   Durant was the only player who reached five under par Thursday,
but then double-bogeyed No. 14. Danger lurked at every hole.
Olympic features a brutal start. No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 are ranked
the second, third and fourth hardest holes on the course
respectively. Get through that stretch, and you are still faced
with the rough and the tiny greens. And Thursday's pin placements
were difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Colin Montgomerie, who shot even par. ``I
couldn't see putting the pins in some of these positions. That's
why the scores are so high. There was not one pin that was a
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, Stewart could rest more easily than most. He
had one good day in the bank. And that was more than many others
could say.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Both Tommy Tolles (pulled lateral torso) and Dudley Hart (wrist
injury) withdrew. Tolles suffered his injury earlier in the week,
but he tried to play anyway. ``If it had been any other tournament,
I wouldn't have teed it up,'' said Tolles, who finished fifth at
last year's Open. ``I couldn't take a practice swing without
pain.'' &QL;

DALY SHOWS MATURITY BY NOT USING HIS DRIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Before John Daly teed off Thursday, he made an
important decision. He left his driver in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   For Daly, parting with his driver is like Sampson cutting off
his hair, like Popeye giving up spinach. However, conservative golf
is the best golf at the U.S. Open, even for Daly, perhaps the
game's longest hitter. And by replacing his driver with a 3-wood,
Daly showed a newfound maturity and shot himself into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting an opening-round 69, Daly was three strokes off the
lead, threatening to win the third major of his career. It was the
first time he had played a round at a major without his driver
since the 1993 PGA Championship at Inverness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, but it's challenging,'' Daly said. ``Whenever
I can't use my driver for 18 holes, it's not good for the fans. But
it's the only way to play this course, and I believe it's the only
way I have a chance to play really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who won the PGA Championship (1991) and the British Open
(1995), has come a long way since last year, when he withdrew from
the U.S. Open after nine holes with the shakes, just a month after
a stay in the Betty Ford clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking off at nine was not the smartest thing I could've
done,'' Daly said. ``It was a very difficult time. I'm proud I
didn't get mad or do something stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went in the Betty Ford, it was my second time in
rehab,'' he said. ``The first time, I didn't listen to anybody. I
didn't want to be there. This time, I'm allowing myself to go to
meetings and talk about it. The only way I'm going to stay sober is
to surround myself with those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Daly was steady, and while his drives were not
spectacular, he played precision golf instead of power golf,
keeping the bogeys and double bogeys off his card.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Daly teed off, there were omens that he might play
well. One of the main roads to the Olympic Club is named John Daly
Boulevard, and Daly City is the name of a town nearby. Daly has not
won this year, but he has two top 10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods Eight Back
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods shot a four-over-par 74, including one four-putt and
two three-putts. He was two under par after eight holes, but he
double-bogeyed the par-4 ninth with a four-putt, including a miss
from about three and a half feet. Woods also bogeyed Nos. 12, 13,
16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a lot of shots out there,'' said Woods, who only used
his driver three times. ``I hit the ball pretty well, but I didn't
make enough putts. I'm just trying to stay patient.''

HEMPSTEAD DRAWS TOP FILLY FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The best fillies in the East _ including last
year's champion and two arriving with five-race winning streaks _
will compete at Belmont Park Saturday in the Hempstead Handicap,
running a mile and one-sixteenth for a purse of $250,000 and a
major credential in the race for division honors.
</P>
<P>
   The champion is Ajina, the winner of the Breeders' Cup Distaff
last November and the Eclipse Award as the 3-year-old filly
champion. She will be the overnight favorite at 6-5 for her
trainer, Bill Mott, and her jockey, Mike Smith. But Ajina will have
to outrun Glitter Woman, trained by Shug McGaughey with Jerry
Bailey riding and a record that shouts. In 13 of her 15 starts,
Glitter Woman has run first or second.
</P>
<P>
   Ajina and Glitter Woman, who have each earned more than $1
million, should get a run for their money from the two fillies
coming into the Hempstead with the five-race winning streaks:
Colonial Minstrel, who has run in the money 12 times in 14 starts,
and Mossflower, a daughter of Affirmed, who has started just five
times but won them all. And everybody will be keeping an eye on the
two fillies who complete the field, Dixie Flag and Royal Indy, both
trained by Allen Jerkens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ajina and Glitter Woman will be the favorites, and deservedly
so,'' said Mark Hennig, the trainer of Colonial Minstrel. ``They've
accomplished more. But none of that matters. I haven't found one
horse yet that knows how to read the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very tough race on everybody. Somebody said
it's the best race for fillies and mares this season, and I
wouldn't argue with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mossflower will be running her first stakes race, and her
trainer, Richie Schosberg, sees nothing but class in her path.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is how it should be,'' Schosberg said. ``You have to
like Ajina because she ran a tremendous race last time out. Allen
Jerkens has two fillies that you have to respect for who they are
and because of Allen. Glitter Woman comes in on the heels of a good
race and warrants respect. And Mark's filly can't be ignored
because she has won five in a row, including the Shuvee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My filly,'' Schosberg concluded, ``is the unknown factor.''

   (NYT15) WASHINGTON -- June 18, 1998 -- RICHARDSON-PROFILE, 6-18
-- Bill Richardson, foreground, who was nominated to be secretary
of energy on Thursday by President Clinton, standing with the newly
appointed U.N. ambassador, Richard Holbrooke. In choosing
Richardson, the former U.N. ambassador, to be his new energy
secretary, Clinton has given him an assignment which traditionally
carries far less glamour and less opportunity for a high public
profile. But no one in the capital expects Richardson to recede
into relative obscurity. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT14) WASHINGTON -- June 18, 1998 -- HOLBROOKE-PROFILE, 6-18
-- Richard Holbrooke, left, being congratulated by President
Clinton, after being appointed as the chief representative for the
United States at the United Nations. At right, is Bill Richardson,
the former U.N. ambassador. Holbrooke, who negotiated the Bosnia
peace agreement in 1995, was effusively praised by the president at
the ceremony. ``His remarkable diplomacy in Bosnia helped to stop
the bloodshed, restored hope and saved lives,'' said Clinton. (Paul

their company, The Dyne Group, has its American office. ``We formed
our company in 1990, when China was starting to transform from a
planned to a market economy and was full of opportunity,'' says
Yan. (Elisabeth Rosenthal/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT12) UNDATED -- June 18, 1998 -- NELLY-PROFILE, 6-18 -- Nelly
Toll, who somehow created happy paintings amid the horrors of World
War II. Ms. Toll, who along with her mother spent much of the war
hiding from the Nazis in an apartment of a gentile couple in
Poland, painted 64 watercolors in the 13 months she and her mother
were in hiding. ``There is a duality to my approach to life, you
might say,'' Ms. Toll says. ``In my art I was able to separate. It
was my escape to a better world.'' Six of Ms. Toll's paintings will
be auctioned at Sotheby's next Friday. (Librado Romero/New York

``These meetings are terribly unpleasant,'' explains Elena
Vishnitsev, 31, while standing under umbrella in Moscow recently.
Ms. Vishnitsev has been searching for a husband for three years
through an Internet-based service which catalogs hundreds of young
women looking for husbands. She says that introductions via the
service, while safer, also can be degrading. ``You feel like you
are for sale at a slave market.'' (Charles W. Holmes/Cox News

Andrews. ``It's all very competitive.'' (Bernie Nunez/New York

SIDE-MAN-THEATER, 6-17 -- Michael Mayer, left, the director of
``Side Man,'' with its author, Warren Leight. The play, opening
Thursday at Stage Right at the Roundabout Theater Company, is a
memory play about jazz performers. ``For the last 20 years I've
been a writer-for-hire, basically,'' says Leight. In jazz, sideman
refers to a musician who works for hire on band jobs, knows the
standards by heart and solos but also blends in with an orchestra's

DISCO'S BACK, SO LET'S KILL IT QUICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This evil is insidious, like all the worst evils: vampires,
lobbyists, the bubonic plague. It moves with utmost stealth,
thrives on lack of vigilance. Relax for an eye's blink, and boom.
</P>
<P>
   Someone plays KC and the Sunshine Band.
</P>
<P>
   And then someone, some dude in a mood ring and platform shoes,
barks it aloud, that most nightmarish phrase: ``Hey, disco's
back!''
</P>
<P>
   No right-thinking American can allow this. We must stop disco
here, and we must stop disco now. For good. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   I say this because disco and the 1970s are in fact back, at
least partway. Which is horrid, in every way. Not as horrid as,
say, Denny Terrio, the ``Dance Fever'' guy, getting a new TV show,
but far more horrid than reruns of ``Charlie's Angels.'' &QL; 
THE DARKER DAYS OF DISCO &QL; 
Disco terror hit me early this week. First, I saw a movie with a
promising title _ ``the Last Days of Disco'' _ which I assumed
would be the inspirational tale of a serial killer stalking
bell-bottomed cokeheads at Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   And then, 12 hours later, I opened this very newspaper to a
feature story headlined ``Disco Relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Good metaphor: disease. Bad message: ``The halcyon days of disco
_ with all their attendant terrors _ are back.''
</P>
<P>
   The article named the usual culprits in the recycling of
cultural abominations: films, TV, music, fashion. It also had the
obligatory ``those were the days'' quote, supplied by director Mark
Christopher, whose upcoming ``54'' will chronicle that fabled disco
Sodom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an era of anything goes, and I think people today want
to see what it was like,'' he said. ``There was a sense of liberty,
of being able to really let go and get crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or get a social disease. Or get divorced. Or get addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, niceties like that, the real fallout from the 1970s,
get skipped by those rejoicing over hiphuggers, tube tops and Kool
and the Gang. We also don't hear much about that other legacy of
the Disco Age.
</P>
<P>
   The death of public trust.
</P>
<P>
   I am speaking of Richard Nixon and Watergate, of 1974 and his
plane out of D.C. Three Mile Island, the Bee Gees, polyester _
mercifully, those afflictions came and went. But nothing has
stitched the tear between politicians and people.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s brought us all that. Thus, the decade begs for
execution. Instead, its corpse keeps jumping up for one more chance
to do The Hustle. &QL; 
A MERCY KILLING
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic,'' 1987: ``Meanwhile, the hippest of the
twenty-something generation revel in a 1970s pop-culture revival.''
</P>
<P>
   1991, the ``New York Times'': ``Sick of '60s nostalgia? . . .
Perhaps then you will appreciate the next, and most improbable,
pop-culture comeback: The '70s, the disco decade.''
</P>
<P>
   1995, ``The Indianapolis Star'': ``Just when you thought they
were forever banished to the annals of bad taste, the '70s are back
in all their glitzy glory.''
</P>
<P>
   1996, the ``Cleveland Plain Dealer'': ``Disco, Bell-Bottoms,
Bradys Back As '70s Pop Culture Enjoys Revival.''
</P>
<P>
   1997, the ``Times'' again, where the editors still wear
puka-shell necklaces: ``Now disco is back, and so are the Village
People.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, this decade has been on the way back for so long, I can't
wait until it finally gets here. So we can jab a stake through its
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Or drown it in Billy Beer. Or coat it in Jovan Musk Oil for Men.
Whatever it takes to kill the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   It would be euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Face the facts. The only thing right in the '70s was the
catchphrase: Disco sucks.
</P>
<P>
   Did then, does now. Just like pointy collars, shag haircuts,
``Barnaby Jones,'' Atari, oil embargoes, Kiss singing ``I Was Made
For Lovin' You'' and pet rocks.
</P>
<P>
   KC, Your Boogie Man, must've tripped on his Boogie Shoes and
smacked his head while (Shake, Shake, Shake) Shaking His Booty
because he was so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way, nuh-uh, nuh-uh, I like it. Nuh-uh, nuh-uh. &QL;

IT'S A SPRINT TO FINISH AND TO THE NEXT EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It has all happened so fast for Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 months ago, after time out for basketball and broken
legs, she started competing again in track and field. Two months
later, she won national championships in the 100-meter dash and the
long jump. Two months after that, she won those events in the world
championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the U.S championships Friday through Sunday, she is
favored to win three titles _ the 100 and 200 meters and the long
jump. That Jesse Owens-Carl Lewis type of triple was last
accomplished in the women's competition by Stella Walsh in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   If that triple seems like heady stuff for Jones, think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing all those events,'' the 21-year-old said
Thursday, ``because it's a challenge. It keeps it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps it scary because the three rounds of the 100, the
three rounds of the 200 and the long jump are crammed into three
days. Saturday can be especially hazardous, with the 100 final at 7
p.m., Eastern time; the long jump at 8 and the 200 quarterfinals at
8:50.
</P>
<P>
   Jones respects her opponents too much to predict a sweep, but a
surprise is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a star from the time she entered her teens, and in
1992 she made the U.S. Olympic team as a relay alternate. But her
mother thought it was too much too soon for a 15-year-old, so the
daughter stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina won the battle of college recruiters by allowing
her to double in track and basketball. She became the fastest point
guard alive, but in the summer of 1995 she broke her left foot
playing basketball and in January 1996 she broke it again doing a
long-jump drill on a trampoline. She missed the 1996 track season,
watching the Olympics from the same place as in 1992 _ in front of
a television set. She finished her senior year of basketball, then
had to make a choice.

   ``I had to decide then what to do with my life,'' she said,
``play basketball or run track. I chose track.''

   This year, she is the world leader in the 100 meters (10.71
seconds), the 200 (21.94 seconds) and the long jump (23 feet 11 3/4
inches). The respective world records for those events are 10.49
and 21.34 seconds, both by Florence Griffith Joyner of the United
States, and 24 feet 8 1/4 inches by Galina Chistyakova of the
Soviet Union. All three records were set in 1988.

NAVY YARD RESERVES SITE FOR PROPOSED FILM STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amid a surging demand to produce films in New York
City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration has promised a pair
of young entrepreneurs a lease to build a major Hollywood-style
movie studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard _ provided they can obtain
$190 million in financing by December.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, the most ambitious of several proposals for new sound
stages and film studios in the city, represents a gambit by two
little-known players in an industry defined by fast fame and
fortune. If they succeed in attracting the financing, they would be
granted a 70-year lease on 15 acres of the Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The site is among the city's most famous pieces of industrial
real estate, since it includes the cavernous shipbuilding structure
that produced the U.S.S. Missouri and other warships during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   In place of that building, and over a concrete foundation built
for wartime demands, would be a vast new studio providing the core
of what the project's sponsors call a ``production mall.'' It would
contain 11 sound stages, including one of the largest in the movie
industry, movable sets, sophisticated lighting and other equipment
available to movie and television producers on a pay-as-you-go
basis.
</P>
<P>
   No government incentives are being offered beyond those that
would be granted any industrial concern taking space in the city.
And entertainment industry executives said the plan could be
undermined by the relative inexperience of the partners, or by a
tendency of some producers to regard Brooklyn as a tawdry stepchild
to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Navy Yard proposal resonates with an odd blend of New
York City history, entrepreneurial drive, the promise of an
industrial renaissance and an unlikely alignment of forces on Wall
Street and at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the project's chief financial adviser is J.P.
Morgan, where investment bankers who specialize in media and
entertainment have been approaching corporate finance and Hollywood
executives to cover the anticipated $190 million in development
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how all the other issues go away when people
focus on the Navy Yard and what it could provide for film
production,'' said James Rutherford, a managing director in J.P.
Morgan's investment banking department. He said discussions were
under way with two major Hollywood studios, several television
executives, banks and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advantages of the Navy Yard, he said, is the sheer
availability of space, its ready access to major highways, its
isolation from residential areas and its proximity to the hotels
and other amenities of Manhattan. He said he expected financing for
the project to be in place by September. If so, construction could
begin by early next year, and the first production could start a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   For many producers, the key advantage of having a full-service
studio in New York would be that it would eliminate the need to
travel back and forth between California sound stages and
production sites in the East.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a field of dreams,'' said Rudy Washington, the deputy
mayor for community development and business services, and chairman
of Brooklyn Navy Yard Corp., an agency controlled by the city that
has discretion to extend a lease for the movie studio without a
need for other city approvals. ``What gets me excited is to see the
entrepreneurial juices flowing, and to see it happening in
Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the Navy Yard proposal, who would control what
they are calling simply New York Studios Inc., are Louis Madigan, a
jocular, 30-year-old computer consultant and Internet whiz, and
Cary Dean Hart, 35, a movie-set designer.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said they approached J.P. Morgan and the Navy Yard's
directors with their idea a year ago, and in March were given the
conditional promise of a 70-year lease. If financing is obtained
and the studio built, their payments would be $16,250 a month, an
amount that would triple after five years of operation.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Madigan nor Hart brings the credentials that would
assure them a good seat at a Hollywood restaurant, both have
personal and professional connections to the Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan, a stalwart in New York City's burgeoning new-media
industry, is a Brooklyn native and the grandson of a Navy engine
mechanic who, with the rest of his World War II crew, received a
presidential citation for work in the Navy Yard on the U.S.S.
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say New York Studios was the idea of Hart, whose set
design company, Delphi Studios, set up shop in a Navy Yard
warehouse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me immediately that the Navy Yard already looks and
feels like a film production lot,'' he said the other day at the
site of the proposed studio, from which the 260-acre Navy Yard
spreads out like a small, forlorn industrial city. On the shore of
the East River between the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges, it
commands unbroken views from the World Trade Center to the Empire
State Building.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy Yard plan is far from the only studio production
venture being promoted at a time when demand for existing studios
and sound stages has never been more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman Astoria Studios, the city's largest production complex,
with six sound stages dedicated in recent years to television
series, is known to be planning an expansion on its site in Queens.
``We should have an announcement within about three months,'' said
Jane Bartnett, a spokeswoman for Kaufman Astoria's owners.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, several developers, producers and television
networks are considering Hudson River piers, Donald Trump's
Riverside South project and other new commercial developments as
potential sites for studios.
</P>
<P>
   But entertainment industry executives said most, if not all, of
the other proposals are for studios that would be dedicated to
television, while the far larger studio envisioned at the Navy Yard
would also be suitable for movie production.

EDITORIAL: REFORMERS SCARE THE SPEAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies did all they could
this week to bury campaign finance reform. But after two days of
skirmishing, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut extracted a
promise from Republican leaders Thursday to vote on the
Shays-Meehan bill to outlaw ``soft money'' before the end of
summer. That promise strengthens the chance of reform and also
challenges Republicans from the metropolitan area to get on board.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample reason to be skeptical of any offer from the
speaker. To sabotage a debate in March, Gingrich tried to foist a
phony bill on the House. He later spoke of a vote in May, and now
he is talking July. It all adds up to a speaker on the run,
improvising to forestall the inevitable. The handshake Thursday
between Shays and Dick Armey, the majority leader, amounts to the
first firm promise of an actual vote.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is mounting, moreover, that the Shays-Meehan
legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts,
is picking up steam. This page had urged that supporters of
Shays-Meehan, which would ban unlimited contributions to parties by
corporations, unions and rich donors, reject a separate bill
calling for a study commission. The fear was that the commission
might pass by a small margin, and that the Shays-Meehan bill would
have to pass by an even bigger margin to become law. On Wednesday
night the commission was actually defeated, 201-156, sending a
thunderbolt into Gingrich's office.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker then began to worry that enough Republicans might
defect and join with the Democrats to reject a special rule
governing the debate, which would have allowed for the
death-by-amendment scheme. If the rule had gone down to defeat, the
speaker would effectively have lost control of his own House.
Democrats were angry that Shays agreed to support the rule in
return for Armey's promise to schedule a vote. But this is a game
that requires some gambles.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the commission measure suggested that there are 30
to 50 moderate Republicans ready to declare their independence from
the leadership and join with perhaps 190 Democrats to put the
measure over the top this summer. It would then have to go back to
the Senate, where a clear majority are also on record as favoring
reform but saw it killed last year because of a filibuster under
the direction of Trent Lott, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   We remain convinced that if the Shays-Meehan bill passes this
summer and goes back to the Senate, Lott will not be able to
control his members and make them dance to the tune of jangling
cash registers. There will, we predict, be enough Republicans in
the Senate as the election approaches to break the filibuster and
pass reform. It is anything but a sure thing, but this is no time
to give up. &QL;

AT RALLY, HOSPITAL WORKERS VOW TO STRIKE TO PROTECT JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About 13,000 members of the largest union
representing New York City hospital workers rallied along Broadway
in midtown Manhattan on Thursday afternoon, vowing to strike if 35
private hospitals do not offer them a satisfactory new contract by
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering in Central Park and marching down Broadway to an
elaborate soundstage erected in front of the Crowne Plaza Hotel on
48th Street _ the site of negotiations between the hospitals and
the union _ leaders of the march threatened a walkout by 50,000
workers in 35 hospitals if the hospitals do not accede to their
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will it be on July 1st _ contract or strike?'' Dennis
Rivera, president of 1199, the National Health and Human Service
Employees Union, asked to roars from the crowd. ``They have a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce McIver, the private hospitals' chief negotiator, said he
thought the negotiations were close to a resolution. ``From my
point of view, the demonstrations and strike notices are just a
distraction,'' McIver said. ``What we ought to do is pay attention
to the bargaining and make sure we reach a contract before the
expiration of this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been negotiating in the hotel for the last
two weeks. They held talks Thursday morning, suspended them during
the demonstration and resumed them Thursday evening. The two sides
are at odds over job security, a pay increase and potential
layoffs, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the city's hospitals are underused and
have estimated that a staff reduction of more than 15 percent will
be needed in the next three to seven years. Union officials say
those estimates are exaggerated, and insist that through early
retirements, attrition and other means, large-scale layoffs can by
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, which organizers said 22,000 people attended,
snarled traffic in midtown for several hours as police blocked off
at least 10 blocks of Broadway beginning at 3 p.m. But the
demonstrators, who assembled in Central Park at 3 p.m., did not
start marching down Broadway until after 5 p.m.

LAWN-MOWER JOCKEY TRIUMPHS IN RACE _ WINS VASECTOMY

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Randy Hinkle won the contest Thursday, but it's the
doctor who will make the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle's victory in the Father's Day lawmower-riding contest
will ensure he will never be a father again.
</P>
<P>
   The grand prize was a vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The losers were fit to be tied. The winner will be.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle was a virile competitor, nearly tipping his 15-horsepower
John Deere mower as he rounded the final turn, sputtering towards
the finish line at the course set up at Los Arcos Mall in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Michelle, 22, and 17-day-old daughter Emma cheered him
from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Other men watching the festivities would have raced to avoid a
vasectomy. But Hinkle, 42, was eager to claim the prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to spoil this one,'' he said, gazing at his
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle bested two opponents, Jesse Mason and Chris Carlile, to
win his date with the doctor. The losers got KSLX-FM T-shirts as
consolation prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The classic-rock radio station, is springing for five
vasectomies this week. It's an idea hatched by morning radio
personality Joey ``T'' Teehan.
</P>
<P>
   Each day this week, the station is hosting a lawn mower contest,
buying the winner a vasectomy in honor of Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Other men wanted to race the riding mowers. But they turned pale
and slinked back into the crowd after hearing the V-word.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Guttierrez of Gilbert turned down a shot at the grand
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it the way it is,'' he said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   Evidence keeps mounting that the Chinese army is exploiting
flawed American export controls to acquire sophisticated satellite
communications technology for military and intelligence use. The
Pentagon and State Department are now questioning the pending sale
of a Hughes communications satellite whose upgraded design would
let Chinese authorities eavesdrop on mobile telephone conversations
at home and abroad. President Clinton should suspend this sale and
the licensing of any more satellite deals with China until export
control rules are tightened. In particular, he needs to put the
State and Defense departments back in charge of export approvals
and diminish the role of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Communications satellites must be carefully watched because they
have both military and civilian uses. Satellites for civilian
mobile telephones can be used by China's army to communicate with
remote field units. When equipped with powerful antennas and
computers, they can spy on other countries' communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, with China's own communications satellites
wearing out, military leaders set out to find foreign-built
replacements. The Clinton administration initially approved the
Hughes sale, it now says, after being advised that the Chinese
could purchase similar communications technology from European
sources. But since that approval, the project has been modified by
adding a more powerful antenna. It is not clear that China could
obtain comparable equipment from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have suggested that the administration loosened the
rules on satellite sales because of large campaign contributions to
the Democratic Party from the American aerospace industry and, it
appears, Chinese military officials. In late 1996, the same year
Clinton initially approved the Hughes satellite, he granted the
aerospace industry a change in export licensing procedures.
Satellite licensing authority was shifted from the State and
Defense departments, whose concern is national security, to the
Commerce department, which promotes business deals.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country like China, where aerospace and communications
companies have close links to the army and government, these deals
are rarely purely commercial. Clinton should work with Congress and
the intelligence agencies to evaluate any damage done and develop a
sounder policy. &QL;

   MONTREAL _ Montreal Manager Felipe Alou not only is Mel Rojas'
uncle, but also used to be his manager. That was when Rojas was at
his best as a reliever, from 1994-96. Now, Rojas, 31, is struggling
in his role as the Mets' setup man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has thrown so many splitters over the years,'' Alou said,
``that his fastball is not as fast anymore, and he doesn't have
command of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rojas had picked up the loss in Wednesday night's 5-4
victory over the Expos, the right-handed pitcher said one of the
reasons he has struggled this year against right-handed hitters is
because he throws so many more fastballs to them than to
left-handed hitters, against whom his main weapon is his
split-finger fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers are batting .391 this season against Rojas,
left-handers .192.

   L. Edwin Smart, 74, Former TWA Chairman
</P>
<P>
   L. Edwin Smart, a former chairman and chief executive of Trans
World Airlines, died June 1 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
in New York. He was 74 and lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart disease, said Jeanie Smart, his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Smart became chairman and chief executive of TWA in 1977 and was
named chairman and chief executive of Transworld Corp., a holding
company formed when the airline was restructured in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Transworld bought Spartan Food Systems, the largest
franchisee of Hardee's restaurants, and Century 21 Real Estate
Corp., the real estate brokerage chain.
</P>
<P>
   The conglomerate spun off TWA in 1983, after defeating a
takeover bid by Texas International Airlines, which was led by
Frank Lorenzo. TWA was eventually purchased by Carl Icahn in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Smart sold Transworld's hotel division in 1986, and liquidated
most of the assets to avoid an acquisition by Ronald Perelman, the
takeover investor and chairman of Revlon Inc. The resulting
company, called TW Services, was devoted to the food services
industry. Smart left in April 1987. In 1989, TW Services was
acquired by Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Edwin Smart graduated from Harvard University in 1947, and
Harvard Law School in 1949, both with magna cum laude degrees. He
joined Hughes, Hubbard &AMP; Reed (then Hughes, Hubbard &AMP; Ewing) that
year, and became a partner in 1957. During his tenure at the firm,
one of his major clients was Bendix Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Smart was named president of the international division
of Bendix, a position he held until he joined TWA as an executive
vice president in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Smart is survived by a daughter,
Cynthia S., of San Antonio; two sons, Dana G., of Long Beach,
Calif., and Douglas E., of Madison, Conn., and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest H. Kirkpatrick, Consultant, 92
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Hunter Kirkpatrick, a retired educator, corporate
executive and management consultant on personnel administration and
industrial relations, died May 31 at the Ohio Valley Medical Center
in Wheeling, W.Va. He was 92 and lived in Wheeling.
</P>
<P>
   He had long associations with Bethany College in West Virginia
and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. In the 1940s, on a leave of
absence from the college, he organized a personnel administration
program for Radio Corp. of America and then served RCA as an
educational consultant until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Bethany College in 1927 and earned a master's
degree at Columbia University in 1931. He was a professor and dean
at Bethany from 1927 to 1940 and again from 1946 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he was named assistant to the chairman at what was then
Wheeling Steel. He retired from the company as a vice president and
secretary in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he served as a consultant to various federal
departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He left no immediate survivors.

   NEW YORK _ Bowing to pressure from federal prosecutors, the New
York City Police Department has agreed to overhaul its system for
investigating sexual harassment complaints and
gender-discrimination charges within the department.
</P>
<P>
   The policy changes came as part of a settlement, announced
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, of a lawsuit the
government filed against the department. The department has also
agreed to strengthen its policy against displaying pornographic
materials in station houses, to increase the staffing of its Office
of Equal Opportunity Employment to 30 investigators, from 20, and
to start mandatory programs to teach all 38,000 officers and
commanders procedures for preventing and reporting sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office sought the stricter standards two
years ago, after a former police officer filed a lawsuit alleging
that her commanders at the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst, Queens, had
ignored complaints that male officers routinely watched
pornographic movies in the lounge of the station house and posted
photographs of naked women on the station's walls.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the officer's charges, Mary Jo White, the U.S
attorney for the Southern District, also sued the department,
saying that tougher standards and more vigilant enforcement were
needed to protect female police employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was the first of its kind to be filed by the
government against a city police department, and Ms. White said
Thursday that the settlement, which allows the U.S. attorney to
review all of the department's harassment investigations, was an
encouraging sign that police commanders might improve their efforts
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in bringing this lawsuit was to insure that all
employees within the New York City Police Department are free to do
their jobs without fear of sexual harassment from other members of
the department,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Zoland, the police lawyer who negotiated the settlement,
said the lengthy court battle helped police commanders improve
their policies by viewing their anti-harassment measures from an
outside perspective. Ms. Zoland said the pact would ultimately make
the department more active in preventing workplace harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the investigations were done poorly before, but
they weren't done uniformly,'' Ms. Zoland said. ``This agreement
will help improve the quality of life for female members of the
Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The police officer who filed the original complaint, Sheryll
Goff, was awarded a $320,000 settlement by the city last summer,
after the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found
there was ``reasonable cause to believe'' her complaints that
commanders had made little effort to stop the repeated display of
pornography in the precinct work areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goff's complaint also charged that a supervisor once
humiliated her in front of other officers by suggesting she have a
bulletproof vest specially designed to accommodate her breasts. Ms.
Goff, who no longer works for the department, has an unlisted
telephone number and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police policy already forbids officers to display inappropriate
material in department buildings, but under the guidelines adopted
Thursday, the desk commanders in each precinct must now inspect
their buildings at the start of each shift and immediately
confiscate any pornography. Police officials also agreed to add new
sections to the department's patrol guide that strengthen the
requirements to report any harassment and to include a new section
in supervisors' performance evaluations that grades their
sensitivity to harassment complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But neither federal officials nor police commanders would
discuss how the settlement would affect another recent sexual
harassment case in the Police Department. In that case, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir overruled the recommendation of his
commissioner for Equal Employment Opportunity that a high-level
commander be disciplined for failing to respond properly to a
female officer's harassment charges.

EDITORIAL: THE DIPLOMATIC SHUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke is living proof that you do not have to win
friends to influence people. The most undiplomatic of diplomats, he
is nevertheless persuasive enough to be a good choice for the post
of Washington's representative to the United Nations. The man he
replaces, Bill Richardson, is his stylistic opposite, an
Olympic-class schmoozer. He, in turn, knows Washington and the
relevant issues well enough to make a solid energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few things these two men share is friendship with Al
Gore and a fervent and not entirely disinterested desire to see him
president. Richardson, conscious that voters do not always reward
foreign policy expertise, has talked about running for governor or
senator in his home state of New Mexico, and some reports have Gore
eyeing him as a possible running mate. The post of energy secretary
will give him cabinet-level experience in a domestic issue, one of
particular importance to New Mexico, home of the Los Alamos and
Sandia nuclear laboratories. But he will lose political stature if
he uses the post to promote pork projects for his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, his best qualification for the job is his
international experience. As a congressman and at the Unite
Nations, Richardson served as the administration's ``undersecretary
for thugs,'' as he puts it, as emergency envoy to places like North
Korea and Iraq. These trips will be good background for a job that
now includes dealing with such foreign issues as nuclear testing
and oil pipelines in the Caspian region. His confirmation should
move smoothly, provided his explanation of his job-interview
meeting with Monica Lewinsky holds up.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the rivalry between Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Holbrooke, who nearly had her job. It is
true that Holbrooke has a reputation as a difficult man who
sometimes verges on self-parody. But he is also seriously concerned
about the moral dimensions of foreign policy and the use of
American influence. He will be a valuable ally for Albright in
administration discussions and help her counter the Pentagon, which
has drawn President Clinton into bad decisions on such issues as
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke will not charm his U.N. colleagues. Indeed, many U.N.
officials who worked with him when he successfully led the Bosnian
peace negotiations were put off by what they _ and numerous others
_ perceived as his arrogance. But head-cracking has served him, and
American interests, well in the past. &QL;

CARDINAL JOHN CARBERRY, 93, OF ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ohio, Ind.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinal John Joseph Carberry, who was a canon lawyer active in
the Roman Catholic Church's affairs and who led the Archdiocese of
St. Louis for 11 years, died on Wednesday at St. Agnes Home in
Kirkwood, Mo. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry was installed in 1968 by Pope Paul VI as archbishop of
St. Louis, the spiritual leader of more than 500,000 Roman
Catholics. He succeeded the late Cardinal Joseph Ritter and, like
him, made civil rights a central issue in his tenure. Carberry was
also a leading national figure in ecumenism with the Protestant
churches. He was named archbishop emeritus in 1979 at 75, the
retirement age set by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry was considered more theologically conservative than his
predecessor as archbishop and was chosen with particular care by
the Vatican in light of an initiative by a group of diocesan
priests and laymen who wrote a program in 1965 that questioned
traditional doctrines and practices.
</P>
<P>
   The pope elevated him to cardinal in 1969, when he was the
bishop of Columbus, Ohio, as someone likely to maintain discipline
among the rank and file and diocesan laity. In fact, he became
known in St. Louis as the creator of the Archdiocesan Pro-Life
Commission, a model for anti-abortion groups in church
jurisdictions around the United States. It was also noted that his
administration left the archdiocese in sound financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   He was respected for his careful, scholarly preparation for
meetings. He took part in all four sessions of the Vatican Council
convened by Pope Paul XXIII and missed only a day and a half as the
council sessions stretched from 1962 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry sat in the two conclaves of 1978 that elected Pope John
Paul I and, after his sudden death, John Paul II, the first
non-Italian pontiff since 1523.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Carberry began to study for the
priesthood at 15 at Cathedral College Seminary in Brooklyn. He was
ordained a priest of the Diocese of Brooklyn at the North American
College in Rome in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States, Carberry received a doctorate in
canon law at Catholic University of America in 1934, was secretary
to the bishop of Trenton, N.J., and returned to Brooklyn in 1940 to
teach at the diocesan seminary. Pope Pius XII named him bishop of
Lafayette, Ind., in 1957, and Pope Paul named him bishop of
Columbus in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected vice president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in 1974 and was a U.S. delegate to the World Synod
of Bishops in 1972, 1974 and 1976. He was a past chairman of the
Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, he remained active in church life and community
affairs in St. Louis until he suffered a stroke in 1988.

`FILES' MAKERS HOPE THEY HAVE `X' FACTOR FOR BIG-SCREEN SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: ``Today'' in story refers to Friday, June 19.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California and ``e'' entertainment
news files.) 
BY MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Their foray into the realm of motion pictures could
be the biggest expedition into alien territory yet for Scully and
Mulder, the two sullen heroes of Fox Television's eerie action
drama, ``The X-Files.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet in their silver-screen debut _ a $70 million, two-hour
action-packed adventure that opens today _ Scully and Mulder are
not traveling to a land where no man has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The X-Files'' movie is just the latest in a very long
list of television shows turned motion pictures _ including the
long-running ``Star Trek'' series _ it is different from its
predecessors in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' is still in its first run on prime-time
television. ``The X-Files'' movie features the same actors and
actresses 20 million to 30 million viewers tune to Fox each Sunday
night to see. The movie is not a remake from the '50s, '60s or
'70s. And it's not animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's most unusual, especially in current times,'' said Tom
Borys, chief operating officer of ACNielsen EDI, a market research
firm that does overnight box-office tracking for the motion-picture
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very interesting. A lot of people will be looking
at this. I think it will be imitated a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That interest is in large part based on the profitability of
adapting popular television shows into feature films, according to
Borys.
</P>
<P>
   According to ACNielsen EDI research, the average gross for
movies made from television shows this decade is $60.6 million. The
average for all other films in wide release is $35.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks to why they do it. They already have the built-in
identification and a track record,'' Borys said. ``But that is by
no means a guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Batman'' grossed $251.2 million at the box office. ``Batman
Forever,'' ``The Fugitive,'' and ``Mission: Impossible'' all
grossed in excess of $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batman Returns,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' ``The
Flintstones,'' ``Wayne's World,'' ``Addams Family Values,'' ``Star
Trek IV,'' ``George of the Jungle,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Maverick,''
and ``Casper'' each also brought in more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Davis, who directed ``The Fugitive,'' which shot to No. 1
on the box office list upon its release in August 1993, said the
story sold more tickets to his movie than fan allegiance to the
1960s TV series. But he did not see anything wrong with dipping
into the TV well for movie ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's worthwhile material, it doesn't bother me,'' he said
when his movie debuted.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``The X-Files'' series attracts 20 million to 30 million
viewers each week, ``X-Files'' creator and now film producer and
screenwriter Chris Carter is hopeful ``The X-Files'' movie can do
at least that well.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there's no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``X'' fans beseeching each other on Internet chat
sessions to give the movie a boost and spur sequels by seeing the
movie again and again, Carter said making the film was a scary
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were risks inherent in taking it to the big screen,''
Carter said. ``But (Fox) saw the beauty of making the movie. They
were a little afraid the movie would be the end of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to convince them it wasn't going to be. That it would be
a really good way to invigorate the series and to make a great
movie, too,'' Carter said. ``I didn't want this to be seen as an
exploitation. I wanted it to be seen as a celebration of the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   If the celebration turns out to be profitable, the possibilities
for television producers who want to make movies is nearly endless,
Borys said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a trend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter agreed. ``Anybody could do it. `ER' could do it. `NYPD
Blue' could do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that we did, and we had good reason to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Borys doesn't think just anyone can do it. Sitcoms couldn't
make the translation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do need to have the right kind of show to translate to the
big screen. ``X-Files is a good one that does translate. The
concept stands on its own as a film kind of idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt we're going to see `Friends: The Movie.' But `ER'
could probably do it. That makes perfect sense to me and I'm not
even a producer,'' Borys said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Borys, there are already other conversions in the
works, including a ``South Park'' movie and a new ``Beavis and
Butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's still a lot of other old TV shows out there to be
mined.''

2ND GIRL RAPED IN LIBRARY, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time in little more than a month, a girl was
raped in the main branch of Newark's public library, police and
library officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a 16-year-old girl who was a regular patron of the
library on Washington Street was attacked amid stacks of fiction
books on the second floor of the four-story building after a man
asked her to help him find material for a book report, said
Detective Rocco Malanga of the Newark Police Department. The
attacker was described as a light-skinned Hispanic man with
red-streaked brown hair and brown eyes, Malanga said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attack came just five weeks after a 15-year-old girl
told police she had been raped in a second-floor restroom by a man
who threatened to kill her if she screamed for help, Malanga said.
Three days after that rape, which occurred on May 13, police
arrested Jason Yantin, 18, of Newark, and charged him with
aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, including Mayor Sharpe James, were shocked that
the assaults had occurred inside the library, which is more than
100 years old and adorned with murals of Apollo and the Muses.
James called the rapes ``dastardly acts,'' and demanded that Dr.
Alex Boyd, the library's executive director, increase security in
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said that library officials had already closed the
second-floor restrooms in response to the first rape and had forced
patrons to ask for a key to those on the first floor, which can now
be used by only one person at a time. He said officials increased
the number of security guards in the library Thursday to five from
three, and planned to install 10 to 15 security cameras.

MELVIN BARNET, 83, TIMES EDITOR DISMISSED AFTER TAKING THE FIFTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Melvin Barnet, who was among several editors and
reporters questioned by a congressional committee investigating
communist affiliations in the news business in the 1950s and who
was dismissed by The New York Times after invoking the Fifth
Amendment, died June 17 at Long Island College Hospital in
Brooklyn. He was 83 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, 1955, Barnet responded to the questions of Sen.
James Eastland, D-Miss., chairman of the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee, by declaring: ``Since February or March of 1942, sir,
I have not been a communist. At the time prior to that I assert my
privilege under the Fifth Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee had been looking into disclosures made by
Winston Burdett, a CBS correspondent who said he had joined the
Communist Party in the late 1930s while working at The Brooklyn
Eagle. As the opening witness in the subcommittee hearings, Burdett
named 12 former colleagues at The Eagle, including Barnet, as party
members.
</P>
<P>
   When, two weeks later, Barnet, a Harvard graduate and an Army
veteran of World War II, was asked about these and other names, he
repeated his refusal to comment, citing the constitutional
protection against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In that period, characterized by fears of Soviet espionage and
communist-hunting by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., such responses
were at times offered by witnesses who believed it dishonorable to
name old colleagues and implicate them in their own troubles.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his testimony, Barnet, who had been a copy
editor on the city desk for two years, was notified of his
dismissal by The Times in a letter made public by its publisher,
Arthur Hays Sulzberger. The letter noted: ``The course of conduct
which you have followed since your name was first mentioned in this
connection culminating in your action today has caused The Times to
lose confidence in you as a member of its news staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven employees of the news department were called before the
Eastland subcommittee; six provided accounts of their communist
backgrounds to the editors of The Times, and remained in their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Barnet was the only one of the seven to invoke the Fifth
Amendment, Turner Catledge, then the managing editor, wrote later
that this was not the reason for his firing. He was dismissed,
Catledge said, because he had failed to ``cooperate with us in
protecting the integrity of The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial on Jan. 5, 1956, six months after Barnet's
appearance before the subcommittee and dismissal, The Times
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of those employees who have testified to some
communist association in the past, or who have pleaded the Fifth
Amendment for reasons of their own, it will be our policy to judge
each case on its own merits, in the light of each individual's
responsibilities in our organization and of the degree to which his
relations with this newspaper entitle him to possess our
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   After he was fired, Barnet had difficulty finding work. He
picked oranges in Florida, served as cook on a shrimp boat and
edited manuscripts for vanity presses before joining The Medical
Tribune, a journal distributed to doctors, in the 1960s. He was
associate editor when he retired in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joan; a son, Michael Cross-Barnet of
Santa Monica, Calif.; a brother, Stuart, and a sister, Beverly
Morrison, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: VIGILANTISM AND MEGAN'S LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   The incident in New Jersey in which five gunshots were fired
into the house of a sex offender shows how vulnerable these
individuals are to vigilante actions. New Jersey Attorney General
Peter Verniero has vowed to prosecute the unknown shooters and is
directing local authorities to increase community education efforts
to prevent vigilantism, but such measures do not correct the
problem inherent in the state's sex-offender notification law.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 states, including New York, have statutes requiring
public notification when a sex offender is released into a
community. These ``Megan's Laws'' typically provide information
such as names, pictures and addresses of sex offenders so that
parents and teachers can keep on eye out for potential danger. But
releasing such information also makes it possible for vigilantes to
track down offenders who have served their time and are living
peaceably. The authorities have limited ability to protect these
individuals from violence.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's law provides notification to community groups,
schools and even whole neighborhoods. The information inevitably
spreads far beyond the neighborhood, and the broader the
dissemination, the greater the risk of trouble. In 1995, two men
broke into a house and beat a New Jersey man whom they mistakenly
thought was a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   In the shooting case, the offender, Frank Penna, was convicted
of kidnapping and rape in 1976. He has been out on parole since
1992. Under the New Jersey law, offenders who have been out of
prison for up to 15 years are still subject to community
notification requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Penna's neighbors had no reason to believe him a danger until
they were notified of his criminal record two weeks ago. The threat
he poses to the community is theoretical. But the bullets
apparently meant for him were very real. They could easily have
injured or killed his neighbors. That irony should not be lost on
those who think notification promotes public safety without also
exacting a cost.

<P>
   Boeing's annual look 20 years into the future shows that
Asia-Pacific airlines will buy 4,760 new commercial jets, worth
$427 billion. That's compared with $332 billion worth of aircraft
from North America and $345 billion in Europe. China alone is
expected to buy 1,800 new aircraft worth $125 billion over the next
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the economic issues going on in Asia are short term
and will be contained within Asia,'' Bruce Dennis said Thursday in
releasing Boeing's 1998 Current Market Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   He said several Asian airlines have requested help from Boeing
in financing new airplane orders and some have postponed taking
delivery of their new jets because they can't afford them.
</P>
<P>
   While Dennis said no Asian airlines have canceled orders so far,
he noted: ``There are a couple of airlines out there that are on
the ropes, so stay tuned.'' He declined to identify those airlines.
</P>
<P>
   He said some Asian economies will fall into a recession in the
next 12 to 18 months, though historical growth trends will return
in four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Boeing expects the commercial jet airplane fleet of
2017 to have 26,200 airplanes, with airlines buying 17,650 new
jets, worth $1.25 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   That includes replacement aircraft and new planes to accommodate
expected average worldwide travel growth of 4.9 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Boeing and Airbus will be fighting out over the
next 20 years,'' Dennis said in a conference call from New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Asian carriers likely will buy 150 fewer airplanes _
90 from Boeing and 60 from rival Airbus Industrie _ over the next
five years because of slower growth in the current downturn. He
based his prediction on the assumption that Boeing will retain its
traditional 60 percent of the worldwide jetliner market.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty of the Boeing deliveries to be affected will be widebody
aircraft such as the 747 jumbo jet, the 767 and the 777, all of
which are built in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the reduced demand for widebodies, Boeing recently
announced it will lower monthly production of its largest model,
the jumbo 747, to 3.5 in mid-1999 from five currently.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delayed publishing its annual forecast for more than two
months while assessing the impact of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, we were going to forecast a scenario that looked
like Asian economies were growing in leaps and bounds, but because
of what's happening out there, we had to revise it,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Published annually by Boeing, the 20-year forecast is used by
the company's customers and suppliers to gauge future growth in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook predicts Latin America will be the fastest-growing
air travel market over the next 20 years at an annual rate of 7.4
percent. Latin America's airlines are expected to add 1,410 new
jets, valued at $77 billion, in that time.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and North America, many airlines are reporting record
profits, Dennis said, and aircraft orders should remain about the
same as the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's outlook indicated European travel growth will be
4.1 percent a year, with airlines adding 4,990 new jets, valued at
$345 billion, in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future market for airplanes clearly is outside of the
United States,'' Dennis said. ``Essentially, international
customers will invest $3 out of every $4 for new airplanes over the
next two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   For the North American market, traffic growth has decreased from
3.1 percent last year to 2.9 percent in 1998. The outlook estimates
the region's airlines will add 5,580 new jets, worth $332 billion,
over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes that small airplanes will capture the largest
segment of the market over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast projects seven out of 10 airplanes delivered during
the next two decades will be single-aisle airplanes _ the size of
the California-built Boeing 717, and the Renton-built 737 and 757.
They will account for 43 percent of the dollars invested in new
airplanes, or 12,260 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Intermediate-size airplanes, such as the Boeing 767 and 777,
will represent one out of four future airplane deliveries and will
account for 44 percent of the dollars invested in new airplanes, or
4,360 jets.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates the smallest market segment, 747-size or
larger airplanes, will total 15 percent of the dollars invested in
new jetliners, or 1,030 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This forecast was the basis for our decision not to build an
airplane larger than today's 747. Unlike our competitor, we think
that market forces are moving toward frequency over size. The
market is simply too small and too far into the future to risk
investing large amounts of money on airplanes larger than the
current 747-400,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus disagrees and is planning a new superjumbo jet dubbed the
A3XX that could cost $12 billion to develop and would break
Boeing's monopoly in the market for planes seating more than 400
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell who's right,'' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   While the report did not address employment, Dennis said Boeing
has not changed its previously announced plans to reduce its
workforce by 20,000 over the next two years, mostly through
attrition.
</P>
<P>
   He summed up Boeing's outlook by saying: ``We think our name is
still going to be in the phone book 20 years from now.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The matter of the men's magazines in the barbershop
at the Harvard Club, which inspired a flurry of ultraliterate
letter-writing when the club's manager yanked them for fear of
offending female customers, has been settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They voted I have to keep them in the closet,'' said the
longtime barber, FRANK LOMBARDI. ``I have to keep them locked.''
But only Playboy and Penthouse. ``The Esquire, that's OK,''
Lombardi said. ``The Sports Illustrated, they don't say nothing
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the club's house committee is a bit more
complicated. Lombardi said he could no longer have his
subscriptions to Playboy and Penthouse sent to the barbershop. The
copies that end up in his closet will be addressed to BARNEY
OLDFIELD, who graduated in 1979 and receives his mail in a private
mailbox at the club. ``In his name, yeah, not my name,'' Lombardi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oldfield, 41, grandson of the legendary race-car driver who
shares his name, said the arrangement amounted to a compromise. ``I
know, I know, it sounds like high school,'' he said. ``What can I
tell you? The real issue is, someone is going to find everything
uncomfortable. You can't go around bowdlerizing the world so
everything is Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, he added: ``I don't read Playboy, but there are
people who want to read it, and they should. You can't go around
the world removing things that are uncomfortable. If you don't want
to look at it, avert your eyes.'' He also said he had invited HUGH
HEFNER, the founder of Playboy, to speak at the club. ``He wrote me
back a really nice letter,'' he said, ``but he didn't want to come.
Kind of impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Highbrow Nudes
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ROBERT MORTON, whom DAVID LETTERMAN ousted as his
executive producer in 1996, bid on three pieces at the New York
Academy of Art's ``Take Home a Nude'' silent auction _ and not one
was the Al Hirschfeld showing the gap in the fully clothed
Letterman's uppers. Morton bid on ``My Wife'' by JULIAN SCHNABEL, a
photograph of a hot dog that said ``Achievement,'' and an ED RUSCHA
silk-screen with the inscription ``You Know the Old Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put it in my office because I work with writers
all day,'' said Morton, who starts filming JOHN LEGUIZAMO's
``Freak'' for HBO next week, with SPIKE LEE directing.
</P>
<P>
   Three Win Kyoto Prize
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Assuming that the call went through in the middle of
the night, the video artist NAM JUNE PAIK is $351,000 richer on
Friday. The Inamori Foundation, started in 1984 by the
industrialist KAZUO INAMORI, chose him for one of three Kyoto
Prizes and was scheduled to call him at his loft in SoHo by 2:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He probably had an inkling that the call was coming. After all,
the foundation had summoned him to Kyoto, Japan, last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the group, though eager for the publicity that comes with
giving away big money, wanted to be the one to give him the
official word. So it sent out a press kit on the condition that he
not be contacted until after the all-important call.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't pick up, they keep trying,'' said JENNIFER
FRIEDMAN, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The two other winners, who were to have been called at the same
time, were Dr. KURT WUTHRICH, a pioneer in molecular and structural
biology, and Dr. KIYOSI ITO, a mathematician and professor emeritus
at Kyoto University.

   NEW YORK _ MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV did something Thursday night that
he had never done before: He danced at a political event, a
fund-raiser for PETER VALLONE, the City Council speaker and a
candidate for governor. ``Peter Vallone has always worked hard for
arts in New York City,'' Baryshnikov said, ``and I'd like to see
him continue this work for the state.''

MCCALL FORMS COALITION TO FIGHT LILCO PAYOUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ State Comptroller H. Carl McCall has
organized a coalition of major stockholders in Marketspan Corp.
seeking to remove its chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, because of
the growing controversy over his compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketspan's future success will depend on strong
leadership,'' McCall wrote to the company's board of directors on
Wednesday. ``Dr. Catacosinos has lost the confidence of
shareholders, customers and regulators, and I do not believe he can
provide the leadership Marketspan needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Marketspan spokesman, Joseph McDonnell, said that
Catacosinos still has the confidence of other investors
representing far more shares than the coalition does.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's move opens a new front in the battle over the $67
million in special compensation that Catacosinos and 25 other top
executives of Long Island Lighting Co. took before it disbanded in
a complex deal on May 28. The state's Long Island Power Authority
took over LILCO's electricity service. The rest of LILCO merged
with the Brooklyn Union Gas holding company to form Marketspan,
which the authority hired to run the electric system.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Gov. George Pataki disclosed the payments, which
he said violated the takeover deal. He accused Catacosinos, who got
$42 million, of ``secret acts of greed'' and called for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   McCall is the sole trustee of the state's Common Retirement
Fund, which owns 440,000 shares of Marketspan. He acted in concert
with the New York State Teachers' Retirement System, which holds
170,000 shares, and New York City's comptroller, Alan Hevesi, the
adviser and a trustee for five city pension funds that have 800,000
shares. McCall said he was also ``reaching out'' to other
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that the recent controversy over executive
compensation packages has had a deleterious impact on the value of
our investment,'' McCall wrote to Marketspan.

WHITMAN EYES ALTERNATIVES TO INCREASING GASOLINE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Faced with growing opposition from lawmakers
over her plan to raise the gasoline tax to pay for preserving 1
million acres of farmland and undeveloped land over the next 10
years, Gov. Christie Whitman said Thursday that she was considering
other ways to finance the program.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she was not abandoning her gasoline-tax
proposal, but she acknowledged that her aides were discussing
financing alternatives with legislative staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman aides said that one plan under discussion would involve
the state's borrowing $1 billion over the next 20 years to buy the
land during the next decade. The cost would be about $92 million a
year, to be paid from existing state revenue. In addition, the
state would spend another $445 million over 10 years to acquire
open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important to me is that we get to the goal of a
million acres for preservation and that we fund New Jersey First,
that's the transportation part of it,'' Whitman said. New Jersey
First is the Whitman administration's transportation improvement
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline tax now stands at 14.5 cents per gallon. Whitman
has been seeking legislative approval to put a 7-cent-a-gallon
increase on the ballot this November. She has proposed using 5
cents of the increase for transportation projects and 2 cents to
buy open space.
</P>
<P>
   Her aides are continuing to push for the tax increase for
transportation projects. While state lawmakers have expressed
support for raising the tax for that purpose, there has been little
enthusiasm among Republicans or Democrats for raising the tax to
pay for open space preservation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think the governor is willing to review her original
proposal to something that would be more amenable to legislative
concerns,'' said Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, a Republican from Morris
Plains who is chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee.
``I never was in favor of using motor taxes for open space. I've
always felt those monies should be used for transportation
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is likely to win more support for her borrowing proposal
than for the tax increase to meet her goal of preserving half of
the state's remaining two million acres of open space. In the
Republican-controlled Senate, lawmakers have been pushing
legislation that would put a $210 million bond proposal before
voters in November for open space preservation.
</P>
<P>
   A Star Ledger/Eagleton Poll published Thursday found that 72
percent of those surveyed said that preserving open space was
``very important.'' But the poll found that New Jerseyans were
evenly split on whether they would vote for a gasoline tax increase
to pay for it. Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they would
vote in favor of a gasoline tax increase while 48 percent said they
would vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who has been promoting the gas-tax proposal at frequent
appearances around the state, took her campaign Thursday to a farm
in Lawrence Township that was made part of the state's farmland
preservation program. She talked about the importance of farmland
preservation, but did not bring up her gas-tax plan until asked by
reporters.

`FILES' MAKERS HOPE THEY HAVE `X' FACTOR FOR BIG-SCREEN SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: ``Today'' in story refers to Friday, June 19.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national and ``n'' California news
files.) 
BY MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Their foray into the realm of motion pictures could
be the biggest expedition into alien territory yet for Scully and
Mulder, the two sullen heroes of Fox Television's eerie action
drama, ``The X-Files.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet in their silver-screen debut _ a $70 million, two-hour
action-packed adventure that opens today _ Scully and Mulder are
not traveling to a land where no man has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The X-Files'' movie is just the latest in a very long
list of television shows turned motion pictures _ including the
long-running ``Star Trek'' series _ it is different from its
predecessors in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' is still in its first run on prime-time
television. ``The X-Files'' movie features the same actors and
actresses 20 million to 30 million viewers tune to Fox each Sunday
night to see. The movie is not a remake from the '50s, '60s or
'70s. And it's not animated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's most unusual, especially in current times,'' said Tom
Borys, chief operating officer of ACNielsen EDI, a market research
firm that does overnight box-office tracking for the motion-picture
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very interesting. A lot of people will be looking
at this. I think it will be imitated a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That interest is in large part based on the profitability of
adapting popular television shows into feature films, according to
Borys.
</P>
<P>
   According to ACNielsen EDI research, the average gross for
movies made from television shows this decade is $60.6 million. The
average for all other films in wide release is $35.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks to why they do it. They already have the built-in
identification and a track record,'' Borys said. ``But that is by
no means a guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Batman'' grossed $251.2 million at the box office. ``Batman
Forever,'' ``The Fugitive,'' and ``Mission: Impossible'' all
grossed in excess of $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batman Returns,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' ``The
Flintstones,'' ``Wayne's World,'' ``Addams Family Values,'' ``Star
Trek IV,'' ``George of the Jungle,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Maverick,''
and ``Casper'' each also brought in more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Davis, who directed ``The Fugitive,'' which shot to No. 1
on the box office list upon its release in August 1993, said the
story sold more tickets to his movie than fan allegiance to the
1960s TV series. But he did not see anything wrong with dipping
into the TV well for movie ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's worthwhile material, it doesn't bother me,'' he said
when his movie debuted.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``The X-Files'' series attracts 20 million to 30 million
viewers each week, ``X-Files'' creator and now film producer and
screenwriter Chris Carter is hopeful ``The X-Files'' movie can do
at least that well.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there's no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``X'' fans beseeching each other on Internet chat
sessions to give the movie a boost and spur sequels by seeing the
movie again and again, Carter said making the film was a scary
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were risks inherent in taking it to the big screen,''
Carter said. ``But (Fox) saw the beauty of making the movie. They
were a little afraid the movie would be the end of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to convince them it wasn't going to be. That it would be
a really good way to invigorate the series and to make a great
movie, too,'' Carter said. ``I didn't want this to be seen as an
exploitation. I wanted it to be seen as a celebration of the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   If the celebration turns out to be profitable, the possibilities
for television producers who want to make movies is nearly endless,
Borys said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a trend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter agreed. ``Anybody could do it. `ER' could do it. `NYPD
Blue' could do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that we did, and we had good reason to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Borys doesn't think just anyone can do it. Sitcoms couldn't
make the translation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do need to have the right kind of show to translate to the
big screen. ``X-Files is a good one that does translate. The
concept stands on its own as a film kind of idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt we're going to see `Friends: The Movie.' But `ER'
could probably do it. That makes perfect sense to me and I'm not
even a producer,'' Borys said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Borys, there are already other conversions in the
works, including a ``South Park'' movie and a new ``Beavis and
Butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's still a lot of other old TV shows out there to be
mined.''

HOSPITAL IS FINED FOR HOURS YOUNG DOCTORS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finding that young surgeons at New York University
Medical Center were working far more hours than the law allows _ in
some cases up to 130 hours a week _ state health officials fined
the hospital $16,000 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that the state fined a hospital
specifically for violating the decade-old law aimed at protecting
patients from doctors who are overworked or deprived of sleep. But
health officials, under increasing criticism for not enforcing the
regulations, warned last month that they were stepping up the pace
of inspections and would punish offenders.
</P>
<P>
   New York Medical Center, one of the city's most prestigious
hospitals, became the first to be fined under the state's new
vigilance. An inspection there in mid-May found that 10 of 18
surgical residents worked more than the 80-hour limit, and 12 of
them worked 30 to 36 hours straight. The law bars residents from
working more than 24 hours straight.
</P>
<P>
   The state investigation found the violations only in the
surgical training programs, with the cardiac-surgery department the
worst. All four first-year cardiac residents were found to be
working between 110 and 130 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara DeBuono, the state health commissioner, said there
was no evidence that any patients were harmed because of tired
doctors. But, she said, the hours worked were ``way beyond what the
regulations call for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need residents who are working in the operating rooms who
are well rested and whose technique is excellent and who are not
fatigued,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner added that New York University had been cited
in 1996 for similar violations regarding the amount of rest that
residents were getting and that the hospital had not corrected
those problems despite a promise to do so. ``It's far more serious
because they had been cited before,'' Dr. DeBuono said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital released a statement acknowledging the problem and
saying that it has formed a committee to make sure that it follows
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYU is committed to assuring compliance with the working-hour
regulations and, in full cooperation with the New York State
Department of Health, has taken substantive steps to correct the
deficiencies noted in their review,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement also noted that the problem existed at other
institutions. In May, after several months of mounting criticism
from medical experts, in newspaper articles and from other public
officials, Dr. DeBuono completed an investigation of 12 hospitals _
many of them among the best in the state _ and determined that all
12 were violating the laws.
</P>
<P>
   The day the report was released, Dr. DeBuono sent investigators
to three other hospitals, including New York University Medical
Center, and found only NYU had violated the laws, passed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind those laws, Dr. Bertrand Bell, praised
the fine and Dr. DeBuono's initiative on Thursday, even as he doled
out a measure of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state has recognized that this is a serious
problem,'' said Bell, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine at Yeshiva University. ``And Governor Pataki wants to be
re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. DeBuono said politics had no effect on her actions.

ALL-STAR JOCKEYS GET OLDER AND BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ When the lights come up tonight at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie, there is the inevitable presumption
that some of the participants are old enough to be put to stud.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Jerry Bailey, Hall of Fame jockey, still
wants to work.
</P>
<P>
   At the NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship, they'll be checking
birth certificates only on the horses, thank you. Bailey, born in
Dallas and raised in El Paso, will turn 41 this summer and has
saddled more than 4,300 winners.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay, another of the seven Hall of Fame jockeys who
will ride tonight, is a nimble 51. Cajun-born Eddie Delahoussaye is
46. Canadian Sandy Hawley is 49.
</P>
<P>
   They may be getting older. They may also be getting faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few athletic endeavors, I guess, where you
don't lose your edge or your physical ability just because you get
older,'' Bailey said on the eve of the second annual event.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's record, like Pincay's and Delahoussaye's and all of the
40-something set's, more than substantiates that. They don't ride
on the seniors circuit and their winners don't pay off in Depends
coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, instead, offers this thought: ``The more horses you
ride, the wiser you become.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a betting man might have wagered that not all
jockeys would live into their 40s, let alone win in them. Bailey
has heard the old stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard, fast life,'' he said. ``And I think the owners
and trainers wanted them to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners and trainers felt that a guy was more of a
risk-taker out on the track if he was a risk-taker in every other
endeavor of his life. So the wilder the jockeys were at night, they
figured the wilder they would be on the race track for them. I've
heard stories about some of the great riders of the past showing up
in the morning wearing tuxedoes _ from the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey paused and smiled. ``I don't think that's the mentality
anymore,'' he assured.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone with the Damon Runyon novels. The stakes
today are too high. One slip _ even one vacation _ and there's
somebody else in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey rides six horses a day, five days a week, about 48 weeks
a year. He has been averaging 1,100 to 1,200 rides each calendar
year.
</P>
<P>
   He rides in New York, because all the great ones, sooner or
later, tend to gravitate to the New York, Kentucky or California
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't Texas. But Bailey has earned enough _ his mounts'
winning purses last year totaled nearly $16 million _ that he has
been able to buy himself some Texas-sized elbow room on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 3 acres,'' Bailey said, ``and I can't see the next
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was born in Dallas, Bailey moved to El Paso with his
family before he had turned 3. His father, a dentist, bought a pony
for the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   When his dad bought more horses, Jerry learned that pitching hay
and combing colts was far more intriguing than throwing newspapers
and bagging groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, growing up in Texas, I wanted to be a football
player,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   But his bio lists him _ generously _ at 5-foot-5 and 112 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too little,'' he said. ``I wanted to be a basketball player,
but I was too short. I tried out for all the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a professional athlete. I ended up coming full
circle back to racing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, he began riding professionally at Sunland Park in New
Mexico. His first winner was named Fetch. But his greatest winner
was the legendary Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   From October 1994 until August 1996, Cigar won 16 races without
losing. The streak equaled Citation's as the longest by any North
American-based horse in the 20th century. Bailey was aboard Cigar
for 15 of those 16 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had great personality to him,'' Bailey said of his former
partner. ``Two or three days before a race, he'd bite your hand
off. He knew what was coming. Yet the day after the race, my
4-year-old son could go pet him on the nose and he'd be as gentle
as a kitten.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigar's resoluteness carried itself onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had nerves of steel, and he'd pass it on to the horses he
was running with,'' Bailey said. ``That air of invincibility. He'd
beat horses mentally as well as physically.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jerry Bailey aboard, Cigar was once called ``Nureyev in
horseshoes.'' Racing lore tells the story of the stakes race he won
in Illinois where $200,000 in winning tickets went uncashed. Fans
wanted, instead, to keep them as mementos.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar retired in 1996. But his old saddle mate, Bailey, as a
spry 40-year-old, rides on.
</P>
<P>
   As you may observe tonight, age matters only on the horses.
They're all stars, and they never looked brighter.

 UNDATED: had sought.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, a
company that advises institutional investors on legal terms, said
she is not surprised that producers have decided to take their
chances in the courtroom, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the reason that the industry came to the
table,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``They came to get rid of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the McCain bill and the prospect of renewed
courtroom conflict will cause many state attorneys general to
jump-start their lawsuits against producers. A large majority of
the states involved in last June's plan were late in suing
producers and many of those states, expecting the settlement to win
congressional approval, have not done much pretrial work.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in just a few states have introduced bills over the
past year that would make it easier for a state to prevail in a
lawsuit against a cigarette company. Such a bill, which effectively
allows a state to recover collectively rather than pressing
individual claims on behalf of every smoker treated, was considered
instrumental in Florida's ability to negotiate an $11.3 billion
settlement with the industry last August.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Habush, a lawyer who represents the state of Wisconsin, said
that while some states have lost ground waiting to see what
Congress would do, others like Wisconsin have been proceeding
actively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the industry thinks that proceeding state by
the state is best possible route,'' said Habush. ``But there is no
way they are going to get through this minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Some initial settlement efforts have been made to try and
restart settlement negotiations between the industry and some state
attorneys general, but one industry lawyer called the talks very
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aronson and other legal experts added that while they
believed the industry could overcome many of the claims filed
against it, the legal landscape remained troubling for producers.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that new claimants like health insurers and
union health plans were assaulting cigarette makers for the first
time. And while those actions might not initially succeed, the
success of one could open the door for others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the outpouring of secret industry documents and the
steady drumbeat of negative articles and television programs about
tobacco producers was likely to have an impact on jurors, Ms.
Aronson and others added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, jurors felt that smokers brought on their own
demise and should not be rewarded,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``Now some
juries are willing to take their eyes off the smoker and cast them
on the industry.''

MOVES TO TRACK HIV CASES GAIN IN N.Y. LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (also see NY-LEGIS-POLITICS)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With just hours left in the legislative session,
leaders of the state Assembly on Thursday dropped their opposition
to a measure requiring that the names of HIV-positive people be
reported to the state and mandating that government health workers
ask infected people to name their sexual partners so that they can
be notified that they are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday night passed the
bill by a vote of 55-6, and a large majority of Assembly members
are known to favor the measure, which has been kept from a vote by
the leadership in recent years. Gov. George Pataki, a Republican,
also favors the bill in concept, but aides said he would not
comment on it until his lawyers had read it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the HIV tracking measure, legislative leaders
also agreed to create an appeals process for people who are denied
health insurance and to expand health care for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Senate and Assembly met late into the night to
conclude what many legislators called a singularly unproductive
year, leaders of the two houses and Pataki failed to agree on a
wide range of measures that appeared possible, even likely, as
recently as a day or two ago: ending parole for violent felons,
establishing charter schools, consolidation of the state's
multilayered court system, allowing dairy farmers to charge more
for milk, and permitting mutual insurance companies to sell
billions of dollars in stock.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bitter internal fight over HIV legislation among
the Democrats who control the Assembly that occupied much of the
last two days in that house, and provided the greatest drama on the
final day.
</P>
<P>
   After years of resisting the concept, the Democrats who control
the Assembly said their house would pass the bill requiring
reporting, by name, of people infected with the AIDS virus, to the
state Health Department, which would keep a central registry of the
names of infected people.
</P>
<P>
   Local health agencies would be required to interview all people
reported as testing positive, ask them to name their sexual
partners, and then warn those partners that they have been exposed
to the virus. But the law would not penalize anyone who refused to
divulge the names of their sexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight other states, including New Jersey, already track
HIV cases by name, but many of those do not mandate the tracing of
contacts. Passage of the measure in New York would be significant
since it has the nation's highest rate of reported AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials have said that reporting by name and
tracing contacts are needed to make sure that people are aware that
they have been exposed to the virus, in part to reduce the risk of
spreading the infection. Early detection of the virus is considered
increasingly important since a new class of AIDS drugs called
protease inhibitors has proven effective in treating the disease in
many people.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-treatment advocacy groups have fought the measure, arguing
that it would discourage people from being tested and seeking
treatment. Some said patients could be effectively tracked without
using their names, by assigning them identification codes. But
supporters of the bill said such a system would be cumbersome and
might hinder the ability to track the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been clear that such a bill had enough votes to pass
the Assembly _ nearly all the 53 Republicans and most of the 97
Democrats favor it _ but Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver kept it
from coming to a vote for years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, a Queens
Democrat, has been a loud and relentless advocate, spending years
trying to embarrass Silver into allowing a vote. And many Assembly
members have said the public pressure on them to act grew greatly
with the news last fall that one man, Nushawn Williams, had
infected more than a dozen women and girls in small towns in
western New York.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the legislative session, Silver gave in to
pressure from other Democrats. Many genuinely supported the
measure, while others feared their failure to act on it would be
used against them as a campaign issue by Republicans. Silver
negotiated some minor changes with Ms. Mayersohn, then freed
legislators to vote as they pleased. The bill squeaked through two
committees, by votes of 11 to 10, before going to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great moment for common sense,'' said Ms. Mayersohn.
``This is what we do with every other serious communicable disease,
and what we should have done years ago with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Jaffe, a lobbyist for Gay Men's Health Crisis, said,
``It really intrudes upon the relationship between the physician
and the patient. The idea that HIV-positive persons will disclose
to government workers who they don't know and don't trust is a
fantasy. From the beginning, we've been told this was being driven
by the politics surrounding the Nushawn Williams case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resolution of the AIDS issue, many legislators
expressed disappointment about a session that seemed much more
promising months ago. In April, many lawmakers were euphoric after
the Legislature enacted the least-tardy state budget in five years.
For the first time, the budget was hammered out in conference
committees, with the involvement of many rank-and-file legislators,
rather than in secret meetings among state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But for those same lawmakers, the last seven weeks of the
session _ and the final 48 hours in particular _ were a distinct
letdown. Pataki, who is running for re-election, took much of the
wind out of the Legislature's sails by vetoing $1.6 billion in
spending it had approved, and the rest of the session sank into a
morass of recriminations and election-year politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of getting a budget done in a timely way, there was
virtually nothing accomplished here,'' said Assemblyman John Faso
of Kinderhook, the Republican minority leader. ``It's been a very
frustrating session.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the final deals made by lawmakers strikes at health
insurers that deny people coverage for treatment, whose only option
is to appeal the insurer. Instead, the agreement reached by Silver,
Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno would allow patients
to appeal a denial of treatment _ including of experimental
treatments _ to an independent arbiter chosen by the state Health
Department. Both houses were expected to approve the bill Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could neutralize what was shaping up to be an issue in
the gubernatorial race. Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, Pataki's
former protegee who hopes to run against him as a Democrat, has
made attacks on health maintenance organizations and calls for an
outside appeals process a centerpiece of her campaign, and some of
the other Democrats in the race have joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs will no longer be judge and jury in New York when
consumers file a complaint,'' said Richard Kirsch, executive
director of Citizen Action of New York, one of many consumer groups
that had lobbied for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, Pataki and Bruno also agreed on an expansion of the
state's health care program for children of low-income families,
which will be paid for by New York's share of a $24 billion federal
grant program established last year. About 420,000 children are
eligible for the program, but fewer than half that number are
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The state program, called Child Health Plus, makes health
coverage available at little or no cost. Income limits would be
raised _ from $35,000 a year for a family of four, for example, to
$40,000 _ expanding eligibility by about 35,000 children. It would
also lower the fees charged to some families, and move some
children in the program into Medicaid, the federal health program,
giving them a wider range of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a giant step forward,'' said Melinda Dutton,
senior health policy specialist with the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent proposal to fade away in the waning hours,
and the one Pataki had pressed for most vigorously, was one that
would have ended parole boards' ability to release violent felons
from prison early. Under the measure, felons would have been
required to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   As with many of the issues taken up this year, the Democratic
Assembly leaders were reluctant to go along, but were aware that
the governor's position was popular, and that Democrats might pay a
price at the polls for opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second-to-last week of the session, Silver said he would
accept the parole provision if it were linked to expanded education
programs in prisons and to laws allowing some felons to be
sentenced to drug treatment programs rather than prison. Pataki and
Bruno rejected those conditions, and despite negotiations that
continued far into the night Thursday, no compromise was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was the chief advocate for several other ideas that
died in the last few days, like casino gambling and creating
so-called charter schools, public schools with particular missions
that operate largely independent of the usual bureaucracy. The
Assembly Democrats and their allies, the teachers' unions, opposed
the governor's charter schools proposal, and while they insisted
they were open to some other version, there was little evidence of
a middle ground they would accept.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also wanted to see a change in law to allow mutual
insurance companies, which are technically owned by their
policyholders, to sell stock to outsiders with limited compensation
to policyholders. Under current law, a mutual insurance company can
sell stock but the policyholders must get most of it. The Assembly
leaders negotiated with the insurers until late Thursday, but no
deal was reached.

HERNANDEZ AND YANKS TOO MUCH FOR INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ If there was any doubt whether Orlando Hernandez is
good enough to face good teams, he put it to rest Thursday night,
when he pitched seven and two-thirds strong innings against the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was out of the game before the Yankees won, 5-2,
snapping a tie in the ninth inning when Scott Brosius drew a
bases-loaded walk with an 11-pitch at-bat and then adding two more
runs. But Hernandez confirmed the Yankees' belief in him, and their
decision to keep him in the rotation and move Ramiro Mendoza to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had the bases loaded and one out in the ninth, and
Indians reliever Mike Jackson struck out Chad Curtis for the second
out. Brosius beat out what appeared to be a run-scoring infield
hit, but Tim Tschida, the home-plate umpire, ruled the ball was
foul, prompting a lengthy argument with Joe Torre, the Yankee
manager.
</P>
<P>
   After Brosius resumed his at-bat he fouled off five two-strike
pitches before taking the walk that scored pinch-runner Homer Bush
with the lead run. A single and an error added two more runs in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson got the victory for the Yankees, who are 49-16.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was initially scheduled to pitch against Baltimore on
Monday, and quite logically, the Indians did not send an advance
scout to watch El Duque's last start, in Montreal on June 9. The
Yankees had two rainouts last weekend, Hernandez's subsequent start
was postponed, and the Indians then were left to examine videotape
of his previous outings, to look for patterns or tendencies or any
sort of clue to identify when and what Hernandez would throw.
</P>
<P>
   They might have had more luck finding the Loch Ness Monster.
Hernandez, in his third major league start, mystified the Indians
completely with his cheek-high Bruce Lee leg kick, the gold chain
and cross dangling from his neck, his instinctual feel for
confusing batters.
</P>
<P>
   Most starters become more vulnerable as the game progresses, as
opposing hitters begin to time their fastballs and better recognize
the off-speed stuff. But in the case of Hernandez, information
almost seems to be counter-productive; the Indians grew more
baffled inning to inning, at-bat to at-bat, as they guessed
incorrectly what Hernandez might try next.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was at an immediate disadvantage against Hernandez,
even before the Indians' first at-bat. Charles Nagy, the Cleveland
starter, threw two low curveballs that Tschida called for strikes;
these parameters of the strike zone could not have been better
suited for Hernandez, who throws many types of breaking balls that
spin low.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had seven hits and three walks during Hernandez's
seven innings, but until his final inning of work, he seemed to be
completely in control. Torre wondered aloud last week how Hernandez
would respond to pressure. This is his answer: Cleveland was
hitless in its first eight at-bats with runners in scoring
position, Hernandez throwing curves, sliders, changeups and
fastballs from all different angles. Twice Cleveland manager Mike
Hargrove griped to the umpires about how Hernandez wiggled his
fingers when working from the set position, probably an attempt to
rattle the rookie. But Hernandez would not be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had a runner at third and one out in the third
inning, and Hernandez whiffed Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome, with a
slider and changeup, respectively. The Indians had another runner
at third and one out the next inning; Hernandez struck out Mark
Whiten and Pat Borders.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez carried a 2-0 lead into the seventh, allowing a walk
and a single to open the inning. Borders stared at a third-strike
fastball, David Bell grounded out, advancing the runners and
bringing Kenny Lofton to the plate. Lofton, who seemed to be the
only Cleveland batter remotely comfortable hitting against
Hernandez, fouled off three pitches with two strikes, before lining
a two-run single to right and tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez retired the first two batters in the eighth, jamming
Ramirez so badly with a fastball that the right fielder fell
backward in the batter's box as the ball trickled up the first base
line _ where Hernandez, charging off the mound, gloved it just
before it edged foul, and ran to stomp on the bag himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having thrown 122 pitches to that point, however, Hernandez was
lifted. He lowered his earned run average to 1.52. He has allowed
16 hits and 6 walks in his first 23 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, in the final step of rehabilitating his abdominal
strain, played for Class AAA Columbus Thursday night, in Durham,
N.C., and hit two doubles and struck out in four at-bats. He made a
throwing error for the Clippers; interestingly, he hasn't made a
single throwing error for the Yankees. Jeter is expected to join
the Yankees Friday and play against Cleveland, after being
activated off the 15-day disabled list.

<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, a
company that advises institutional investors on legal terms, said
she is not surprised that producers have decided to take their
chances in the courtroom, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the reason that the industry came to the
table,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``They came to get rid of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the McCain bill and the prospect of renewed
courtroom conflict will cause many state attorneys general to
jump-start their lawsuits against producers. A large majority of
the states involved in last June's plan were late in suing
producers and many of those states, expecting the settlement to win
congressional approval, have not done much pretrial work.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in just a few states have introduced bills over the
past year that would make it easier for a state to prevail in a
lawsuit against a cigarette company. Such a bill, which effectively
allows a state to recover collectively rather than pressing
individual claims on behalf of every smoker treated, was considered
instrumental in Florida's ability to negotiate an $11.3 billion
settlement with the industry last August.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Habush, a lawyer who represents the state of Wisconsin, said
that while some states have lost ground waiting to see what
Congress would do, others like Wisconsin have been proceeding
actively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the industry thinks that proceeding state by
the state is best possible route,'' said Habush. ``But there is no
way they are going to get through this minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Some initial settlement efforts have been made to try and
restart settlement negotiations between the industry and some state
attorneys general, but one industry lawyer called the talks very
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aronson and other legal experts added that while they
believed the industry could overcome many of the claims filed
against it, the legal landscape remained troubling for producers.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that new claimants like health insurers and
union health plans were assaulting cigarette makers for the first
time. And while those actions might not initially succeed, the
success of one could open the door for others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the outpouring of secret industry documents and the
steady drumbeat of negative articles and television programs about
tobacco producers was likely to have an impact on jurors, Ms.
Aronson and others added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, jurors felt that smokers brought on their own
demise and should not be rewarded,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``Now some
juries are willing to take their eyes off the smoker and cast them
on the industry.''

NEW YORK HUNTS FOR SCHOOL SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With less than three months left before 14,000
4-year-olds are supposed to begin new prekindergarten classes
established by the state, New York City's overcrowded public school
system is planning to enroll a third of those children in private
and parochial preschools.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to squeeze the preschoolers into public schools ripping
at the seams, officials expect to use public funds to educate about
5,000 children in private schools. It is a rare example of the
city's public school system relying on the private sector for basic
academic services; the only precedents are smaller programs in
counseling and tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   The state law that established prekindergarten classes
encouraged local school districts to draw up contracts with private
preschools. The law requires each district to devote at least 10
percent of its funds to contracts with private agencies, and
education officials in Albany said the requirement was added
because they knew many districts would be unable to find the space
or the qualified teachers on their own. The private preschool
industry, worried about losing business, also lobbied heavily in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   When state lawmakers enacted the law establishing the $500
million program last summer, they allocated money for teachers and
aides, but none for construction, despite the space problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, translating the language of the law into reality has
flummoxed school officials across the state, especially in New York
City, which now expects to be spending 35 percent of its state
allocation for the program on private and parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the story of prekindergarten in New York is emerging as
the story of good intentions crashing into difficult realities.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of the city, parents have been unable to submit
applications for their preschoolers because district officials have
not picked the private preschools they will use. Bathrooms and
playgrounds are still being inspected, teacher credentials reviewed
and classrooms observed.
</P>
<P>
   As school officials have discovered, conditions at private
preschools vary widely. Dirty floors and a dearth of books at a day
care center on the ground floor of an East New York housing project
dismayed one superintendent, while the emphasis on penmanship at a
preschool in northern Queens troubled another district official,
who considered the school's approach too rigid.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, a new complication was unearthed: When a Brooklyn
superintendent showed up to inspect a yeshiva, it was closed for a
religious holiday, revealing the potential chaos that mismatched
school calendars could create for working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most educators unequivocally embrace the concept of
preschool education, not just in New York but around the United
States. A survey taken last year by the Children's Defense Fund, an
advocacy group based in Washington, found that 21 states had
increased financing of preschool programs, most of them intended
for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New Jersey Legislature set aside $125 million for
prekindergarten classes in 125 of the state's poorest school
districts. In Connecticut, lawmakers agreed last year to spend $86
million over two years on prekindergarten classes in more than a
dozen poor, mostly urban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can say anything bad about children having early-childhood
education?'' said Dr. Arthur Greenberg, the head of Community
School District 25 in Flushing, Queens. ``Is it well planned? No. I
know a whole bunch of superintendents who would have liked more
time to get this off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   When the universal prekindergarten law was enacted a year ago,
it drew bipartisan support from lawmakers, and got a strong boost
from Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. The program is voluntary for
parents. New York City's Board of Education voted to require each
of its 32 districts to provide the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of the program cited research pointing to the
long-term benefits of early education. For instance, studies of
Head Start, the federally financed prekindergarten program for poor
children, showed that preschoolers enrolled in the program
initially showed measurable improvements in health, school
attendance and cognitive test scores. The gains in cognitive test
scores, however, faded after a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   To stretch its resources, New York City decided to establish
half-day prekindergarten classes; a few other districts in the
state are creating full-day programs.
</P>
<P>
   The program is financed with $46 million in state funds for the
1988-89 school year, matched by $5 million from the Board of
Education. Unlike Head Start, which is limited to needy children,
New York's prekindergarten program is available to children
regardless of their family income, though in the first year only
districts with the largest percentage of poor children _ including
all New York City districts _ are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Private preschools that want contracts with the city school
system must be licensed by the city, and they cannot offer
religious instruction. Any parochial schools involved in the new
program will, under the state law, have to scrub classroom walls of
religious icons and agree to a secular curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Given the stipulations, several private agencies, including
schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, have
passed up the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the business of religious education,'' said Dr.
Catherine Hickey, superintendent of schools for the archdiocese,
which has more than 6,000 children in prekindergarten classes. ``We
probably would not sacrifice one of our own religious
early-childhood programs for the sake of secular programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The privatization issue has not drawn opposition from the
teachers' union. An estimated 225 teachers will be hired to
instruct children in prekindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would prefer it in the public schools,'' said
Ronald Jones, the United Federation of Teachers vice president for
elementary schools. ``Until we get to that nirvana, I don't think
we should deprive these kids of pre-K.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union has pledged to watch closely
as the arrangement is carried out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although enrollment is optional for parents, each of the city's
school districts will be required to accommodate 16 percent of
their estimated population of 4-year-olds, or a citywide total of
14,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the most overcrowded districts have yet to find room in
their buildings or in private preschools to accommodate their share
of prekindergartners in the fall, though Board of Education
officials say they are optimistic that room will be found soon.
</P>
<P>
   Those five are District 6 in upper Manhattan, Districts 9 and 11
in the Bronx and Districts 24 and 29 in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts are selecting students either by lottery or on a
first-come-first-served basis. The state law mandates that
districts gradually expand the number of slots so that by fall
2002, any 4-year-old can enroll in a prekindergarten class.
</P>
<P>
   But accommodating all children whose parents want them in the
program by 2002 is likely to be a formidable challenge, given the
lack of new school buildings and parallel state legislation
requiring cuts in class size beginning in fall 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For prekindergarten alone, 30,000 seats, or 1,750 classrooms,
would have to be built or found by 2002, according to estimates by
the Board of Education. To reduce class size, 45,552 more seats _
more than 2,000 classrooms _ would be required. This fall, the
board will open six new schools with about 5,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facilities part is a major factor that has been
overlooked,'' said J.D. LaRock, a board spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   District 19 on the eastern fringe of Brooklyn, for example, has
little room for prekindergarten in its Cypress Hills neighborhood,
the densely populated northern part of the district where schools
are already so crowded that kindergartners are bused to Starrett
City, several miles south.
</P>
<P>
   Touring his district and looking for prekindergarten space the
other day, Superintendent Robert Riccobono said he wondered whether
parents in Cypress Hills would shepherd their children to the
southern end of the district, where there is ample space for
prekindergarten: Within a two-block radius in Starrett City, he had
found a public school that could house a couple of prekindergarten
classes, as well as a yeshiva and a secular preschool.
</P>
<P>
   But space is not the sole concern. Although licensed private
preschools, like the public schools, have state-certified
early-childhood teachers, there is a great variety in the
conditions and philosophy of each preschool.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour the other day, Riccobono found one preschool, on the
ground floor of a housing project in the East New York section of
Brooklyn, practically devoid of books and instructional supplies
and floors that needed a thorough cleaning. Still, he chose the
preschool after concluding that the problems were easily fixable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, we are responsible,'' Riccobono said. ``It's not
comfortable to be responsible for something you can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the state, 124 of about 700 school districts _ those with
the largest share of poor children _ are eligible in the first
year, and of those, 80 are participating. School districts will be
phased in based on their percentage of poor children, and by the
fourth year, all districts will be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts are also facing problems implementing the
program. In small, growing cities like Gloversville, west of
Albany, school officials are having trouble finding enough school
buildings or licensed day-care centers to accommodate the rising
student enrollment, state education officials said. In East Aurora,
in western New York, school districts are negotiating with a
mammoth day-care center run by the toy company Fisher Price.
Several cities are looking for empty rooms in state buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the demand for the state-financed
prekindergarten classes is hard to gauge, though it is well known
that the day-care crunch is particularly intense for the city's
working poor: There are 36,000 children on a waiting list for
city-subsidized day-care slots.

EXPOS BEAT METS, 7-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Luis Lopez, who is normally an infielder, had no
problem at all with any of the fly balls hit his way Thursday night
in his first major league start in right field. Instead, it was a
ground ball that proved tricky for Lopez, and that played a key
role in helping the Montreal Expos beat the Mets, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's misplay, as well as the inability of Rey Ordonez to
drive someone home with one out and at least one runner in scoring
position in the fifth and sixth innings, were what hurt the Mets
the most. Ordonez popped out to short with Edgardo Alfonzo on third
in the fifth and grounded to third and into a double play with the
bases loaded in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, whose last four losses have each been by one run, did
score three times in the sixth off the Montreal rookie Javier
Vazquez to erase a 2-0 deficit. But Masato Yoshii (4-3), who had
allowed home runs to Vladimir Guerrero and Rondell White in the
first two innings, could not hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the Expos' sixth, Lopez let a bases-loaded single by Mark
Grudzielanek get under his glove for a two-base error, which led to
a five-run inning that made it 7-3 and pretty much doomed the Mets.
Lopez was playing right field because Bernard Gilkey is still
having problems with his left eye a week after being hit by a pitch
in the face and because Butch Huskey's aching right knee needed
some rest.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Mets (38-29) with a 3-4 finish to their
eight-day journey to Florida and Montreal, two of the weakest teams
in the National League. Yoshii was charged with 7 runs on seven
hits in five and a third innings against the weakest-hitting lineup
in the NL, his worst outing as a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   That Yoshii was not at his sharpest was evident early, when
Guerrero homered with two out in the first inning and then White
went deep to lead off the second. But Yoshii was able to hold the
Expos scoreless for the next three innings, while the Mets
attempted to figure Vazquez out.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old right-hander, who had a 1-6 record and a 6.00
earned run average, scattered four hits on his first two times
through the Mets' order.
</P>
<P>
   The third time through was the charm for the Mets, however. Five
consecutive hits _ a Matt Franco single, a Mike Piazza double, a
John Olerud single for two runs, a Carlos Baerga single and an
Alfonzo double for a third run _ built a 3-2 lead for the Mets. But
Ordonez failed with the bases loaded against reliever Shayne
Bennett, and then Yoshii let the lead slip away.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos sent 11 batters to the plate in their sixth. Yoshii
opened the inning by getting Jose Vidro on a called third strike.
But Guerrero followed with a double, Brad Fullmer singled him to
third and White walked on a 3-2 pitch to fill the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Grudzielanek, rifled a run-scoring single to
right on the artificial turf, past a diving Baerga at second base.
Lopez charged the ball sensing a play at home. Instead, the ball
kicked off his glove and went to the wall. Three runners scored,
Grudzielanek wound up at third base and the Expos had a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the inning was over, it was 7-3 with these numbers:
three hits off Yoshii; five walks shared by Yoshii and Turk
Wendell; one botched rundown after Wendell had picked Chris Widger
off first base, and Lopez's two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did answer with another three-run rally in the seventh
as Piazza Piazza provided a run-scoring double, his second of the
game, and Baerga singled for two runs. It pulled the Mets to within
7-6.
</P>
<P>
   But Guerrero robbed Alfonzo of extra bases _ and what would have
been his fourth hit of the game _ with a running catch in
right-center field to end the uprising, and the Expos held on to
win.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have still not announced whether they have come to an
agreement on a no-trade clause with Todd Hundley. Both sides are
believed to be close. ``They're still talking,'' assistant general
manager Omar Minaya said of the negotiations between general
manager Steve Phillips and Seth Levinson, Hundley's representative.
``We will make an announcement when the negotiations are
concluded.'' According to manager Bobby Valentine, Hundley took
right-handed and left-handed swings off the organization's
minor-league hitting coordinator, Mickey Brantley, at the Mets'
training complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla, Thursday. Hundley, who is
working out in the outfield, also threw from 150 feet and,
Valentine said, ``felt real good'' ... On Friday morning, Bernard
Gilkey and Butch Huskey are scheduled to undergo medical
examinations. Gilkey, who has not played since being hit with a
pitch above the left eye in Florida last Friday, is still seeing
little flashes and will be examined by an ophthalmologist for the
third time in a week. Huskey is planning to have a magnetic
resonance imaging test on his right knee, even though the swelling
subsided Thursday ... An Aug. 20 court date has been set for the
five Mets' minor leaguers accused of sexual assault in Port St.
Lucie ... Valentine on reports that Bud Selig will become the
full-time commissioner: ``What did the search committee decide? Not
to search?''

OFFICER ACCUSED IN 1994 DEATH WAS LABELED VIOLENT IN '91 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years before a New York City police officer,
Francis Livoti, was accused in the choking death of Anthony Baez
during a 1994 arrest in the Bronx, his commanding officer
recommended that he be transferred because of the number of police
brutality complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   The department did not follow the recommendation of Deputy Chief
William Casey, then commander of the 46th Precinct in the Bronx,
who described his concerns about Livoti in a recent deposition in a
pending civil lawsuit against the Police Department by the Baez
family.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Casey testified that he also changed Livoti's
shift, gave him a new partner, talked with him and recommended to
him that he undergo psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti is currently on trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
on a charge of depriving Baez of his civil rights. In October 1996,
he was acquitted of state charges of criminally negligent homicide
in Baez's death. The acquittal ignited street protests in the Bronx
and focused more attention on the issue of police brutality. In
February 1997, after a separate administrative trial, the Police
Department dismissed Livoti from the force after finding that he
had used an illegal and deadly choke hold on Baez.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Livoti, Stuart London, who has said that his
client denies all wrongdoing in the Baez case as well as in other
civilian complaints, did not return calls to his pager last night.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony by Casey shows that, as early as 1991,
high-level police officials were aware of the concerns about Livoti
and did not take action.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the government continued to present its civil rights
case against Livoti; the trial has included testimony from members
of Baez's family that they saw Livoti grab Baez around the neck. In
the early morning hours of Dec. 22, 1994, Baez, 29, was tossing a
football with his three brothers near their childhood home in the
University Heights section of the Bronx, where Baez was visiting
from his home in Florida. When the brothers' football hit a patrol
car repeatedly, Livoti got out of his car and confronted the
brothers in an incident that ultimately led to the struggle in
which prosecutors say Livoti choked Baez. Baez died shortly
thereafter
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said publicly whether Casey will testify at
the trial. But prosecutors may have been alluding to his concerns
when they told the jury Thursday _ in a statement agreed to by the
defense _ that before Baez's death in 1994, Livoti had been
``individually warned by the commander of the 46th Precinct to
refrain from using excessive force and to avoid unnecessary
civilian confrontations.'' A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan would not discuss whether Casey would testify.
</P>
<P>
   Casey's testimony in the deposition also points to the influence
that the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has
in disciplinary matters. Casey testified that his case for Livoti's
transfer had to be even stronger because the officer was the
precinct's union delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a different criteria in the transferring of a PBA
delegate than a normal officer,'' Casey testified in response to a
question from state Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon. He said
that in order to get a union delegate transferred, the officer's
behavior had ``to be more egregious than normal police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the chief's deposition remain sealed under an order
from Justice McKeon. A lawyer for the Baez family, Susan Karten,
declined to make a copy available or to discuss it, citing the
judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who is assigned to the Department's organized-crime
control bureau, referred a request for comment to a Department
spokeswoman, who declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers defending New York City in the Baez family's civil suit
have sought to keep Casey's testimony out of the public record,
requesting the confidentiality order and objecting in a hearing
April 7 before McKeon when one of the family's lawyers referred
briefly to the transfer recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey said, `Get Livoti out of the 46th and give him a less
stressful job,''' said the family lawyer, S. Alan LeBlang, leading
to the city's objection, a transcript showed.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Casey said that Livoti was the first officer
he had ever tried to transfer, and that he had done a full analysis
of Livoti's civilian complaint record. Although details of that
record were not available Tuesday, federal prosecutors, in court
papers, have described one incident _ which the jury will not hear
about in court _ that predates the chief's June 1991 recommendation
to transfer Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   In that September 1990 incident, according to the court papers,
Livoti was arresting a man, Ivan Cruz, and twisting his arm behind
his back when a second man, Manuel Bordoy, approached and told
Livoti that he was being unnecessarily rough. The two men were
returning home to the Bronx from a nightclub in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government's account _ which Livoti denies _ he
then punched Bordoy twice in the face, breaking his jaw in three
places.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also wrote to Judge Shira Scheindlin that ``there
are numerous other incidents in which Livoti was alleged to have
used excessive force in connection with his work as a police
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said in the deposition that in 1991 he did not recommend a
specific assignment for Livoti; it could have been a clerical
assignment, he suggested, or merely a move to a precinct with a
lower crime rate and less violence. ``Almost every place is less
stressful than the 46th,'' Casey said.

STANTON FIRM ON APPEAL, UNLESS IT HURTS THE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ As he decides how to approach the appeal of his
five-game suspension, Mike Stanton may have to choose between
honoring his principles and doing what is most advantageous for the
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Budig, the American League president, imposed a five-game
suspension and $1,000 fine on Stanton, contending that he purposely
hit Baltimore's Eric Davis with a pitch on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton adamantly denies he did anything of the sort, and he
says that he intends to aggressively appeal the suspension, which
is scheduled to begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merely accepting the penalty, Stanton said Thursday, would be
``like pleading guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton wants to establish all the way through the process that
he disagrees strongly with the decision, and that he did not target
Davis. And there is always the chance that Budig will reduce the
penalty once he meets with Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Stanton could take the same approach that
Darryl Strawberry and Graeme Lloyd did last month and try to time
the suspension so that it leaves the Yankees in the best possible
competitive situation.
</P>
<P>
   It would best suit the Yankees if Stanton remained available for
the four-game series with Cleveland that started Thursday night,
and for as many games as possible in the four-game series to be
played against the Atlanta Braves next week; Stanton is
left-handed, and the Indians and the Braves are loaded with
left-handed hitters, from Cleveland's Jim Thome and David Justice
to Atlanta's Ryan Klesko and Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead further, the Mets, who will play host to the
Yankees from June 26 to 28, have just one front-line left-handed
hitter, John Olerud. On the face of it, the Yankees would be best
served if Stanton could serve the bulk of his suspension while the
team plays at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But he is torn. He wants to make a stand, an opportunity to
present his perspective to Budig.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do decide to withdraw,'' Stanton said, ``it's going to be
because that's what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter Doubles Twice in Tuneup
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, in the final step of rehabilitating his abdominal
strain, played shortstop for the Yankees' Class AAA Columbus
Clippers Thursday night, in Durham, N.C. He hit two doubles and
struck out in four at-bats. He also made a throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is expected to join the Yankees on Friday and play against
Cleveland, after being activated off the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Is a Late Addition
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis was not in the first lineup posted in the Yankees'
clubhouse Thursday. But after talking to Curtis and examining the
statistics of the Cleveland starter, Charles Nagy, Joe Torre
reinserted Curtis in center field. He was 1 for 3.

BOSTON GLOBE ASKS COLUMNIST WHO FABRICATED MATERIAL TO RESIGN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to expand, with Smith column excerpts, additional Storin
quote, etc.)  (EDS. NOTE: The Boston Globe is planning to move a spot news story
on the columnist and the last column by Patricia Smith for use by
New York Times News Service clients. For questions, call Frank
Perrotta at the Globe: (617) 929-2597.)  
 (ps)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A columnist at The Boston Globe, a Pulitzer Prize finalist,
fabricated people and quotations in four of her columns this year,
and the newspaper has asked for her resignation, The Globe
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, she made up nearly an entire column about a woman
dying of cancer, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said the columnist, Patricia Smith, 42, a widely
respected figure in the Boston area, had acknowledged the
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy,'' said Matthew Storin, The Globe's editor.
``And I feel that we have handled it in the only way we could, and
that itself speaks well for the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin added, ``There is no middle ground on something like
this. That was self-evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Storin said he had yet to receive Ms. Smith's letter of
resignation. But in Ms. Smith's final column, published in Friday's
issue of The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., she
acknowledges her misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time in my metro column, to create the desired
impact or slam home a salient point, I attributed quotes to people
who didn't exist,'' she said. She also apologized ``to the grocery
clerks and bartenders and single mothers, to the politicians, PR
flacks, spokespersons and secretaries, to my dear husband and
family and friends, I am sorry for betraying your trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith did not respond to messages left on her voice mail at
work, and her home telephone was out of service. Her lawyer, John
Williams of the Boston firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge, also did not respond to
voice-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time in Ms. Smith's career that her
credibility had come under fire. As an editorial assistant at The
Chicago Sun-Times in the late 1980s, she wrote a review of a
concert that she had not attended, a former colleague recalled. The
newspaper ran a correction, but she was not dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about Ms. Smith come just a week after The New
Republic published the results of an investigation into the work of
Stephen Glass, a staff writer, who it said had fabricated parts or
all of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for the magazine in two and a
half years.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said Friday's paper would also include a news article
about Ms. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we confirmed that we had the problem, we wanted to get
the information out as quickly as we could,'' said publisher
Benjamin Taylor. ``Credibility with our readership is the single
most important asset that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said it discovered Ms. Smith's fabrications two weeks
ago during normal monitoring by senior editors. Under the system,
which Storin said he established two and a half years ago, editors
occasionally double check columnists' sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had questions raised from time to time over the years
about metro columnists who have such freedom to write about
whatever they want _ street scenes, slices of life, etc.,'' Storin
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said editors discovered the fabrications earlier this month,
while Ms. Smith was on vacation, and confronted her when she
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We detected a few weeks ago that some quotes seemed too
articulate or too polished in certain circumstances,'' Storin said.
</P>
<P>
   The fabrications appeared in columns on April 13, 20, 24 and May
11. Storin said further research would be done into Ms. Smith's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fake people quoted in these columns was Janine Byrne,
whom Ms. Smith identified as ``a South End cosmetologist'' in her
April 24 article on Stephen Fagan, who is accused of kidnapping his
two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, The Globe said Ms. Smith created a woman named
Dorothy Gibson in her April 13 column about a little girl's Easter
experience. In the article, Ms. Smith gives this quotation from Ms.
Gibson: `` `Seems like that girl's feet grew a size since we bought
those,' said Carolyn's mom Dorothy Gibson. `You know, when they get
a certain age, nothing sits still.'''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for The Globe, Richard Gulla, said he did not know
whether other people in that article, including Carolyn, were
fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said Ms. Smith also acknowledged inventing Jim Burke,
a worker erecting barricades at the Boston Marathon, in her April
20 column; and Claire, for whom Ms. Smith did not give a last name,
the subject of a poignant column about a woman with cancer,
published on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claire has been thinking about dying for weeks now,'' Ms.
Smith wrote, ``ever since her doctor said the tragic word, ever
since she found out why she was so woefully tired all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether The New Republic's case influenced The Globe's
handling of the situation, Storin said: ``It reinforced the idea
that we had to get to the bottom of it but we were already on that
track. This process was well under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who began her newspaper career as a typist at The
Chicago Daily News, joined The Globe in 1990. She has been writing
a column for the Metro/Region section since 1994. This year, she
won an award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors for a
series of columns published in 1997. She was also nominated for a
Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year. A poet, she has been
widely recognized in the Boston arts community for her public
readings.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether The Globe knew about The Sun-Times incident,
Gregory Moore, The Globe's managing editor, said: ``We've tried to
establish that. We don't really know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe said Ms. Smith admitted the fabrications after being
questioned by Moore. Storin said that The Globe initially had
questions about six columns and that Ms. Smith admitted to
fabrications in four of them.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Thursday, Storin and Taylor told the news staff of
their request for Ms. Smith's resignation. ``There is no middle
ground on something like this,'' Storin said. ``That was
self-evident.''
</P>
<P>
   In her column Friday, Ms. Smith said she would ``survive this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will write as long as I breathe, despite the dire
predictions that this indiscretion spells the end of my career,''
she wrote.  &QL;

U.S. SOCCER TEAM COUNTING ON HEJDUK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France _ He wears his hair to his
shoulders. He proposed to his wife in the Pacific Ocean surf,
holding her with one hand and his surfboard with the other. Even
into last year, Frankie Hejduk struggled to determine whether his
profession would be surfing or soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, this free spirit was kicked off the U.S.
soccer team for missing a team flight to China. But his searing
speed, boldness in attack and renewed dedication have won him a
place on the World Cup squad. He provided the only scoring chance
in Monday's humbling 2-0 loss to Germany, and is expected to start
Sunday's crucial match against Iran in Lyons, where the Americans
hope that goals will come in bunches, like grapes.
</P>
<P>
   When given the nod at halftime on Monday, with the United States
trailing, 1-0, Hejduk (pronounced HAY-duck) searched for something
to wrest his team from its timid start. Baseball players break out
the rally caps, but soccer players don't wear hats, so Hejduk went
to his rally shorts, turning his game pants around, number facing
the back.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, he had practiced his trademark reggae dance in
his hotel room, just in case he scored a goal. And nine minutes
into the second half he launched a diving header that appeared to
be a certain score, only to be thwarted by a desperate reach from
the German goalkeeper, Andreas Kopke.
</P>
<P>
   Against Iran, the Americans will again need his assertive
efforts to get behind what is considered a penetrable defense. Goal
scoring figures prominently in the tie-breaker system used at the
World Cup. The Americans feel they must win by at least two goals
on Sunday and win or draw against Yugoslavia next Thursday to have
any chance of advancing to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk is expected to replace Mike Burns at right wing in
midfield, and coach Steve Sampson is considering whether to play
with two forwards instead of one. The idea is that the Americans
must be aggressive from the beginning and not lie back as they did
against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go up and down as much as we can, as fast as we
can,'' Hejduk said. ``We're going to have to play better than we
have in months to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics continue to swirl around this game the way hot-dog
wrappers swirl around ballparks. But politics don't seem to
resonate in the slightest with the 23-year-old Hejduk. He was only
5 in 1979 when the Americans were taken hostage at the U .S.
Embassy in Tehran. At the time, he said, he was into soccer,
surfing and recess.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew about the Great Satan appellation given to the
United States by Iran's conservative clerics, Hejduk said blankly,
``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   He had much the same incredulous reaction in January 1997, when
he did not hear his watch alarm, and he missed a team flight to
China. Infuriated, coach Steve Sampson dismissed Hejduk from the
team and planned never to call him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was finished,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk said that, at the time, he wasn't sure whether he
preferred soccer over surfing. A native of Cardiff, Calif., he had
been a state surfing champion in high school. And he had wanted a
surfboard, not room and board at some university, but his parents
convinced him that a soccer scholarship to UCLA was not an
opportunity to be wasted. Nor, he later realized, was a chance to
play in the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether I wanted to do this for a living or not,
but it kind of woke me up,'' Hejduk said of the China trip. ``I
realized the opportunity I was missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, Hejduk and Sampson met to clear the air.
Hejduk said he ``admitted my stupidity'' and convinced the coach
there would be no more China syndromes.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage and the birth of a son have brought maturity and
discipline to Hejduk, according to Sampson, who granted him a
second chance. And Hejduk says he now sets six alarm clocks instead
of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just doing it for me anymore,'' Hejduk said of his
family. ``Now I have someone to support and be a role model for.''
</P>
<P>
   His biography was not included in the 1998 soccer team media
guide. But Hejduk intrigued Sampson with his tireless running in a
1-0 victory over Brazil in February and scored in a 3-0 exhibition
victory over Austria in April. Then he missed the final four World
Cup tuneups with a hamstring injury and was nearly cut from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy again, he remains one of the few real American threats
with his ability to sprint ceaselessly down the wing. Except,
perhaps, for Cobi Jones, no one on the team can match Hejduk's
enduring speed. And few demonstrated the absolute fearlessness that
he showed against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lack of concern about who's on the other side,''
Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach has theorized that Hejduk gets his fearlessness in
soccer from surfing. And Hejduk believes there is no other
cardiovascular workout so effective. What do his surfing friends
think of soccer? They love it, Hejduk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them an excuse to go to bars to watch games,'' he
said. &QL;

STEWART ON TOP AFTER UNEVENT FUL FIRST ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most every player in this week's 98th U.S. Open
knows the eerie history of this tournament at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   They know why this notorious tract was dubbed ``the John Wilkes
Booth of golf courses'' after an unknown named Jack Fleck upset Ben
Hogan here in the 1955 national championship, and Billy Casper did
the same to Arnold Palmer in the '66 version.
</P>
<P>
   They also are well aware that the ominous San Andreas Fault lies
underneath the course's most scary stretch (Nos. 2-5), called
``Quake Corner.'' Escaping it without a bogey is almost unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Payne Stewart was so giddy after a 4-under
66 in Thursday's opening round, which was contested under very mild
conditions, at least in these parts. Yep, no wind, no fog and _
thank goodness _ no you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Thursday) was a day that you could get a good round of golf
in around here,'' noted Stewart, who held a 1-stroke lead over
unheralded Mark Carnevale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? The wind could be howling by tomorrow, and we could
have an earthquake running down the 18th fairway. So I'm going to
just sit back and relish this.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Stewart dared to utter the ``e'' word. Perhaps he had
earned the right, considering the 1991 Open champ was one of the
few who held his game together, chiefly by closing with three
straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tournament favorites were much more shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods absorbed two 3-putt bogeys, and a disasterous 4-putt
double bogey at the ninth hole, on his way to a 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually played very well, I just couldn't make the putts,''
said Woods, who would have been much worse if not for three birdies
on the front side, when he was briefly among the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champ Ernie Els also had his putting problems on
greens that, for the most part, were fairly moist and slow by
Olympic standards. His chances for a third national championship in
the past five years looked bleak after a 75.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, America's hottest player? He kept slipping and
sliding as he also could do no better than 75.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Casey Martin, making Open history when he became
the first player to ride these always-tight fairways with the aid
of a cart. Professional golf's ``Lone Rider,'' who needs the cart
because of a circulatory condition in his right leg, made the turn
at even par before a few bumps down the homestretch left him at 74.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a player who had it on cruise control, it was
Carnevale. He never made a bogey while carding a 67.
</P>
<P>
   The group at 68 also was plenty strong with the exception of
journeyman Joe Durant. They included Scottsdale's Tom Lehman, Bob
Tway and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   At 70 were Masters champ Mark O'Meara; last year's Open
runner-up, Colin Montgomerie; Paradise Valley's Andrew Magee; and
U.S. Amateur champ Matt Kuchar, who also played well at The
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   British Open champ Justin Leonard and Paradise Valley's Phil
Mickelson were lurking in a pack at 71.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, only nine players in the field of 156 managed
to break par.
</P>
<P>
   Even Stewart made several references to his first 18 holes being
``lucky.'' That would be an accurate assessment, considering three
of his birdies came from the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never drove it off line huge, where I had to chip out of the
deep rough except for the 18th,'' Stewart said. ``That was a
horrible 2-iron (off the tee) there.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievably, he caught a good lie and managed to smack an
8-iron to 12 feet for his fifth and final birdie of the day against
one bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave myself a lot of chances, and I was very patient, which
is what you have to be at a United States Open,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has finished third, second and third in the past
three Opens, was cautiously optimistic about his 68, which included
three birdies on his last four holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to put the ball in the fairway,'' said Lehman, who
had rallied back from a double bogey at No. 10. ``I know the fans
are rooting for me after all the near-misses, but I'm going to
forget about winning it until the 72nd hole on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how fickle the Olympic Club can be, there seems no other
way to approach it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Leeland McElroy, a second-round draft pick by the Cardinals in
1996, was released Thursday after several attempts to trade him
failed.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy, from Texas A&AMP;M, struggled during his two seasons. He
became expendable with the off-season additions of running backs
Adrian Murrell, Mario Bates and draftee Michael Pittman, plus kick
returner/wide receiver Terry Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made significant moves at the running back position in
the off-season,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said. ``Leeland
became a victim of the numbers game. It was in the best interest of
Leeland and the team to take action now instead of later.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McElroy gained 424 yards on 135 carries for an
average of 3.1 yards a carry. He scored two touchdowns and started
eight games for a team that was the NFL's worst rushing team.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy's release will cost the Cardinals only $100,000 for
salary-cap purposes.
</P>
<P>
   They have signed all but their top two 1998 draft picks, Andre
Wadsworth and Corey Chavous, after Thursday's signing of former
Arizona State player Pat Tillman, a seventh-round draft pick. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jason Gore's opening drive at his first U.S.
Open got rid of his jitters. And his third shot gave everyone in
his gallery shivers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Gore's second shot that set the tone for his round
Thursday at the Olympic Club's Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   It was a doozy, a 4-iron that landed in a spot that might as
well have been Alcatraz. His lie in a tangle of bushes and
Monterrey pine branches was unplayable, so Gore took a one-stroke
penalty and got a free drop in return. Some handout it turned out
to be; his golf ball landed in lethal _ but legal _ rough 65 yards
from the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's next shot was arguably the best one anybody had Thursday.
The graduate of Hart High in Newhall, a Los Angeles suburb, chipped
onto the green with his wedge and the ball rolled 50 feet and
disappeared in the cup. It was the first of two birdies Gore had en
route to a 7-over-par 77.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most exciting thing I've ever seen,'' said Gore's
mother Kathy, who was easy to pick out of the crowd in her ``Gore's
Gallery'' shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a first-year pro on the Nike Tour, hit eight of 14
fairways, so he reasoned his score should have been lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed with the way I played,'' he said. ``I
was not capitalizing on the opportunities I had.''
</P>
<P>
   He missed the green with his tee shot on the par-3 third hole
and wound up with a triple bogey. His tee shot on the par-5 16th
landed in the fairway and he walked away with a double bogey, which
in his mind might as well have been a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have made a birdie from the middle of the fairway,''
Gore, 24, said.
</P>
<P>
   His approach shots posed problems all day. Club selection was a
real guessing game because of the adrenaline coarsing through his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was so nervous when he stepped to the first tee box, he
barely could breathe. He looked heavenward and instantly felt, at
once, better and sadder.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father Sheldon died of a heart attack last September,
shortly after Gore emerged victorious in the California State Open
and the California State Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about him all the time,'' said the former Pepperdine
standout. ``I know he's watching me, but I kind of wish he was here
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Gore would have been proud of how his only son handled
himself. There were no angry outbursts, no emphatic club tosses,
just one ear-to-ear grin that, like the marine layer overhead,
stayed put throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks happy to be here,'' one fan told Gore's mother as the
golfer walked from the eighth green to the ninth tee.
</P>
<P>
   Replied Kathy with a grin that matched her son's, ``He is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daly Show: Before John Daly teed off, he made an important
decision. He left his driver in his bag.
</P>
<P>
   For Daly, parting with his driver is like Sampson cutting off
his hair, like Popeye giving up spinach. However, conservative golf
is the best golf at the U.S. Open, even for Daly, perhaps the
game's longest hitter. And by replacing his driver with a 3-wood,
Daly showed a newfound maturity and shot himself into contention.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting an opening-round 69, Daly was three strokes off the
lead, threatening to win the third major of his career. It was the
first time he had played a round at a major without his driver
since the 1993 PGA Championship at Inverness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, but it's challenging,'' Daly said. ``Whenever
I can't use my driver for 18 holes, it's not good for the fans. But
it's the only way to play this course, and I believe it's the only
way I have a chance to play really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods eight back: Tiger Woods shot a four-over-par 74, including
one four-putt and two three-putts. He was two-under par after eight
holes, but he double-bogeyed the par-4 ninth with a four-putt,
including a miss from about 3{ feet. Woods also bogeyed Nos. 12,
13, 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a lot of shots out there,'' said Woods, who used his
driver only three times. ``I hit the ball pretty well, but I didn't
make enough putts. I'm just trying to stay patient.''

SWEEP DEAL FOR D-BACKS  
 AGGRESSIVE ANDERSON TOPS REDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In the city where the Big Red Machine once ruled
the baseball world, it seemed a bit strange that an expansion team
could sweep a road series.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Turquoise Machine? The Big Purple Machine? The Big
Copper Machine?
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are not quite ready for that kind of notoriety,
nor will they be for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   But after Thursday's 4-2 victory at Cinergy Field completed a
three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds, the Diamondbacks hope the
momentum carries into the remaining five games of this eight-game
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Brian Anderson came through with a gritty
seven-inning effort in which he held the Reds scoreless on two
hits. He also singled and provided spark on the basepaths by
scoring two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (25-47) begins a three-game series tonight in St. Louis
against the Cardinals. The Reds (30-43) became further embedded in
the National League Central Division cellar.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was achieved in sweltering conditions. Temperature
at game time was 82, but on the artificial turf it had to be at
least 10-15 degrees higher. In addition, the game started at 12:35
p.m. local time after a night game Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of a game like that, the way the guys responded,''
said Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter. ``We had a quick
turnaround and the guys, particularly the veterans, wanted to go
for the sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's big day came in front of a group of family and
friends from his home area in northern Ohio while he was battling
the onset of a cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It figures. The middle of the summer and I have to get a
cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived at the park on Thursday, he got some advice from
right-hander Andy Benes, who kept the Reds in check in similar
conditions on Wednesday night by giving up one run on five hits in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy said, `Don't try to pace yourself. Just go out there from
the get-go and see how long you can last,' '' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   To help him win for the fourth time in his past five starts,
Anderson (5-6) also took a page out of the pitching book of
left-hander Omar Daal, who beat the Reds on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Daal's) curveball was working real well against them, so I
figured I might as well try it,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He figured he might as well try to be aggressive on the
basepaths, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, he followed a leadoff double by catcher
Kelly Stinnett with a sacrifice bunt off right-hander Scott
Klingenbeck (1-2). First baseman Eduardo Perez fielded the ball and
tried to get Stinnett at third, but the throw was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson advanced to second when Klingenbeck hit Andy Fox with a
pitch (Fox also was hit by Jeff Shaw in the ninth). Devon White hit
a single to center, scoring Stinnett easily.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson came steaming into third, slowed when third-base coach
Brian Butterfield waited to make the signal and had to shift into
high gear again when Butterfield waved him home. Anderson hit the
dirt and slid a leg between the shin guards of catcher Eddie
Taubensee.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Anderson led off with an infield hit. White hit a
single to left-center with one out and Anderson challenged the arm
of left fielder Dmitri Young, who threw the ball into the dugout
and allowed Anderson to score.
</P>
<P>
   Of his aggressive baserunning, Anderson said, ``I try to be a
baseball player, not just a pitcher who goes from station to
station.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter had mixed feelings about Anderson's aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a gunslinger and you want him to live to fight
another day. But the same things you're cautious about are the same
things you like about him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Karim Garcia's ground-rule double made it 4-0 in the
eighth, Showalter went to right-hander Russ Springer, who gave up
two runs on three hits. Right-hander Gregg Olson rescued Springer
by striking out Taubensee to end the inning, then returned in the
ninth to set down the Reds in order and record his second save in
two games and 10th overall. &QL;

EAST VALLEY GIVES `WAKE-UP CALL' TO PHOENIX CIVIC PLAZA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Cohn issued the warning more than a year ago: ``Phoenix
is no longer a first-tier convention city, and a strong argument
can be made that it is no longer a second-tier convention city
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cohn, managing director of the Crowne Plaza Hotel in
downtown Phoenix, stands by those words and says the city's
convention center could be headed for even tougher times.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the plans being unveiled Friday for a major
East Valley convention center and football stadium are ``a wake-up
call'' to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Phoenix already have opened their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Said one city official, envisioning competition from a sparkling
new East Valley convention center and stadium nestled amid open
space, maybe near a town lake, ``I'm not so confident we'd win the
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Civic Plaza has about 330,000 square feet of exhibit
space, trailing smaller cities such as Anaheim and Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Trade Show and Convention Guide'' for
1997-98, the size of the Civic Plaza ranks 29th &UR; nationally. But
exclude the outdoor Symphony Hall terrace &UR; and the Civic Plaza would
not crack the nation's top 30.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio said the Civic Plaza is
vulnerable, not only to the East Valley's plans but to those in
other cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City of Phoenix is slowly but surely moving out of the
competitive position,'' DiCiccio said. ``The city missed the chance
two years ago to build a bigger convention center to make us more
competitive in the national scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn points to an exhibit hall list that placed Phoenix at No.
13 in 1990, ranking the size of the country's convention centers.
By 1993, Phoenix slipped to 34 and reportedly has fallen even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a new convention center that competes with and
takes some business from the Civic Plaza is something Phoenix
officials are watching closely.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn noted that the problem for Phoenix officials is not just
what is happening down the road in the East Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to be concerned on a national level. They compete
nationally for national conventions,'' he said. ``Phoenix does not
have a competitive facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash, said David Krietor, director of Phoenix's Community and
Economic Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If the East Valley convention center opened its doors, ``We
would be concerned. The Civic Plaza is essential to the viability
of downtown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if a new convention center does sprout, Phoenix will do what
it can to keep its hold on the Valley convention business. He said
competing against the Phoenix Civic Plaza ``will be like trying to
climb Mount Everest with your fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the size of the Civic Plaza doesn't compare to other
centers in the larger cities, but a look at the whole package shows
downtown amenities from sports arenas to museums within walking
distance _ and a recent $32-million face lift. Two planned downtown
hotels should help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Given the size of the facility and the number of hotel
rooms downtown, we're certainly not in the top tier'' of convention
cities, said Kevin Hill, marketing director for the Civic Plaza.
``Even with the new hotel rooms planned, we're at best a
second-tier city. That's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like Krietor, he said there are other factors to make up
for that disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Local convention figures show 50 conventions booked into the
Civic Plaza in fiscal 1997-98, which ends June 30. That would
compare with 43, 49 and 62 in the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at convention business Valley-wide _ including, but not
limited to, Civic Plaza _ total conventions booked, convention
attendees and convention ``room nights'' are all up considerably
from last year, according to local figures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The size of the Civic Plaza is an issue,'' Krietor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza said Thursday, ``We've had a lot of
discussions internally'' about how to expand the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The city already purchased more than eight acres at the old
Phoenix Union High School campus. One of the reasons: to possibly
use it for expansion of the Civic Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   If 200,000 or 300,000 square feet of meeting and exhibit space
were built at the old campus at Seventh Street and Van Buren,
Krietor said the plaza could double-book, hosting some events at
the plaza and some at the nearby campus.
</P>
<P>
   If the East Valley plan becomes reality, Hill said, the Phoenix
Civic Plaza will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it take some business away? Absolutely,'' Hill said. ``Is
it competition? Anything is competition. Is it going to empty out
our place? No.'' &QL;

CLAIRE COOL ON MORE TRADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said
Thursday that budget concerns make it unlikely the club will trade
to fill holes created by the rash of recent injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are not expected to have their ace Ramon Martinez
(shoulder) back soon, if at all. They also lost Todd Hollandsworth
to season-ending shoulder surgery last week. The Dodgers are
playing Eric Karros (left knee) and Bobby Bonilla (left wrist, left
Achilles) despite injuries. Both will be hobbled for the rest of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Karros played Thursday and drove in five runs in the Dodgers'
5-0 victory over Colorado. Bonilla did not start. Neither did
second baseman Eric Young (right thigh) and center fielder Raul
Mondesi (left ankle). But the Dodgers took on $11 million in extra
salary when they made the May 15 trade with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Claire said adding to a payroll that is up to $58 million
prohibits movement and would require approval from the new owners
at Fox and club president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out making phone calls because for one thing _ and
there is a very practical side and that is our payroll,'' he said.
``The budget I had was increased when the trade was made. We have
made a major move. That is a factor. If there is a move to be made
it would not be dictated by me. That would have to come from Bob
and from Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Russell? Claire's role in determining the future of
manager Bill Russell also appears diminished by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing speculation that Russell's job is in jeopardy if
the team's record does not improve, Claire applauded the manager's
effort given the team's injury problem.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he would fight to keep Russell in the
manager's spot, Claire said: ``I'm not going to comment on that.
We're in a battle right now. There is no question that Billy is
making every effort with this team. But I'm not going to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, Young out: Mondesi, who sprained his left ankle
crashing into the outfield fence in the third inning Wednesday,
thought he would be ready to play Thursday. But when he awoke, the
ankle was badly swollen and he was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't walk on it,'' said Mondesi, who could miss the next
few games. ``You never like sitting out games, especially at Coors
Field. But this is not something that you can play through. I went
out and played a few more innings after I hurt it. Maybe I
shouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mondesi made an over-the-shoulder catch on a drive by San
Diego's Tony Gwynn, the left ankle buckled under the weight of his
body. He tried to brace himself as he hit the wall with his right
knee and suffered a slight strain. He was treated for both
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Young also hoped to be back to play his former team, but his
strained right thigh has not improved. The disabled list has been
considered, but Young, who first injured the leg May 21, has
responded to rest in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hooray for Jaime: Dodgers Spanish language broadcaster Jaime
Jarrin, who will be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame next
month, will receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Jarrin,
with the Dodgers for 40 years, joins broadcaster Vin Scully, who
received his star in 1982.
