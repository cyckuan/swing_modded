SKIMMING WINS PACIFIC CLASSIC AT DEL MAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ General Challenge had the star power and
Tiznow had the trendy support going into Saturday's 10th Pacific
Classic, but Skimming had the most important factor of all on his
side. He had trainer Bobby Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel won the $1 million Pacific Classic, Del Mar's premier
event, for the fifth time as Skimming _ the third choice of bettors
_ led from gate to wire under Garret Gomez, who scored the biggest
win of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just start calling this race the Pacific Frankel
Classic,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux, who finished third aboard
Ecton Park, behind Tiznow and a half-length ahead of even-money
favorite General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give him my first call for the race next year right now.
Who's he running? I want to ride him.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel previously won the Pacific Classic with Missionary Ridge
(1992), Bertrando (1993) and Tinners Way (1994, 1995), but the
trainer can take extra pride in Skimming, a major reclamation
project from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming began his career in France in the fall of 1998, but
struggled on turf and lost his first four races. Juddmonte Farms,
which owns Skimming, put him under Frankel's care in California.
There, the colt was able to use the bleeder medication Lasix, which
is banned overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming became a Pacific Classic contender with wins in three
of his first five races under Frankel, including an eight-length
victory in the San Diego Handicap on Aug. 6. But Frankel faced
questions as to whether the colt's early speed could hold up over
1\ miles.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Skimming set the pace with good position at the
rail, but longshot Forty One Carats and second choice Tiznow stayed
right with him, never more than a length behind over the first
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming took control at the top of the stretch and held off
late runs from Tiznow and Ecton Park for a two-length victory,
Frankel's seventh stakes win of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has demonstrated that he is one of the best
trainers in the world,'' said Prince Ahmad Abdullah, son of
Juddmonte owner Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had basically written (Skimming) off, but not totally.
Bobby did a good job of making him as good as you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and Gomez didn't shy away from using Skimming's speed.
In fact, they challenged the other horses to keep up on a track
that tends to favor speed to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see (other horses) struggling to keep up with you,''
Frankel said, ``and then when you turn for home, they're struggling
just like you are. (Skimming) ran a great race. I love the little
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that seemed to surprise Frankel was that bettors
didn't think more of Skimming, who went off at 9-2 despite his
impressive recent credentials. General Challenge received much of
the prerace attention, as the Bob Baffert-trained gelding attempted
to repeat his victory in last year's Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge went off as the favorite, with Laffit Pincay a
late replacement for regular rider Corey Nakatani, who suffered a
hairline fracture of his left collarbone two races before the
Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay kept the gelding in good position for much of the race
and seemed poised to make a move at the top of the stretch, but the
run never came. General Challenge has now lost three consecutive
races, all as the post-time favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really pay attention to what (Pincay) was doing,
because they were all behind me,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Pacific Classic is old hat to Frankel, but it was
Gomez's first stakes victory. Gomez got the ride for the first time
at the San Diego Handicap, when previous riders Alex Solis and
Victor Espinoza were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez is not likely to give up on Skimming anytime soon, as the
horse will now likely be pointed toward the $4 million Breeders'
Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Skimming) answered every question,'' Gomez said. ``There was
a matter of the distance, but he answered that one. I never hit
him, not once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what would have happened if a horse had come to
him late and I had to hit him, but he might have had another gear
yet. He was trying, all the way. This is the biggest win of my
career, no doubt about it.'' &QL;

PINCAY DOESN'T HAVE TO WIN TO HAVE FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay got beat in the Pacific Classic
on Saturday but seemed to have fun anyway. You might have forgotten
it could work that way for the winningest jockey of all time.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, the highlights of Pincay's great career have been
painted by the numbers, chronicled with a calculator. There was the
heroic drive for victory No.8,000 (accomplished at Del Mar Aug. 29,
1993). The drama of the record-tying No.8,833 (Hollywood Park, Dec.
9, 1999). The ecstasy of No.8,834 (the next day). And lately the
climb toward 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   As if the wins are all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   But something important had been missing as Pincay grew into the
role of elder statesman among the nation's elite riders. When it
came to the major races, the ones that really get the blood
pumping, the 53-year-old Panamanian had gotten used to being passed
over by horse owners and trainers in favor of younger jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   The snub is, well, an old story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been riding in the big races,'' said a
matter-of-fact Pincay, who hadn't had a mount in the Pacific
Classic since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why, when Corey Nakatani was injured in a heavy
fall an hour before the 10th Pacific Classic, leaving favorite and
defending champion General Challenge without a jockey, Pincay
didn't expect to be named as the replacement.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been the only one.
</P>
<P>
   When Nakatani and a filly named Candace in Paris went down after
clipping another horse's heels on the turn for home in the sixth
race, and Nakatani went to the hospital with a hairline fracture of
his left collarbone, everybody with a program in his pocket turned
to the jockey standings and knew Pincay was the best alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay was tied for second with 21 wins at Del Mar. Of the top
nine, only Pincay, Alex Solis (out of town) and Tyler Baze (a
17-year-old apprentice) weren't locked into other Pacific Classic
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge's trainer, Bob Baffert, didn't hesitate to
choose Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have to use a lifeline,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Del Mar managed to prolong the unexpected drama. The
horses were coming into the saddling paddock, less than 20 minutes
before the $1 million race, and the bettors hadn't been told who'd
be riding the even-money favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's riding, Bob?'' a couple of guys yelled at Baffert as he
ambled into the walking ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laffit,'' Baffert shouted back. A small hurrah erupted among
the fans close enough to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Trevor Denman made the announcement, and the public
murmured its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay strode out of the jockeys' room and a television
interviewer stuck a microphone in his face. All eyes were on the
muscular little man in the burgundy and gold of Golden Eagle Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I made the right move,'' Baffert told him, ``because
as soon as your name was announced, everybody cheered.'' Pincay
beamed.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's third race, he had ridden the Del Mar-loving mare
Theresa's Tizzy to a gritty victory in a $150,000 sprint. That was
No.8,971, and he would add one to that tally later on.
</P>
<P>
   Could he get General Challenge to the wire in front in the
all-important eighth race, in what would have been Pincay's first
million-dollar victory since he won the 1993 Breeders' Cup Juvenile
Fillies at Santa Anita aboard Phone Chatter?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he couldn't. But it was hardly Pincay's fault. General
Challenge just wasn't good enough Saturday to handle Skimming.
Pincay put the 4-year-old in position to win. General Challenge
couldn't stay with the front-runner in the stretch and finished
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very difficult to ride. To put Laffit in that situation
is tough,'' Baffert said. Then the trainer dispelled the notion
that General Challenge lost because Pincay had never ridden him
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look quite right coming down the stretch,'' Baffert
said of the horse, not the jockey. ``Something happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, reporters gathered around Pincay, just as they did in
the good old days when it wouldn't have been a major race without
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't fire today,'' Pincay said of General Challenge.
``When he got in the clear, I expected a big finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay didn't get his big finish. But he got a shot at glory.
That was something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it would have been nicer to win it,'' he said. ``But it
was nice.'' &QL;

SKIMMING WINS PACIFIC CLASSIC AT DEL MAR

Eds: Fixes spelling of Garrett Gomez's name in 2nd graf (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

DEFENSE STEALS SHOW IN TEXAS TECH'S WIN AGAINST NEW MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ As have many this summer who ply their trade
through the friendly skies, Air Raider last night experienced its
share of system glitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mike Leach era at Texas Tech nevertheless got off the
ground as the Red Raiders defeated New Mexico, 24-3, in the
inaugural Transamerica Hispanic College Fund Classic before an
announced crowd of 42,238.
</P>
<P>
   Leach's pass-happy offensive scheme had few stellar moments,
producing 186 passing yards and only 255 yards total offense.
Quarterback Kliff Kingsbury completed 21 of 47 passes for 186 yards
and two touchdown passes _ 6 yards to running back Ricky Williams
and 8 yards to wideout Derek Dorris. But the expected explosion did
not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play well and made too many bad reads,'' Kingsbury
said. ``We had some opportunities to get our offense going. I just
don't feel like I played well enough to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech coordinator Greg McMackin's new defense stole the spotlight
and iced the victory with a 63-yard touchdown return on a fumble
recovery by defensive end Aaron Hunt with 8 minutes, 22 seconds in
the fourth quarter. Tech defenders limited the Lobos to 167 yards
total offense and also held on downs late in the game after New
Mexico had first-and-goal from the two after a pass-interference
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the defense rose to the occasion and shut
them down,'' Leach said. ``Offense and special teams need to get
better. We expect to get better, no question about it. We need to
polish and protect the quarterback better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's rumble with the fumble was the play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Down 17-3, New Mexico grasped what proved to be its last chance
to get back into the game when David Mauer blocked Eric Rosiles'
punt to set the Lobos up at the Tech 30. On third-and-nine,
quarterback Jeremy Denson moved left on the option and was covered
by black shirts. End Devon Lemons knocked the ball loose, Hunt
picked it up and was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also produced three pivotal plays in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``McMackin has them playing like their hair is on fire,'' New
Mexico coach Rocky Long said.
</P>
<P>
   On New Mexico's first possession of the second half, the Red
Raiders held on fourth-and-three from their 17 when Denson bobbled
the snap and the play lost 4 yards. That prevented New Mexico from
answering Tech's 72-yard scoring drive that opened the third
quarter, capped by Kingsbury's 8-yard scoring pass on a slant
pattern to Dorris.
</P>
<P>
   Tech cornerback Antwan Alexander, the Raiders' player of the
game, then turned in big plays on successive series. He went high
to come down with an interception of a deep pass off Denson's arm
at the Raiders' 3-yard-line. Then, after New Mexico had taken over
on an interception at the Tech 21, Alexander picked up a loose
fumble at the 7-yard line and returned the ball down the left side
to the end zone. But officials called a clip by linebacker Dorian
Pitts on the return, and the ball was brought back to the New
Mexico 39.
</P>
<P>
   Tech couldn't score and settled for Chris Birkholz's 33-yard
field goal with 33 seconds left in the third quarter for the 17-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tech led 7-3 at the half after New Mexico's Vladimir Borombozin
kicked a 49-yard field goal on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored Tech's only first-half touchdown, taking a short
toss in the right flat and scoring untouched from the 6-yard line
at 6:44 of the first quarter. Williams' first touchdown reception
of his career came on the fourth play of a 40-yard drive after a
short New Mexico punt. The Lobos failed to move to a first down
after Tech's Shaud Williams downed Rosiles' 57-yard punt at the New
Mexico 1-yard line. \Nsubheds:Briefly Texas Tech leads the all-time
series with New Mexico 30-5-2 and has won the past seven games
against the Lobos. ... The Red Raiders wore new black uniforms. ...
Tech officials relented yesterday afternoon and lifted a local
television blackout they had imposed Thursday because of lagging
ticket sales. ... Running back Ricky Williams played the entire
game without apparent problems with his rehabilitated left knee,
gaining 78 yards on 15 carries ... Derek Dorris led all receivers
with 4 catches for 53 yards.

SOONERS QUARTERBACK HASN'T CHANGED DESPITE THE EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ Greater expectations don't appear to bother
Oklahoma quarterback Josh Heupel a pip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh remembers that before everyone knew him as Josh Heupel
the Oklahoma quarterback, they were skeptical of what he could do,
and he didn't give that much thought then,'' teammate and roommate
Josh Norman said. ``Now that people do know who Josh is and they're
expecting big things of him, he still doesn't pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The same guy as always looks back from whatever mirror Heupel
happens to see himself in, Norman explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh can't forget who he was, what it took to get him here,''
he said. ``And he knows it will take the same thing to keep him
here and keep him constantly getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do what it takes. And if that means not paying attention
to whatever people are saying about him, not paying attention to
what they expect of him, then that's what he's going to do. The
first thing that I think of when I think of Josh Heupel is
dedication. Dedication to anything he does, regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Record-setting Sooners quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Strong arm. Quick mind.
</P>
<P>
   The player who more than anyone else is responsible for the
sense among eager OU fans that the Sooners are on the verge of
reasserting themselves as one of college football's elite programs.
Son of a small-town football coach from the northeast corner of
South Dakota who seldom reads the sports pages or watches sports on
television, yet is acutely conscious of the position to which he
has been thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``God puts people in certain situations,'' Heupel said
matter-of-factly. ``I've done nothing to create all this, and I
realize what a blessing this all has been. But I enjoy the position
I'm in and the responsibility placed on my shoulders. I'm humbled
by this every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations of myself are no different than they have ever
been. The only thing that has changed is the expectations of the
fans and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Justifiably so. An unknown quarterback from an obscure junior
college (Snow) in Utah, the left-hander emerged last season in OU's
pass-happy offense to become the Big 12 offensive newcomer of the
year. He set school and conference season passing records for
attempts (500), completions (310), yards (3,460) and touchdown
passes (30) in leading the Sooners to a 7-5 record and their first
bowl appearance in five seasons. He also set and reset five OU
single-game passing marks.
</P>
<P>
   Spring ratings from National Football Scouting Inc. _ a firm
that provides analyses to NFL teams _ ranks him behind only
Purdue's Drew Brees among this year's crop of senior college
quarterbacks. He is a major reason why the Sooners at No. 19 are
ranked in The Associated Press preseason poll for the first time in
five years and are picked as the major contender to Texas for the
Big 12 South crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations of Josh as well as of our offense is that
both should be better,'' Sooners coach Bob Stoops said. ``There are
several factors that should help Josh improve. He's worked hard on
strength, conditioning, technique and fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fond of comparing people, but he has that \Rformer
Florida quarterback\S Danny Wuerfel-type poise and calm. I see that
in Josh. Danny didn't have a strong arm, but he had touch and so
does Josh. And they both have great minds for getting you out of a
bad play into a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to Heupel's sensed improvement this season is new
quarterback coach and passing-game coordinator Chuck Long, the
former Iowa quarterback who won the Davey O'Brien and Maxwell
trophies in 1985 and spent eight seasons in the NFL. Long in effect
filled the slot of former OU assistant Mike Leach, now head coach
at Texas Tech, after five seasons on the Iowa staff.
</P>
<P>
   Though Leach and Heupel were close, and shared endless hours in
discussion and film study, Long has brought a new dimension to
Heupel's game _ both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Leach and I had a good working relationship,'' Heupel
said. ``His door was always open and once you spend a lot of time
with a person, you tend to think a lot alike. We had the same views
on offense. But coach Long and I can share experiences as
quarterbacks that coach Leach and I didn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful not to step on any toes, Long agreed that having played
the position helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of very good coaches who have not played the
game, but who have studied the game and know what they're doing,''
Long said. ``But there is a rapport there \Rbetween a former
quarterback and pupil\S that no one else has.''
</P>
<P>
   You notice things others don't. When he joined the Sooners'
staff in December, before the Independence Bowl, Long immediately
began refining Heupel's throwing mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh was a chronic back-foot thrower,'' Long said. ``He was
awfully accurate last year but could have been even more accurate
not throwing off his back foot as much. Getting more weight balance
in your drop and setup, you can follow through better.
Follow-through creates accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when you throw off your back foot, your arm wears down
over the course of the season. We want Josh strong in the fourth
quarter and strong at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Long was immediately impressed with Heupel's dedication and
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is as good as I have seen at this level as far as work
ethic and being a student of the game,'' Long said. ``And he's a
lot better than a lot of them at the next level. If he carries that
through for the rest of his career, it will be extended for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Heupel does not like to talk about himself and is a little
embarrassed by the Heisman hype. But that doesn't mean he is not
mindful of the aura surrounding what could be his legacy in the
glorious history of Oklahoma football, which is on graphic display
in the 7,000-square-foot Legends Lobby in the Barry Switzer Center
that also houses team facilities adjacent to Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Included among the memorabilia are tributes to OU's three former
Heisman Trophy winners _ Billy Vessels (1952), Steve Owens (1969)
and Billy Sims (1978).
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk through the Switzer Center every day,'' Heupel said.
``One reason I came to Oklahoma was because of the tradition of
success you see in those rooms. I realize the great history, and to
me that places a great responsibility on my shoulders to uphold
that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Should he win the Heisman, Heupel said, ``It won't be based
really on anything I do but putting the team in a position to win
every Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   That he has already done. \Ntagtop:Mike Jones, (817) 390-7760

BELCHER CLOSER TO RETURNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Right-hander Tim Belcher, sidelined since July
3 with recurring problems with his surgically-repaired right flexor
muscle, will make a rehab start today for Single-A Lake Elsinore
and figures to make an immediate return to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take what I'm throwing now out there on the mound,''
Belcher said Saturday. ``It feels pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia isn't quite as optimistic _ ``More likely,
he'll need one more (rehab start),'' said Scioscia. ``You can't
rule anything out with Tim. He's worked very hard. And he's
maintained his stuff more than at any time this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who will have a limit of 90 to 100 pitches today, has
pitched a handful of simulated games and thrown in the bullpen
since his latest setback. He's started just four games this season,
going 2-2. But he's allowed 14 earned runs in 13 innings, a 9.69
earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get back on the mound and pitch,'' said Belcher,
38, who has 144 wins in the big leagues in 12 seasons. ``I want to
help this team win. We've got a chance to be playing in October,
and I want to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels wouldn't mind either. Belcher has a 3-1 record in
League Championship play and a 1-0 World Series record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, I'm not worried,'' said Belcher, who's signed
through this season and the Angels have an option for 2001. ``If I
finish September strong, and I'm productive, that's enough for me.
I'd rest a lot easier in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   NO CLOSER, YET: Don't look for reliever Troy Percival to return
to his closer role just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Two reasons: One, he only returned to the active roster Saturday
after 18 days on the disabled list because of tendinitis in his
right elbow, and, two, Shigetoshi Hasegawa has done well in his
absence (2-1, five saves, 0.51 ERA, 21 strikeouts his last 22
appearances).
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work him in slowly,'' Scioscia said before Saturday
night's game. ``We'll try to get him an inning that's not a save
situation and go from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Percival's) anxious to pitch,'' Scioscia said. ``I don't
think he's that concerned about whether or not he closes.''
</P>
<P>
   CANDY MAN: Former big leaguer Candy Maldonado, who's working
tonight's game for ESPN's Spanish-language telecast, dropped by
both clubhouses before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado and Scioscia were teammates with the Dodgers in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   HAIR TODAY ...: Someone wondered if Scioscia had ``grayed'' much
during the course of his first season as a big-league manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at the color so much,'' he said, doffing his
Angels cap and revealing an increasingly receding hairline, ``but I
am counting the strands of hair I'm losing.'' &QL;

RED SOX GET THEIR KICKS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ROYALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ A night after Sox starter Jeff Fassero verbally
kicked his boss for pulling him out of a game, another starter,
Rolando Arrojo, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night lasted no longer than Fassero. But
Arrojo kicked an object instead of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, who was coasting after the Sox seized a 4-0 lead in
their first at-bat, turned on himself after giving up a two-out,
two-run homer to Johnny Damon in the fifth. When he reached the
dugout after the inning, the generally placid Arrojo kicked in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he kicked a bucket,'' manager Jimy Williams said. ``I
just told him not to drink the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo wasn't sure what he kicked _ a fence, a bucket, a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even looking,'' he said through one of the world's
most highly paid translators, Pedro Martinez. ``I just kicked. I
was frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches into the sixth, he was gone, lost for the night with
a right ankle contusion.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Sox, they were not lost without him, as they
were bolstered yet again by the league's stingiest bullpen and
outlasted the Royals, 5-3, before 30,199 at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Sox a half-game ahead of Cleveland in the
American League wild-card race and dropped Oakland a full game
behind. Boston stayed three games behind the Yankees in the AL
East.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe posted his 31st save, despite a ``Twilight Zone''
episode in which he balked by turning to throw to first to hold on
a runner, Gregg Zaun, who already had stolen second.
</P>
<P>
   That put Zaun at third with two outs and the ever-dangerous
Damon representing the tying run at the plate. With Lowe grinning
sheepishly, Williams rushed to the mound to settle him down.
</P>
<P>
   The manager joked to Lowe that he must have allowed Zaun to take
third because he wanted to pitch from the windup. ``I didn't want
him to focus on what just happened,'' Williams said. ``I wanted to
get him back on the hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon grounded out, and Lowe finished his 50th game of the
season, after Hipolito Pichardo and Rich Garces set him up. He said
afterward he never checks runners because the Sox don't try to hold
them at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mental mistake,'' he said. ``Luckily, it didn't come
back to haunt us.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also something mental about Arrojo's mistake. But he
said the injury was minor and would not force him to miss his next
start, which is a good sign for the Sox since they have won all
five games he has started since he lost his Sox debut July 30.
</P>
<P>
   He scattered five hits and didn't allow a walk for the first
time since he joined the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo credited Martinez in part for his improved control. Just
before he started the game, Martinez advised Arrojo to ``block out
everything else and just pitch straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he didn't think straight in the sixth. ``I have never
done that before,'' he said of his kung fu moment. ``It was
something that just happened. I felt bad because I made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when he sat in the dugout after the kick, he said to
Martinez, ``Why am I doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   He threw two pitches in the sixth, retiring Mike Sweeney before
summoning Williams. ``I wanted to stay in the game,'' he said,
``but I thought I could help the team better by just telling the
manager what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams agreed. ``That was the smart thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Sox scored all the runs they needed in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after Royals starter Brian Meadows frustrated the
Sox, holding them to one run in 6 2/3 innings of relief in a 7-5
Royals victory at Fenway, Boston hitters struck swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   After Jose Offerman slapped a single to left to open the game,
Brian Daubach took Meadows to the waterfall beyond the right-field
fence, a 418-foot shot that gave the Sox a 2-0 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Daubach's 19th. And it was unusual, in that
Daubach has developed a habit of going deep when the Sox need it
most in the late innings. Of his 70 RBIs, 32 have come in the
seventh inning or later.
</P>
<P>
   The homer was particularly sweet for Daubach because he crushed
it in front of his family and many friends, who motored to the game
from his hometown of Belleville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   They had seen the Sox lose, 6-2, the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off a tough loss, it's always good to score early in
the game,'' Daubach said. ``It was a big lift for everyone, and it
helped Arrojo relax a little bit. He did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, who went 3 for 4, improving his average to
.373 after returning from a three-game absence because of a
strained left hamstring, followed Daubach's shot with a single to
center. He moved to third on Troy O'Leary's double, and Scott
Hatteberg drove in both Garciaparra and O'Leary with a single into
the left-field corner for the four-run advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo took it from there, making one mistake, the pitch to
Damon, before yielding to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has pitched some solid games,'' Williams said. ``He has a
resilient arm. He can take you deep in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a kick here or there.

ZARLEY TAKES SENIORS LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ One by one, they took their turns on the
leaderboard, and just as quickly as they got there, they fell off.
</P>
<P>
   First-round co-leaders Larry Nelson, Simon Hobday, and Harold
Henning clung to the top rung before falling back. Jim Ahern gave
it a whirl. So, very briefly, did Dana Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   But the man standing alone at the end of the day was Kermit
Zarley, a nonwinner since 1994 who checked in with a 5-under 67,
for a two-day total of 136, to lead the Senior PGA Tour FleetBoston
Classic under another picture-postcard day at Nashawtuc CC.
</P>
<P>
   He goes into Sunday's final round of the $1.3 million tournament
with a one-stroke lead over Nelson, who birdied the 18th to set up
an interesting final.
</P>
<P>
   Another stroke behind at 138 were Ahern and Terry Dill.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a few others within striking distance, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Trevino is just three shots behind Zarley after digging deep
into his bag of tricks to fire 65_139 in a round that featured
seven birdies. Dave Stockton (70) is also at 139, as are David
Graham (70), Leonard Thompson (68), Chuck Moran (71), Ed Dougherty
(70).
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the last putt dropped, Zarley playfully began
playing mind games with Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some really good players out there,'' he said, ``and
Larry Nelson is one of them. Hey, there's no question about it,
Larry Nelson is a better player than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who was awaiting his turn at the podium, said, ``But
Kermit is playing better than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarley overcame a double bogey on the par-3, 189-yard second,
with birdies at holes 4, 7, and 9, to go 6 under and make the turn
in 33. He picked up another stroke with an 8-foot birdie on the
15th and yet another, a 20-footer, on 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lucky break on 13,'' said Nelson about the par-3,
203-yard hole. ``I hit a 3-iron to the left of the hole, but it hit
a fir tree and dropped down just 8-10 feet off the green. I was
able to save par there rather than lose a stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarley credited his caddie son, Mike, 29, with detecting a flaw
in his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada (AT&AMP;T Canada Senior Open), I was back in about 40th
place. I was disgusted with the way I was hitting the ball. I asked
him what I was doing wrong and asked him to watch me swing and see
what he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart kid and he told me my swing was too fast in the
transition. That I was trying to slow it down, but that it still
looked like I was trying to kill the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   His son obviously knew what he was seeing, because the next
week, at the Novell Utah Showdown, Zarley had rounds of 65-68-71 en
route to a fourth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson followed Friday's opening-round 67 with a lackluster 70.
He had just three birdies and admitted his putting was way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I putted just awful,'' he said. ``If that comes around, I feel
pretty good about my game. Every green out there today seemed a
little different. Some were firmer than others. I don't know that
anything is safe tomorrow because the scores are so bunched. I feel
like someone is going to shoot low.''
</P>
<P>
   Dill, who started the day 1 under at 71, had five birdies to not
only win the Georgia-Pacific Super Seniors segment of the
FleetBoston, but to thrust himself firmly into contention to win
the whole shooting match.
</P>
<P>
   He, like Zarley, credited a member of his family with detecting
a flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife (Linda) gave me a putting lesson (Friday). It had to
do with my posture when I stand over a putt. I worked on it in
front of the mirror. I think she knew what she was doing because I
made six birdies, all with pretty good putts.''

TANTRUM LEAVES ARROJO ON FENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If there is an insurance policy protecting
Red Sox starting pitchers against freak injuries, the premiums shot
sky-high again Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The team that already lost one pitcher because he slept on his
pillow wrong (Jeff Fassero), another because he rolled out of bed
onto a drinking glass (Paxton Crawford), and a third because a
teammate in Pawtucket decided to practice some martial arts on his
face (Tomo Ohka), lost Rolando Arrojo Saturday &UR;  &LR; night when he
elected to test his place-kicking technique on the protective fence
in front of the visitors' dugout here.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo apparently planted his right foot into the fence en route
to the bench after giving up a two-run homer to Johnny Damon of the
Royals with two out in the fifth, cutting the Sox lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo struck out the next batter, Rey Sanchez, on three pitches
to end the inning, but the man who seldom shows any emotion while
on the mound took his anger out on the fence, and the fence won.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo came out for the sixth, but after throwing just two
pitches to Mike Sweeney, who lined out to Trot Nixon in right,
Arrojo immediately looked into the dugout, which brought manager
Jimy Williams hustling to the mound. With Jose Offerman acting as
translator, Williams quickly deduced the Cuban righthander was done
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, another early call went out to the bullpen, but
unlike Fassero's complaint the night before, this one had nothing
to do with Williams's quick hook. And the Sox relievers, as they
have done almost all season, were equal to the task, including
Hipolito Pichardo, whose surgically repaired elbow has been put to
a severe test this summer and who is starting to show alarming
signs of wearing down.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pressbox announcement during the game, Arrojo
had a contusion on his right ankle, which doesn't sound serious.
Arrojo, who said he wasn't sure what he kicked, explained after the
game that the doctor said he was OK and Arrojo could make his next
start. The Sox can only hope.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it: Until Ramon Martinez comes back and
shows he's capable of pitching here the way he did Friday in
Buffalo, when he held the Triple A Bisons to two hits in seven
innings, Arrojo is the Sox' No. 2 pitcher behind Pedro Martinez and
perhaps the key to the Sox returning to the postseason for a third
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 games left in the season, Arrojo figures to make seven
more starts for the Sox, almost all against playoff contenders. As
the schedule stands now, he would face the Mariners Friday night in
Fenway Park, the A's the following Wednesday, the Yankees in Yankee
Stadium Sept. 11, the suddenly hot Tigers in Detroit Sept. 16, the
Indians in Fenway Park Sept. 21, and the White Sox in Chicago Sept.
26.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, who warmed up for this pennant race by pitching in games
in which Fidel Castro took an intense personal interest, hasn't
lost since his first start for the Sox July 30, after coming from
Colorado with Mike Lansing in the Brian Rose/Jeff Frye/John Wasdin
trade.
</P>
<P>
   He had three wins and two no-decisions in his last five starts,
and the Sox have won all those games, including Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's
5-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   He has the live fastball, the hard breaking stuff, and the
commanding mound demeanor of a big-game pitcher. He certainly has
the experience: He pitched a full decade for the Cuban national
team before his dramatic defection, and Sox general manager Dan
Duquette was among the first to laugh openly about Arrojo's age
when he signed a $7 million bonus to pitch for the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays. His bio says he is 32. If that's his age, the Sox should
invite Luis Tiant back to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But at any age, he is central to the Sox' hopes of playing in
October. Which is why they can't afford to have him lose his
temper. They've already seen how costly that can be with a certain
center fielder.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They've been acting like a couple of little kids
getting ready for a play date, all excited and giddy, their
families say _ these two 73-year-old women meeting for the first
time Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame them. Carolyn Blanchard and Valerie Mulhair have
been the best of friends for 57 years.
</P>
<P>
   By mail.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, they've written each other letters pouring out their
lives, every Christmas and on birthdays their families have
exchanged cards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they were getting ready to meet face-to-face _ not living
behind their words anymore. And they were nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called her, and told her who I was, we both got so
excited because we had never even heard each other's voices
before,'' Carolyn said Friday from the suburban Canyon Country home
of her son and daughter-in-law where the meeting would take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started laughing because we had to yell to make each other
heard. Our hearing's not what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much usually is after 73 years of living, but there's
nothing wrong with their memories.
</P>
<P>
   They might not be able to remember exactly what was in that
first letter Valerie mailed Carolyn from her parents' home in
Sydney, Australia, in 1943, but Carolyn remembers like it was
yesterday, looking in her mailbox in the tiny town of Seymour,
Conn., and wondering who the heck did she know in Australia?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had met her uncle, Timmy, when he was on leave from the Army
in Sydney, and he told me about his niece back in the States who
was my age,'' Valerie said Friday from Visalia, Calif. her home
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it would be a great idea if we became pen pals, so
we did. Fifty-seven years later, we still are.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for regular dialysis treatment has kept Carolyn from
making the long cross country trip to visit her son, Robert, living
in Canyon County, but her daughter-in-law, Lori, was determined
that the two women should finally meet in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arranged for her medical needs, and a clinic for her
dialysis treatments every other day,'' Lori said. ``This was just
too important not to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange thing, both women say being a pen pal that many
years. They've gone from FDR to Clinton together, from the days of
radio to a crazy new invention called television to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Through their letters, they've laughed and cried together,
watched each other's families grow up and have families of their
own, and leaned on each other shoulders through illnesses and
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, they say, they are truly best friends even
though they've never formally met.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie named her first daughter after Carolyn, and Carolyn
poured out her heart to her Australian friend as a young woman,
afraid she would never meet the right man, get married and have
children.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie told her, nonsense, she would. And, of course, she did.
</P>
<P>
   There's something so completely honest and true about having a
friend who knows you only from your words in a letter, both women
say.
</P>
<P>
   No pretensions, no petty jealousy, no promising to meet next
week for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's the main reason they've never met before. Why would you
want to spoil something so special? A friendship that has been
allowed to evolve over 57 years in more than 5,000 letters, with an
occasional photo to get an image in your mind.
</P>
<P>
   But now it was finally time to meet, and both women were as
nervous as could be Saturday morning as Valerie Mulhair's car
pulled onto Carolyn Blanchard's street.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional meeting, how could it not be? Both woman
stood in the middle of the street embracing and crying
</P>
<P>
   their families standing on the curb trying hard not to cry
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held up traffic on the street for five minutes just
standing out there hugging,'' Lori said. ``They wouldn't let go of
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   When they finally did, Valerie reached into her purse and handed
Carolyn a picture of her Uncle Timmy standing next to a young girl
from Australia in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set us up,'' Valerie said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he did,'' Carolyn said, taking her friend's arm in hers,
and walking her into the house both of them laughing and carrying
on like a couple of kids on a play date.
</P>
<P>
   Two 73-year-old pen pals finally able to hug and touch each
other after 57 years of living behind words.

HARRIS, REVOLUTION TOP CREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution appear to have finally
developed a playoff mentality. And that compensated for their flaws
in a 2-1 win over Columbus Saturday &UR;  &LR; night which launched them
ahead of the Crew into seventh place in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   The late-game mistakes which have plagued the Revolution have
been reduced in the last eight days as the team earned two
successive victories with concentrated defending, an effective
central midfield combination, and the consistent individual
striking efforts of Wolde Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris converted the winning goal in the 51st minute, scoring in
his seventh successive game to tie the MLS record set by Raul Diaz
Arce of D.C. United in 1997. Harris, who will play for Jamaica
against the Cayman Islands Sunday afternoon, dribbled past Todd
Yeagley and finished with a low shot into the far left corner of
the net in the 51st minute for his 15th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution's game plan was based on purposeful
defending, keyed by libero Mauricio Wright, the midfield trio of
Leonel Alvarez, Joe Franchino, and John Harkes, and the pressing of
forward William Sunsing.
</P>
<P>
   Franchino stayed with Crew midfielder John Wilmar Perez, whose
choreographing had been a key to Columbus' 3-1 and 4-1 wins over
the Revolution earlier in the season. Alvarez limited the
effectiveness of Brian McBride, who played as a withdrawn forward,
in the second half, after McBride had converted a 20th-minute
penalty for the first goal of the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great win because it proved we could concentrate
for 90 minutes and get a result,'' Revolution coach Fernando
Clavijo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have 39 points, 1 more than Columbus and 2 more
than the team record set in 1997, and will meet D.C. United at
Foxboro Stadium Wednesday and in Washington Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team has confidence we can defend a one-goal lead to
the end,'' said Harris, who was replaced by Jamar Beasley in the
81st minute. ``I wanted to come out of the game because I felt my
calves tightening. It was a good move because it gave us a chance
to get some fresh legs out there to pressure the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution spent most of the game doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sunsing, nicknamed ``El Travieso'' (``The Menace''), disrupted
the rhythm of the Crew's strong, but predictable, back line,
forcing them to increase the pace of their clearances. Crew
goalkeeper Mark Dougherty twice left the penalty area to make
headed clearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew, lacking Robert Warzycha (suspended) in midfield,
struggled to complement Perez. And Revolution defenders Adam Eyre,
Rusty Pierce, and Wright kept the Columbus forwards in check,
though they received a major break on a call by referee Rich Grady
in the final minute of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the game was marked by what appeared to be makeup calls
by Grady, one possibly dating back to Aug. 5, when the Revs were
denied a possible penalty kick in a 1-1 tie with the Crew. Grady
issued eight cautions and called two penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Grady whistled a second penalty kick when Todd Yeagley and
Wright collided with both players moving away from the goal near
the edge of the penalty area. Imad Baba converted the penalty for
his seventh goal of the season in the 35th minute to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution also capitalized as Grady awarded a free kick to
Columbus instead of allowing Jeff Cunningham to complete a solo
move against Juergen Sommer in the 45th minute, and survived two
Crew shots off the post _ by Jason Farrell in the 13th minute and
McBride in second-half injury time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a physical game from start to finish but we knew it
would be,'' said Sommer, who won for the first time against his
former team. ``I though the refereeing slowed down the game because
of so many calls. The challenges were tough but not nasty, and it's
a physical sport in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbus put a lot of pressure on us and had the better of the
chances. But we have a more cohesive, more balanced team out there
now.''

MONEY MAY HAVE BEEN AT ROOT OF EWING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has been more than one week since the news surfaced
that Patrick Ewing might be dealt from New York to Seattle for Vin
Baker. It has been more than 48 hours since the Knicks, in an
extraordinary confessional in this day of subterfuge and deception,
owned up to trying to do the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But even after New York general manager Scott Layden's admission
that the deal was all but completed, something still begs for an
answer: Why?
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing suspicion was that Ewing, who is finishing up a
four-year, $68 million diamond parachute, had forced the Knicks'
hand by demanding an extension. Or, perhaps, suggesting an
extension. Layden said that was not the case. ``I want to make that
clear,'' he said. That's his story and he's sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, how then, did Ewing suddenly go from indispensable to
disposable in the span of two months?
</P>
<P>
   The only possible answer: Ewing wanted an extension and the
Knicks, wisely, thought that it was not such a good idea. Wounded,
Ewing agreed to waive his no-trade clause and gave the Knicks
permission to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   No other scenario makes any sense. Ewing fed up with Knicks
fans? How was this year different from any other? Ewing hoping to
win a title? How does he come closer with playoff wannabe Seattle
than playoff fixture New York? How are the Knicks better with
Baker? Ewing unhappy with his role?
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had to have forced this. The Knicks have always championed
him and his contributions; coach Jeff Van Gundy has been an
unflagging defender; and Layden said in June that the team's title
hopes were best served with Ewing in the middle. Two months later,
he's on the block.
</P>
<P>
   If this were strictly a basketball matter _ and very few deals
these days seem to qualify as that _ then it would be a no-brainer.
As they say in politics, go to the record. It's there in black and
white, and while Ewing may have an unrealistic opinion of his own
ability, there is no disputing what happens to the Knicks when he
plays: They win a lot more than they lose.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Ewing missed the first 20 games and the Knicks went
11-9. They were 39-23 in the games he did play, and that includes
the season-ending no-show at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing bashers point out he didn't have a basket in the fourth
quarters of the last two playoff games against Indiana. But the
Knicks might never have gotten that far had he not gone for 20
points and 10 rebounds in Game 7 at Miami, including, lest we
forget, the game-winning basket. He had gone for 15 and 18 in Game
6, when the Knicks rallied from a huge hole to send the series back
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also 38, has battled injuries the last few years, and,
frankly, the absolute last thing he should be contemplating at this
point is an extension. It's not like he needs the money or the
security. He has plenty of both.
</P>
<P>
   He has no NBA championship rings, however, and that will be his
enduring legacy in New York, where he has a conflicted and
sometimes tortured relationship with the MSG faithful. (Although
those fans, like so many others, appreciate Ewing a lot more when
the Knicks win.) He always has come up short. But he has plenty of
company _ Charles Barkley and Karl Malone to name two. Like Ewing,
they had the misfortune of trying to win when a guy named Michael
Jordan was around.
</P>
<P>
   Layden now says that Ewing will likely stay a Knick, which
should make for an interesting fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a consummate professional,'' Layden said. ``I expect him
to come back and have a great season with the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he had to be expecting in June, too. Why the
about-face? There's only one story that makes any sense. Yup,
that's right: Greed. It's about the money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of money, that was one of the driving forces behind the
Celtics' interest in the four-way trade with Utah, Golden State,
and Dallas. Lost amid all the players changing places was the
Celtics' receipt of $3 million of Mark Cuban's loose change. Add
Dana Barros's $3.7 million and the Celtics actually made $250,000
in the deal. (They assumed $6.45 million in salaries.) Some of the
principals involved said the Celtics were fixated on money during
the talks, which may explain why they and they alone came up empty
in the deal. Utah got Donyell Marshall. Golden State got Danny
Fortson (seven years, $41 million), and Dallas got Howard Eisley.
The Celtics got some extra money, two beaten-up players, and a
draft pick (see below). Rick Pitino has stated time and again that
he is under budget restraints and that he is allowed to spend the
salary cap ($35.5 million) plus the two exceptions ($3.45 million).
That works out to about $39 million. The Celtics' payroll for this
season is more than $51 million. Even taking Cuban's $3 million and
possibly some insurance relief from Hot Rod Williams's $2.11
million deal and Greg Minor's $3.24 million, that still leaves
Pitino considerably over budget . . . That deal, by the way, was
all but complete when someone noted that Bruno Sundov was unsigned.
Agent Frank Catapano, who represents the 7-foot-2-inch Sundov, then
got a call and the deal was delayed for two days until Catapano got
a deal for the Croatian center. Sundov was shipped from Dallas to
Utah after agreeing to a three-year, guaranteed deal. However, the
Jazz are liable for only the first year unless they keep him on the
roster after Oct. 1. If they don't, Catapano says he has two NBA
teams ready to pounce on Sundov, who appeared in 14 games (61
minutes) for Dallas last season . . . Another money matter: We
noted a few weeks ago that the NBA had told its teams to plan on a
salary cap of around $42.7 million next season, a 20 percent jump.
Huh? Did we miss a new television deal or three new expansion
teams? No. The salary cap for this coming season would have been
around $39 million save for a one-time credit cap the league
received because it spent more than the agreed-upon amount on
salaries. The credit will not be in place next season, hence the
big jump. However, what will be in place next season is the escrow
provision, which allows the league to withhold 10 percent of every
player's salary if it pays out more than an agreed-on percentage.
(Projections indicate they will.) The withdrawals will occur from
November to April, be placed in the bank, and, if the league's
projections are on target, will then be distributed back to the
owners. Additionally, players who customarily received their salary
in a lump sum in the summertime won't be able to do that starting
with next season. The new labor deal stipulates that each player
receive at least 30 percent of his salary from November to April,
allowing the league to make the withdrawals . . . Antoine Walker
may not like the fact that his name is being mentioned in trade
talks, and despite the obligatory team denials, he is available.
``It's not a secret,'' said Walker's agent, Mike Higgins. ``If the
right deal is out there, they'd move him. But I believe that when
it's all said and done, he will be with the Celtics when the season
starts.'' Walker also does not like to see his name and the word
``weight'' mentioned in the same sentence, which Pitino has a habit
of doing . . . The new top assistant to Isiah Thomas in Indiana is
Brendan Malone. That's the same guy Thomas hired to guide the
expansion Toronto Raptors out of the box and then summarily
dismissed after one season when the two couldn't agree on how best
to proceed. (Thomas wanted the young players to play more. Malone
wanted to win.) Malone had been an assistant with Detroit for seven
years, collecting two title rings in the process and marveling at
his new boss. ``He was the best player, leader, and competitor I've
ever been around,'' Malone said. ``I've always had this
schizophrenic relationship with Isiah. He gave me the opportunity
to be a head coach in the NBA. I appreciated that. What I didn't
appreciate is that he fired me (after a 21-61 season). But in this
business, you have to let bygones be bygones. It's been five years
since Toronto, and I've seen Isiah a lot since then.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing the Celtics simply announced that they had
received one of Utah's two first-rounders in next June's draft in
the Fortson trade. Anything else would have required the folks at
MIT to explain. After you read this, you may understand why the
trade took so long to complete. Utah has two picks in the 2001
draft, its own and one from Denver. If both picks fall in the top
15 (unlikely), Utah gets the better one. If one pick falls in the
top 15 (likely), Utah gets that one. If neither fall in the top 15
(unlikely), the Celtics get the better pick. Based on that
scenario, the Celtics would likely end up with the Jazz's pick
because Denver probably will be in the top 15 and Utah won't. Aha,
but that's only part of it. There are conditions on the Denver
pick. The Nuggets have two picks, their own and one from either
Cleveland or Phoenix. If Cleveland's pick is 14 or higher _
unlikely _ it goes to Denver. If it's in the lottery, then the
Cavaliers keep the pick and the Nuggets end up with the Suns' pick,
which likely will be in the 20s. Denver then sends the less
favorable of the two picks to Utah (probably Phoenix's) in which
case both picks would be in the 20s. Still with me? The final
option is that the Celtics could exercise their right to Denver's
own No. 1 (protected for the top picks), and the Nuggets would then
send the other one to Utah. Bottom line: If things go as expected,
Utah will likely end up with its own pick and that of the Suns.
Both should be in the mid 20s, and Boston will get the better of
the two . . . Oregon Live, a website in Portland, has conducted a
vote the last couple of weeks modeled on the TV hit ``Survivor.''
Fans were asked to vote on which member of the Trail Blazers would
remain on the island. The first to be kicked off was Jermaine
O'Neal, which is not surprising given that he wants out of town.
Damon Stoudamire was the next to go. It came down to Scottie Pippen
and Rasheed Wallace, with Wallace surviving by a 2-1 vote . . .
Everyone else seems to be wondering what the Pistons are doing
(hint: freeing up cap room doesn't make free agents want to play
for a bad team in a cold climate), but Jerry Stackhouse apparently
is not one of them. The additions of Ben Wallace, Chucky Atkins,
Billy Owens, and Mateen Cleaves has, in his mind, made the Pistons
tougher. ``I don't want to seem as just because I'm a part of the
team, I'm optimistic,'' Stackhouse told the Detroit News. ``But I
really am optimistic because we're becoming tougher. And that's
what it's all about. It's not about having the most talented guys.
These guys have talent, but they won't get frail when things go
bad.'' Did that mean that the departed Grant Hill and the
soon-to-be-departing Christian Laettner are, um, soft? ``I'm not
going to talk about what the problem was.'' Laettner (and,
possibly, Terry Mills) is presumed to be heading to Dallas for
Cedric Ceballos, John Wallace, and Eric Murdock. That deal is
expected to be announced Monday, two months since the Mavericks
acquired Wallace and Murdock in draft day deals. The Dallas Morning
News also said that newly acquired Barros and Billy Curley may be
heading to Detroit in a separate deal for the all-but-finished Loy
Vaught.

SINDEN WILL SUBTRACT IF HOLDOUTS DISTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPES-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If the three unsigned Bruins elect to sit out training
camp, it could wind up costing them a good deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter, Joe Thornton, and Sergei Samsonov are all
restricted free agents, and with training camp just over a week
away, none is close to reaching a deal with the club.
President/general manager Harry Sinden said that after the
disastrous season the team endured last year, he doesn't want the
kind of distractions at training camp that pretty well crippled the
Bruins well into November when goalie Byron Dafoe was sitting out
in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that, Sinden said, he and assistant GM Mike O'Connell
are seriously considering punishing players financially if they
don't sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest damage is to the rest of the players on
the team,'' said Sinden. ``It's very tough for the coach,
especially when it's a high-profile player like Byron, to run his
training camp with the full attention of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a $3 million offer at the beginning and he had a $3
million offer when he signed. We took off the games he missed, he
didn't get paid for that. But he didn't lose anything for missing
training camp because he wasn't getting paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way that we're considering to drop the offers if
they miss camp and screw up and disrupt our training camp. For
example, if we're offering you $1.5 million, it's going to drop to
$1.45 million for each day you're not here or each three days.
Teams have done it, particularly New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why I think it's proper. Even though they only
get paid during the regular season, their contract covers preseason
and the playoffs but their pay period is spread throughout the
regular season. When they miss training camp, they didn't provide
their services. If they're going to screw up this team by sitting
out, then they're going to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden asked O'Connell to recheck the team's offers to the three
players to make sure they were fair with regard to what other
players of comparable ability are making. They came to the
conclusion that the offers were proper, although the players don't
agree. In the case of Carter, the sides are believed to be a
million dollars apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Mike, `I don't know what else we can do. I just
don't,' '' said Sinden. ``We didn't make the playoffs, we had a
lousy team. They were a big part of it. They were no more the cause
than anybody else, but they were regular players. We must have had
a hell of team last year, didn't we? Here, we've got three guys who
are regular forwards on the team who must have made a nice
contribution to what happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter freely admits that his perception of his worth is
different than the Bruins'. Sinden said that if Carter wants to be
paid for what he believes he can do rather than be rewarded for
what he's done, it isn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the odd player you're willing to do that with,'' he
said. ``If Bourque's contract was up or Orr's contract, a star
player who you knew was getting better every year, you might do it.
But right now, the way things go now, it's `What did you do last
year?' `What have you done in your career?' and that's where you
fit for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the arbitration goes, and that's where we're coming
from. We compare them in all categories to the comparables. Two of
them didn't have arbitration and one elected not to go. Anson, if
he thought he could've gotten it, he should've gone. The other two,
if they think they can get it from the arbitrator like Radek Bonk
did, they're going to have to wait like Bonk did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of leverage here. We could say, `I don't care
what your numbers are. That's all you're getting. You got too much
your first three years and we want it back.' But we're not saying
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said in the case of Carter, the sides are a long way
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to raise a suspicion in my mind that he wanted us to
trade him to somebody who would give him what they're asking,''
said Sinden. ``But you can't let them dictate. If every time you
trade a guy he gets what he wants, what is the sense? We'd have to
get a player absolutely as comparable or probably better to do it.
He's a long, long way from being a complete player. A long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we're close with any of them but we're further
along with Thornton. We've had more conversations with (agent) Mike
Barnett than we've had with the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said in addition to considering financial penalties, he
and O'Connell are also pondering whether to set a hard and fast
deadline for getting Carter signed, as Phoenix did with Nikolai
Khabibulin last year and Ottawa did with Alexei Yashin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is either perceived or imagined as a big distraction that
screwed up this team last year, we'd have to consider it,'' Sinden
said. ``It would be one thing if they were trying to do that
because we were trying to cheat them, but we can show them the
numbers and they can't really argue.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look as though forward Martin Rucinsky will be in
Montreal's training camp. He seems poised to sit out for the second
time in three seasons because of a contract dispute. The Canadiens
made him a qualifying offer of $2.4 million, the same salary he
made last season, after declining to pick up a $2.7 million option.
Rucinsky said he's considering playing for Litvinov in his native
Czech Republic, the same club former Coyote Robert Reichel plays
for. ``With him being there, it would make it an easier decision
for me,'' said Rucinsky. ``We played on the same line for 10 or 12
years. One thing is certain, I won't be inactive for a whole season
like Petr Nedved did a couple of years ago. I'm in the same boat as
Jose Theodore, Sheldon Souray, and Craig Rivet. I still haven't
signed a new contract. I won't go to camp without one. It's too
risky. I was surprised and disappointed at their offer. My option
year wasn't for $4 million like it was for Saku Koivu or Shayne
Corson. In my case, it was only a $300,000 raise.'' . . . Penguins
free agent Robert Dome is another player threatening to play in
Europe. But in Dome's case, money doesn't appear to be the
stumbling block. According to his agent, Jiri Crha, it's about
opportunity. The 21-year-old native of Slovakia, who was the
Penguins' first-round draft pick in 1997, wants a better chance to
play in the NHL rather than the minors. ``For three years, they
didn't give him an opportunity to show anything, always sending him
to the farm team,'' said Crha. ``I don't want Robert to go through
that anymore. I don't want him to go up and down, with everybody
telling him over and over why he's not playing. Just let him play.
You need a chance at least to prove somebody wrong. If you play six
shifts a game, you're never going to produce.'' . . . Wendel Clark,
who retired in June after 15 NHL seasons, is having discussions
with the Maple Leafs about joining the club in some capacity.
Whether it be in marketing, community relations, scouting, or some
other area remains to be seen. ``I'm definitely interested,'' said
Clark. ``The discussions have been going very well. It's an honor
to be associated with the Leafs and it will be great if that
relationship continues. So far, things have been informal and that
has allowed me to sit back and think about what I might like to
do.'' Leafs president Ken Dryden said Clark is still adjusting to
the fact that he won't be playing pro hockey for the first time in
15 years. ``When you are changing lives, sometimes it takes awhile
to determine what you want to do,'' Dryden said.

   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock, whose club made it to the Cup finals
before bowing to New Jersey, said he was ``decimated'' for three
weeks after the loss. ``But when I sat back and removed myself from
the emotion, I said, `Just a second here. We had a hell of a
season,' '' said Hitchcock. ``We had a great chance to win it
again. We had some great performances and I had to overplay some
role players along the way. At the end of the day, we didn't have
the freshness we needed to get by New Jersey.'' . . . The Vancouver
Canucks re-signed goalie Felix Potvin. The 29-year-old, who went
from the Islanders to Vancouver before Christmas, had a hard time
at first, with a 1-5-3 record in his first nine starts. But his
play picked up a great deal after the All-Star break as he went
11-8-4 . . . The $175 million sale of the Devils to the YankeeNets
group is finally complete. The deal had been scheduled to be
finalized July 14 but paperwork delayed it until last Tuesday. ``I
did the deal,'' said former owner John McMullen. ``It's over with,
that's it. It's been a long, drawn-out affair, as everyone knows.
It's too bad. It is. But I had to do it.'' Payments from YankeeNets
to McMullen are being deferred over three years. ``They call it
deferred payments,'' McMullen said. ``Basically it's a loan for
three years.'' Reportedly, the new owners are planning a new
stadium in Newark . . . The acting bug bit a few NHL players this
summer. Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick, Devils center Scott Gomez,
Canadiens defenseman Souray, Flyers defenseman Chris Therien, and
Lightning goalie Kevin Weekes participated in a one-day shoot for
the ABC soap opera ``One Life to Live.'' It will air Thursday at 2
p.m. on Channel 5. Roenick, who has appeared on the Disney
Channel's ``The Jersey,'' also will be featured in the HBO show
``Arliss'' Sept. 3 . . . Fitness guru Mike Boyle, who has helped
many NHL players, including former Bruin star Cam Neely, is
expanding his business. After Labor Day, he'll have gyms in
Winchester and Canton, with off-ice programs tailored for the
hockey athlete. For more information, call Bob Hanson at
781-729-1333 . . . 11 days to training camp.

MAKING _ AND SHAKING _ HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ They were separated by just a few yards while the
action took place at the eighth hole of Firestone Country Club in
Akron, Ohio, Thursday. On the green, Tiger Woods was rolling in a
birdie to get to 5 under par. Outside the ropes, with the
ever-present cigar clenched between his teeth, Charlie Sifford was
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Sifford. They represent two spectrums of history in
the world of professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   At one end, you have arguably the most gifted player we have
ever seen, playing at a time when prize money is enormous, the
game's popularity is far-reaching, and the public's ignorance is
less of an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, you have a player of considerable talent who
toiled when financial rewards were minimal and a nation's shame
slammed shut the door of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Racial barriers were knocked down years ago, but not until it
was too late for Sifford and the great black golfers of his era,
men such as Ted Rhodes and Pete Brown. They were good enough to
compete, good enough to win, but they were never allowed to get to
the first tee. Sifford has every reason to be bitter, but as he
stood behind the eighth green Thursday, he was a man filled with
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the greatest thing that's ever come along for golf,''
said Sifford, watching not only Woods's birdie putt but the mass of
bodies off in a flash. The gallery was swift to the ninth tee, the
Tiger Trail moving as one. Children, some white, some black, some
Asian, battled to get to the ropes, holding their fists out in
hopes that Woods would lightly punch them the way he does with
caddie Steve Williams. Adults of all shapes and sizes _ from the
country club set in their Hilfiger shirts and Footjoy shoes to the
blue-collar crowd in their tank tops and high-top sneakers _
struggled to get a glimpse of this young man who has unlocked the
mystery to this impossible game.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Sifford stood quietly and nodded his head in
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, why I'm so happy to see him,'' said Sifford. ``He
made my dream come true, because when I started it's just what I
wanted to do. But I didn't have the opportunity to do it. I wasn't
as good a player, didn't have no (financial backing), not too much
instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he have any doors opened for him. The game and the
people who ran it weren't colorblind black then, so we will never
know how good Sifford was and what he could have accomplished. At
78, his resentment has subsided, in large part because Woods has
helped people appreciate Sifford and the other black golfers who
endured a nation's bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about that,'' said Sifford. ``He said that. I think I
played a major part in African-Americans in professional golf. Of
course, if I hadn't acted like a professional man when they first
sent me out, with all the obstacles I went through and done
something crazy, well, there might not be any blacks playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were against me. But I toughed it out. I'm
proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sifford remembered another visit to Firestone CC, in 1958, when
he played in the Rubber City Open. An 18-year-old amateur from
nearby Columbus, Ohio, was in the field that day, a long-hitting
phenom named Jack Nicklaus. ``The greatest I ever saw,'' said
Sifford, though he agreed that Woods is quickly approaching such
stature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overwhelming presence of Woods, there still aren't
enough blacks making it professionally, said Sifford, and the game
is still not being introduced to minority children as much as it
should be. He met the game as a caddie in Charlotte, N.C. (``18
holes for 60 cents,'' he said, laughing) but even that avenue has
been taken away from kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' said Sifford. ``There might be somebody who comes
along better than Tiger. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about opportunity and hard work, he said. He was
speaking from a lifetime of experience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that they won't be charged up when it arrives, but the
American players certainly aren't in a fever about the Presidents
Cup. Want proof? Here was Paul Azinger, when asked about playing
the matches so late in the season: ``That's when we play the Ryder
Cup, in September.'' He was told that the Presidents Cup will be
Oct. 19-22. Trying to recover, Azinger laughed and said, ``It's in
October? Oh, well, I can't make it.'' A humorous exchange, but it
serves as a reminder that the Presidents Cup does not carry the
same intensity as the Ryder Cup, at least for the Americans. The
International Team players are genuinely geared up for it, but some
fear the US players could be drained playing these team events each
year. Hal Sutton thinks things will change as the event nears. ``I
think we're looking forward to playing,'' said Sutton, who praised
the addition of Azinger as one of Ken Venturi's captain's picks
(Loren Roberts was the other). ``Paul is such a fiery, spirited,
competitive, great player,'' he said. ``Those kind of guys are good
to have on a team like that.'' . . . Say what you will about the
Presidents Cup not being the Ryder Cup, but take note that
officials at Robert Trent Jones GC in Virginia have marketed the
event brilliantly. It is a virtual sellout, with a little more than
20,000 daily tickets _ not to mention the corporate tents _ gone .
. . Chris Perry, No. 12 in the standings and very passionate about
his desire to be on the team, learned a valuable lesson: If you are
going to blow a tournament, don't do it under the eye of the
Presidents Cup captain, particularly when he's one week away from
completing his team. But that's what Perry did, making bogey to
lose to playing partner Rocco Mediate at the 72d hole of the Buick
Classic, right below the CBS tower where Venturi sat. There may
have been sympathy for Perry, 38, who last year finished just
outside the top 10 and wasn't added to the Ryder Cup team. What
worked against him was his lack of experience in international team
matches, plus the fact that he's won just once. Not fair, he said.
``I've been out here 15 years,'' said Perry. ``I've been in enough
pressure situations that I don't think it's anything I can't
handle. I've been in the hunt a lot. Yeah, I haven't come through a
lot, but if he's going to base it on a guy's experience, then
again, why do we have a two-year process? Let's just take the
favorites and most popular players and let's go; let's not even
have a system.'' . . . As for the old Catch 22 regarding experience
_ that is, if a guy doesn't have it, how does he get it? _ Sutton
had a simple solution: ``You make the team first. Don't wait on
being picked. Make the team.'' . . . Biggest winner at Valhalla in
the PGA Championship? Woods? Well, yes, and Bob May wasn't far
behind, but Australian lefthander Greg Chalmers certainly came away
with a huge smile. When Jose Maria Olazabal missed a 3-foot putt
for par at the 72d hole, it dropped him into a tie for fourth with
Stuart Appleby and Chalmers. The top four and ties earn berths in
the Masters field . . . Lee Janzen wasn't in the chase for a
Presidents Cup berth, but he was asked about it. Laughing, Janzen
said, ``All I know is Tiger has won. I think he's further ahead
than the next guy has money. And he's already got enough points to
make the Ryder Cup team next year. Heck, they ought to make him
captain.'' Janzen turns 36 Monday and hasn't won since his second
US Open title in 1998, but after finishing in a tie for 19th at
Valhalla, he was upbeat and turning his attention toward the 2001
Ryder Cup. When told it was at the Belfry, he frowned. ``I've
played twice and both times (in Europe),'' he said. ``I'd like to
play over here once.''
</P>

   Tough to figure out Karrie Webb. She apparently was caught by
BBC cameras taking an illegal drop, an infraction that cost her a
two-shot penalty, then announced she would never do an interview
with that network again. Then she bemoaned the fact that every week
she gets asked questions about Woods. Well, guess what. She's in
great company, because every member of the PGA Tour could say the
same thing. Instead of whining, she has to learn to live with it,
as so many others do. It's too bad, because Webb is the star around
whom the LPGA needs to build so much of its fan base . . .
Fortunately, there are LPGA players like Meg Mallon, who scorched
Walnut Hills CC in East Lansing, Mich., with a 62 in Thursday's
opening round of the Oldsmobile Classic. Mallon has had a splendid
season, capped by her du Maurier triumph a few weeks ago. OK, she
grew up in Michigan and went to Ohio State, but she was born in
Natick and will forever be a local girl. Right? ``Absolutely,'' she
said. Conversations with Mallon invariably turn to this: ``What is
up with the Celtics?'' No one has figured out how to answer her yet
. . . Michelle McGann, still on the comeback trail, played Loch
Lomond in Scotland last week, just in case she were to somehow make
her way onto the Solheim Cup team for October's event . . . Biggest
concern for Solheim Cup captain Pat Bradley has to be the condition
of Dottie Pepper, arguably the team's inspirational leader. She's
been out for a few weeks with a bad back . . . Juli Inkster chose
to stay in Europe and play in the Compaq Open in Stockholm . . . A
summer fixture could end Tuesday when Chi Chi Rodriguez appears at
New England CC in Bellingham on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association. That club is up for sale, and the future of the annual
benefit event is uncertain. Rodriguez puts on a great show and
he'll do a clinic at 10:30 a.m. Spots are also available in the
ensuing tournament. Call 617-266-3600 or 508-883-2300 for
information . . . So, Woods uses a Nike golf ball that isn't the
one you can buy? Shocking. And here I was thinking he stopped off
on his way to the course and picked up a couple sleeves at the pro
shop. His TV commercial may lead you to believe you can buy the
exact same ball he uses, and that is deceptive, which is why Nike
landed in court last week, sued by a consumer group. But before you
rail against this, understand that, for good or bad, this was not
exactly news on the driving range at the NEC Invitational. ``We get
the opportunity to test prototypes,'' said Darren Clarke. ``We get
clubs and things to try before it is made available to the public.
So I'm sure this is just another step along that line.'' A quick
survey indicated no fewer than 15 of the 37 players in the NEC
field had some prototype clubs in their bags, the most notable,
reported Golfweek, being Nick Price and Azinger. They were both
using a Callaway driver that industry sources believe is a tweaked
version of the ERC, the controversial club that was banned after
failing USGA testing for ``spring-like effect'' earlier this year.
Reportedly, the club now conforms, though Price and Azinger both
had tape covering the model name. Should Woods's ad be amended to
say something to the effect that you can play Nike balls, just as
Woods does? Absolutely. But keep in mind that, for the most part,
you can't buy the equipment that Woods and his colleagues are
using. What came of all this was no surprise. Nike announced
Thursday that those balls will be made available to the public
starting in October. You will then hear cash registers ringing from
a rush of people overlooking a simple truth: It ain't the ball,
it's the person hitting it.

WOODS LEAVING COMPETITION BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
 INVITATIONAL-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ It is a commentary on the current state of the PGA
Tour that Tiger Woods's opposition in the third round of the NEC
Invitational Saturday came not from one of his colleagues but from
a wasp that was using the 15th green as a resting area.
</P>
<P>
   Woods thought the insect was wounded and limping into his
putting line, so he picked it up to move it. Surprise. The wasp _
unlike the guys chasing Woods _ had life. ``I got stung,'' said
Woods. ``It hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   His dominance of this World Golf Championships event at
Firestone Country Club, however, was not damaged at all. Woods
broke from the gate with a birdie-eagle-birdie start, fell back
with a bogey at the par-4 fourth, then tore off 14 straight pars to
all but lay claim to his eighth PGA Tour win of the year. Despite
going into a protective mode, Woods shot a 3-under-par 67 for a 192
total, increasing his lead from seven to nine shots.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 29th consecutive round of par or better, a PGA Tour
record, and at 18 under he established a 54-hole scoring mark for
this tournament. Facts that made him virtually yawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the right thing,'' he said. ``I fired away from pins.
Fairways and greens. That's all I tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An understandable game plan in light of the seven-shot lead he
had earned thanks to Friday's sizzling 61. And one that made it
nearly impossible for the field to make up any ground. Phil
Mickelson, Woods's playing partner, made a whimper of a rally,
trimming the deficit to six with birdies at the par-3 15th and
par-5 16th, but he chopped it up coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson bogeyed the par-4 17th after driving into a fairway
bunker, then three-putted from 6 feet at the 18th to close with a
double bogey. With a disappointing 69_201, he fell into a three-way
tie for second.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Hal Sutton, whose hole-in-one at the par-3 12th
highlighted the day's best round, a 65, was first in at 9 under and
will play with Woods Sunday. Unheralded Phillip Price shot 66 to
join the trio in second place, and he showed that he has a firm
grasp of the situation. ``I'm 75th in the world,'' said Price.
``I'm not trying to compete with Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise lad, this Welshman, for if anyone knows how to protect a
lead, it is Woods. In 21 tournaments in which he has enjoyed a
54-hole lead, Woods has prevailed 19 times. Hence, his logic for
Sunday: ``If I make a lot of pars, they're going to have to go
awfully low to get me. If they do, I'll take my hat off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   He can plan on keeping the hat on.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever hope Mickelson had of getting back into contention was
doused early _ and in electrifying fashion as Woods, one day after
bringing the magic number 59 into the equation, did it again. He
lofted a wedge to 10 feet at the opening hole, a ``soft 6-iron''
second shot from 178 yards to 15 feet behind the pin at the par-5
second, then a wedge to a foot at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Birdie, eagle (his third straight at this hole), birdie.
Nineteen under par. More magic on the way?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Woods. ``I hit a couple of marginal
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as? Well, said Woods, ``I skanked it off the heel'' at the
first tee, ``pulled it about 15 feet'' with his approach into the
second, and ``heel-skanked'' the tee ball at the par-4 third.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that Woods went storming to the practice
area. ``I'm very happy,'' he said. ``A couple of times I hit bad
shots, but overall, not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   That opening burst built a cushion that was impenetrable given
the way Woods was playing. And with Mickelson going about his work
quietly _ 12 pars and two lonely birdies _ there was very little
drama. Which is OK with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big lead, any time,'' he said, when asked if he'd prefer
someone breathing down his neck, as Bob May did at last week's PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mickelson wasted that birdie-birdie effort, it was left
to Woods to supply what passed as drama: his second shot to the
par-4 18th. He had driven left into deep rough, drawing a nasty
lie, and had 162 to the front of the green, 182 to the pin. Club of
choice? Wedge, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open face, more loft,'' he said of the wild, powerful swing on
which he nearly jumped out of his shoes. ``You've got to be able to
get the ball up over the trees and then hook it against the
left-to-right wind.''
</P>
<P>
   But the swing? So ugly, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's funny-looking, but the shot ended up pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right, of course, because the ball came to rest no more
than 15 feet from the pin and set up a two-putt par. As Mickelson
struggled to find the final hole, with three putts from a short
distance, Woods stood quietly, trying like anything to shake things
off.
</P>
<P>
   Not the competition, mind you, but the sting. The stinger was
still in the ring finger of his left hand. The competition had long
since disappeared.

PATRIOT OFFENSE'S CAPACITY UP IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For good or ill, what you saw Thursday night in the
first half of the Patriots' 29-21 exhibition win over the Carolina
Panthers is how they will play offense this season. They will play
it on the run but not with the run.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's the Drew Bledsoe Show again.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis has no choice and he knows
it. He is operating a flawed machine, one that is still capable of
producing but is out of balance, and the Greeks learned eons ago
that that seldom works in life or the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is diplomatic on such matters but even he said last
week, ``We're not the kind of offense that is going to plod
downfield with 15-, 16-play drives. We'll need some big plays to
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been very productive to this point. I think we can
be, but we're not going to drive anybody off the ball or overpower
people. To be successful we need to cut out the mistakes, stay out
of third and long, and hit some big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, things haven't changed all that much except that
there appears to be a few less armaments at Bledsoe's disposal than
he had last season, when after a strong first half the offense
collapsed and took a solid defense down with it.
</P>
<P>
   That is the challenge Bledsoe and his associates face this year,
because that defense will be at least as good if not better despite
a glaring hole at right cornerback that wily 11-year veteran Otis
Smith may fill for a season until they can get reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bledsoe is up to that challenge is anyone's guess.
Certainly he can't be as confident as he was even a year ago
despite his public assurances that all is well. If you know
Bledsoe, you know that while he is the eternal optimist, he also is
a realist, and when he looks around the huddle, he knows the
offensive line is no better than a year ago and may not be as good;
he knows the tight ends standing in for Ben Coates are not as
dangerous as even the aging Coates was last year; and he knows he
hasn't had a game-controlling running back since the day Curtis
Martin left and that has not changed with the arrival of limping
J.R. Redmond and game-but-slowed Raymont Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Weis finally opened up his playbook Thursday and revealed a
number of different formations _ including a full-house backfield
and a set that opened the game with three wide receivers and no
tight end _ and attacked through the air. Bledsoe threw on eight of
the game's first 10 plays, and on one of the others, wide receiver
Troy Brown ran a reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Weis inserted scrambling Michael Bishop at quarterback on short
yardage three times, and Bishop ran the option for a 1-yard
touchdown. It was interesting to watch and it led to two solid
drives in the first half, but it was far from the approach the
Patriots would have taken if there was a semblance of a running
game. Just because you run 32 times and pass 33 doesn't mean you
have a balanced attack. Not when 75 percent of your yardage comes
from the pass.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots did try to run out of normal sets, they
averaged 2.2 yards a carry (32 carries for 71 yards). For the
summer, they averaged 3.9 yards a rush. In fact, the last time New
England averaged 4 yards a carry or better was 1985, but at least
in the Martin years (1996-98) they had one consistent back who
averaged 4 yards a rush (4.0, 3.6, 4.2).
</P>
<P>
   Since his departure, what has been consistent is that their
backs get tackled not long after they are handed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admittance, Bledsoe was dreadful in the second half
of last season, but who wouldn't have been while being sacked 33
times? After throwing 13 touchdown passes and only four
interceptions while being sacked only 22 times in the first half,
Bledsoe hurled 17 interceptions and only six TDs in the second half
to accompany those 33 sacks. Do we see a correlation here?
</P>
<P>
   Now he's with his fourth offensive coordinator in six years (Ray
Perkins, Larry Kennan, Ernie Zampese, and now Weis) and he's trying
to incorporate Weis's wisdom without a running game and with a
shaky line and reduced capabilities at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   As good and tough as Brown might be _ and he may be the best
pure football player on the team _ he has scored only eight
touchdowns in 92 NFL games. That's not all his fault, because his
forte was as a third-down receiver who got open after double
coverage took out Glenn and Coates, but it is still a fact that he
couldn't convince anyone that the less-than-legendary Vincent
Brisby or Shawn Jefferson should be unseated in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is hard-nosed, fearless, and seldom drops a ball, but he's
opening the season as the No. 2 receiver only because Brisby and
Tony Simmons couldn't win the job, not because Weis thinks he's the
ideal man. Taking him out of the slot is not playing to a strength,
and Weis probably knows it but has no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   Where this leaves Bledsoe is anyone's guess, but his confidence
has to be shaken despite his remarkable numbers. He's been to three
Pro Bowls in eight years and was the youngest quarterback to do so,
at 23. He reached 10,000 passing yards faster than anyone in
history, and among the 10 quarterbacks who were taken with the
draft's first pick _ including John Elway, Troy Aikman, and Terry
Bradshaw _ his numbers are better at this stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't won a Super Bowl and he very well may not until he
has what those other quarterbacks had: a running game behind him
and a solid line in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Those simply do not exist in New England today, which is why
it's the same story in Foxborough: The Patriots will go only as far
as Drew Bledsoe can throw them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is said that no good deed goes unpunished. Lawyer Milloy
wouldn't argue with that. Recently, Bledsoe was late for his weekly
appearance on the Patriot-owned radio show, so Milloy was asked by
the team to pinch hit. Milloy was in a team meeting room, having
arrived early for a defensive session, but went to the interview
when asked. When it lasted longer than expected, Milloy finally
said on the air that he had to go or he'd be fined. By the time he
got downstairs, the door to the meeting room was locked and he was
told he'd be fined $2,000 for being late. His explanation fell upon
deaf ears initially, but an effort last week to rescind the fine at
least held it off until he gets his first regular-season paycheck .
. . One reason Brisby will get new life with the Jets is that he
stands tall. Brisby is 6 feet 3 inches, 200 pounds, the only target
Vinny Testaverde has over 6 feet, with starters Dedric Ward at 5-9
and Wayne Chrebet at 5-10 (liar). But what was Brisby talking about
when he told New York reporters last week that Jets camp was more
intense than Bill Belichick's in New England? Old friend Al Groh is
running a tight ship in New York but it's unlikely that he's more
intense than the smile-challenged Belichick . . . Lightning knocked
out the lights at Ewbank Hall one day last week so Groh had to send
somebody to Home Depot to buy lamps that could run off generators
so they could see in their meeting rooms . . . Jets linebacker
Bryan Cox was his own blackout last week _ as in news blackout. He
has refused to talk to the media since an altercation on the
practice field with defensive line coach Ray Hamilton was reported,
and he says his silence will continue all year. But even when he's
not talking, Cox gives better quotes than most guys. ``The go to
(quote) guy has left the building,'' the non-talking Cox said.
``I'm in it for the long haul. They can't make me talk. I'll talk
when I'm ready to talk.'' Sounds like he's saying more while not
talking than a lot of guys say giving a speech . . . Cox and
Hamilton reportedly got into a heated battle over defensive line
calls. Linebacker Mo Lewis and defensive back Victor Green had to
separate them . . . Groh claims this is the first time in NFL
history that a team has had a bye the final week of the exhibition
season, and he's not happy about it. Groh is afraid his team might
lose its edge. What they'll probably lose is a little soreness,
which can't hurt . . . The Bills took few chances in their final
exhibition game, keeping eight starters out. But they did get
running back Antowain Smith playing again. Smith has been limping
with a thigh bruise, a reminder that his durability remains in
question . . . Speaking of the Bills, some wondered whether Rob
Johnson's rip job on Doug Flutie in the upcoming issue of Penthouse
was a return to the old days of the Bickering Bills, which is what
they were called in Buffalo during some of their Super Bowl
seasons. The fact is, most of the Bills agreed with Johnson, who
said Flutie was selfish and had insulted the team when he told a
Canadian broadcaster in February they would have beaten the
Tennessee Titans if he had started the playoff game instead of
Johnson. ``If he was covering kicks maybe,'' Johnson told
Penthouse, a reference to the Titans' last-second kick-pass-and-run
play for the winning touchdown after Johnson had led the Bills to a
go-ahead field goal with only seconds to play. Flutie's willingness
to be a team player when not on the field has often been
challenged, in his days in Chicago and now. Last year, wide
receiver Andre Reed called Flutie selfish on his Web site. Now
Johnson has done the same, and no one rushed to Flutie's defense.
In fact, the honeymoon may be over for Flutie even with the Buffalo
media. A columnist in Rochester wrote last week, ``The concept of
team is lost on Flutie.'' Wisely, Flutie has remained mum, while
Johnson tried to downplay the fallout by saying, ``If it was that
bad something else would have happened by now if we hated each
other that much.'' I'm sure that's comforting for head coach Wade
Phillips to know.
</P>

   The Hall of Fame Senior Committee finally decided to honor the
first defensive player from the Dolphins' Super Bowl teams that
went 32-2 over two seasons in the 1970s, nominating Nick Buoniconti
to be a Hall of Fame finalist. Usually, that's a lock for
induction. Buoniconti got the news last week on a Florida golf
course, when his wife beeped him. His first thought was that
something had happened to his paralyzed son, Mark, who was injured
years ago playing football at Clemson. If he is inducted next July,
Buoniconti will have his son introduce him . . . Before he named
Jay Fiedler his starting quarterback Saturday, here was the essence
of the dilemma facing Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt: Damon Huard
failed to lead his team to a single touchdown in seven quarters
with the first unit this summer, but Fiedler was injured and did
not play a down until Friday night. Huard was 4-1 as a starter
replacing Dan Marino last year, but Fiedler has more NFL
experience. Wide receiver Oronde Gadsden put Wannstedt's problem in
perfect perspective: ``He has a quiet confidence about him,''
Gadsden said of Fiedler. ``What everybody is waiting to see is
whether that translates into the ball getting to where it needs to
be.'' . . . Shaky quarterbacks are a problem not only in Miami.
What about in Pittsburgh, where the Steelers are on the hook for
millions with Kordell Stewart and watched in horror as he went 14
for 40 for 191 yards in exhibition games? Between Stewart and wide
receivers Plaxico Burress and Troy Edwards, the Steelers have spent
$18.5 million in signing-bonus money alone the last two years and
still don't have a passing game . . . Sometimes you have to know
whom to trust and sometimes you have to know better than to trust
anyone. At the end of a practice session last week, Titans safety
Marcus Robertson was doing a pass-catching drill using a machine
that shoots footballs out at a fast clip. Head coach Jeff Fisher
was walking behind Robertson, who stopped the drill as the coach
passed. Fisher told him, ``It's OK. I trust you.'' The next ball
went whistling through Robertson's fingers and bounced right in
front of the trusting coach . . . Andre Rison may have finally
landed with the right team, the Oakland Raiders. The troubled
former All-Pro receiver was signed last week after the Kansas City
Chiefs released him and he caught passes for 15 and 34 yards on his
first two plays against the Bears, the latter being the
second-longest gain of the summer by a Raider. He also got charged
in Kansas City with bouncing $158,000 in checks, was fined $219.50
last month in Wisconsin for giving a false name to a policeman
after a brawl in front of a bar, and will have to appear in an
Olathe, Kan., court before the Raiders play the Chiefs in Kansas
City Oct. 15 or face a felony theft charge for not returning a
borrowed tape recorder to a music store. Sounds like the perfect
Raider, don't you think? . . . If the Patriots are looking to
upgrade their punting, the Raiders may give them the chance. Lee
Johnson has struggled this summer, netting barely 36 yards a punt
in four exhibition games and averaging 37 yards in the final game
Thursday night, including a 17-yard shank. The Raiders have the
opposite problem. Rookie Shane Lechler is averaging 48.6 yards a
punt and incumbent Leo Araguz is averaging 46.6. Somebody has to
go.

   The Chargers are ready to sign former Pro Bowl defensive end
Neil Smith to replace the injured Raylee Johnson, the team's best
pass-rushing defensive end. After the Broncos released him before
the summer, Smith turned down a $750,000 offer to play for the
lowly Saints and opted to wait for a better opportunity. He now has
one with one of the best defenses in the AFC. He flew into San
Diego last week to talk terms and was wise enough not to show up
with a suitcase, flying right back home to Kansas City the same day
while the Chargers formulated an offer. Smiling like a Cheshire
cat, Smith said, ``I'm feeling the warmness here. There's a need
for me to come here.'' All they have to do is show him a little
love, NFL style. That's green love . . . How jumbled is the AFC
West race? According to Chargers coach Mike Riley, ``We could
finish first or we could finish last.'' . . . Here's how the
best-laid plans can go astray. After spending $100 million in
signing bonuses and salaries to bring a potential Super Bowl team
to Washington, Redskins owner Dan Snyder will have to see his team
open the season with a guy who has never played a down as the
starting center. Cory Raymer will miss 4-6 games with injuries, so
untested Mark Fischer must step in. Center is a pivotal position,
so how well Fischer holds up may determine more about the Redskins'
future than all the high-priced players Snyder signed . . . Deion
Sanders has decided he is the Lawrence Taylor of cornerbacks _ a
man who changed the way his position is played. He's so convinced,
in fact, that he thinks more should change. ``I don't know why they
haven't changed the name of the position yet,'' Sanders said.
``Instead of cornerback, just call it Deion. Kids should say, `I
want to play quarterback. I want to play receiver. I want to play
Deion.' '' . . . When the Redskins played the Browns last week, the
contrast of how the teams are being built could not have been more
evident. The Redskins had a total of 71 years of NFL experience in
their starting lineup, Cleveland had 30. More to the point,
Washington wide receiver Irving Fryar has 16 years in the NFL.
Cleveland's entire receiving corps had a combined seven. The
Redskins are betting it all on this season. The Browns are trying
to build a contender piece by piece, which means they're going to
lose a lot of games again this year . . . Speaking of the Browns,
linebacker Rahim Abdullah seems to have the wrong first name for
his position. Rahim is Arabic for ``merciful.'' What linebacker is
merciful? . . . Certainly not Ravens Pro Bowler Ray Lewis, who
reportedly is so angry over the $250,000 fine levied against him by
the NFL for his misdemeanor guilty plea in a murder case in Atlanta
that he has bulked up from 240 to 265 and is playing even more
intensely than before, if that's possible. Lewis has made more than
200 tackles each of the last two seasons, so intensity has never
been an issue. He is refusing to talk to out-of-town media and
reportedly focusing all of his frustrations and anger on the team
in front of him . . . The same week Bob Kraft was selling naming
rights to his new stadium for a record figure, voters in Phoenix
were polled about a new stadium there, and 59 percent opposed it.

REDMOND EAGER TO MAKE UP FOR LATE START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ J.R. Redmond is finding out firsthand the
difference between fans in the West and fans in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Adored, almost revered in the West, Redmond already has been
called slow, unexciting, and perhaps a waste of a third-round pick
here. There's been a steadfast refusal by some Patriots observers
to factor in a 10-day holdout and a groin injury that required
surgery and perhaps is still not 100 percent healed.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Redmond must prove himself quickly. It's not about what
they thought of you out there, it's what we think of you here.
</P>
<P>
   But Redmond has had plenty of practice at withstanding rancor.
The Arizona State star already has been divorced and forced to
mature beyond his 23 years after enduring an NCAA suspension last
October. In a sordid tale, he was pressured into marrying a member
of the ASU athletic department, whom he had been dating and whose
cell phone he had used. The woman told him that the use of her
phone would be an NCAA violation unless they were married. A month
later, the episode ended in bad publicity and a dissolved marriage.
Redmond has been through the wash and wrung out.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a little heat from impatient New England fans is nothing
compared with what he's been through.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it is time to show them what he's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is much faster than in college,'' said Redmond. ``I
couldn't believe the speed of Tampa Bay's defensive line. But
that's the kind of thing I have to get used to. I think I'm making
progress. It'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever been around Redmond believes it will come.
Bruce Snyder, his coach at ASU, said, ``He was born to play
football. He loves it. He enjoys every minute he's out there. This
is a neat kid. You're going to like him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   Personable, and a bit cocky, Redmond is devout in the belief
that he is a big-time talent. He was typecast as a third-down back
by some teams because he could split wide and act as a receiver in
Snyder's offense. Many other teams, including the Patriots, didn't
believe in that narrow view.
</P>
<P>
   But he's started so slowly that Kevin Faulk has had time to
shake off his own third-down-back typecasting and become the de
facto No. 1 back. Redmond knows there's still time to emerge, still
time to make his mark as a rookie. But the opportunities may not
come as readily now that the preseason is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to help our team in any way I possibly can,''
said Redmond. ``I know I started late, but mentally I don't feel
behind because I was going through the reps and the playbooks even
when I was out. Physically, I hadn't been out there for a while but
the more I play the more comfortable I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond had 13 carries for 28 yards Thursday vs. Carolina,
averaging 2.2 yards. His best run was for 6 yards. He also caught
three passes for 29 yards, including a 19-yarder. He fumbled an
end-over-end pitchout from Michael Bishop, but recovered it. The
spring he seemed to lack against Tampa Bay last Sunday was slightly
more visible.
</P>
<P>
   He returned three kickoffs for 59 yards with a long return of
24. He fielded one punt but didn't return it. Snyder once said that
Redmond didn't call for a fair catch in his first 2 1/2 years at
ASU and he was considered a ``courageous punt returner.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attributes have not shown up yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although his statistics may seem less than impressive, they are
a starting point. To think Redmond can't get better and explosive
once he's seen the pro game would be shortsighted, according to
those who know him. After all, Redmond has been the star at every
level of his career _ from midget football to college.
</P>
<P>
   In an Arizona Republic poll last fall, respondents voted Redmond
the ``most influential'' athlete in the state of Arizona. He got 33
percent of the vote to beat out Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson
(24 percent), Suns guard Jason Kidd (19 percent), Diamondbacks
third baseman Matt Williams (13 percent) and Cardinals quarterback
Jake Plummer (6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Right now he barely registers on the Boston-area radar screen,
but Redmond, who wears black-rimmed glasses off the field, always
has been seen and heard. He's always made an impact, even in his
new line of clothing, ``Just Run,'' which is soon to make its
debut. Redmond wants to make a splash with his clothes and football
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to pay my dues,'' said Redmond. ``We have excellent
running backs here like Kevin and Raymont (Harris), who have been
around the league for a long time. I'm trying to learn things from
them, and there's a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your body has to adjust to the speed of the game. Everybody in
this league is strong and fast, so you have to keep ahead of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond was the 76th pick in the third round _ considered ``a
steal'' by some of the top college scouts _ and the Patriots still
hope they have landed the next Curtis Martin and not the next
Reggie Dupard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the Patriots tried out linebacker Doug Coleman,
formerly with the Giants and Titans. He is considered a top special
teams player.

CHAMP VARGAS GETS FOURTH-ROUND TKO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Ross Thompson stands ... er, sits corrected.
</P>
<P>
   IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas, almost
out-of-control angry, shut Thompson's big mouth the best way he
knew how on Saturday: by repeatedly putting his formidable fists
into it.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who had described Vargas as overrated and punched him
at a prefight news conference, went down three times as result of
Vargas' frightening fury before referee Joe Cortez put an end to
the slaughter at 1:07 of the fourth round in front of an energized
pro-Vargas crowd of 5,325.
</P>
<P>
   The victory sets up a juicy title-unification matchup with WBA
champ Felix Trinidad on Dec. 2, a tentative fight that is all the
more compelling after Vargas' spectacular performance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross Thompson had never been knocked out, never been knocked
down. I think that shows what kind of junior middleweight I am,''
said Vargas (20-0, with 18 knockouts).
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' anger was evident before the opening bell: The Oxnard,
Calif., resident refused to shake hands with Thompson (24-4-1, 16
KOs) until Cortez made it clear he had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in his career, Vargas' emotion spilled
over into the ring. He went after Thompson immediately looking for
a knockout until his trainer, Eduardo Garcia, ordered him to calm
down and be patient.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he found it difficult to hit the slick, awkward Thompson
for 2{ relatively even rounds.
</P>
<P>
   And then opportunity knocked. Moments after Cortez took a point
from Vargas for hitting behind the head in the third round, Vargas
landed a straight right to Thompson's jaw and the challenger never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas pinned him against the ropes and pummeled away until
Thompson fell again as the result of another right a split second
before the bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, it was clear Thompson hadn't recovered. He held
Vargas in an attempt to buy himself time but the champion broke his
grip and resumed his attack, knocking him down a third time a
minute into the round.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas then pinned a helpless Thompson against the ropes and
landed seven unanswered punches, which prompted Cortez to stop it
and Vargas to jump on the ropes and raise his arms in victory as
the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, the bulk of whom apparently made the trip from the
L.A. area, embraced Vargas like never before _ cheering his every
move and chanting repeatedly during the fight, ``Vargas! Vargas!
Vargas!''
</P>
<P>
   And he earned it: It was the kind of dominating performance that
fans don't forget.
</P>
<P>
   The only sour note this night was the fact Vargas spat at
Thompson after the last knockdown. Vargas apologized at the
postfight news conference, although Thompson never realized what
the champion had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pissed off,'' he said. ``I've never been this pissed off
for a fight. It's over now, though. It's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who weighed an astonishing 173 pounds Saturday (to
Vargas' 163) after making the 154-pound limit on Friday, was
extremely humble afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave what I had,'' said the Buffalo, N.Y., resident.
``Fernando's a good fighter, a (ital)great(endital) fighter. ... He
just caught me. My mind was OK but my legs were gone.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... My head said get up, my legs said stay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Vargas is Trinidad, probably in Las Vegas, in what
could be a defining fight his career.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been overly enthusiastic when he predicted that
pay-per-view buy rates would exceed all nonheavyweight records.
However, he might not be far off _ those who are familiar with both
fighters can't wait to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mega big, it's super big, it's definitely my biggest
fight,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to it. And I think I can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson might agree.
</P>
<P>
   Former Olympian Vernon Forrest, who had to wait a long time for
an opportunity to fight for a world championship, will have to wait
even longer.
</P>
<P>
   On the Vargas-Thompson undercard, Forrest's opponent, Raul Frank
(23-3-1, 12 KOs), suffered a deep gash on his forehead as the
result of an accidental head-butt and the fight for the vacant IBF
welterweight title was ruled no contest in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest (31-0, 25 KOs) wept at the postfight news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was going to be my night. I'm just so
disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the fight will be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, won the first
two rounds on one card while the other two were even.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Forrest, 29 and a longtime welterweight contender,
should've received a title shot much earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Shibata Flores (40-8, 20 KOs) of Los Angeles defeated
Robert Kamya (10-1, four KOs) when Kamya quit after seven rounds of
a scheduled 12-round junior middleweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   The give-and-take bout was close but Kamya complained of pain in
his eye and refused to come out for the eighth round. &QL;

SEMINOLES OPEN FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-BRIGHAM YOUNG-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ In the grand scheme of things, it will be a
footnote in a season that figures to be filled with highlights.
</P>
<P>
   But championship seasons have to start somewhere, and if you are
a Florida State fan who believes the Seminoles can parlay last
season's 12-0 national championship run into a 13-0 national
championship rerun, you can point to Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's effort
against Brigham Young as a portent of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden's No. 2-ranked Seminoles did very little
wrong in opening with a 29-3 victory over the Cougars, who did
little right in a Pigskin Classic that was anything but classic.
</P>
<P>
   FSU, of course, was supposed to dominate. The Seminoles were
25-point favorites and nearly took care of that spread in the first
half when they climbed all over the Cougars in building a 22-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   For BYU, which was beginning coach Lavell Edwards's last hurrah
season after 29 years, it was a quick dose of life in the fast lane
of football at the top of the rankings. The Cougars are a preseason
pick to finish third in the Mountain West Conference behind Utah
and Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars were smaller and slower and looked clueless for most
of the evening, much to the delight of the majority of the 54,260
fans who nearly filled Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was led by 28-year-old quarterback Chris Weinke _
who now is a dazzling 22-1 in career starts for the Seminoles. He
took care of business, throwing for a couple of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some good things and some not so good things,'' said
Weinke. ``We've got lots of room to improve, certainly. But we
moved the ball pretty consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he saw a different game than he had expected.

   ``The game surprised me,'' he said. ``Our defense hadn't done a
thing all year and our offense had been very good. I expected a
high-scoring game and it was just the opposite. The defense
couldn't play any better. And the offense went hot and cold.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU starting quarterback Bret Engermann, whose main claim to
fame is that Larry King is his brother-in-law, could do little in
the first half against a Florida State defense that had done
nothing to instill any confidence in Bowden and his staff during
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But when the bell rings, Florida State generally shows up. And
all went well, aside from some kicking problems. Freshman walk-on
Matt Munyon _ filling in for injured freshman scholarship kicker
Brett Cimorelli _ missed an extra point and two short field-goal
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, it was business as usual for FSU, which
now can get on with the business of defending its national
championship.

RED SOX FEELING POWERLESS IN AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ That home run Mo Vaughn hit to deepest center
field in Fenway Park Wednesday night off Tomo Ohka wasn't a
game-winner, but it will do for a conversation starter.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, where have all the Red Sox home runs gone?
</P>
<P>
   We're in the middle of the biggest power show in the history of
the game, but instead of Roman candles every night, the Sox are
setting off only an occasional cherry bomb.
</P>
<P>
   With just a few days left in the month, the Sox have hit only 14
home runs in August, and that's only after Brian Daubach (twice)
and Carl Everett went deep on successive nights in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Everett and Daubach have four home runs this month, Nomar
Garciaparra two. No one else on the team has more than one.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have hit 44 home runs this month. The Sox,
meanwhile, are neck and neck with Sammy Sosa and Jeff Bagwell to
see who hits more home runs in August. So far, it's Sox 14, Sammy
and Bags 11 apiece, with Glenallen Hill (10) lurking.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon hasn't hit a home run since June 23; you have to cut
him some slack, he missed a month with a bad hamstring, but it's
been a month since he's come back and he still hasn't gone deep.
Troy O'Leary, who hit 28 last season? One this month, on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman and Bernard Gilkey haven't hit a home run since
the Fourth of July. The catchers, Jason Varitek and Scott
Hatteberg, are 0 for the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have played 12 games this month in which they did not
homer. Everett's home run Friday was just the fifth hit by the Sox
in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodger pitcher, Darren Dreifort, hit two home runs in a game.
The Sox have had just two games this month in which they've hit two
home runs in a game, on back-to-back days (Aug. 9 and 11).
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal, you say? They're in the midst of the
playoff chase anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the big deal: In games in which the Sox have hit two or
more home runs, they're 24-7. In games in which they hit no homers,
they're 16-29.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to cut it, especially for a team that can't
run. Opposing pitchers are working around Everett, Nomar's in a
slump, O'Leary's home run stroke has been MIA all season, Daubach
is streaky, Nixon has been bounced around in the lineup, and the
new guys don't have ``slugger'' on their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox return home Friday, they'll be facing one team of
big boppers after another: the Mariners, A's, Yankees, and Indians.
Popguns don't stand a chance. When that twinge in Garciaparra's
hamstring heals, Sox fans had better hope it sends tremors into his
bat, too.
</P>
<P>
   And who was that guy who hit one halfway to Revere Wednesday
night?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two position players, Rockies catcher Brent Mayne and Mets
outfielder Derek Bell, wound up pitching for their teams last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was cannon fodder in a 16-1 loss to his former team, the
Padres, allowing five runs (four earned) and walking three. His
first pitch was clocked at 47 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne, meanwhile, had never pitched, not even in Little League,
but emerged with the win after Rockies manager Buddy Bell used him
in the 12th inning when his ninth pitcher, John Wasdin, was ejected
after hitting Andres Galarraga of the Braves with a pitch,
provoking a bench-clearing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never thrown off a mound,'' Mayne said. ``Last week in New
York, I was in the bullpen and stood up on the mound and pretended
I was throwing, but I didn't have a ball. Five days later I'm in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only pitched an inning, retiring Chipper Jones on a
checked-swing grounder with two on and two out, but became the
first nonpitcher to win a game since Aug. 25, 1968, when Rocky
Colavito, with the Yankees at the end of his career, beat the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams once used a position player, Mike Benjamin, as a
pitcher, but he hates the concept, thinking it makes a mockery of
the game. But what would happen if he ran out of pitchers? Who
would pitch for Boston?
</P>
<P>
   The question was put to Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no clue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Who would like to?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nomar would,'' he said. ``He pitched a little bit when
he was young. I actually caught him once before, at Georgia Tech.
Not in a game, in an intrasquad game. He had a sinker and a
changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe (Kerrigan, the pitching coach) always wants me to pitch.
`Just one inning,' he tells me. I throw mainly a four-seamer. I
don't know how to throw the ball curved. I'd rather keep my stuff
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett pitched in high school in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to see Carl on the mound,'' Varitek said.
``Nothing personal. I just wouldn't. He's a good enough athlete,
but he'd probably get too competitive out there and blow his arm
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he'd be willing to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fun,'' he said. ``I can't tell you what I throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he would leap at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to,'' he said. ``I'd do anything they asked me to do
in a game. I'd even catch, though I probably wouldn't be able to
walk for a week afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside to Derek Lowe: If the Sox ever get tired of you, they
could go to Nomar. He was a closer in high school. He'd play eight
innings at short, then come in to nail down the last three batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinker and splitter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those swarms of insects that invaded Detroit's Comerica Park
Wednesday night in Biblical numbers?
</P>
<P>
   ``They left us as quickly as they came in,'' said Tyler Barnes,
the Tigers' senior director of marketing and communications. ``And
they left no calling card.''
</P>
<P>
   Play was held up briefly in the bottom of the first inning of
the Tigers-Mariners game when the insects arrived, said Barnes,
``like a shadow over the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a two-minute bug delay. Someone in the press box said
that it looked like the fans were doing the Macarena; they were all
fanning the insects away from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't blow my bubble gum 'cause I didn't want to get any
bugs in it,'' said Mariners starter Paul Abbott. ``I thought we
were going to have a bug-out. That would have been a first.''
</P>
<P>
   The invaders, Barnes said, were flying ants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an entomologist,'' he said, ``but I think they came in
the millions. It was freaky. I've seen similar things _ bee swarms,
250 seagulls descend on a field _ but nothing of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans retreated to the relative safety of the concourses,
Barnes said, until the insects began to lessen in number around the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players did a terrific job of playing through it,'' Barnes
said. ``The situation was somewhat similar to playing in a steady
rain. Certainly it was distracting, but by no means was it
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, as yet, has been able to offer a plausible explanation
for the insects' appearance (another sign from above that Juan
Gonzalez should sign elsewhere?). Or disappearance, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was oppressively hot and humid that day, especially for
Detroit,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What blew me away was that I was asked by two TV stations, on
camera, what we planned to do to prevent this in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em, `We're taking suggestions.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trivia question: What pitcher gave up a 431-foot home run to
Ramon Castro, the first blast hit this season by a Marlins catcher?
(Hint: He's a former Red Sox pitcher now laboring for the Colorado
Rockies.) No, not Johnny Waz. Too obvious. This was Brian Rose,
doing his part to keep the Marlins out of the record books. The
last team whose catchers hit no homers all season were the 1980
Mets. John Stearns was the regular catcher, but he played just 54
games because of a broken finger. His backups included Alex
Trevino, Jose Moreno, Ron Hodges, and Butch Benton. The last team
with any position that had no homers was the 1995 Texas Rangers.
Their center fielders, led by Otis Nixon, were shut out . . .
Garciaparra's younger brother is turning serious about baseball,
according to big brother. Michael Garciaparra, who is entering his
senior year in high school, played in the recent Area Code games,
which feature the top high school players in the country. He's also
a star soccer and football player . . . Angels manager Mike
Scioscia on left fielder Darin Erstad, who didn't play last week in
Boston because of a strained muscle in his rib cage: ``Did you see
that catch he made against the Yankees? Incredible. That's why he's
the MVP for my money, for what he does all around. I know he
doesn't get much ink back East, and Carlos Delgado and Nomar are
putting up some great numbers, but when you look at Darin's
production, his defense, stealing bases, power, clutch hitting, he
does it all. He reminds me a little bit of what Kirk Gibson did for
us on the Dodgers in 1988. Every time we needed a clutch hit, or a
clutch catch, or a clutch stolen base, any clutch play we needed,
Gibson did it. Erstad is like that.'' . . . Scioscia, like
Williams, is no proponent of the slide-step as a way to keep
runners from stealing. But he said there are other ways to control
the running game. ``We have our pitchers vary their hold counts,''
said Scioscia. ``You want to control the jump as well as the time
in between where you have to deliver the ball. Varitek is not the
problem. We have him at about 1.98 seconds to tag time from the
time he throws, which is above average. Pudge (Rodriguez) is
1.8-1.85 and we've even had him at 1.77 seconds, which is
incredible.'' Here's why fractions of seconds are important. An
above-average runner can go from his lead at first base to second
base in about 3.5 seconds. Red Sox pitchers, according to the
Angels' figures, are about 1.55-1.56 seconds to home plate. That
leaves the catcher little margin for error. ``I checked myself
after that Seattle series, when I was as humiliated as you can
be,'' Varitek said. ``I was consistently around 1.92 to 1.98.''
Martinez is very good at varying his holds, Varitek said. ``He
alters the pattern of his delivery,'' said the catcher. ``He might
wait two or three seconds one time before he releases the ball, one
second the next time. A lot of guys like to go, `Dum, dum, pitch.'
'' And did you know that when a Sox pitcher throws over to first
base, he has been instructed to do so from the bench? ``That's why
I'm always looking into the dugout,'' Varitek said.
</P>

<P>
   You may have missed it, but last week the Sox went over the 2
million mark in attendance for the 14th straight year (not
including the strike-interrupted 1994 season). They rank seventh in
the league in attendance, with all six teams ahead of them playing
in new ballparks, except for the Yankees, who are the defending
champs and play in New York. The Yanks are averaging more than
40,000 a night and are on pace to draw 3.2 million. They're
followed by Cleveland, Baltimore, Seattle, Texas, and Detroit. The
Sox have a shot at their all-time attendance record of 2,562,435,
set by the Sons of Joe Morgan in 1991. With a crowd of 20,000 and
change Friday night in Kansas City, the Sox joined the Yankees as
the only AL teams to draw more than 2 million on the road. It's the
fifth straight season and 14th time overall that the Sox have drawn
more than 2 million on the road . . . Tragedy struck former Sox
pitcher Pat Rapp, who last season went through a life-threatening
pregnancy with his wife, returning to his home in Louisiana several
times between starts. Rapp, now pitching for Baltimore, rushed home
recently to be with his father, who apparently contracted an
infection while fishing. Rapp then returned to the Orioles to pitch
and took a two-hitter into the eighth inning of what became a 4-1
loss to the Royals. He went back home, and two days later, James
Rapp died at 55. Our sympathies to Rapp and his family.

USOC WRESTLES WITH COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Only in America does the Olympic committee bring three
arbitrators to the Games to settle last-minute disputes over who
ought to be on the team. This year the post-selection griping is at
an all-time high, with 10 complaints from disgruntled athletes just
in the last two months. First, the softball team had to be picked
three times. Then it was boxers protesting decisions. Recently,
it's been Greco-Roman wrestling, cycling, tennis, and rowing.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, arbitration cases are about process _ how the team was
chosen. But the wrestling case, which still hasn't been decided
after two appeals, two arbitrators, and two levels of federal
court, is explosive because it deals with a ``field of play'' issue
_ a non-call by a referee at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   After Keith Sieracki beat Matt Lindland in the finals, Lindland
claimed he'd been tripped. After USA Wrestling turned down Lindland
twice, an arbitrator ordered a rematch, which Lindland won. After
Sieracki got an arbitrator to put him back on the team, Lindland
went to court. He was turned down at the district level, upheld at
the appellate level. Now, the issue has been dumped into the lap of
the US Olympic Committee, which will decide this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insanity, that's what's going on,'' Lindland said. ``I don't
know what decision is final.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the US baseball team has no Tim Raines, Wade Boggs, or
Terry Steinbach, 13 of its players (including all of the catchers
and three of the four outfielders) have major league experience.
Most notable is 37-year-old catcher Pat Borders, who was the 1992
World Series MVP with Toronto and now plays for Tampa Bay's Triple
A club. As expected, the selectors couldn't get most parent clubs
to part with anybody who might make even a slight difference in a
pennant race. Still, manager Tommy Lasorda is bullish on the team's
medal chances. ``We're not going 6,000 miles to lose,'' he said.
The Americans won the bronze behind Cuba and Japan last time using
college kids . . . Even though she probably couldn't have played
more than half of any match at the Games, the loss of Michelle
Akers, 34, is an undeniable blow to the US women's soccer team. For
15 years, she was the team's Alpha female, its unquestioned
on-field leader, the one woman whom rivals actually were afraid of.
Finally, though, her body gave out after a dozen knee surgeries,
numerous concussions, and an ongoing battle with chronic fatigue
syndrome. The crusher, finally, was a reinjured shoulder this
month. ``I finally said to myself, this is insane,'' said Akers,
who said her body was ``ready for a MASH unit'' . . . Meanwhile,
the same malaise that's dogged the US men's (i.e. World Cup) soccer
team for years has spread to the women. Except for the seven-goal
outburst against the Russians (who won't be in Sydney), the Olympic
team hasn't scored more than one in its last eight games. After the
Americans drew, 1-1, with Canada last weekend (after 21 straight
wins) and missed the target with 21 of 31 shots, coach April
Heinrichs bluntly told them to snap out of it. ``I reminded them
that this is not going to be easy,'' she said. ``There is no team
in the world that is going to give them the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did the US men's soccer team get the best three over-age players
in Jeff Agoos, Chris Armas, and Frankie Hejduk? No, but it got the
best three available. With the Olympics two months later than usual
(and halfway across the world), most European clubs are balking at
letting their better players go. The Nigerians, who won in Atlanta,
are having trouble prying loose captain Nwankwo Kanu from Arsenal.
And the Brazilians, who've never won the Olympics, didn't even
bother trying to get Rivaldo back from Barcelona (which did release
four regulars to the Spanish team). Meanwhile, Brazil turned down
Romario's plea to play at age 35 since they're using only
under-23s. Romario, who played on the 1988 squad that lost to the
Soviets in the final, has won every world bauble but an Olympic
gold . . . The most baffling aspect of the gymnastics trials was
the ``nolo contendere'' by Vanessa Atler, a former national
cochampion who still was one of the top three candidates coming
into the year. But she obviously hadn't trained all summer and
clearly didn't care whether she was on the team at all. Had Atler
done anything at the FleetCenter, the selectors would have picked
her as a vault and floor specialist. But they were worried that her
lassitude would rub off on her teammates, who'll need the meet of
their lives to win even a bronze at Sydney . . . Dominique Dawes
will be only the third US female gymnast to compete in three
Olympics, joining Muriel Davis Grossfeld (1956-60-64) and Linda
Metheny Mulvihill (1964-68-72). If she wins a medal, Dawes will be
the first American female gymnast to do that at three Games. Dawes
and Shannon Miller both made the podium in 1992 and 1996. Even at
23, Dawes isn't the oldest woman ever to make the team. Mulvihill
was 25 in 1972 and Kathy Johnson was 24 in 1984 . . . The oldest
swimmer on the US team _ 33-year-old Dara Torres _ will also be the
busiest in Sydney. Torres will be competing in the 50 and 100
freestyles, the 100 butterfly, and probably all three relays. If
she wins medals in each, which she could, Torres will have a career
10. That could still leave her short of teammate Jenny Thompson,
who can add five medals to the six she already has. Most ever by a
US female swimmer is eight by Shirley Babashoff . . . It wasn't the
record 1,300 competitors (more than double the usual) that made the
US Olympic swimming trials such a grind. ``The most onerous thing
about it was the eight days,'' said men's team coach Mark Schubert.
``But we needed to do it because NBC's making us do it for the
Olympic Games.'' . . . How much is the USOC cracking down on its
eight 2012 Olympic bid cities from schmoozing with the Lords of the
Rings at Sydney cocktail parties? Their representatives can't even
wear lapel pins. After the Salt Lake payoff scandal, the USOC
doesn't want even a hint of lobbying. A number of IOC members, most
notably Mexico's Mario Vasquez Rana, still blame the Utahans for
seducing them with the same goodies they'd been taking for years.
Anyway, lobbying the Lords makes little sense now. They won't even
choose the 2008 site until next year . . . If you can get yourself
Down Under, you'll have no problem getting Olympic tickets,
especially for soccer matches. More than a quarter of the 9 million
still remain unsold, even for the closing ceremonies. Last year's
distribution mess didn't help, but the current reason is seasonal:
It's still winter in Australia, so Summer Games seem distant. And
if you want Olympic arts festival tickets, the organizers may offer
to pick you up in a limo. Less than half of the seats for
orchestral, opera, and theater performances have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're not imagining things if your Sydney-bound flight reeks of
roach spray. The Australian government requires every inbound plane
to be disinfected to keep foreign insects and other pests from
infesting the island continent. Problem is, the sprays (either
permethrin or d-phenothrin) have been known to make passengers sick
and may cause long-term health problems . . . Given Sydney's recent
airport woes, it may make more sense to go by tramp steamer. First,
recent power outages twice shut down the control tower. Then, the
baggage system broke down five times this month. All this after the
Aussies spent $350 million modernizing the place . . . The
five-ring Olympic logo stretching across Sydney's famous Harbor
Bridge, which will glow from dusk to dawn until the opening
ceremonies, is 248 feet long, 116 feet high, and contains 170,000
individual lights . . . Only in Japan: Travel agencies are offering
a $1,700 package that will fly spectators nine hours to Australia
to see one soccer match, then fly them back in time for work a day
later. No hotel room, no meal. ``We created this tour for people
who don't have much time,'' said a Japan Travel Bureau spokesman.

UNSHADED'S TIME ARRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
 STAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Racing may seem like a game geared to
instant gratification, but the results of Saturday's $1 million
Travers Stakes at Saratoga proved that long-range planning has its
place. Trainer Carl Nafzger had pointed Unshaded, a headstrong
gelding, toward the Travers since January, and, although there were
bumps in the road, Unshaded got the job done with a rippling run
through the stretch, justifying Nafzger's patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse wasn't focused before,'' said Nafzger. ``He was
always a nice horse, but he wasn't sharp. He got focused after his
last race (a third in the Jim Dandy at The Spa Aug. 5). He's just a
sharper, more focused horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about the Travers since January. He was a
talented horse, but he hadn't matured yet. Now, he's a man. We take
every race as a building race to learn as we're going until we get
to our ultimate goal. Truthfully, I was 100 percent certain he'd
win the Travers. As long as he kept developing, I knew he would do
it. I love it. I love it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded, the second choice at 3-1 ($8.90 to win), received a
strong ride from Shane Sellers before a record Travers Day crowd of
54,116. The winner put in a determined drive to catch Albert The
Great, a 7-1 shot, who had shaken loose turning for home under
Jorge Chavez. Unshaded thrust his head in front as the pair hit the
wire, covering the 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:02 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   Commendable, the Belmont Stakes victor, set the pace at 9-1
under Pat Day, and held on for third. Dixie Union, who was favored
at 5-2 after taking the Haskell at Monmouth Aug. 6, finished a
disappointing fourth after fading in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded, a son of 1990 Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic
winner Unbridled, was gelded because he was a bad actor who
resisted being trained. He's still a tough customer, as Sellers
knows well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a horse you can't put in a particular spot,'' said
Sellers. ``You just can't do it. He won't listen to you. He's just
a difficult horse. He's got a bad attitude. That's the tough part
for me. You tell him where to go, but he says `no.' You've got to
go with him. He's a big plodder, and I just can't get into a rhythm
with him. He was closer to the pace today, and I was able to get
him running. I listened to my horse today. I gave him my all, and
he gave me his all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, who stands a respectable sixth in the Saratoga
standings with 18 winners, took the occasion to disclose some
information about his personal life in what was a remarkable moment
of unsolicited candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed my attitude in the last year,'' he said. ``I now
know that the press and the people have their own opinions. I used
to try to change everybody's opinion. Mentally, I would fight with
the press. I'm just going to go out and ride like a professional. I
burned a lot of bridges. Whoever I did it to, I apologize. I hope
they give me a second chance. I've sought help for anger
management. I'm on medication, and I'm not embarrassed about it. I
never gave myself a chance to be a great rider, either mentally or
physically. Since this meet started, I've mended a few fences with
trainers that I burnt with my mouth. It was great to win the top
race of the meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Zito, conditioner of Albert The Great, also did a fine
training job. Albert The Great was considered a front-runner, but
Zito took the blinkers off him, and Chavez was able to rate him
behind Commendable untill he grabbed the lead on the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real disappointed that we didn't get there, but I can't
thank Albert enough for trying as hard as he did,'' said Zito. ``He
just got beat. That's racing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at the quarter-pole, I saw Unshaded coming,'' said
Chavez. ``We were fighting neck-and-neck, head-and-head. I thought
Albert The Great ran a tremendous race. We're real happy with this
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union had no real excuse. However, California jockey Alex
Solis did have him on the rail for most of the journey, and the
rail has been completely dead for the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his left front shoe, so that might have had something
to do with it,'' said Richard Mandella, who trains Dixie Union.
``Alex was trying to save ground part way around the track, and he
just got stuck inside. It was unfortunate. I just wasn't happy with
the way he ran the last quarter-mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the $7,371,991 bet on-track on the 10-race card, and the
commingled handle of $28,281,322, were Saratoga records.

ANGELS' RALLY FALLS SHORT IN LOSS TO TRIBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ This time of year, with the Angels clearly in
the mix for the American League West crown, as well as the AL wild
card, there's always a tendency to scoreboard watch, to see what
everyone else is doing. Only Mike Scioscia, the Anaheim skipper,
says that's not the case with his young club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not watching the scoreboard,'' he insists. ``We don't
need help. We need to win. And we're playing the teams we have to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up a definite good news-bad news sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   They're also playing the teams they can't be losing to.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians withstood a furious comeback try by the Angels and
came away with a 9-5 victory Saturday night at Edison Field in
front of 37,697 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 7-1 after seven innings, the Angels batted around in
the eighth, scoring four runs to cut the deficit to two, and they
had the tying runs on base. But Mo Vaughn, who had a rough night
all around _ he struck out three times and kicked a ground ball at
first base that led to a Cleveland run _ managed only a tapper down
the third base line and was thrown out by the pitcher, ending the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland then punctuated its 15th win in its last 22 games when
Travis Fryman welcomed Angels relief ace Troy Percival back from
the disabled list with a two-run homer in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim won the first game of the three-game series Friday
night, not the second. The Angels haven't won two in a row against
the Indians in more than two years, since Aug. 3-4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The win lifted Cleveland into second place in the wild-card
chase, just one-half game back of Boston, while the Angels fell 3{
games behind the Red Sox _ five games back in the loss column _ and
into fifth place in the wild card. They're also five back of
Seattle in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the standings, sure,'' Scioscia said before the
game, ``but we're a little short of that time when you're saying,
`We're a game up or a game down with two weeks to play' ... stuff
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of baseball left.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweiss (6-7), in his first start since the numbing
loss last week in Boston, when he was within one out of his seventh
win before giving up a tying home run, pitched into the seventh and
was charged with six runs on eight hits. He is winless in his last
four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweiss limited the Indians to just one hit over the first
three innings, then his throwing error helped the Tribe take a 2-0
lead in the fourth. He gave up two more runs in the sixth and came
out in the seventh when the Indians added two more for a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meantime, were restricted by starter Jason Bere, who
worked 52/3 innings, to just one run on four hits in the first
seven innings, and reliever Paul Schuey, who fanned Ron Gant to end
a bases-loaded jam in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland picked up an unearned run in the top of the eighth and
led 7-1 when the Angels suddenly came alive in the bottom of the
eighth, fans furiously waving their towels on Rally Monkey Towel
Night.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Tim Salmon, a single by Garret Anderson _ who had four
hits _ and a single by Troy Glaus produced one run. A bases-loaded
walk to Gant made the score 7-3, and Darin Erstad followed with a
run-scoring single to cut the deficit to 7-4. Kevin Stocker's
sacrifice fly made it 7-5, but left-hander Ricky Rincon, the fourth
of five Cleveland pitchers, retired Vaughn to snuff the flurry.
</P>
<P>
   And send the monkey back into the cage. &QL;

 &HT;    SEA CHANGE FOR SUMMER TV(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL GOODYKOONTZ(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The funny thing about writing a wrap-up of summer television is
that there's never been a need for one before.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, has that changed.
</P>
<P>
   Once it became clear that huge chunks of people would spend
their summer clamoring to watch a bunch of would-be Gilligans chow
down on rats and bugs, and stab each other in the back
(figuratively, anyway), the whole game changed.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Survivor (enditalic)rocked, and TV executives
rolled out plans to put new shows and new episodes on during a time
when viewers traditionally switched off their sets and went outside
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Networks used to feel free to bombard us with reruns and crummy
shows they had lying around gathering dust but which they'd already
paid for and needed to get on the air sometime, ideally when no one
was watching.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two networks finally threw away the `Gone fishing' sign for
the summer,'' Les Moonves, the president of CBS Television, told
critics last month.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to his own network, of course, because he looks
like a genius for putting (beginitalic)Survivor (enditalic)on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also throwing a bone to ABC, which trotted out a
little game show in August 1999 called (beginitalic)Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire(enditalic). What seemed like a cute, low-risk
throwaway at the time turned into a juggernaut, and television
hasn't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   So CBS took a gamble with (beginitalic)Survivor (enditalic)- and
silly as that sounds now, it was a gamble - and it paid off big.
You couldn't swing a cat by the tail this summer without hearing
someone working ``Vote you off the island'' into conversation. (As
catch phrases go, it beats ``Is that your final answer?'' But not
by much.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS also launched (beginitalic)Big Brother(enditalic), which has
had neither the ratings nor the cultural impact of
(beginitalic)Survivor(enditalic), but it beats what the network had
been doing before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to try these things than to come back to you with
(beginitalic)Diagnosis: Murder (enditalic)reruns,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   No argument there.
</P>
<P>
   What's good for CBS and ABC has been good for television
generally. Viewership was up this summer among 18- to 49-year-olds
(the only viewers TV honchos really care about). And you can bet
that other networks are scrambling already for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw this summer is clear,'' said Scott Sassa,
president of NBC West Coast. ``The dinner bell went off and said,
you know, the 13 weeks of summer are no longer a time just to put
your reruns on. People want new, they want different, they want
distinctive and they're willing to accept different things based
upon the competition. And you will see us next year be very
aggressive in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet - Sassa has come under fire for not hitching NBC's
wagon to the ``reality TV'' star sooner. But don't worry, the
network is catching up with shows such as (beginitalic)Chains of
Love(enditalic), in which four men are chained to a woman, who
releases one every 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing about this summer blitz - no one said it had to
be good TV. Just TV that people will watch, which is hardly the
same thing. How far down the taste meter TV will spiral is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to tell you that we were going to do a show where
people would eat rats and eat bug larvae, you wouldn't get it,''
Sassa said. ``But for whatever reason, in this (beginitalic)Swiss
Family Robinson (enditalic)context of people being on an island,
the public seems to say, `It's fine.' They're OK with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled - no one is talking about turning summer into a
``sweeps'' rating period. More people are watching, yes, but not so
many more that networks don't still toss off the occasional shelf
sitter just to get rid of it (David Spade's NBC cartoon
(beginitalic)Sammy(enditalic), for example).
</P>
<P>
   And some of the best risks, such as Fox's intriguing
(beginitalic)American High(enditalic), don't pay off; the network
canceled it after two episodes, subbing reruns of
(beginitalic)Futurama (enditalic)in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, (beginitalic)Survivor'(enditalic)s success means that TV
fans' watching habits will mirror what happens to students when
they graduate: no more summers off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all in this now for performance 52 weeks out of the
year,'' said Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of ABC Television.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the rest of us, pal. Just like the rest of us.

 &HT;    A DOCTOR WHO TOOK HIS MEDICINE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By E.J. MONTINI(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it wasn't me he'd come to visit, I'd hurry to meet Dr.
Owens at the front gate, hoping he'd let me carry his black satchel
into the house.
</P>
<P>
   We lived in one of the small, duplex homes built by the Jones &AMP;
Laughlin company for the immigrants who worked in the steel mill.
Dr. Owens visited patients throughout the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was stately and grand as a sorcerer, his leather doctor's bag
like the gripsack of Merlin. Inside it, the bottles and vials
jiggled and bumped into one another as he walked, making music like
muffled bells.
</P>
<P>
   In my memory, it's almost always me Dr. Owens comes to treat.
</P>
<P>
   These were the days before I had my tonsils out, when my throat
would be so inflamed and my fever so high I sometimes saw the face
of Lucifer coming straight at me from across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to call Dr. Owens,'' my mother would say, growing
calm simply by voicing the old man's name. He was the doctor who'd
delivered my brother and me. He'd helped my mother and father care
for their ailing parents. Something in his demeanor, as much as the
potions in his black bag, brought comfort to the families on our
block.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't describe what his face looked like anymore, but I
remember he had large warm hands, and he wore stiff white shirts
that carried the scent of a man who'd just been to the barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   I've thought a lot about Dr. Owens since reading the series of
stories by (beginitalic)The Arizona Republic's (enditalic)David
Parrish and Jodie Snyder. For a week, their articles have detailed
the failings of many local physicians and the discipline, or lack
of it, they received from the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   If Dr. Owens were around today, practicing the kind of hands-on,
deeply personal medicine I remember so well, I have no doubt he
would stand out {hellip} as one of the most potentially dangerous
physicians in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each visit to our house, Dr. Owens would linger in
the kitchen. He'd chat with my mother about food and make small
talk with my dad about baseball or football. Then he'd have a shot
of whiskey. His ``medicine,'' he called it. In the winter, he'd
sometimes pour the liquor into a cup of coffee. In summer, there
may have been a glass of ice water.
</P>
<P>
   I don't suspect we were always the last stop on Dr. Owens'
rounds. I'm not sure he followed the same social routine at every
house.
</P>
<P>
   I do know he was a soft old man willing to work a tough old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who would have filed a complaint against him with the
local medical board, or caused him to cease making home visits,
would have had reason to fear for his own health from the people of
Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked about this with friends, who laugh and say standards
were lower in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were lower. The cost of medical malpractice
insurance was lower. The threat of lawsuits was lower.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of humanity, standards were very high.
</P>
<P>
   We expect more of doctors, now, I've been told. But just the
opposite is true. We expect them to be scientifically faultless, to
be procedurally flawless, to be perfect as robots. All of which
adds up to something less than human.

 &HT;    `SURVIVOR' SPURS CONFESSION OF CULTURAL DROPOUT(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By ROBERT ROBB(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hoopla over (beginitalic)Survivor(enditalic) leads me to a
confession: I've become an almost total dropout from popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't watch a single episode of the show. I don't understand
the attraction of reality TV or even why it's called that.
</P>
<P>
   What's real about dumping a bunch of people on an island and
having them compete for a million dollars? And why was it called
(beginitalic)Survivor(enditalic) when the winner was chosen by a
vote?
</P>
<P>
   I didn't watch any of (beginitalic)Seinfeld(enditalic) until the
last episode. Which made me glad I hadn't watched any previously,
although I did finally understand why it was called a show about
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I haven't regularly watched a new television series for
over 15 years. Television in my house is carefully rationed and
consists mostly of sports, public affairs programming, and
(beginitalic)Star Trek: The Next Generation (enditalic)reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, we'll watch one of the old sit-coms:
(beginitalic)Andy Griffith(enditalic), (beginitalic)Dick Van
Dyke(enditalic), the (beginitalic)Bob Newhart (enditalic)show. They
seem to involve real people, in real if exaggerated circumstances.
And each episode teaches a moral lesson, however subtly. Although
I'll admit I haven't seen much of it, modern television seems to
consist of weirdos in contrived circumstances, competing to defy
moral conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Three times this year, my wife and I decided to go to the movies
only to find there wasn't a single one we actually wanted to see.
In today's Hollywood, action seems to consist of bloodying bodies
or blowing things up. Dialogue is creative (or uncreative) cursing.
Love, or at least amorous coupling, is found in almost any
imaginable human configuration, except for a man and a woman who
happen to have been married to each other for some time.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her if it would be OK to walk out of the last movie we
saw: (beginitalic)Mission Impossible II(enditalic). A woman having
sex with a terrorist killer she despises. Now there's an edifying
story line.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to kids movies more than my kids do. My youngest
is now 9 and will soon outgrow them. And then I'll be reduced to
trying to borrow a neighbor kid to take.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe not. My wife and I went to see the
re-release of (beginitalic)Pinocchio(enditalic) even before we had
kids.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Nintendo, Sega or PlayStation in my house. The kids
do not have televisions or telephones in their rooms. They all have
computers in their rooms, but not telephone hookups that would
enable them to surf the Net unsupervised. Net access is through the
common computer in the family room.
</P>
<P>
   They grumble occasionally about their deprived living
conditions. I just tell them they pulled the short straw when it
came to assigning parents. They'll have to complain about it to God
when they get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   But, in reality, they don't cavil much. Dad's been stodgy ever
since they've been born. Besides, the oldest is now 17. They know
they'll eventually escape.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other dropouts, I don't rail a lot against popular
culture. I share the critique of those who do rail against it. Our
popular culture is coarse, vulgar, violent and undermines important
moral principles and practices.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe in a free society. A large number of people want
to produce and consume what passes for popular culture today. So be
it.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing popular culture is also an exercise in freedom. But I
just don't get the point. The people who produce and consume coarse
culture presumably like it. The rest of us don't need the sermon.
</P>
<P>
   So, creating and submerging yourself in an alternative culture
seems more productive. And as popular culture becomes increasingly
eccentric and insipid, I suspect more and more Americans are doing
just that: joining me as a dropout.
</P>
<P>
   After all, 50million Americans watched
(beginitalic)Survivor(enditalic) Wednesday night. That means
225million did not.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When professor Mark Dawkins stands before his
Intermediate Accounting class at the University of Georgia, he is
greeted by 75 white faces and three black ones like his.
</P>
<P>
   But skin color isn't what's on the mind of the popular assistant
professor. Principles of accounting are. It's not easy to get into
the Terry College of Business. It's one of the nation's Top 20
among public universities. Even with the high caliber of students,
Dawkins said, about 30 percent of them in his survey course are
likely to fail or take it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weeding-out class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't think about race when he's teaching, the
37-year-old Dawkins knows deep down what it's like to feel
marginalized. He was the only black student among 110 entering the
MBA program at the University of Florida in 1986. He was recruited
to UGA in 1994 _ the second African-American to join the business
school faculty. Now there are four.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins feels a personal responsibility to recruit top black
students. For the past two years, he has worked with professional
accountants' societies to bring black high school students
interested in business careers to the campus for a three-day
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   This past week I spoke with six black professors about what they
think needs to change at the state's still predominantly white
flagship institution (my alma mater).
</P>
<P>
   Four decades after Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton Holmes
broke the university's 175-year-old color barrier, 6 percent of the
31,000 students are black, the same as last fall. There are 94
black professors among the 1,780 full-time faculty members. All
those interviewed lauded President Michael Adams' commitment to
appeal a recent federal court ruling striking UGA's modest
affirmative action program _ one that makes race one of 12 positive
factors in choosing the last 10 percent of freshmen. But all of
them also criticized Adams' failure to implement an aggressive
black-student recruitment program. They said former university
President Charles Knapp did a better job in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bennett-Alexander, a tenured professor who teaches business
law and employment discrimination, was the first black female
professor recruited to the university, 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was viewed as an affirmative action hire, and my competency
was questioned _ though indirectly _ by some faculty,'' she said.
Bennett-Alexander, whose daughter is a student at UGA, says black
students in many ways are just as isolated on campus as they were
30 years ago. ``There are still an amazing number of college
students who simply don't know much about people who aren't like
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When her classes delve into employment discrimination,
Bennett-Alexander asks the students to visit an event or place
where they don't feel comfortable. White students often go to the
black sororities' and fraternities' ``step show,'' an elaborate
dance routine rooted in slavery. Some have been ridiculed by fellow
white students for attending, and that has ignited lively
discussions in class about equality in social and work situations.
``At least we get it out in the open,'' Bennett-Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   John Morrow, the Franklin Professor of Modern European History,
derides current black recruitment efforts. ``It's just window
dressing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow thinks President Adams should go personally to
predominantly black high schools to send a message from the top
that the university is serious about diversity. Added his wife,
Dianne Morrow, who teaches 19th Century African-American History:
``Dare I say it _ it really should match the effort to recruit top
athletes.'' The black faculty organization, headed by Derrick
Aldridge, an education professor, has been asking for three years
for the appointment of a Vice President for Equity. Aldridge and
others are disappointed that the job, which remains unfilled, has
been relegated to a less powerful position: ``associate provost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A symbolic post, yes, but symbols send powerful messages,''
said Maurice Daniels, a member of the School of Social Work faculty
for 20 years. Daniels, like other black professors, wouldn't trade
his teaching and research opportunities at Georgia. Still, he
senses the school, like society, is treading water on diversity
because a vocal minority has convinced so many that all vestiges of
discrimination have disappeared. If it's so, Daniels says, why is
the poverty level among black children still twice that of white
children?
</P>
<P>
   Daniels recalls the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,
who worried about what he called ``the appalling silence of the
good people.''

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Last year 87 percent of Texas
students passed the reading, writing and math portions of the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills. That means this year: (a) We should
pat ourselves on the back for figuring out this education thing.
(b) We should make the test tougher _ you know, ``raise the bar.''
(c) We should redouble our emphasis on TAAS, because it means
improved learning for everyone. (d) We should snap out of it. The
answer is (d). By review, the answer is: Snap out of it. There will
be a test at the end of this commentary. (Young, Waco

   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ When professor Mark Dawkins stands
before his Intermediate Accounting class at the University of
Georgia, he is greeted by 75 white faces and three black ones like
his. But skin color isn't what's on the mind of the popular
assistant professor. Principles of accounting are. It's not easy to
get into the Terry College of Business. It's one of the nation's
Top 20 among public universities. Even with the high caliber of
students, Dawkins said, about 30 percent of them in his survey
course are likely to fail or take it again. (Ezzard, Atlanta

   TRANSITION _ ATLANTA _ If hearing all the high-tech hubbub makes
you think you're missing out, now may be the time for you to pack
up your skills and enter the fray. Although there are already some
10 million information technology workers in this country, there's
still plenty of room. The South has the highest number of IT
workers overall, according to the Information Technology
Association of America. Demand is hot, and it isn't expected to
cool off anytime soon. So many jobs, so few workers. One place they
will come from is the ranks of current jobholders, especially
women, who shift from the Old Economy to the New. (Mallory, Atlanta

   ISP-FUTURE _ ATLANTA _ What's a 21st century Internet service
provider to do? Stocks in traditional ISPs, such as Atlanta-based
EarthLink, are hovering near all-time lows as Wall Street's love
affair with the traditional dial-up ISP begins to wane. Investors
are demanding more products and services and evidence of additional

   OLYMPIC-FESTIVAL _ Preview of the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival,
how it compares to Atlanta and what to look for if you go. How is
this festival uniquely Australian, or is it? Whatever you say about
it, it's an extremely impressive lineup--plenty of sophisticated
contemporary work, classics, and such big names as Robert Spano and
Pinkas Zuckerman, Ricardo Muti with his La Scala orchestra; Pina
Bausch, Bill T. Jones, Ute Lemper, Bang on the Can All Stars, the
Dead Sea Scrolls and Bill and Melinda Gates' copex of Leonardo da
Vinci's Codex Leicester on display. The theater component looks
especially strong. An advance, with some analysis and nuts and
bolds stuff. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 45.

   FALL-MOVIES _ You've heard it all summer long. Seen any good
movies lately? Well, no, we haven't. Ticket sales may have held
steady but the summer drought has to do with more than your front
yard. Outside of maybe ``Gladiator,'' it's been one stinking summer
at the movies. That's about to change. With the onset of fall, a
couple of solid, winning movies are coming: Neil LaBute's blue
collar ``Nurse Betty'' and Cameron Crowe's '70s rock tour film
``Almost Famous.'' Plus, get ready for Denzel Washington's
made-in-Atlanta movie ``Remember the Titans.'' All three point to
well-written tales about American obsessions: soap operas, rock
music and football. And each focus on average Americans. Not the
$3,000 Italian sofa crowd of ``American Beauty,'' but the
TV-watching waitresses of ``Nurse Betty'' and the shaggy haired and
ratty-jeaned concert fans of ``Almost Famous.'' (Longino, Atlanta

   MUSIC-WEBERN _ ATLANTA _ Modernism comes in waves. The first
wave of modern music ended in Mittersill, Austria, on Sept. 15,
1945, with three quick gunshots. The war in Europe had been over
since May. An American soldier, Raymond N. Bell, was on a policing
raid when he encountered a man breaking curfew, puffing a cigar in
a doorway. The events of that evening remain unclear. What's known
is that Anton Webern, an impoverished composer, had fled the
turmoil of Vienna and was visiting his son-in-law, a Nazi turned
black marketeer. Webern had stepped outside for a smoke _ a
contraband gift, undoubtedly _ just as Bell arrived. After a
scuffle, shots were fired. So ended the career of one of the most
unlikely giants of 20th-century music. (Ruhe, Atlanta

   DEFIANT-PRAYER _ Determined not to be stopped by the U.S.
Supreme Court, students and grass-roots conservative groups across
the Bible Belt stood up last weekend and made a defiant statement:
They plan to pray at high school football games. The battle lines
were drawn, from the Carolinas across to Texas, with organized
efforts to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling in June prohibiting
student-led prayer at games and assemblies sanctioned by public
schools. Incidents were reported, with various levels of

South, and are likely to grow as word spreads. (Salzer, Atlanta

 &HT;    Schools must make room for enrichment amid basic skills
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Last year 87 percent of Texas students passed the
reading, writing and math portions of the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills. That means this year:
</P>
<P>
   (a) We should pat ourselves on the back for figuring out this
education thing.
</P>
<P>
   (b) We should make the test tougher _ you know, ``raise the
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   (c) We should redouble our emphasis on TAAS, because it means
improved learning for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   (d) We should snap out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is (d).
</P>
<P>
   By review, the answer is: Snap out of it.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a test at the end of this commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, and many states following in its path, is becoming like a
cross-eyed ferret as it tracks the scores of one basic skills test.
Our path is becoming a rut, too often sapping education of its
richness, its color.
</P>
<P>
   There's no discounting the fact that rising TAAS scores are
desirable. They mean some students are acquiring basic skills they
might not have had. Good for us. Good for them.
</P>
<P>
   But a system that aspires to excellence does not rate itself on
something that 8.7 out of 10 children pass. Some will respond to
this statement with the ``raise the bar'' reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the bar? Only to the extent to which TAAS truly reflects
grade-level skills. That's all TAAS is about. TAAS is a
criterion-based test, meaning it is based on skills every student
at a certain grade level should know. Not every high schooler needs
to know trigonometry. We could ``raise the bar'' by testing on it.
We also could test every sophomore on quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to see the problem inherent here: A
criterion-based basic-skills test is inadequate to judge schools.
</P>
<P>
   We are being told that a curriculum aligned with TAAS
grade-level skills improves learning for all students. Not true.
For some already at grade level it makes no difference. They know
the material and would have before TAAS. Indeed, for some who have
beyond-grade-level skills TAAS holds them back. TAAS is their worst
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot have a system based on a test of basic skills
everyone needs to know and assume that it benefits everyone. Get
real. What about the third-grader who reads at fifth-grade level?
The second grader with fourth-grade math skills?
</P>
<P>
   TAAS shouldn't even be given to the vast majority of students in
the spring. When should everyone take it? At the beginning of the
school year. Indeed, the best thing that could happen to education
in Texas would be to test all students on Day 1 of the school year,
exempt all who are at grade level or beyond, and spare them from
any mention of TAAS. Let those who need more emphasis on basic
skills have it, and test them often.
</P>
<P>
   And if one's response to that notion is to suggest ``raising the
bar'' to make TAAS tougher and justify itself by challenging more
students, the answer remains: Either you're going to have a
grade-level criterion-based test or you're not.
</P>
<P>
   There are other tests of students' skills _ norm-referenced like
the Iowa Test of Basic Skills _ that stretch every student.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an entry-level diagnostic tool, as TAAS ought to be
at each grade, we use it as the climax of the school year, every
lesson building toward a common denominator that challenges some
and doesn't challenge others.
</P>
<P>
   The real benefit of TAAS, and basing promotion on passing it, is
to the portion of students who may have drifted along without
grade-level skills and can't hide anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even among those students who need basic skills: Are we
developing young thinkers or test drones? Young innovators or test
drones? Young citizens or test drones?
</P>
<P>
   A sad sight: Recently a retiring Waco grade-school teacher,
going through her classroom supplies, came across a sparkling set
of flash cards about the U.S. presidents. She hadn't been able to
use them. They weren't a TAAS objective. It reminds me of a
fourth-grader who didn't know what the Alamo was. Is he receiving
the kind of education an enlightened society needs?
</P>
<P>
   THINKERS OR TEST-TAKERS
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do about this TAAS over-emphasis?''
</P>
<P>
   One hears this comment often from parents who think their
children have become lab rats to one wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual thing about the above-quoted comment, however, is
that it came from a principal _ yes, a principal _ dread-filled
over the lack of higher-level skills among children. Are they being
inspired in class? Taught about the world and our country? Made to
feel in any way that learning is something you might enjoy doing
for life even after you pass TAAS?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, many are, in classrooms with teachers who are incredibly
skilled, or who have classes that come in with high levels of basic
skills and don't have to inch toward one test every day of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   For other teachers, TAAS is a treadmill test.
</P>
<P>
   So, back to that 87 percent passing rate on TAAS. Be careful
reading too much into those numbers and assigning too much to a
test that, by design, can only be so much.
</P>
<P>
   However, we could look at these improving figures in a better
way.
</P>
<P>
   They make possible a liberating notion: that we start focusing
intently on ways to flesh out education beyond the basic skills,
beyond TAAS objectives, using the test differently than we do now.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where ``the bar'' is set, if passing a test pegged
to what every child should know meets your standard of excellence,
then you need to (d) snap out of it.

 &HT;    Meteorology is becoming an increasingly popular career choice
 &HT;    By Dann Stupp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you think sleet is neat, if the barometric
pressure gets your blood pumping and if you hail to hail, a career
in weather might be for you.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since weather became a 24-hour-per-day fix for atmospheric
junkies, thanks to cable television and the Internet, an increasing
number of college students are considering careers in meteorology.
</P>
<P>
   And with an Air Force base, numerous media outlets and a
National Weather Service station in the area, Miami Valley hosts a
variety of possible weather-related careers for future forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always wanted to be a weather guy, even before The
Weather Channel made it seem cool,'' said David Milner, 18, who
plans to enter Ohio State University's atmospheric-science program
this fall. ``For Christmas one year, I asked for a rain gauge. And
Santa came through. I think you know at an early age if meteorology
is for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the job market is extremely tight for
meteorologists, the variety of weather-related jobs is limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Despite popular perception, meteorologists do more than
seven-day forecasts on the morning news. Opportunities exist in
teaching, research, aviation dispatching, military technology,
agricultural forecasting and even in the insurance industry.
Whether you're launching weather balloons or calculating damage
from a late-summer hurricane, you can have a meteorological career
without a green screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm probably not going to have the six-digit television
salary,'' said Miller. ``But I'm sure I'll be chasing storms
someday, even though Doppler Dave would be a great TV name for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AN EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Few colleges and universities offer degrees in meteorology (also
called atmospheric science or geosciences). Ohio State University
offers a bachelor's degree in geography and a master's degree or
Ph.D. in atmospheric science. The Air Force Institute of Technology
at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base also offers a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs are usually made up of geography, civil engineering,
geology, computer science and some other areas,'' said Jeff Rogers,
professor of atmospheric science and geography at Ohio State.
``People in the field need a diverse background.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are also encouraged to take classes in communications.
A recent survey by the American Meteorological Society found that
aside from meteorological aptitude, strong verbal and written
communications skills were the most important traits required by
employers, especially if you choose to work in the media side of
forecasting. And if you can navigate your way through various
computer-programming languages, you're going to be even more in
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``While in high school, students should be taking as much
science and math as possible,'' said Rogers. ``And if possible,
they should be getting a foundation of computer skills.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the hard work can pay off _ handsomely. Salary figures
range from the mid $20,000s for entry-level research positions to
over hefty six-digit salaries for celebrity media forecasters in
large markets.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT/AVIATION
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Haydu, meteorologist in charge at the Wilmington
National Weather Service station, knows that people rely on the
forecasts put out by his government-funded station _ some more so
than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put out something called a Nowcast, which lets people see
the potential precipitation for the next six hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the station's responsibilities stretch well beyond weather
forecasts for your afternoon plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supplying international airports with weather is very typical
of an NWS station,'' said Haydu. ``Once the planes are in the air,
we control them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilmington station, which supplies the Dayton International
Airport with up-to-the-minute forecasts, employs 16 of the 5,000
meteorologists nationwide who work for the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from alerting the public of severe weather, meteorologists
in Wilmington educate the public about their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might overlook the amount of community-relations work
we do,'' he said. ``We take a lot of phone calls from the public
and curious kids, talk at area schools and we work with counties'
emergency-management offices to make sure they're getting their
warnings out efficiently. That's why communication skills are so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all segments of the weather industry, the job market for
government-based forecasting and researching is quite tight.
Because so many people are applying for a limited amount of jobs,
employers have the ability to pick and choose from many applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be good at math and science, but you also need to
be a good writer,'' said Haydu. ``You need your meteorology degree,
but you just about need a double major in math to work at a place
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of working at a National Weather Service station, you
could also work for the government-funded National Hurricane Center
in Florida, or the Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, to name a
few. Yup, with the help of the government, you could be a real
storm chaser.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   If you want to jump-start a weather career while on a tight
budget, Ron Rodney, a staff meteorologist for the Aircraft and
Sensors Team at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, says he military
is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get your meteorology degree _ and get paid doing it,''
he said. ``In fact, many people start their meteorology careers in
the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Madden went from Dayton's WHIO-TV to The Weather Channel
in 1996. Madden, a major in the Air Force Reserve's 88th Weather
Squadron, now flies with the Mississippi-based Storm Trackers, a
team of hurricane reconnaissance pilots who track tropical storms
for the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Military meteorology has a little bit of everything for
everyone. Whether you hope to do some top-secret research,
traditional weather forecasting or air-traffic control, you might
want to consider using the U.S. Air Force as a way into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Just this year, the 19 members of the base weather operations
flight of Aeronautical Systems Center's 88th Weather Squadron at
Wright Patterson earned one of the highest ratings ever given by
the Air Force Weather Agency, which made the local meteorology
staff one of the best-qualified in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into any type of weather, the military is probably the
best way to do it because that's what employers look for,'' said
1st Lt. Ginger Hayden, wing weather officer for the Base Weather
Operations Flight. ``Employers are going to look for experience,
and you're going to get the experience here that is going to be
very marketable.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA
</P>
<P>
   Media meteorology is often dubbed as the highest-profile career
in weather, and it pays accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a small market, you can be making $20,000-$25,000,'' said
Jamie Simpson, a staff meteorologist for WHIO-TV. ``But if you get
into a big market like New York, Los Angeles or Chicago, that
number can go (up to) $400,000 or $500,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating local forecasts, media meteorologists
often work as the alarm system for the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a weather radio, you aren't going to hear the
warnings put out,'' said Simpson. ``It's our job to alert the
public of severe weather.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two routes to delivering the weather on air. You can
get an education in meteorology and learn the television business
later on, or you can establish yourself in the TV business and
learn weather as you go along. The AMS views those with a degree in
meteorology who use ``scientific principles to explain, understand,
observe or forecast the Earth's atmospheric phenomenon'' as
meteorologists. Those without an education and little training are
called weathercasters. However, the National Weather Service offers
a 17-course, three-year curriculum for certification through
Mississippi State University's distant-learning program, which
allows experienced broadcasters the ability to work on a
meteorology degree in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists for television, radio and newspapers also
sometimes serve as environmental reporters for their media and are
asked to generate stories on a variety of earth topics. As a TV
meteorologist, you might also be asked to develop forecasts and
Internet content for newspapers and radio stations that lack
weather staffs.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that the job market for media
meteorology is extremely limited. Because there are only 1,500 jobs
nationwide and a very low turnover rate, becoming a prime-time
weather forecaster will likely be a pipe dream for someone without
a top-notch education, an array of contacts and strong computer
skills.
</P>
<P>
   CONSULTING/RESEARCH
</P>
<P>
   In addition to positions with airlines, the government, media
and the military, there is a variety of lesser-known job options
for meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many outdoor events must be insured, and some
meteorologists are contracted to monitor potential severe weather
for events such as outdoor concerts and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Many universities in the region also partake in research
projects, some of which are funded by government agencies such as
NASA. Private consulting firms and agencies also research
everything from global warming to tornado predicting. These
agencies can range from international corporations to one-person
operations run by free-lance meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   You can also try your luck in the atmospheric measurements and
instrumentation industry, which works to improve existing
technologies in the weather field.
</P>
<P>
   Like all areas of meteorology, it takes a diverse educational
background, experience and a passion for weather to succeed in
research and consulting.

 &HT;    The path to information technology is easier than you think
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If hearing all the high-tech hubbub makes you think
you're missing out, now may be the time for you to pack up your
skills and enter the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are already some 10 million information
technology workers in this country, there's still plenty of room.
The South has the highest number of IT workers overall, according
to the Information Technology Association of America. Demand is
hot, and it isn't expected to cool off anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   So many jobs, so few workers. One place they will come from is
the ranks of current jobholders, especially women, who shift from
the Old Economy to the New.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Information Technology Association of
America report, Bridging the Gap: Information Technology Skills for
the New Millennium, ``Employers will attempt to fill 1.6 million
new IT jobs in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   And job seekers don't even have to look to technology companies
for work. Most IT workers are employed by non-IT companies, the
ITAA reported. Fully 9 million IT employees work at nontechnical
firms, while the remaining 1 million are at tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAA surveyed 700 hiring managers at IT and non-IT companies
alike. Though the job openings will be plentiful, more than 840,000
likely will go unfilled. There just aren't enough IT workers to go
around, the ITAA reported.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not working a technical job now, how do you get
one?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``shifting'' or ``Transitioning,'' it is moving
from traditional, brick-and-mortar and nontechnical jobs into IT
positions. That was the topic of a conference held by Women In
Technology and sponsored by Matrix Resources Tuesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among current IT workers, women account for approximately 30
percent of the work force, compared with being about half of the
population, noted Lisa Levinson, associate director in the
permanent-services division of Atlanta-based Matrix. The event was
planned to help educate women about transitioning, she said in an
interview prior to the conference. ``This is something we're doing
to help women excel.'' But the advice from Levinson and the other
panelists isn't gender-specific.
</P>
<P>
   So, where would a ``shifter'' begin?
</P>
<P>
   First, know there's still time and don't be afraid, counseled
keynote speaker Sonia Lucas, vice president for the strategic
account group at software maker Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to feel like you're too late to get into the
tech area,'' Lucas said. ``Put a stake in the ground and decide to
commit to making the transition. . . . Fear will be one of your
biggest enemies. You have to be aware of it, get past it, get over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson advised the more than 100 conference attendees: ``The
first step in deciding the right career path is to look inward _
determine what you enjoy doing.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to make note of all your personal and professional
skills, your strengths, weaknesses and what you like to do,
Levinson added.
</P>
<P>
   A ``career model'' is one tool Levinson suggested to help direct
shifters to the right IT job. Finding a mentor and networking are
also keys to transitioning.
</P>
<P>
   After sharing her story of how she moved from the hotel industry
to her current position, Lucas endorsed finding allies in the tech
field to help you make the move. Have your mentor periodically
review your transition strategy at 30-, 60-, 90-day intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to others in the field and be willing to learn from their
experiences and expertise, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surround yourself with people in the technology field and get
engaged,'' said Lucas, who herself joined the Women in Technology
organization shortly after relocating to Atlanta. ``I think you'll
be surprised there are lots of people willing to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Thomas Pilsch, director of Georgia Tech's
computer-training facility, also urged shifters to join local
technology interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid. . . . People love to talk about what they're
doing,'' Pilsch said. ``Just walk into the meeting and say, `Hello,
I'm new . . .' and you won't have to buy another drink all night,''
he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be shy to network in your current company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many IT professionals get started through
on-the-job-training,'' Levinson said. ``It's usually easier to make
this transition within your own company because you already have a
relationship there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Karen See, CEO of Abovo Marketing Group, noted
nontechnical workers should take the initiative, on their own time,
to learn from their tech peers and ``suck the knowledge out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For more formal training, the panelists noted several options,
including private learning centers, online training and two- and
four-year college degrees. ``The most important thing in learning
is to stay current,'' Pilsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Training options can range in cost from a few hundred dollars to
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Panelist Salila Sharma, a senior Oracle database administrator
with Z-Tel Communications, warned conference participants to choose
their IT training carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be cautious in what you chose and what you want to do,''
Sharma said, citing research estimates that ``three to four years
from now, 50 percent of the current IT skills will be outdated.''

 &HT;    Shadow boxer
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The makeshift dressing area in the casino corridor
simmered with anxiety and expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Some fighters sat stone-faced in draped-off cubicles focusing on
the storm ahead. Others bounced about, firing jabs and uppercuts at
imaginary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the last partition sat a short, thickly muscled young man
with a bleached buzz cut and canary yellow satin robe. Last time
out, in his pro debut, Newnan's Ebo Elder left his opponent
slack-jawed and hanging on the ropes. It took 91 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Elder sat calmly as his hands were wrapped in gauze. Behind Ebo
stood his dad, 5-foot-5, pony-tailed and ready to explode. The
night's fight card had wrongly added 10 pounds to Ebo, calling him
a 148-pound welterweight. Greg Elder, Ebo's father, manager and
spiritual leader, smelled a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is done by design!'' Greg said, his red-clay twang rising
in anger. ``This is done so Ebo will outweigh his opponent by 8
pounds and the crowd will root for the other guy!''
</P>
<P>
   Heads turned. Ebo looked up, puzzled. Jim Troy, Ebo's
co-manager, stepped in as a diplomat but the irate dad shook him
off. They'd come too far, fought too many battles, to get
undermined like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get hot, things are going to come down or I'll go to
jail,'' Greg said as Troy ushered him away. To keep Ebo focused on
the fight. And to avoid a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Elder has become persona non grata in amateur boxing,
insisting that corrupt forces in the sport robbed his son of a spot
on the 2000 U.S. Olympic team. His plan had been for Ebo to soar
into the pro ranks this fall with Olympic pedigree and an
impressive contract. But rather than training for the summer Games
next month in Sydney, Ebo was on last month's undercard at Soaring
Eagle Casino in the Michigan sticks, hoping for an early knockout
in the headline fights so he could get a little exposure on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Greg's fire turned his son into a top-notch prospect during
nearly two decades of training. Fathers as coaches are as common in
boxing as hardluck stories. Someone has to exhort a youth through
the unnatural act of getting punched, but common wisdom is that
dads, at some point, must put down the spit bucket.
</P>
<P>
   So now the boxing intelligentsia say Ebo needs to break away
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the Elders' bond is more than training technique and
business strategy. It's about spirit, about attitude. They're
renegades. Dad has long fought against the world. And he has
enlisted his son in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after the dressing room outburst, a serene Greg
returned and quietly slipped in behind Ebo, who was absorbed in
fight mode and did not acknowledge his father. Greg stared at his
son and smiled. Their dream was again on track: The ring was set
up, a good crowd had filed in, ESPN production crews were testing
their equipment. It was fight time.
</P>
<P>
   The grinning dad gently rubbed the son's hair and caressed his
cheek, like a proud papa admiring his powdered infant.
</P>
<P>
   RAISING A FIGHTER
</P>
<P>
   Greg Elder burst with that same proud grin 21 years ago when he
stopped by Mike Gaddy's home with his newborn son on the way home
from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing nearly 200 pounds, Gaddy was Mutt to Greg's Jeff in
high school. Except they were both hellions. Greg weighed barely
125 pounds but was so fierce, so ready to bring it on for no
apparent reason, that even the football players gave him wide berth
in the school hallways.
</P>
<P>
   But those battles were just preliminaries. In 1968, Greg signed
up with the Marines and went to Vietnam. He saw a man's legs blown
off. His buddy was killed. And he killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mercy,'' Greg said. But he already knew that life
was tough. His dad, Tom, died on a Harley when Greg was 17. He was
going 90 when he slammed into the side of a locomotive. Greg barely
knew his father, who was so devoted to making his lumber business
thrive that he had little time for his five children. Greg, the
oldest, became the man of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was a two-time state Golden Gloves champ, but he never
made it as a pro. He married, had a child and tried to keep the
family lumber business afloat. The business, he says, languished
because of unscrupulous management after Tom Elder's death. It was
later sold for pennies on the dollar. The bank was in on it, he
said. Again, a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pain of being a failure; I do not want my children
to feel that,'' said Greg, who also has a daughter, Heather, 28,
and a year-old grandson, Devin. ``I never had that kind of
mentoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Things would be different for Ebo _ born Eben, Greg's middle
name. He'd have that bond with his father Greg never knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had high hopes for him,'' Gaddy recalled. ``He was going to
make a fighter of Ebo _ whether he wanted to be one or not.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 months, Eben was tied to Daddy's back for motorcycle rides.
At 3, he swapped punches with Dad. At 5, the boy challenged a
Marine to a push-up contest while visiting Dad's old base. At 6,
Eben got a chain saw, a gift from Dad. The chain saw absolutely
freaked out Eben's mother, Cindy. Don't worry, Greg assured her, I
know what I'm doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we did was to make him unintimidatable,'' Greg
said. ``In the garage, four nights a week, I took him to the
absolute point of breakdown in sparring with him. The madder and
more desperate he'd get, the more punishment I'd inflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop. Pop. Thwap! ``Son, you're stepping in without thinking.''
Pop. Pop. Thwap! ``Your hands are too low.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy protested again. The no-mercy competition between father
and son was bound to leave some underlying damage, she reasoned.
But the boy seemed to thrive on the battling. She relented and
attended all his fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all done with tender love,'' Greg said. ``There's a
tremendous thrill of purpose watching your flesh and blood
withstand that kind of strain.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy rarely whined. And he always tore into his dad with
resolve. He sought reassurance. The only way to get it was to suck
it up and fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Blows to the body suck a fighter's wind and resolve. Head shots
bring a flash of light and draw a boxer into a netherworld of
jumbled, slow-motion images and disjointed thoughts. Ebo learned to
maintain his compass during these eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known anything else,'' Ebo said with a shrug. ``At
that age, the key is to not be scared to be hit; I got past that.
It's got everything to do with being able to war right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ebo added: ``I doubt I'll be with a 3-year-old with boxing
gloves on. I can teach my son to be a drummer, a lawyer, a
carpenter. I really don't want my son to box.''
</P>
<P>
   The life's too demanding, he said during a recent roadtrip to
spar some pros in Pensacola, Fla. Too many pitfalls. Too much pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm doing it for me and my family _ more them than
me. Anything this hard you have to be doing it for others, not just
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Dad strutted around a pool table at a
nightspot, talking up a successful bank shot. Ebo smiled at the
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's like that. A ham. He's out there, able to talk to anybody,
to ask a stranger the most personal questions. And they usually
answer _ especially after Greg smiles and narrows his icy blue eyes
like he's conducting a murder investigation. Under his questioning,
one waitress admitted that (a) she had kissed another girl, (b) was
adopted, and (c) had keyed a boy's car.
</P>
<P>
   Dad sings shrill falsetto to doo-wop songs while driving,
drawing sidelong glances of annoyance from his son. ``What's with
all that '30s music?'' Ebo asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo's not like that. He keeps it inside, not parceling it out
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Following Dad's footsteps hasn't always worked out. Greg is
still married to his high school sweetheart. Ebo married his and
the union lasted 18 months. They were just too young, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo then played the field and almost undermined the whole dream.
In March, he was charged with having sex with a 15-year-old girl.
The prosecutor termed it ``non-aggravating'' and it was quickly
pleaded out. Ebo got two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Ebo bought the home he grew up in, while his father
_ like Ebo, a carpenter _ started remodeling another home nearby on
the 18 acres the Elder family owns south of Atlanta in Coweta
County. The idea was to keep Ebo close, where distractions are few,
yet afford him the independence a young man needs. It's a balancing
act.
</P>
<P>
   Dad now preaches about sins of the flesh: Beware the seductress.
Resist weakness. Something can always derail you.
</P>
<P>
   But a yearning, an emptiness remains in the younger man.
``What's going to happen the next few years is going to be
awesome,'' Ebo said. ``I want a family there. I want a wife there
to share the experience with me.''
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC HOPES DASHEd
</P>
<P>
   Ebo's rise through the amateurs was swift.
</P>
<P>
   Greg switched his son around to be a left-handed fighter because
the father couldn't figure out southpaws. He drove him through
calisthenics. They pored over tapes searching for flaws. They
traveled for hours to find sparring partners and fights. He started
calling his son ``Ebo'' because it sounded courageous. Ebo was the
name of an African tribe whose members drowned themselves in the
Atlantic rather than be enslaved. And the name was catchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo grew to become a physical dynamo. Strong, fast, fearless.
Never backing up. Greg calls him a gladiator. A warrior.
</P>
<P>
   He was going to make the Olympic team, win the gold and sign a
huge pro contract.
</P>
<P>
   But along came Ricardo Williams, a taller, quick-handed
Cincinnati teen two years Ebo's junior. In 1998, Ebo fielded pro
offers but saw his value drop after he finished second to Williams
in the Goodwill Games. Williams is the U.S. team's 139-pounder in
the Sydney Olympic Games. He's seen as the next Sugar Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   In their last fight, an Olympic qualifier, Ebo was so fired up
to dislodge Williams that he employed a ``pro style,'' boring in
low and digging to the body with power shots. It was not the
stand-up, stick-and-move style the amateurs favor. The fight
devolved into an ugly clash of wrestling and Ebo was disqualified
after elbowing Williams. At the time, Williams was holding Ebo and
shoving him backward across the ring. Greg fired a towel into the
ring in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur boxing crowd, usually reticent with public
criticism, is vociferous in denouncing the Elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a deliberate action to hurt him,'' Tom Mustin, coach of
the 2000 U.S. boxing team who worked Williams' corner, said of the
thrown elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo is easy to hit, Mustin said, because he shifts his weight to
his forward foot when attacking and is off balance. ``Maybe his dad
didn't see it to change it. I don't think Ebo will progress with
his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ebo) has a lot of hate, and hate clouds judgment,'' said Al
Mitchell, the 1996 U.S. Olympic coach who saw the fight. ``He needs
to tone it down and stop listening to his dad. I saw his father
screaming and hollering that his kid got robbed. He told him he was
getting cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   A tape of that fight shows Williams frequently grabbing the
bulling Ebo, who was physically stronger and almost always the
aggressor. Greg slows the tape down to show Williams apparently
elbowing Ebo in the cheek. But when the ref stepped in, he warned
Ebo for grabbing his opponent's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his (Greg Elder's) ranting and ravings were
well-founded,'' said co-manager Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Greg realizes his expertise is limited and last year hired Eric
Bonilla to train his son and instill the intricacies needed to
survive the pro game. Bonilla was a player in the West Coast boxing
scene during the 1980s, working with several champions. But the
fast life burned Bonilla out and he disappeared for a few years to
compose himself. Bonilla gets 10 percent of Ebo's purses and lives
in an apartment on the Elder family compound.
</P>
<P>
   But entrusting the dream to others, even a sliver of it, can be
wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla and the two Elders were driving on the Massachusetts
Turnpike after a bout last year when Greg criticized his son for
not throwing enough jabs. We've been working on other stuff, Ebo
shot back, adding, ``Besides, who's training me anyways?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg swerved to the shoulder. Get out, he told Bonilla. You're
gone!
</P>
<P>
   You can't kick him out, protested Ebo. It's winter.
</P>
<P>
   Then you get out, too, Greg growled.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo refused. So Greg jumped out and stalked down the highway,
intending to walk to the next exit ramp, hail a cab to the airport
and fly to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo drove back minutes later to collect his dad and tears were
shed. But tension bubbles near the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Creative tension is how Greg views it.
</P>
<P>
   And Bonilla gushes when talking about his prized pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a unique fighter _ he's white, and he can fight!''
Bonilla said, glancing about like he's letting out a state secret.
``The toughest white boy I've ever seen. Gonna make a killing with
him. A killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a blue-eyed blond and unafraid to bring it on makes him a
more valuable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who is black, said it's natural for white fans to pull
for a white fighter. ``People like to see that people like
themselves can do it,'' he said. ``They like to imagine themselves
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   FIGHTING FOR THE SPOTLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   But race is just one segment of a plan to cross-market Ebo and
expand him wider than boxing's narrow appeal. His nickname,
``Xtreme Machine,'' is aimed at young X-game types. He's an
explosive drummer, so they hope to tie in the MTV crowd. The
earrings, the motorcycle stories, the frequent smile, his
soft-spoken manner? Those, they hope, will draw women. (Although
his promoter insists he stay off motorcycles because of a crash
last fall.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about putting butts in seats,'' Troy said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebo signed a three-year, 20-fight contract in April with Frank
Warren, the English promoter who recently staged two Mike Tyson
fights. The contract pays Ebo $6,000 a fight for eight fights in
the first year and then more the second and third years as he moves
to eight- and 10-round affairs. Most fights are to be televised.
The plan is to get in the title picture in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing experts agree that the contract, negotiated by Greg, is
an excellent package for a non-Olympian. Normally, pro fighters
start out at a couple hundred bucks a round. Often, 10-round
fighters on ESPN2 collect $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Between travel expenses, marketing, overhead and paying Ebo's
opponents' purses, Warren will likely invest $250,000 in Ebo the
first two years, said Cameron Duncan, a Las Vegas manager who
handles six world champions. ``We're all fighting for a limited
amount of TV time,'' Duncan said. ``(Warren) is taking a big risk,
a big risk. There's not a lot of $600,000 fights out there for a
140-pounder from Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   And to feed Greg's paranoia, the contract reads that one loss
allows the promoter to renegotiate. An undefeated record is a jewel
that an up-and-coming fighter must jealously protect. One bad night
or one unstudied, hard-punching opponent, and a year's worth of
progress vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   No one makes money off a loser.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Greg vetoed a fight against Cory Peterson, a
hammer-handed ex-con who hails from that area. Greg feared hometown
bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, he's a white boy and that takes away the competitive
balance,'' Greg said.
</P>
<P>
   The casino matchmaker and ESPN execs bristled at the Elders'
veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want good fights; this is not the Ebo Elder show,'' said
one.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Peterson and enter Andre Baker, a wiry journeyman from
Lumberton, N.C., and a veteran of other ESPN shows. Good chin, a
3-3 record, won't stink up the joint. And most likely won't knock
your guy horizontal.
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds after the opening bell found Ebo digging ferocious
body shots. Ebo bulled. He grunted. He stomped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settle down!'' Greg yelled.
</P>
<P>
   At the round's end, Greg jumped between the ropes to take over
as lead cornerman, a job supposedly handed over to current trainer
Bonilla. But the role had been Greg's during Ebo's 130 amateur
fights. Giving it up does not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   A vicious hook drew an ``Oooh!'' from the crowd. An uppercut
starting from Ebo's knees brought an ``Ahhh!'' But Baker wouldn't
go down and frustration furrowed on Ebo's brow.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the fourth round, Baker was out on his feet. The
ref was poised to stop the fight when the final bell rang. No
knockout. And no knockouts in the headliner fights, so Ebo didn't
get ESPN airtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly like I was in there (fighting) too,'' Greg said
later, recounting the fight. ``I don't see anything wrong with
that. It's the most natural thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Greg knows they say that he's living his dream through his
son, that he can't bring Ebo to the next level. But those are
simply more slights to overcome. No, he's not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can name on one hand where the son has become a
world-class fighter under a father's tutelage,'' Greg acknowledged,
``but how do you value something? It's by how rare it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Elder knows that he's that exception, that diamond in the
rough. He plans on being there in the corner when they place a
championship belt on Ebo. When they do, they will be strapping it
on him, too.

   IOWA-IMMIG (Marshalltown, Iowa) _ No one would call Iowa a
melting pot. Nearly 96 percent white, this state can seem to have
more kinds of cows and corn than nationalities. But Iowa, which
hemorrhaged families during the 1980s farm crisis and has an
unemployment rate of only 2 percent, is proposing something no
other state has done: an all-out immigrant recruitment drive to

   CALIF-CARMEL (Carmel, Calif.) _ The days of having to go to the

Calif. Home delivery is coming -- and with it, something this

will no longer have to tell FedEx or UPS, or more importantly, 911,

Stone Owl Cottage. But in a town which has kept out street lights,

local molecular biologist's nascent project that he means to extend
to North Carolina and other spots with long-stable African-American
populations. Last spring, a Howard University geneticist announced
he would soon offer DNA analysis to African-Americans. And the
African Burial Ground Project in New York has been assembling a
data-base of DNA from long-buried African-Americans and living
Africans. The efforts may be disparate but this much seems clear:
black Americans hunger to trace their African ancestry is combining
with powerful new DNA technology, and the foundations are being

 &HT;    Sydney Olympic festival planners learn lessons from Atlanta
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When NBC told Olympic Arts Festival artistic director
Leo Schofield how fabulous the billowing white sails of the Sydney
Opera House would look on television, the
restaurant-critic-turned-arts-impresario just smirked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leo thought, `Oh, no. Forget that. I want it to be full
color,' '' says festival general manager Craig Hassall, laughing
about his boss's determination to make the cultural component of
the Olympics as spectacular as the sports.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready to adjust your brightness button.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14 (or ``Games Eve,'' as the Aussies call it), when the
Olympic torch arrives at the opera house, the fabled structure will
go up in bright red flames, thanks to lighting wizardry by trendy
Australian designer Marc Newson. Adding wattage to the ceremony,
Down Under diva Olivia Newton-John will hand the torch to Italian
tenor Andrea Bocelli, who'll pass it to Australian tennis star Pat
Rafter. Afterward, for world leaders with nothing to do, there'll
be glittery twin galas inside the performing arts palace: Bocelli
singing Donizetti arias in one room, the Australian Ballet dancing
in another.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago, Atlanta got what may have been its biggest
infusion of culture ever: a $25 million extravaganza where you
could catch Jessye Norman with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the
Alliance Theater Company's world premiere of Alfred Uhry's ``The
Last Night of Ballyhoo'' or the High Museum's ``Rings'' exhibit of
world masterpieces, to name just a few of the more high-profile
events.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Sydney's turn.
</P>
<P>
   And its festival organizers say they learned a few things from
Atlanta's missteps. They say Atlanta fumbled by scheduling too many
performances during the Games themselves, when sports took center
stage and traffic was chaotic. Though the Woodruff Arts Center
provided something of a cultural nexus, events were spread around
the city precisely at traffic crunch time. Ticket sales were
generally good, but artists often played to half-empty houses.
</P>
<P>
   To adjust for the problem, Sydney has scheduled a good number of
its performances before the Games begin. That isn't to say that
Games-goers won't have arts events to pick from. But almost all of
them will be at the opera house, which offers the kind of dramatic
pedestrian backdrop that Atlanta and Los Angeles, which hosted the
Games in 1984, never could. Like Barcelona, site of the 1992 Games,
Sydney offers a vibrant urban landscape where sports fans, arts
patrons _ and plain old strollers _ can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to have a tourist attraction that is also a cultural
venue, so we have to exploit that to its fullest,'' says Hassall,
who goes so far as to say it's like having the Olympics under the
Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Southern hospitality, the Australians are using their
own blend of mellowness and megalomania to try to turn the world on
its ear. Even if you don't get to see the Codex Leicester _
Leonardo da Vinci's 75-page notebook, on loan from Bill and Melinda
Gates _ or any of the festival's top-notch musical, dance,
theatrical or visual arts offerings, you're liable to get wind of
the Disneyesque dimensions of this Cultural Olympiad. Last weekend,
for example, a sellout crowd of 14,000 heard the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra perform Gustav Mahler's rarely heard ``Symphony of a
Thousand,'' with organ music beamed in via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic Games start Sept. 15, Sydney already will have
been feted to Pina Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal (Germany), Cloud
Gate Dance Theatre (Taiwan), Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company
(the U.S. troupe that recently stood up Spoleto Festival USA
because of the Confederate flag controversy) and the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra's Robert Spano conducting the Australian Youth
Orchestra with violin soloist Pinchas Zukerman. Too bad six of the
festival's seven theatrical productions will have closed by then.
</P>
<P>
   If that is frustrating for arts lovers who can't get to Sydney
three weeks before the Games, it's a gift to the locals, who can
catch the performances before the stampede begins. Conversely, when
the foreign crowd arrives, it can get a good taste of Australian
culture: the Bell Shakespeare Company's mostly nude adaptation of
``Troilus and Cressida,'' the Bangarra Dance Theatre, the
Australian Ballet, the Sydney Symphony, the Australian Chamber
Orchestra and three Opera Australia productions. And the Flying
Fruit Fly Circus of Australia is teaming up with the Shanghai
Acrobatic Troupe through Sept. 30 at Prince Alfred Park.
</P>
<P>
   Major international acts appearing during the Games include
Riccardo Muti conducting his Orchestra Filarmonia della Scala, the
George Shearing Trio, German cabaret singer Ute Lemper and American
chanteuse Barbara Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Hassall says ticket sales are at about 40 percent of capacity.
Only the Bocelli gala and the George Shearing Trio have sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be discounted are the more than 20 exhibitions on
everything from contemporary Australian furniture design and
Aboriginal fishing to Korean masterpieces and photography. The
blockbuster shows are likely to be the Dead Sea Scrolls (Art
Gallery of New South Wales), Leonardo's Codex Leceister and ``1,000
Years of the Olympic Games,'' 50 ancient relics that Greece refused
to lend to Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Fewster, director of the Powerhouse Museum _ where the
Leonardo notebook, the Greek treasures and the Korean show will be
on view _ is expecting big crowds. Fewster says he's experiencing
the same nervousness he observed at Atlanta's High Museum in 1996,
on the eve of the ``Rings'' opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, they did spectacularly well, so I think it would
be fair to say I sit in exactly the same position, on the edge of
my seat,'' says the director of Australia's largest museum. ``The
truth is that nobody can predict just how well it will go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the big question: How will this festival play with
Australia and the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Any Olympic arts festival, be it in Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Barcelona or Sydney, must walk a political tightrope, trying to be
at once local, national and international.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles festival was notorious for excluding its
constituent arts groups. But with the Los Angeles Times as its
major sponsor, the Cultural Olympiad put on a show of such depth
and international cachet that it's still considered the benchmark.
Barcelona's effort, on the other hand, ran out of money months
before the Games but still managed to roll out a tapestry of events
that captured the essence of Catalonian culture and the
cutting-edge attitude of that particular moment. Like Sydney,
Barcelona had scale: Montjuic and the cascading esplanades of the
National Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta wanted to showcase Southern culture, but it couldn't get
over its inferiority complex. The solution was to diffuse the
Southern spotlight by focusing on the 100th anniversary of the
modern Games and on other host cities. ``We tended to go a little
more mainstream,'' says Jeffrey Babcock, director of Atlanta's
Cultural Olympiad and now general director and chief executive
officer of the Boston Ballet. The critical response to Atlanta's
festival was mixed, but some exciting work came to the attention of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusiveness in programming is always a good thing. But Atlanta
needed an arts focus _ a place.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent piece in the Sydney Morning Herald, Debra Good, a
doctoral student at the University of New South Wales' Centre for
Olympic Studies, wrote, ``Schofield's program has been criticized
in advance for not including a commissioned Australian play; for
being too Eurocentric; for being too Sydney-centric; and for being
too international in flavor.'' Anyone who was around for the
constant feuds among the Atlanta arts community, Olympic officials
and the media can't help but feel a little deja vu upon reading
that.
</P>
<P>
   Nunally Kersh, producer of Charleston's Spoleto Festival, says
the Sydney event is to be admired for its mix of avant-garde work
reflecting both Australia and the world. ``I think they have been
very courageous,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the legacy of Atlanta's Olympic Arts Festival,
Babcock mentioned the Uhry play, then paused. ``The important thing
was, when it was all said and done, we really included many local
artists, and they had an opportunity to participate in an event
that only happened once in Atlanta. I think that's vital.''
</P>
<P>
   If only Atlanta had had an architectural jewel doubling as a
performing-arts venue.

Olympic torch arrives at the opera house, the fabled structure will
go up in bright red flames, thanks to lighting wizardry by trendy
Australian designer Marc Newson. Adding wattage to the ceremony,
Down Under diva Olivia Newton-John will hand the torch to Italian
tenor Andrea Bocelli, who'll pass it to Australian tennis star Pat
Rafter. Afterward, for world leaders with nothing to do, there'll
be glittery twin galas inside the performing arts palace: Bocelli
singing Donizetti arias in one room, the Australian Ballet dancing
in another.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago, Atlanta got what may have been its biggest
infusion of culture ever: a $25 million extravaganza where you
could catch Jessye Norman with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the
Alliance Theater Company's world premiere of Alfred Uhry's ``The
Last Night of Ballyhoo'' or the High Museum's ``Rings'' exhibit of
world masterpieces, to name just a few of the more high-profile
events.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Sydney's turn.
</P>
<P>
   And its festival organizers say they learned a few things from
Atlanta's missteps. They say Atlanta fumbled by scheduling too many
performances during the Games themselves, when sports took center
stage and traffic was chaotic. Though the Woodruff Arts Center
provided something of a cultural nexus, events were spread around
the city precisely at traffic crunch time. Ticket sales were
generally good, but artists often played to half-empty houses.
</P>
<P>
   To adjust for the problem, Sydney has scheduled a good number of
its performances before the Games begin. That isn't to say that
Games-goers won't have arts events to pick from. But almost all of
them will be at the opera house, which offers the kind of dramatic
pedestrian backdrop that Atlanta and Los Angeles, which hosted the
Games in 1984, never could. Like Barcelona, site of the 1992 Games,
Sydney offers a vibrant urban landscape where sports fans, arts
patrons _ and plain old strollers _ can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to have a tourist attraction that is also a cultural
venue, so we have to exploit that to its fullest,'' says Hassall,
who goes so far as to say it's like having the Olympics under the
Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Southern hospitality, the Australians are using their
own blend of mellowness and megalomania to try to turn the world on
its ear. Even if you don't get to see the Codex Leicester _
Leonardo da Vinci's 75-page notebook, on loan from Bill and Melinda
Gates _ or any of the festival's top-notch musical, dance,
theatrical or visual arts offerings, you're liable to get wind of
the Disneyesque dimensions of this Cultural Olympiad. Last weekend,
for example, a sellout crowd of 14,000 heard the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra perform Gustav Mahler's rarely heard ``Symphony of a
Thousand,'' with organ music beamed in via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic Games start Sept. 15, Sydney already will have
been feted to Pina Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal (Germany), Cloud
Gate Dance Theatre (Taiwan), Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company
(the U.S. troupe that recently stood up Spoleto Festival USA
because of the Confederate flag controversy) and the Atlanta
Symphony Orchestra's Robert Spano conducting the Australian Youth
Orchestra with violin soloist Pinchas Zukerman. Too bad six of the
festival's seven theatrical productions will have closed by then.
</P>
<P>
   If that is frustrating for arts lovers who can't get to Sydney
three weeks before the Games, it's a gift to the locals, who can
catch the performances before the stampede begins. Conversely, when
the foreign crowd arrives, it can get a good taste of Australian
culture: the Bell Shakespeare Company's mostly nude adaptation of
``Troilus and Cressida,'' the Bangarra Dance Theatre, the
Australian Ballet, the Sydney Symphony, the Australian Chamber
Orchestra and three Opera Australia productions. And the Flying
Fruit Fly Circus of Australia is teaming up with the Shanghai
Acrobatic Troupe through Sept. 30 at Prince Alfred Park.
</P>
<P>
   Major international acts appearing during the Games include
Riccardo Muti conducting his Orchestra Filarmonia della Scala, the
George Shearing Trio, German cabaret singer Ute Lemper and American
chanteuse Barbara Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Hassall says ticket sales are at about 40 percent of capacity.
Only the Bocelli gala and the George Shearing Trio have sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be discounted are the more than 20 exhibitions on
everything from contemporary Australian furniture design and
Aboriginal fishing to Korean masterpieces and photography. The
blockbuster shows are likely to be the Dead Sea Scrolls (Art
Gallery of New South Wales), Leonardo's Codex Leceister and ``1,000
Years of the Olympic Games,'' 50 ancient relics that Greece refused
to lend to Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Fewster, director of the Powerhouse Museum _ where the
Leonardo notebook, the Greek treasures and the Korean show will be
on view _ is expecting big crowds. Fewster says he's experiencing
the same nervousness he observed at Atlanta's High Museum in 1996,
on the eve of the ``Rings'' opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, they did spectacularly well, so I think it would
be fair to say I sit in exactly the same position, on the edge of
my seat,'' says the director of Australia's largest museum. ``The
truth is that nobody can predict just how well it will go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the big question: How will this festival play with
Australia and the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Any Olympic arts festival, be it in Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Barcelona or Sydney, must walk a political tightrope, trying to be
at once local, national and international.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles festival was notorious for excluding its
constituent arts groups. But with the Los Angeles Times as its
major sponsor, the Cultural Olympiad put on a show of such depth
and international cachet that it's still considered the benchmark.
Barcelona's effort, on the other hand, ran out of money months
before the Games but still managed to roll out a tapestry of events
that captured the essence of Catalonian culture and the
cutting-edge attitude of that particular moment. Like Sydney,
Barcelona had scale: Montjuic and the cascading esplanades of the
National Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta wanted to showcase Southern culture, but it couldn't get
over its inferiority complex. The solution was to diffuse the
Southern spotlight by focusing on the 100th anniversary of the
modern Games and on other host cities. ``We tended to go a little
more mainstream,'' says Jeffrey Babcock, director of Atlanta's
Cultural Olympiad and now general director and chief executive
officer of the Boston Ballet. The critical response to Atlanta's
festival was mixed, but some exciting work came to the attention of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusiveness in programming is always a good thing. But Atlanta
needed an arts focus _ a place.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent piece in the Sydney Morning Herald, Debra Good, a
doctoral student at the University of New South Wales' Centre for
Olympic Studies, wrote, ``Schofield's program has been criticized
in advance for not including a commissioned Australian play; for
being too Eurocentric; for being too Sydney-centric; and for being
too international in flavor.'' Anyone who was around for the
constant feuds among the Atlanta arts community, Olympic officials
and the media can't help but feel a little deja vu upon reading
that.
</P>
<P>
   Nunally Kersh, producer of Charleston's Spoleto Festival, says
the Sydney event is to be admired for its mix of avant-garde work
reflecting both Australia and the world. ``I think they have been
very courageous,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the legacy of Atlanta's Olympic Arts Festival,
Babcock mentioned the Uhry play, then paused. ``The important thing
was, when it was all said and done, we really included many local
artists, and they had an opportunity to participate in an event
that only happened once in Atlanta. I think that's vital.''
</P>
<P>
   If only Atlanta had had an architectural jewel doubling as a
performing-arts venue.

 &HT;    Conductor champions Webern's world
 &HT;    By Pierre Ruhe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Modernism comes in waves. The first wave of modern
music ended in Mittersill, Austria, on Sept. 15, 1945, with three
quick gunshots. The war in Europe had been over since May. An
American soldier, Raymond N. Bell, was on a policing raid when he
encountered a man breaking curfew, puffing a cigar in a doorway.
</P>
<P>
   The events of that evening remain unclear. What's known is that
Anton Webern, an impoverished composer, had fled the turmoil of
Vienna and was visiting his son-in-law, a Nazi turned black
marketeer. Webern had stepped outside for a smoke _ a contraband
gift, undoubtedly _ just as Bell arrived. After a scuffle, shots
were fired. So ended the career of one of the most unlikely giants
of 20th-century music.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, Webern became a totem for the generation that
came of age after the war. With Europe in ruins, many headstrong
young artists, in all fields, started to question the value of
tradition. In Webern's music, composers found a break with the
musical establishment. New was better; new was the thing. Like
glass-and-steel architecture and abstract modern painting, Webern's
wispy miniatures were cool, clear, rational. They sounded
different. They fit the times. And a dead composer, especially one
who left no philosophical tracts, could be appropriated as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Pierre Boulez. As composer, conductor and media-savvy
polemicist, Boulez became leader of the international Webern cult,
defining a musical style that steered composition toward the
angular, the abstract, the atonal. When people nowadays get grumpy
about ``modern music,'' whether or not they know it, they're
probably talking about Webern's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Boulez, 75, has been a passionate and compelling champion of the
cause. He has just released the complete works of Anton Webern, a
six-CD set, with help from the Emerson String Quartet, the Ensemble
Intercontemporain and others. The performances overall are
superlative, infused with a luminance and warmth that should dispel
any notion that this music is frigid.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we hear Webern's mature works as bracing, extremely
concentrated, sometimes achingly beautiful and almost always
intoxicating, like a dry martini with olives. And unlike a symphony
by Bruckner or a tone poem by Strauss, Webern's music can be taken
in one gulp.
</P>
<P>
   With the Berlin Philharmonic, Boulez finds a world of expression
in the Symphony, Op. 21. A quirky, highly original work, it lasts
just over nine minutes. His Opus 1, Passacaglia for Orchestra,
lasts 10 minutes and might be mistaken for a rather hyperactive
piece by Mahler. The Variations for Piano, subtly played by
Krystian Zimerman, is loose-limbed and without a tonal center.
Since there's no line to follow, a listener gets soaked in
atmosphere. One of the pointillistic Five Movements for Orchestra,
Op. 10, is just seven measures long _ yet manages to tell a
complete story.
</P>
<P>
   What Webern accomplished _ and his followers adored _ was a
rejection of bloated, rococo romanticism. Economy was important,
yet he never compromised on heightened expression.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Webern's output was vocal music, infrequently heard in
concert because of its difficulty. Soprano Christiane Oelze handles
the songs and the two cantatas, among the composer's most
compelling works, with a fluid grace and an occasional phrase
turned into a haunting statement.
</P>
<P>
   This is Boulez's second crack at a complete Webern edition. His
first, originally released in the 1970s, covered only music that
Webern allowed published in his lifetime. That set is available on
CD from Sony. These new Deutsche Grammophon discs, superior in
almost every way, also include the sins of Webern's youth, works
that reveal his starting point: as a sensuous high romantic, a
direct descendant of Wagner and Mahler. The early Piano Quintet
evokes Brahms; ``Im Sommerwind'' saunters along at a pastoral
Viennese pace.
</P>
<P>
   We also get the posthumously published late works and several of
Webern's arrangements, including Schubert's German Dances and the
``Ricercata'' from Bach's ``A Musical Offering.'' These
re-creations don't try to improve on the original masters so much
as add psychological underpinning.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Webern's abstract music baffles many listeners, and
some never move beyond dismissing it as far-out stuff. Yet
listeners who admire the universality of J.S. Bach, or the tight
control found in sacred Renaissance polyphony, can't help but find
Webern a kindred spirit. Bach explored the cosmos, it's been said;
Webern the atom. In this new set, Boulez makes clear that between
the two exists an eerie bond.

 &HT;    Three new movies to fall for
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We've waited all summer long for a dazzling movie
scene as simple as this: Betty (Renee Zellweger) and George (Greg
Kinnear) quietly talking and getting to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   The dazzle comes with its kick. He's a big TV soap opera star,
thinking she's an actress with the perfect scam to land a part.
She's a small-town waitress psychologically zonked into a fantasy
state, thinking not only that her favorite daytime drama is the
real thing, but that George is the character he plays on television
and the one great love she's desperate to win.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming ``Nurse Betty,'' from director Neil LaBute (``In
the Company of Men''), Betty and George's encounters are sweet,
mesmerizing moments on film. And the movie has more _ lots more.
Hit men. Drugs. Torture. A cross-country chase. All wrapped in a
constant collision of fantasy and reality. It's ``Being There''
meets ``To Die For.''
</P>
<P>
   When the darkly comic ``Nurse Betty'' opens Sept. 8, you won't
have seen a movie quite like it in a long time. Qualitywise, this
summer has been one continuous pileup of flat films. (It speaks
volumes that the most exciting big-studio movie of the summer _
``Gladiator'' _ debuted May 5.)
</P>
<P>
   But the onset of fall is starting to look like a moviegoer's
salvation. Following ``Nurse Betty'' will come two more solid,
winning films: writer-director Cameron Crowe's (``Jerry Maguire'')
1970s rock tour movie ``Almost Famous,'' arriving Sept. 15, and
Denzel Washington's enjoyable, made-in-Atlanta high school football
flick ``Remember the Titans,'' which debuts Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   All three are deep, well-acted tales about American obsessions:
soap operas, rock music and football. And each focuses on average
Americans _ not the $4,000-Italian-silk-sofa crowd of last year's
autumn wonder ``American Beauty,'' but the TV-watching diner
waitresses of ``Nurse Betty'' and the shaggy-haired, ratty-jeaned
concert fanatics of ``Almost Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' is one of those quirky joys like LaBute's own
critics' favorite, ``In the Company of Men,'' only brighter,
lighter and more resonant. ``Men'' was brutal in its depiction of
misogyny and relationships between the sexes, honing masculine
desires into razor-sharp weapons. His equally dark follow-up film,
``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' viewed friendship like the final
daze of ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurse Betty'' not only benefits from being more accessible to
mainstream audiences than those movies (how can LaBute miss with
such a deeply talented, recognizable cast as Zellweger, Kinnear,
Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock?), but its satirical view is often
wrapped in genuine charm.
</P>
<P>
   True fascination is also the undercurrent of ``Almost Famous,''
Crowe's both unfettered examination of and sugary valentine to the
drug-filled, start-it-up rock music of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely based on Crowe's seminal years as a writer for Rolling
Stone magazine, which began when he was 16, the movie stars
newcomer Patrick Fugit as a teenage rock lover and aspiring
journalist who lands a plum assignment for the magazine: covering
the cross-country tour of Stillwater, a burgeoning band that's a
sort of cross between the Marshall Tucker Band and Led Zeppelin.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous in its depictions of flower-power groupies and
long-haired musicians hanging _ and fighting _ backstage, the film
also mixes enticing original songs (composed by Crowe, his wife
Nancy Wilson of Heart, Ann Wilson and Peter Frampton) with classics
from Led Zeppelin, the Who, Elton John, Yes, Joni Mitchell, Black
Sabbath and the Allman Brothers. Frampton also served as the film's
technical consultant and appears briefly as the road manager for
Humble Pie.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Frances McDormand co-stars as Fugit's mom, but the
film lacks a big mainstream marquee name (Brad Pitt was up for the
role of Stillwater's lead guitarist, but the part eventually went
to Billy Crudup).
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that may work to the movie's advantage. Crudup, who
recently starred in ``Jesus' Son,'' lends a believable mixture of
everyday good looks and unkempt cool (reportedly, when Robert Plant
saw the film, he said he was sure he had met the guy playing the
part on the road). Jason Lee (a frequent fixture in Kevin Smith
films like ``Mall Rats'' and ``Chasing Amy''), plays Stillwater's
ego-tuned lead vocalist like a small-town Steve Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Like DreamWorks' early push for ``American Beauty'' last year,
the studio has been pumping press interest in ``Almost Famous,''
launching an interview mini-tour with Crowe, Fugit and Kate Hudson
(Goldie Hawn's daughter, she plays groupie Penny Lane) and holding
invitation-only early screenings to generate a buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Early special screenings are also part of Disney's gameplan for
the modestly budgeted ``Remember the Titans,'' which producer Jerry
Bruckheimer is lauding as ``a real slice of life'' and is
personally promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, reportedly budgeted at around $20
million, ``Titans'' is a classic American tale: a Virginia high
school football team, undergoing integration in 1971, erupts in
racial strife and, against great odds, winds up winning the state
championship.
</P>
<P>
   It's an extremely earnest script and one that Bruckheimer has
ratcheted up with his patented branding of employing popular tunes
from the era, including Norman Greenbaum's ``Spirit In The Sky,''
The Hollies' ``Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress)'' and Creedence
Clearwater Revival's ``Up Around the Bend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film also stars Denzel Washington as the school's
real-life head football coach Herman Boone. It's such a strong
performance, filled with stalwart speeches and unrelenting
determination, that it lifts the film above the normal ``we won''
sports movie. And it's quite possible Washington will be up for an
Oscar again (some thought his performance in ``The Hurricane'' was
wrongly overlooked when Kevin Spacey won best actor this year)
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans'' was filmed throughout metro Atlanta last fall. And
since its subject is Virginia, there's virtually nothing in it
that's uniformly recognizable about Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   That might disappoint a few moviegoers here. But fall's early
message is clear. Nobody has to wait months in hopes that Tom
Hanks' post-``Survivor'' desert-isle flick, ``Cast Away,'' or
Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan's on-screen, off-screen love-tinged
adventure movie, ``Proof of Life,'' will rejuvenate the megaplex.
Very soon, you'll be able to see a really good movie.

 &HT;    DEEP BLUE: THE CYPERSPACE CELEBRITY
 &HT;    300&AMP;add. Moving in the (l) lifestyle and (f) financial
categories for release Monday, Aug. 28.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When an advertiser needs a high-powered sports
figure for a product endorsement, booking agents check out the
Q-rating. Think Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, Deep Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about high-powered. The IBM product has become the first
computer to attain celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steven Levitt, president of Marketing Evaluations,
the research company that has tracked Q-ratings of celebrities for
the past 36 years, Deep Blue ranks on a par with some real people
like Donald Trump and LL Cool J, and some fictional characters like
Austin Powers and Count Chocula.
</P>
<P>
   Q-ratings are calculated by combining popularity, rated on a
scale of 1 to 5, with familiarity. About one out of two people, the
survey shows, is familiar with Deep Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue's Q-rating of 9 was derived from a recent survey of
1,200 Americans. By comparison, Albert Einstein rates as a 56,
Mickey Mouse 44, Elvis 33 and NBC's Tom Brokaw 28. New York Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner will finish the season as a 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people can relate to somebody as a favorite, the more
they're likely to watch the television show in which these people
appear, the more likely they are to be persuaded by that person in
advertising,'' Levitt told National Public Radio this month.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Blue earns its keep as a top-of-the-line RS/6000 SP
supercomputer, plugging away at complex projects in an IBM Research
lab in Yorktown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It first won fame by playing Garry Kasparov, the reigning world
chess champion, in 1996. Deep Blue lost that time, but when an
improved model defeated Kasparov in a 1997 rematch, the computer
ended up on the cover of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   IBM let all comers watch the chess matches in real time on the
Internet, which was still in its embryonic phase. That decision, in
turn, helped bolster the early popularity of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after those games, Deep Blue has displayed its
staying power as a pop icon. Or, as an IBM spokesman put it: ``The
man vs. machine issues that drove initial interest are fading as a
technology-friendly Internet culture has fun with Deep Blue the
'personality.'
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Deep Blue has emerged as a celebrity character
in Internet comic strips, in political satire, in late-night talk
show humor and in a tech-savvy TV animated show, Fox's
``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, an episode of ``Futurama'' featured Deep Blue as an
intern as a ``Vice Presidential Action Ranger'' for Democratic
White House hopeful Al Gore. The computer was charged with the task
of protecting the Earth's time-space continuum.

   It first won fame by playing Garry Kasparov, the reigning world
chess champion, in 1996. Deep Blue lost that time, but when an
improved model defeated Kasparov in a 1997 rematch, the computer
ended up on the cover of Newsweek.

   IBM let all comers watch the chess matches in real time on the
Internet, which was still in its embryonic phase. That decision, in
turn, helped bolster the early popularity of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after those games, Deep Blue has displayed its
staying power as a pop icon. Or, as an IBM spokesman put it: ``The
man vs. machine issues that drove initial interest are fading as a
technology-friendly Internet culture has fun with Deep Blue the
'personality.'
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Deep Blue has emerged as a celebrity character
in Internet comic strips, in political satire, in late-night talk
show humor and in a tech-savvy TV animated show, Fox's
``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, an episode of ``Futurama'' featured Deep Blue as an
intern as a ``Vice Presidential Action Ranger'' for Democratic
White House hopeful Al Gore. The computer was charged with the task
of protecting the Earth's time-space continuum.

 &HT;    Net access providers to move past traditional dial-up access for
traditional PCs.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's a 21st century Internet service provider to do?
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in traditional ISPs, such as Atlanta-based EarthLink, are
hovering near all-time lows as Wall Street's love affair with the
traditional dial-up ISP begins to wane. Investors are demanding
more products and services and evidence of additional revenue
streams from high-speed access, Web hosting, advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Microsoft Network (commonly known as MSN and soon
to be renamed Microsoft.net), which had been practically written
off as an afterthought of the software giant, is rolling out a new
product strategy this week in New York designed to highlight the
company's Web-based content across a variety of platforms and
devices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the days when Internet access was limited to
those who had access to a computer and a dial-up telephone
connection rapidly are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones, pagers, personal digital assistants such as the
Palm Pilot and other devices _ including your television set _ all
allow users to connect to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean PC Internet access is going to be replaced by
cell phones or other space-age devices.
</P>
<P>
   It does mean that ISPs such as EarthLink will have to do more
than offer a reliable connection to the Web from a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Dylan Brooks says the recent
downturn in ISP stocks is an indicator that Wall Street wants to
see more from access providers than just millions of dial-up
customers. Brooks says that to stay competitive in a rapidly
changing marketplace, these ISPs have to start thinking about ways
to keep their dial-up subscribers loyal as other access devices
move into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are hard-pressed to find an ISP that doesn't recognize the
need to smarten up its pipes,'' he says. ``They know they need to
derive more of their revenue from non-access charges, including
paid content, Web hosting, advertising and commerce. The value
placed on those revenue streams is higher than those placed on
access revenue alone. The ISPs valued most highly have significant
application plays and content revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink has blamed its stock slide on the downturn of the
entire Internet sector. It also has aggressively begun to advertise
and roll out high-speed broadband services. (The company topped the
100,000 high-speed user mark last week). It has increased its
offerings to its small-business Web-hosting customers to prove it
can generate alternative revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the best efforts, the stock continues to
stumble, and EarthLink has little choice but to stand by its
``connectivity is king'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Microsoft Network continues to focus on the
design and development of its Web sites such as CarPoint, HotMail,
HomeAdvisor and MSN Search. The company has been sending mixed
signals to analysts with an Internet strategy that focuses on
content, a computer rebate program that focuses on access and a
wireless strategy that seems unrelated to any of its other Internet
plays. Company spokesman say that this week it will announce a new,
unified strategy that will tie the disparate pieces of the
Microsoft.net puzzle together. Microsoft also promises that the
services will be built to deliver the company's content over a
variety of platforms, not just the Windows PC.
</P>
<P>
   While America Online and Microsoft still say access is
important, the slight shift of focus to content gives each an edge
over companies like EarthLink, which built its reputation and its
subscriber base of more than 4 million on outstanding service and
support.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's much too soon to count anybody out, including
EarthLink. The service-based ISP earlier this year ended its TV
commercials with the tagline: ``It's your Internet, we just connect
you to it.'' In the future, what EarthLink or any other ISP
connects you to may be just as important as how fast and how well
it connects you. Microsoft is banking on content; EarthLink is
banking on a strong infrastructure to make sure users get to the
content they want.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink's strategy is to hang on to its dial-up users it has
already won over with its service-based model by assuring them
that, as new technologies develop, the company will be there to
make sure every problem is solved, every glitch fixed and every
question answered.
</P>
<P>
   Company President Mike McQuary says EarthLink will hold to the
same high standards of service for users of emerging technologies
it has always had for its PC dial-up customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already know who you are,'' says EarthLink Chief Executive
Garry Betty. ``And if you want to configure your phone to access
your EarthLink personal start page, we'll be there to deliver to
you the content you already access and are already using.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our core competencies, we have many potential
partners who want to work with us,'' McQuary says. ``But we won't
roll out any new service until it's ready. It's important to us to
maintain trust with our subscribers. We have to make sure that when
we roll out something to our customer base, we can service them and
give them the help they need. ``
</P>
<P>
   While EarthLink continues to focus on connectivity, AOL, the
nation's largest ISP with more than 23 million members, is immersed
in its ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy. AOL is in a better position
because it can offer a staggering amount of content, a huge number
of subscribers and a merger with Time Warner that will provide it
with virtually instant broadband access. The company already is
providing users with access to several wireless devices, Web-based
mail and even AOL TV.
</P>
<P>
   AOL users who enter the keyword ``AOLanywhere'' will find not
just a listing of the wireless products that can be used to access
the service, but a buyers guide. College students also will find
out how to get their AOL mail via the company's Web site
(www.aol.com). Information about AOL's TV offering can be found at
the keyword ``AOLTV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people really understand the value of AOL,'' says AOL's
Marta Grutka, who works with the product development team. ``Our
members have really come to understand how we can enrich their
lives with our content. We can tell them they can send (instant
messages) while they are watching `Friends' or get e-mail from
their cell phones.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL knows that its mail, news, stock, shopping and other
services are vital to users, but it's no longer for information
that users need AOL. Like EarthLink, it is counting on the loyalty
_ as well as the inertia factor _ to migrate users to a variety of
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has always been platform and access agnostic,'' Grutka
says. ``We want to let consumers and AOL members access their
favorite features and services no matter where they are or how they
connect or at what speed.''

 &HT;    Wheeling to Sydney
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARM SPRINGS, Ga. _ For most of the past 150 years, polio
patients came to this sleepy Middle Georgia town. They came to swim
in the 88-degree water that flows from the springs just east of the
downtown business district.
</P>
<P>
   Now, handicapped athletes from around the world come to Warm
Springs because of the accessible facilities at the Roosevelt Warm
Springs Institute for Rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the top eight men's wheelchair basketball teams
in the world have played a round-robin tournament in preparation
for the Paralympics later this year in Sydney, Australia. Canada
defeated the United States 61-55 Saturday to win the tournament
undefeated. Seven women's teams will be on the courts Thursday
through next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The $11.2 million Center for Therapeutic Recreation, where the
2000 Roosevelt World Basketball Challenge is being held, includes
an indoor gym, pool, racquetball court and fitness room. It opened
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   David Kiley, who has won Paralympic gold medals in giant slalom,
track and wheelchair basketball, works at a rehab center in
Charlotte helping recently injured people get back into a
physically active lifestyle. But he doesn't have anything like the
facilities at Warm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't know this is a rehab center, because it's such a
great sports complex,'' Kiley said.
</P>
<P>
   The recreation center is just one of the modern buildings that
sit on the 953-acre campus originally purchased by Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt first came to Warm Springs in 1924 after hearing that
the warm waters from the springs might help his legs, which had
been crippled by polio. He spent nearly two-thirds of his personal
wealth, plus money donated by friends from New York, to purchase a
run-down resort around the springs. He returned 41 times and was
next door at his Little White House when he died in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, which Roosevelt started,
treated polio patients until the disease essentially was conquered
in the 1960s. The state of Georgia took over the management of the
property in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 500 people work there. The annual budget is
about $28 million, including $4 million in state funds. More than
5,000 patients are treated each year.
</P>
<P>
   The institute hosts several competitive events each year. The
wheelchair basketball games are especially significant because they
are the final international competition before the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   Rules for wheelchair basketball games are similar to stand-up
games, except ballhandlers are allowed to double-dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Players' level of disability is rated, and officials use those
numbers to even the competition.
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no lateral movement, and the guys don't jump as
high,'' said Michael Frogley, coach of the Canadian team. ``It's
more a game of tactics and team play, whereas the NBA is to a large
extent a game of one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Frogley, like his players, is in a wheelchair. He played
stand-up basketball before wrecking a sports car when he was a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   In stand-up basketball, fans are accustomed to hearing the
squeak of tennis shoes. In wheelchair basketball, the sounds coming
from the court are the clanking of wheelchairs crashing together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty physical; that's the nature of the game,'' said
Troy Sachs, who plays for the Australian team and is one of the
better, and most aggressive, players in the Roosevelt Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said his team has ``as good a chance as any other'' to
take the gold medal in the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in ourselves as a team, and you definitely have to
have five players working together to succeed in this sport,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA is favored to win the gold in Sydney, and team members
expect to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley, who has been on the U.S. team for 19 years, is hoping to
end his international basketball career with a win in the
Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to come off as not giving other teams respect,
but we're a pretty confident bunch,'' said Kiley, who at 47 is
twice as old as some of his teammates and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   When he hits the courts in Sydney, Kiley will become the only
player in Olympic history to play in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Team members say Team USA benefits from all of the wheelchair
teams playing across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the largest pool of players to draw from,'' he said.
``There are about 190 teams in North America, while some countries
have only 10 teams to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team might have the biggest talent pool, but the team's
bank balance is lagging, Kiley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the players pay out of their own pockets to go to
camps,'' he said. ``We've recently hired an executive director who
we hope will raise funds for us so we can just show up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with the sacrifices, Kiley wouldn't take anything for
the time and money he spent playing the game. And he is most
appreciative of the backing he has gotten from his wife and two
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been my main support through it all,'' he said.

 &HT;    Defiant prayers resound at games
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Determined not to be stopped by the U.S. Supreme
Court, students and grass-roots conservative groups across the
Bible Belt stood up last weekend and made a defiant statement: They
plan to pray at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines were drawn, from the Carolinas across to Texas,
with organized efforts to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling in
June prohibiting student-led prayer at games and assemblies
sanctioned by public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents were reported, with various levels of participation,
at scores of high school football games around the South, and are
likely to grow as word spreads.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the Batesburg-Leesville High School'student
body president took the microphone in the stadium press box and
said a prayer as football fans stood silently. The ACLU threatened
to sue to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In Hendersonville, N.C., Terry Schultz, a member of Reformation
Presbyterian Church, led a prayer at a Hendersonville High School
football game. Several members of other churches, who formed a
protest group called ``We Still Pray,'' participated.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, an organization called ``No Pray, No Play'' is urging
a recitation of the Lord's Prayer before football games this fall,
and it has been backed by pastors around the state who are
organizing prayers for next week's games.
</P>
<P>
   In Searcy, Ark., members of the school board voted to let a
nonprofit interdenominational group hold prayers around a stadium
flag pole before games.
</P>
<P>
   It all started Friday in Hattiesburg, Miss., with a few students
holding hands in the bleachers and saying ``Our Father who art in
Heaven.'' By the time they got to ``deliver us from evil,'' most of
the crowd of 4,500 was standing, proudly reciting the Lord's
Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   School officials carefully stayed out of the way in order not to
violate the court's decision. Handbills had been distributed by a
Christian ministry urging people to pray just before the game, but
no loudspeaker was used, and there was no official leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the government shut down the prayers on the
intercom doesn't mean they can stop us from praying silently or
just starting a prayer,'' said Savannah Spencer, an eighth-grade
clarinet player who prayed with most of the school band.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, high school football starts in earnest this week,
but there were no reports of prayer rallies at the handful of games
that got an early jump on competition this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At North Hall High School in Gainesville, Ga., a public moment
of silence was held instead of a prayer on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition of Georgia Chairwoman Sadie Fields said
Saturday that she has been encouraging the idea of ``spontaneous''
prayer at high school football games this fall, but she did not
know of any organized plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a Christian Coalition church bulletin insert, she recently
wrote that the Supreme Court's decision was ``as classic an example
of tyranny as this nation has ever experienced.'' She encouraged
church members to ``express their faith by reciting the Lord's
Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Texas case brought by two families, one Catholic and one
Mormon, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled illegal any school involvement
_ including the use of the stadium public address system, a speaker
representing students or any direct supervision or approval by the
faculty _ that explicitly or implicitly encourages prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling echoed an 11-year-old Georgia appeals court ban in a
case brought by a Douglas County High School band member. After
that decision, some Georgia school systems publicly announced that
they would disregard it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of prayer, school activities are treated differently
than some other publicly funded activities. For instance, members
of the Georgia General Assembly start each day of their legislative
session with a sermon and prayer, usually by a Protestant minister.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all summer, a loosely knit coalition of conservative
organizations and religious denominations have tried to find ways
to legally maintain prayer at games.
</P>
<P>
   The solution they hit on was a recitation of the Lord's Prayer,
immediately after the National Anthem, by students and parents
without the involvement of school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fields of the Georgia Christian Coalition called praying at
games a ``kind of civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are going to see more and more spontaneous kinds
of rising up against those governmental bodies who are attacking
the community of faith,'' she said. ``It is a true infringement on
the rights of Christians to display their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of pre-game prayers are finding some creative ways to
try to get around the court ban.
</P>
<P>
   In Forest City, N.C., for instance, a radio station is allowing
a pastor to say a prayer at the beginning of high school football
broadcasts, and is urging fans at the game to turn up their radios
during the prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts may force school systems into court _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shapiro, the national legal director of the ACLU in New
York, said if a school is not involved in the pre-game prayer, it
might be protected free speech, although he is concerned about its
presence at a school event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated legal question, but one of the things we
have learned over years is that school officials are rarely
uninvolved at their own events, rarely passive observers,'' he
said. ``School officials don't like to relinquish control.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Dellinger, a constitutional scholar at Duke University
Law School and former solicitor general of the United States, said
prayer could pass muster only if it was truly private and
independent of school authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as unfortunate that football games can be used
as occasions for prayer, the effect of which is to make some
students feel like religious strangers at their own public
schools,'' he said. ``But as long as it is a product of private
decisions by individuals or groups, it doesn't violate the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   At two high schools in Hattiesburg, Miss., school principals
said they had been informed beforehand by organizers that prayer
would be said at Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a while to catch on, like anything else,
but I think it's going to grow pretty big,'' said John Simpson, the
principal of Hattiesburg High School, who prayed. ``Most of the
students and parents support this. They think the Supreme Court
went too far. I would love to be in the middle of it, but I'm not
going to violate the law. So I'm glad the kids are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased by the nature of the prayer, however.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Krell, who is Jewish and a drum major in the band at
Hattiesburg High, wished organizers had not chosen such a
well-known Christian prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against prayer, but it shouldn't be one specific to a
single religion,'' he said. ``If they ever really got organized, I
guess I'd just have to say the Sabbath prayer _ it's Friday night,
you know.''

 &HT;    Defiant prayers resound at games
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Determined not to be stopped by the U.S. Supreme
Court, students and grass-roots conservative groups across the
Bible Belt stood up last weekend and made a defiant statement: They
plan to pray at high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines were drawn, from the Carolinas across to Texas,
with organized efforts to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling in
June prohibiting student-led prayer at games and assemblies
sanctioned by public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents were reported, with various levels of participation,
at scores of high school football games around the South, and are
likely to grow as word spreads.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the Batesburg-Leesville High School'student
body president took the microphone in the stadium press box and
said a prayer as football fans stood silently. The ACLU threatened
to sue to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In Hendersonville, N.C., Terry Schultz, a member of Reformation
Presbyterian Church, led a prayer at a Hendersonville High School
football game. Several members of other churches, who formed a
protest group called ``We Still Pray,'' participated.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, an organization called ``No Pray, No Play'' is urging
a recitation of the Lord's Prayer before football games this fall,
and it has been backed by pastors around the state who are
organizing prayers for next week's games.
</P>
<P>
   In Searcy, Ark., members of the school board voted to let a
nonprofit interdenominational group hold prayers around a stadium
flag pole before games.
</P>
<P>
   It all started Friday in Hattiesburg, Miss., with a few students
holding hands in the bleachers and saying ``Our Father who art in
Heaven.'' By the time they got to ``deliver us from evil,'' most of
the crowd of 4,500 was standing, proudly reciting the Lord's
Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   School officials carefully stayed out of the way in order not to
violate the court's decision. Handbills had been distributed by a
Christian ministry urging people to pray just before the game, but
no loudspeaker was used, and there was no official leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the government shut down the prayers on the
intercom doesn't mean they can stop us from praying silently or
just starting a prayer,'' said Savannah Spencer, an eighth-grade
clarinet player who prayed with most of the school band.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, high school football starts in earnest this week,
but there were no reports of prayer rallies at the handful of games
that got an early jump on competition this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At North Hall High School in Gainesville, Ga., a public moment
of silence was held instead of a prayer on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition of Georgia Chairwoman Sadie Fields said
Saturday that she has been encouraging the idea of ``spontaneous''
prayer at high school football games this fall, but she did not
know of any organized plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a Christian Coalition church bulletin insert, she recently
wrote that the Supreme Court's decision was ``as classic an example
of tyranny as this nation has ever experienced.'' She encouraged
church members to ``express their faith by reciting the Lord's
Prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Texas case brought by two families, one Catholic and one
Mormon, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled illegal any school involvement
_ including the use of the stadium public address system, a speaker
representing students or any direct supervision or approval by the
faculty _ that explicitly or implicitly encourages prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling echoed an 11-year-old Georgia appeals court ban in a
case brought by a Douglas County High School band member. After
that decision, some Georgia school systems publicly announced that
they would disregard it.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of prayer, school activities are treated differently
than some other publicly funded activities. For instance, members
of the Georgia General Assembly start each day of their legislative
session with a sermon and prayer, usually by a Protestant minister.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all summer, a loosely knit coalition of conservative
organizations and religious denominations have tried to find ways
to legally maintain prayer at games.
</P>
<P>
   The solution they hit on was a recitation of the Lord's Prayer,
immediately after the National Anthem, by students and parents
without the involvement of school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fields of the Georgia Christian Coalition called praying at
games a ``kind of civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are going to see more and more spontaneous kinds
of rising up against those governmental bodies who are attacking
the community of faith,'' she said. ``It is a true infringement on
the rights of Christians to display their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of pre-game prayers are finding some creative ways to
try to get around the court ban.
</P>
<P>
   In Forest City, N.C., for instance, a radio station is allowing
a pastor to say a prayer at the beginning of high school football
broadcasts, and is urging fans at the game to turn up their radios
during the prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts may force school systems into court _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shapiro, the national legal director of the ACLU in New
York, said if a school is not involved in the pre-game prayer, it
might be protected free speech, although he is concerned about its
presence at a school event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated legal question, but one of the things we

uninvolved at their own events, rarely passive observers,'' he
said. ``School officials don't like to relinquish control.''
</P>

PATENTS: TRANSPORT IDEAS THAT WORK ON LAND, SEA OR AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations, urban commuters have stood on curbs in every
kind of weather, doing the same dance: bodies tilted, necks craned
and eyes scanning the traffic horizon to see if the bus is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is an invention that could end those contortions.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Freda and Kenneth Schmier, who live in San Francisco, have
patented a system that uses orbital satellites, global positioning
technology, computer networks and wireless communications to
pinpoint buses along their routes and transmit the locations to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Buses would be equipped with global positioning sensors. Each
sensor would relay the location of its bus to a central computer,
where the information would be collected, updated and added to data
on every other bus in a transit system. The computer would create a
table showing the status of each bus, the location of scheduled
stops, connections to other buses, and the computed arrival times
of each bus at the stops along its route.
</P>
<P>
   Riders waiting for a bus could check this data a number of ways
_ through wireless communications devices like pagers, notebook
computers, personal digital assistants or cell phones; on a desktop
computer; or at special display stations.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone downloading the bus information would have
advertisements, too, and news, the inventors said in their patent
filing.
</P>
<P>
   Freda and Schmier received patent 6,006,159.
</P>
<P>
   If taking the bus seems too prosaic, there are transportation
alternatives. An airship with sails, for example, or an amphibious
bicycle. Both won patents this year.
</P>
<P>
   Joab Jay Perdue, who lives in Amarillo, Texas, has designed a
bicycle with pontoons that keeps riders afloat and dry while they
peddle across a lake, river, creek or pond.
</P>
<P>
   The bike has four braces that attach to its frame, each one a
tripod. The braces could be made of aluminum, metal alloy or
plastic. They are attached to the bike at points like the rear
wheel axle, the seat post, the seat-to-fork support bar and the
pedal assembly. Two flat pontoons made of a dense compression
polystyrene, like Styrofoam, are fastened to the bike with a pair
of the braces. Using two braces for each pontoon allows the rider
to raise and lower the pontoons between upper and lower braces. The
lower position allows the bicycle to float on water, while the
upper position moves the pontoons out of the way for cycling on
land.
</P>
<P>
   Moveable cross braces swing under the bike to create a support
bracket between the pontoons. Plastic or metal paddles are attached
to the spokes of the bicycle's rear wheel. They do not interfere
with the bike's function on land, but in the water they serve to
row the bike forward as the rider pedals. In the lowered position,
the flat, wide pontoons would keep the bicycle stable and elevated,
so a rider could pedal without becoming wet, Purdue said.
</P>
<P>
   The pontoons could be made in varying sizes, depending on the
size and weight of the bicycle, but Perdue described a typical
pontoon as being two feet wide, eight feet long and three inches
thick. He wrote in his patent application that a pontoon should be
constructed of polystyrene to ``take the puncture factor out of its
ability to float.''
</P>
<P>
   Perdue also wrote that the frame and pontoons held up well over
rough terrain in a prototype bicycle he rode on land and were
stable in waves of up to two feet. He received patent 6,050,864.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with most dirigibles, as Christopher Thyen sees it,
is that passengers are stuck in a compartment and cannot enjoy the
view and fresh air. So his patented airship with sails would be
shaped like a boat with a flat upper deck so that passengers and
crew could mill around outside in flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of freedom one receives on the deck of a sailing
ship, or from the unenclosed confines of a basket of a hot air
balloon, are missing from the gondolas used on airships,'' Thyen
wrote in his patent filing.
</P>
<P>
   Airships are designed to fly at low altitudes, where there are
strong winds, Thyen added, but modern models like the blimp ignore
this and rely on engines. Thyen has designed his airship to work
like a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   It would even resemble one. The frame is shaped like a boat,
with a curved bottom, a bow and stern, and a flat deck. The lower
part of the frame can be covered with any kind of fabric, and is
filled with seven ``flexible gas cells or lifting bladders''
carrying helium. The ship also has a wing on each side, with
horizontal stabilizers that have pivotal flaps on the trailing
edges to help keep the plane level and control its ascent and
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers and crew sit in an enclosed compartment during
takeoff and landing. The compartment might be several stories high
and could include sleeping cabins and a galley. A vertical
stabilizer with a rudder would be placed behind the compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-foot masts rising from the deck would carry sails. The
sails, along with other conventional sailboat hardware like
trailing booms, spar lines, winches and ballast tanks, allow the
crew to catch the wind for propulsion.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no wind, the ship can be flown with turbofan engines
attached to each side. Once airborne, passengers canleave the
compartment and stroll along the upper deck. An encircling rail
would keep them from falling overboard. Thyen received patent
6,019,311. &QL;

LYNDEN O. PINDLING, 70, PRIME MINISTER WHO LED BAHAMAS TO
INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Lynden O. Pindling, the prime minister of the Bahamas for 25
years, whose reputation and relationship with the United States
were marred by unresolved accusations of protecting drug
traffickers, died on Saturday at his home in Nassau. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, aides said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling was prime minister from 1967 to 1992, leading the
Bahamas through tremendous change, including the transition from a
British colony to independence in 1973. He was defeated in the 1992
election by the current prime minister, Hubert Ingraham. At the
time of his defeat, Pindling had been in office longer than any
leader in the Western Hemisphere except Fidel Castro of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as radio and television stations in the Bahamas
broadcast tributes to Pindling, Ingraham called him ``a giant of
our times,'' according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Left unmentioned, however, were allegations dating to the 1980s
that political observers in the Bahamas say contributed to
Pindling's defeat. He was accused of covering up for drug
traffickers and taking bribes as the chairman of the nation's Hotel
Commission. A Bahamian government commission was unable to
substantiate any of the claims, but the allegations had pronounced
political ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling remained a member of the House of Assembly until 1997,
when he resigned after 41 years in that legislative body. At the
time, he said he was ``less than perfect,'' but added, ``When all I
did for good is put in the balance against all I did for ill or
failed to do at all, I hope that future generations will not find
me sorely wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he helped found the Progressive Liberal Party, a
political organization dedicated to overthrowing the mostly white
colonial-run United Bahamian Party. Some supporters called him the
``black Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pindling was first elected prime minister in 1967, he ended
a tradition of white minority rule that had been in place for
centuries. He devoted his first term in office to securing
independence from Britain and used that prestige to win five more
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling spent much of his time working to improve the
reputation of his country, but became vulnerable to charges of
corruption in 1984, when an official commission set up to
investigate drug trafficking in the Bahamas found wide evidence of
official corruption in his Cabinet and in the Bahamian police. The
commission eventually cleared Pindling of any wrongdoing, but said
he and his wife had at least $3.5 million in bank deposits that
could not be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1987 trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas, a founder of the
Medellin cocaine cartel in Colombia, prosecutors charged that
Lehder and other drug traffickers had paid at least $5 million to
Pindling for permission to use the Bahamas as a shipment point for
cocaine and marijuana bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several drug smugglers testified that they had made such
payments directly to him. The prime minister denied the
accusations. After Lehder's conviction, the United States sought to
confiscate his holdings in the Bahamas, but was rebuffed by
Pindling. He continued to quarrel with the United States until his
1992 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   By that year, though, a decline in the economy in the late 1980s
and early 1990s had become the decisive factor for many voters.
Tourism was by far the largest source of employment and revenue in
the nation of more than 700 islands, and the Bahamas was finding it
difficult to compete with other vacation destinations.
</P>
<P>
   To many young voters, Pindling was seen not as a father of their
country, but as an international pariah who could not get them
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lady Marguerite; two sons, Obafemi,
40, and Leslie, 39; two daughters, Michelle Sands, 38, and Monique
Johnson, 34; and five grandchildren.

LANCELOT WARE, 85, CO-FOUNDER OF MENSA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lancelot Ware, a British barrister who was the co-founder of
Mensa, the society for intellectually gifted people, died on Aug.
15 in a nursing home in Surrey, England. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Ware became interested in unusually bright people when his
father died, leaving him to care for his sister, who was ten years
younger than he. His realization that both of them were highly
intelligent led to an interest in intelligence testing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, when Ware was a postgraduate student of law at Lincoln
College, Oxford, he met Roland Berrill, an eccentric barrister from
Australia who had become fixated with Oxford since being rejected
by the school. Together the two men founded an association for
people with strong intellects.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are about 100,000 Mensa members in 100 countries
and active Mensa organizations in over 40 countries, on every
continent except Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirement for membership is proof that the applicant
has an IQ in the top 2 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Members range in age from 4 to 94, but most are between 20 and
49. They include both high school dropouts and people with multiple
doctorates. Some are on welfare, while some are millionaires. And
they hold many jobs _ professors, truck drivers, scientists,
firefighters, farmers, computer programmers, glass blowers, artists
and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Smart as the two founders were, they could not at first settle
on a name for their aristocracy of intellect.
</P>
<P>
   They began by calling it the High IQ Club. When that sounded too
prosaic they considered ``Mens'' _ Latin for mind. But that was
also the name of a racy gentleman's magazine. So they made it
Mensa, and clung to that even though it was soon discovered that
Mensa, which means table in Latin, also means idiot in Mexican
slang.
</P>
<P>
   The original object of Mensa was to create a list of the names
and addresses of 600 of the most intelligent people in Britain so
that they could be contacted by scholars and governmental officials
in case of need. It was perhaps not surprising that Mensa's
courting of the government went unrequited.
</P>
<P>
   But Ware did not lose his enthusiasm. ``I found that people of
high intelligence were people I had an easy rapport with,'' he once
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mensa developed as its goals to identify and foster human
intelligence for the benefit of humanity, to encourage research in
the field of intelligence and to promote stimulating activities for
its members.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, though, the stated object of the association is
``enjoying each other's company and participating in a wide range
of social and cultural activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Membership is still determined by intelligence testing _ even
after the worth of such tests was challenged. In 1995,
International Mensa was attacked when its Los Angeles newsletter
proposed euthanasia for the old, ill or mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Lancelot Lionel Ware was born in Mitcham, Surrey. During World
War II, he served as a research chemist, but later said he quit
because he was given three months' worth of work to do in three
days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his study of law, he studied at the Imperial
College of Science and Technology in London, and was a medical
researcher and lecturer at St. Thomas' Hospital in London.
</P>
<P>
   In his legal work, Ware specialized in intellectual property,
copyright and patents.
</P>
<P>
   Ware is survived by his wife, Francesca Quint Ware, a fellow
member of Mensa.
</P>
<P>
   Ware lost interest in Mensa in 1950, but after Berrill died in
1961 Ware rejoined the society and became vigorously active in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ware had traveled widely to meet Mensa members.
Last year he was named president of the Mensa Foundation for Gifted
Children.
</P>
<P>
   But Mensa was still an organization in search of a purpose, and
to some degree remains so today.

ANOTHER SIGN OF THE TIMES: THE IRISH ARE DRINKING LESS GUINNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISDOONVARNA, Ireland _ From the doorway of his family's pub,
Peter Curtin has witnessed dramatic changes in Irish life. He
remembers when one man's trip to the United States was considered
so unusual that he was sent to the local schools to share what he
had seen. He remembers when farmers would come in for a pint of
Guinness while clutching the reins of horses poking their noses
into the pub.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this remarkable is that Curtin is only 46 years old.
So much of Ireland has changed in recent years that he avoids
general statements, for fear that another cultural upheaval will
occur before he completes the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But today this much is true: Trips to the States are routine,
customers at the bar could have a BMW parked where the horses used
to stand _ and he is probably drinking something other than a
Guinness, the midnight-black stout consumed by his father and his
father before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too individual a taste,'' Curtin, who now manages that
same pub, said with a hint of admiration. ``Plus, it doesn't have
the perception as a drink for younger people.''
</P>
<P>
   Something seismic is happening in Ireland _ apart from the
diminishing influence of the Roman Catholic Church, apart from an
economy so ferocious that a tiger has replaced the tamer metaphor
of a bull.
</P>
<P>
   In short, people here are not drinking Guinness stout as much as
they used to. Signs once proclaiming that ``Guinness is good for
you'' might now read: ``Guinness is no longer a given.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Diageo, the international food and beverage giant
that owns Guinness along with Pillsbury, Burger King, Smirnoff and
Johnnie Walker, announced that worldwide sales for the stout were
booming, particularly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it also provided another, more intriguing statistic: While
Guinness stout remains the best-selling alcoholic beverage in
Ireland, over the last year its consumption here has declined by
nearly 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a blip. Pat Barry, the director of corporate affairs
for a subsidiary called Guinness Ireland, said that in the last
five years, the sale and consumption of lagers here, the light,
cold and transparent brews, have surpassed those of heavier, darker
stout for the first time in _ well, for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this just a routine shift in consumer tastes _ this is
not Tayto's chips, it is ``the black stuff,'' something so
psychically connected to Ireland that in Dublin after donating
blood, you are given the choice between a free cup of tea or a
half-pint of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness is synonymous with Ireland and with Irish heritage,''
said Philip Hawkins, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in London. ``But
as prosperity comes to Ireland at a rapid pace, youngsters have
more money in their pockets than ever before, and are looking for a
more fashionable drinking experience in the fashionable clubs in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that means you don't walk around with a pint of Guinness
in your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry agreed: ``The challenge for us is to ensure that Guinness
continues to be relevant to a wide range of consumers and to make
it more relevant to the newer consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Having relevance in Ireland has never been an issue for
Guinness. Part of the national story includes how Arthur Guinness
began to brew ales and porter at St. James' Gate in Dublin in 1759;
how the brewery introduced a stronger porter called ``extra stout''
in the 1820s; how the prospering company built housing for the poor
and developed St. Stephen's Green as a gift to Dublin. When the
company adopted the patriotic symbol of a harp, it seemed more
fitting than impertinent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the Irish writer Brendan Behan once observed,
Guinness has been good to the Irish, but so, too, have the Irish
been good to Guinness. Generations of men drank its stout as they
talked rebellion or shared gossip in pubs, long the community
centers of this country. The drink took on its own lore: how you
ate a Guinness as much as drank it; how it contained restorative
vitamins; how even a pregnant woman might benefit from its wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The famous ``Guinness is good for you'' slogan is no longer used
here _ the beverage is, after all, alcohol. But the company still
trumpets the phrase in a few countries, Barry said, where the stout
is perceived by some to be ``a source of power and strength and
virility.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country with more than 10,000 pubs and hotel bars, any
failure in the exacting delivery of a pint _ from the cleanliness
of the tap lines to the temperature of the beverage _ traditionally
could ruin a pub's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Curtin, a sociologist at the National University of
Ireland, Galway _ and Peter Curtin's older brother _ has spent
years studying rural communities like Lisdoonvarna, which is known
for its spa water and for an annual September festival at which
bachelor farmers once sought potential brides. His research has
focused in part on pub life _ a life he knows well, having been
born above the family pub, the Roadside Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   In that culture, Christopher Curtin recalled: ``To be a drinker
was to be drinking Guinness. And if you were to ask what single
drink would you have to have above any other, it would be
Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   But that culture is in transformation. There is an architectural
shift away from the small, bevel-glassed windows, so perfect in
thwarting the curious from peering in. The ``holy hour'' law _
which forced pubs to close on Sunday afternoons to encourage
families to eat, and not drink, their Sunday dinners _ was recently
set aside. Finally, there is the diminishing influence of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   When the Curtins were children, their family's pub offered
Guinness on tap, whiskey in the bottle, and gin for the
nonconformist. Now it offers an assortment of tapped and bottled
lagers, from Heineken to Budweiser, as well as ales, ciders, wine
and a new line of ready-to-drink concoctions made of vodka, rum and
other spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the choices at the Roadside Tavern reflect how far
Ireland has come from being an island unto itself, a parochial
place where Guinness profited from its captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The international market is now competing for the suddenly
abundant pocket money of the average Irish consumer. More people
are returning from intercontinental vacations with broadened
tastes. And the universal emphasis on slim figures, beamed daily
over satellite television, bedevils the Guinness marketing
executives who have tried for years to convey the difficult message
that its heavy product is not particularly fattening.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Guinness anticipated the changing tastes, and has
spent millions of dollars on technology to cool the stout _
traditionally served at room temperature _ and to make it available
in specially designed cans. But the younger drinkers are proving
ever more elusive, acknowledged Barry. ``Our interest at this stage
is to encourage the newer drinker to come on board at an earlier
age,'' he said. ``And we're doing that through a variety of
promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   One such promotion includes photographs of attractive young
people with the advice to ``Live life to the power of Guinness'' _
a phrase that, at least in Lisdoonvarna, has Peter Curtin asking:
``What the heck does that mean?''
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness tap is far from running dry. The company continues
to reap large profits in countries like Italy and Spain, to which
it routinely sends architects to help recreate authentic Irish
pubs. It still owns the brewing and marketing rights here for
Budweiser and Carlsberg beer and distributes various other brands
of ales and lagers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the company continues to streamline its operations _
it recently announced the closing of one brewery and layoffs at a
packaging plant and another brewery _ Barry dismisses rumors that
its parent company, Diageo, will either sell it or move its
operations out of the country. Guinness, he said, will stay _
sponsoring the Rose of Tralee festivals, providing free lunches to
the elderly of Dublin, remaining a part of the Irish psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something has been lost. Forty years ago, who in
Lisdoonvarna could have imagined that the Curtin lad named Peter _
the one who watched over their horses while they had a pint of
Guinness _ would someday propose building a microbrewery next to
his family's pub? A microbrewery that he promises would make its
own brand of stout.

   OLYMPIC-FESTIVAL _ Preview of the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival,
how it compares to Atlanta and what to look for if you go. How is
this festival uniquely Australian, or is it? Whatever you say about
it, it's an extremely impressive lineup--plenty of sophisticated
contemporary work, classics, and such big names as Robert Spano and
Pinkas Zuckerman, Ricardo Muti with his La Scala orchestra; Pina
Bausch, Bill T. Jones, Ute Lemper, Bang on the Can All Stars, the
Dead Sea Scrolls and Bill and Melinda Gates' copex of Leonardo da
Vinci's Codex Leicester on display. The theater component looks
especially strong. An advance, with some analysis and nuts and
bolds stuff. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 45. MOVED.

   DEFIANT-PRAYER _ Determined not to be stopped by the U.S.
Supreme Court, students and grass-roots conservative groups across
the Bible Belt stood up last weekend and made a defiant statement:
They plan to pray at high school football games. The battle lines
were drawn, from the Carolinas across to Texas, with organized
efforts to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling in June prohibiting
student-led prayer at games and assemblies sanctioned by public
schools. Incidents were reported, with various levels of
participation, at scores of high school football games around the
South, and are likely to grow as word spreads. (Salzer, Atlanta

   OLYMPICS-WHEELCHAIR _ WARM SPRINGS, Ga. _ For most of the past
150 years, polio patients came to this sleepy Middle Georgia town.
They came to swim in the 88-degree water that flows from the
springs just east of the downtown business district. Now,
handicapped athletes from around the world come to Warm Springs
because of the accessible facilities at the Roosevelt Warm Springs
Institute for Rehabilitation. This past week, the top eight men's
wheelchair basketball teams in the world have played a round-robin

   GRIFFEY _ It was supposed to be the happiest of homecomings for
Ken Griffey Jr. But the outfielder's first season in his hometown
of Cincinnati hasn't been what he and the Reds had hoped. Griffey
has struggled to hit .250 and feuded at times with the media about

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What my dentist cried out one day after finally removing an
unsuspected fourth nerve from one of my molars comes to mind each
time I try to understand myself as a writer. Do I, as a writer,
have what he called a ``hidden nerve''?
</P>
<P>
   Don't all writers have a hidden nerve, call it a secret chamber,
something irreducibly theirs, which stirs their prose and makes it
tick and turn this way or that, and identifies them, like a
signature, though it lurks far deeper than their style, or their
voice or other telltale antics?
</P>
<P>
   A hidden nerve is what every writer is ultimately about. It's
what all writers wish to uncover when writing about themselves in
this age of the personal memoir. And yet it's also the first thing
every writer learns to sidestep, to disguise, as though this nerve
were a deep and shameful secret that needs to be swathed in many
sheaths. Some don't even know they've screened this nerve from
their own gaze, let alone another's. Some crudely mistake
confession for introspection. Others, more cunning perhaps, open
tempting shortcuts and roundabout passageways, the better to
mislead everyone. Some can't tell whether they're writing to strip
or hide that secret nerve.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea to which category I belong.
</P>
<P>
   As for a sheath, however, I'd spot mine in a second. It is
place. I begin my inward journey by writing about place. Some do so
by writing about love, war, suffering, cruelty, power, God or
country. I write about place, or the memory of place. I write about
a city called Alexandria, which I'm supposed to have loved, and
about other cities that remind me of a vanished world to which I
allegedly wish to return. I write about exile, remembrance and the
passage of time. I write _ so it would seem _ to recapture, to
preserve and return to the past, though I might just as easily be
writing to forget and put that past behind me.
</P>
<P>
   And yet my hidden nerve lies quite elsewhere. To work my way
closer to it, I'd have to write about loss and feeling unhinged in
provisional places where everyone else seems to have a home and a
place, and where everyone knows what he wants, who he is and who
he's likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   My Alexandrians, however, have an unsteady foothold wherever
they stand; they shift time zones, life passions, loyalties and
accents with the unwieldy sense that the real world swims before
them, that they are strangers in it, that they're never quite
entitled to it. Yet peel this second sheath, and you'll find
another.
</P>
<P>
   I may write about place and displacement, but what I'm really
writing about is dispersion, evasion, ambivalence: not so much a
subject as a move in everything I write. I may write about little
parks in New York that remind me of Rome and about tiny squares in
Paris that remind me of New York, and about so many spots in the
world that will ultimately take me back to Alexandria. But this
crisscrossed trajectory is simply my way of showing how scattered
and divided I am about everything else in life.
</P>
<P>
   I may never mention dispersion or evasion by name. But I write
around them. I write away from them. I write from them, the way
some people write around loneliness, guilt, shame, failure,
disloyalty, the better to avoid staring at them.
</P>
<P>
   Ambivalence and dispersion run so deep that I don't know whether
I like the place I've chosen to call my home, any more than I know
whether I like the writer or even the person I am when no one's
looking. And yet the very act of writing has become my way of
finding a space and of building a home for myself, my way of taking
a shapeless, marshy world and firming it up with paper, the way the
Venetians firm up eroded land by driving wooden piles into it.
</P>
<P>
   I write to give my life a form, a narrative, a chronology; and,
for good measure, I seal loose ends with cadenced prose and add
glitter where I know things were quite lusterless. I write to reach
out to the real world, though I know that I write to stay away from
a world that is still too real and never as provisional or
ambivalent as I'd like it to be. In the end it's no longer, and
perhaps never was, the world that I like, but writing about it. I
write to find out who I am; I write to give myself the slip. I
write because I am always at one remove from the world but have
grown to like saying so.
</P>
<P>
   Thus I turn to Alexandria, the mythical home of paradox. But
Alexandria is merely an alibi, a mold, a construct. Writing about
Alexandria helps me give a geographical frame to a psychological
mess. Alexandria is the nickname I give this mess. Ask me to be
intimate, and I'll automatically start writing about Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   I'll write about diaspora and dispossession, but these big words
hold my inner tale together, the way lies help keep the truth
afloat. I use the word exile, not because I think it is the right
term, but because it approximates something far more intimate, more
painful, more awkward: exile from myself, in the sense that I could
so easily have had another life, lived elsewhere, loved others,
been someone else.
</P>
<P>
   If I keep writing about places, it is because some of them are
coded ways of writing about myself: like me, they are always
somewhat dated, isolated, uncertain, thrust precariously in the
middle of larger cities, places that have become not just stand-ins
for Alexandria, but stand-ins for me. I walk past them and think of
me.
</P>
<P>
   Let me turn the clock back 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is October 1968, and I've just arrived in New York City.
Mornings are nippy. It's my second week here. I have found a job in
the mailroom at Lincoln Center. During my rounds at 10:30 every
morning the plaza is totally empty and its fountain silent. Here
every day I am always reminded of my very early childhood, when my
mother would take me for long walks along a quiet plantation road
far beyond our home.
</P>
<P>
   There is something serene and peaceful in this memory. I go out
every morning knowing that as soon as I get a whiff of a nippy
Manhattan breeze, I'll encounter the memory of those plantation
mornings and the hand that held mine along these long walks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward more than two decades. It is 1992. On certain warm
summer days at noon I go to pick up my mother on 60th Street, where
she still works as an office clerk. We buy fruit and sandwiches on
Broadway and walk awhile until we find a shady stone bench at
Lincoln Center's Damrosch Park. At times I bring my 2-year-old son,
who'll scamper about, eating a spoonful, then run back to hide in
between raised flowers beds.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward he and I walk my mother back to her office; we say
goodbye, then head toward Broadway to catch the bus across from a
tiny park where Dante's statue stands. I tell him of Paolo and
Francesca, and of cruel Gianciotto, and of Farinata the exile and
Count Ugolino who starved with his children.
</P>
<P>
   Dante's statue still reminds me of the tales I told my son then;
it reminds me of this park and of other small parks I've since
written about, and of how I felt guilty as a son, letting my mother
hold so menial a job in her 70s, taking her out for a walk when it
was clearly too warm for her, and how, to write a memoir about our
life in Egypt, I had hired a full-time baby-sitter who was only too
glad to have the time off whenever I'd take my son to lunches that
I resented sometimes because they'd steal me from my desk. I think
back to that summer and to my explosive snubs whenever my mother
complained I'd arrived too late again.
</P>
<P>
   One day, after losing my temper and making her cry at lunch, I
went home and wrote about how she would sit in our balcony in
Alexandria smoking a cigarette, and of how the wind had fanned her
hair on the day she came to pick me up at school after someone had
called home saying I had been suspended that day. Together we rode
the tram downtown, naming the stations one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever I look back to those hot afternoons at Lincoln
Center, I see two boys, me and my son, and I see my mother both as
she was during those summer lunches in the early 90s and as I
remembered her on our walks along the plantation road two and a
half decades earlier. But the one mother most clearly limned on
those stone benches at Damrosch Park is the one riding the tram
with me: serene, ebullient, carefree, catching the light of the sun
on her face as she recited the name of the stations to me.
</P>
<P>
   I did not lie about the names of the tram stations, but I did
make up the scene about her coming to school that day. It doesn't
matter. For this scene's hidden nerve lay somewhere else: in my
wanting to stay home and write, in not knowing which mother I was
writing about, in wishing she could be young once more, or that I
might be her young boy again, or that both of us might still be in
Egypt, or that we should be grateful we weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it had something to do with my failure to rescue her
from work that day, which I'd inverted into her rescuing me from
school; or perhaps with my reluctance to believe that an entirely
invented scene could have so cathartic an effect, and that lies do
purge the mind of mnemonic dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. Perhaps writing opens up a parallel universe into
which, one by one, we'll move all of our dearest memories and
rearrange them as we please.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why all memoirists lie. We alter the truth on
paper so as to alter it in fact; we lie about our past and invent
surrogate memories the better to make sense of our lives and live
the life we know was truly ours. We write about our life, not to
see it as it was, but to see it as we wish others might see it, so
we may borrow their gaze and begin to see our life through their
eyes, not ours.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, perhaps, would we begin to understand our life story,
or to tolerate it and ultimately, perhaps, to find it beautiful;
not that any life is ever beautiful, but the measure of a beautiful
life is perhaps one that sees its blemishes, knows they can't be
forgiven and, for all that, learns each day to look the other way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Kwang-I Yu, president of Paracel Inc., will
not say which secretive government agency buys his company's
specialized supercomputers. ``We sell to the federal government,''
he demurs.
</P>
<P>
   But J. Craig Venter, the president of Celera Genomics, is less
circumspect. Paracel's machines, he said, are used by the National
Security Agency, the code-breaking unit that eavesdrops on other
nations. And Venter should know. Celera Genomics, the company that
mapped the human genome, acquired Paracel for nearly $250 million
in stock in June.
</P>
<P>
   Paracel's machines are designed to sift documents rapidly for
particular words, phrases or strings of letters _ an ability of
obvious use to those filtering communications for important
nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   But what attracted Celera is that Paracel's technology is also
good for breaking another code _ the genetic one. The machines are
being snapped up to sift the blizzard of data being generated by
the Human Genome Project and various private genomics efforts.
``They're all character strings,'' said Yu, comparing the gene
sequence to a text message.
</P>
<P>
   The need for Paracel's machines stems from biology's shift from
a ``wet'' science performed in test tubes to at least partly a
``dry'' one, in which much of the crucial analysis is done on
computers. This has given rise to a field called bioinformatics,
the use of computer science in life science.
</P>
<P>
   And bioinformatics must handle volumes of data so huge they
could bring ordinary computers to their knees. A scientist studying
a particular sequence of DNA _ perhaps one comprising several
thousand units represented by the letters, A, T, C and G _ might
search through all three billion letters of the human genome, as
well as the genomes of other animals and bacteria, to find similar
sequences. And genomics companies might want to do thousands of
such searches a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a class of algorithms that would take forever on a
regular computer,'' said Edward Kiruluta, vice president for
research and development at DoubleTwist, a bioinformatics company
in Oakland, Calif. Even with its Paracel machine, he said, some
analyses take weeks. On regular computers, they would take months.
And speed is of the essence, especially in analyzing data from the
publicly financed Human Genome Project, which makes new sequences
available each day to everyone at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the genome data comes out, you want to analyze it as fast
as you can, make the discoveries first and protect the intellectual
property,'' said Martin D. Leach, director for bioinformatics at
CuraGen , which uses genomics to develop drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, of course, are doubling in speed for a given cost
every 18 months or so, according to Moore's Law, named after
Intel's co-founder, Gordon Moore. But the volume of genomic data is
growing even faster, owing to automated DNA-sequencing machines.
GenBank, the government-run public domain database of DNA
sequences, more than doubled in size the last six months to more
than 8.6 billion bases, the fundamental chemical units of the
genetic code that are represented by the letters A, T, C and G.
</P>
<P>
   IBM estimates that the market for hardware and software for life
sciences will grow from $3.5 billion now to more than $9 billion by
2002. Carolyn Kovac, who heads a newly formed life sciences
division at IBM, said biologists had replaced physicists as the
main scientific users of supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems and Compaq Computer are also trying to develop
products for the life sciences, with either supercomputers or
servers linked together in big clusters. And start-ups like Parabon
Computation of Fairfax, Va., and Entropia of San Diego, are trying
to harness tens of thousands of home and business computers to work
on genomics when they would otherwise be idle by distributing
portions of the tasks to these computers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paracel's GeneMatcher machine, however, is especially built for
genomic searchers. It has 7,000 processors arranged in a way best
suited to matching character strings. Yu likened the process to
having each letter of the sequence being studied in a separate
processor strung along the inside of a hose. The database to be
searched flows over these letters like water through a hose, at the
rate of 30 million characters a second, and each processor sees
whether it has a match as each letter flows by.
</P>
<P>
   With a list price of $360,000, GeneMatcher would be too much for
general-purpose computing. But for the task for which it was
designed, it can be up to 1,000 times as fast as a Pentium-based
computer, making it cost-effective, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for machines like GeneMatcher, which are called
genomics accelerators, is tiny. Paracel sells only one or two a
month, so few in fact that it assembles its machines by hand in one
room of a high-rise office here.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It says it has more than 30 customers, including drug companies
like Novartis, Bayer and AstraZeneca, as well as some biotechnology
and bioinformatics companies. No customer has more than two
machines, other than Celera, which bought four last year.
</P>
<P>
   But sales are growing. Paracel, which was privately held before
its acquisition by Celera, had sales of $14.2 million in 1999, up
from $5.9 million the year before. Yu said Paracel was not
profitable because of investments but had been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   GeneMatcher accounted for $5.2 million of Paracel's 1999 sales,
and genomics software $1 million. Textfinder machines, used by the
government agency and a few other customers to search text
databases, accounted for $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paracel's main competitor, TimeLogic, based in Incline Village,
Nev., had sales of $3 million in 1999 and was profitable, according
to its chief executive, James W. Lindelien. Sales of its DeCypher
accelerator rose 350 percent in 1999 and should rise 50 percent
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compugen, an Israeli company that just went public, also sells
an accelerator but is de-emphasizing that business.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think that conventional server farms can do the job
less expensively than genomics accelerators can and can also be
used for other tasks. The National Center for Biotechnology
Information, which runs GenBank, uses about 140 conventional
computers that are tied together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, history is not on the side of dedicated hardware.
Machines designed for artificial intelligence, computer-aided
design, database storage and graphics were all eventually replaced
by general-purpose computers, which became fast enough to handle
those jobs and cost less because of their huge production volumes.
The huge volumes also provide more money for research and
development, allowing general purpose processors to improve at a
faster rate than specialized ones.
</P>
<P>
   Paracel's acquisition by Celera will give the company more
financial resources to help it keep up. But some bio-informatics
experts were shocked that Celera would spend so much money for such
a tiny, niche company.
</P>
<P>
   But Venter of Celera said the Paracel machines would be
important. ``There's no university or pharmaceutical company that
has the computing capability they need to deal with our data or
anyone else's genomic data,'' he said.  &QL; 
(OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celera must persuade companies to pay for its genomic data when
GenBank offers much of the same human genome data free. One way to
compete is to offer more and better data. But another, Venter said,
is to use the Paracel machines to offer Celera customers faster
searches than they could get using GenBank.
</P>
<P>
   Paracel technology can also be used to compare the sequence of
amino acids that make up a protein and could become part of a
protein analysis machine that is being designed by Applied
Biosystems, Celera's sister company. Both Celera and Applied Bio,
formerly known as PE Biosystems, are subsidiaries of the PE Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Celera has one of the largest computer centers in the world,
costing more than $50 million. It is mainly made up of Compaq
servers. By May, Celera had bought only $1.9 million of Paracel
machines. But Venter said that while the Compaq machines were used
to assemble the genome sequence in the correct order, the Paracel
machines would be used to search the database.
</P>
<P>
   PE and Paracel have long been partners. In 1996 PE bought a 14
percent stake in Paracel for $4.5 million. Yu himself owned about
17 percent of Paracel, giving him Celera stock worth about $35
million when the acquisition closed in June.  &QL; 
(OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yu, 50, grew up in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia and came to
the United States for college. After earning his doctorate in
computer science from the California Institute of Technology, he
joined TRW, the defense contractor, where he worked on development
of the text-searching chip. In 1992 TRW spun out Paracel to
commercialize the technology and now retains only 13 percent of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition by Celera will benefit Paracel, but it could
also cause genomics companies that compete with Celera to avoid
buying from Paracel. TimeLogic is already playing up this factor in
its sales pitch. And to counter Paracel's alliance with Celera,
TimeLogic is expected to announce soon that its machines will be
distributed by Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said he did not think customers would desert Paracel. And
Paracel will obtain information from Celera that could help it
design better machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to be part of something that's the definitive
provider of tools to mine that information,'' he said. ``I can get
there faster by merging with Celera.''

THE NEWEST MEMBER OF GORE'S CAMPAIGN TEAM COMES FULL CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Conn.)   By ROBIN TONER    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stan Greenberg, who was President Clinton's
pollster throughout his long march to the White House, is back in
the fray of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The former Yale political science professor, a longtime
interpreter of the political yearnings of the white middle class,
quietly signed on with Vice President Al Gore's campaign five weeks
ago. It represented a certain closure: Greenberg had left Clinton
after the debacle of the 1994 election, when the Democrats lost the
House and the Senate and Clinton summarily replaced him with Dick
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to make a change, given the '94 losses, and he made
the change,'' said Greenberg, with the careful equanimity of a man
who landed well and wants you to know it. ``It worked out fine. I'm
very happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only question is why I'm so foolish to come back and do
this,'' he added with a short laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Since he left Clinton, Greenberg has worked on campaigns around
the world, developing a kind of specialty in helping center-left
parties return to power. He worked for Tony Blair's 1997 campaign
for prime minister of Britain; Blair's election broke 18 years of
Conservative Party rule. He also worked for Gerhard Schroeder's
1998 campaign for chancellor of Germany; his victory returned
Social Democrats to power for the first time in 16 years, And last
year, he worked for the campaign of Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each battle has its uniqueness,'' Greenberg said. ``But each
of these parties has struggles in the postindustrial period, and
they're all trying to learn from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, 55, does not really want to talk about the strategy
of the Gore campaign, which has taken a markedly populist turn in
recent weeks. (A populist turn that escalated, by the way, with
Greenberg's arrival, although the Gore campaign dismisses the
connection.)
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg also dismisses the idea that there is a clear tension
between that economic populism and the ``new Democrat'' philosophy,
willing to break with liberal orthodoxy on issues like trade and
welfare reform, that that was championed by Clinton and Gore in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's a new Democrat,'' Greenberg said. ``He's always been
a new Democrat. His message derives from who he is and what he's
been saying in his political life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pollster contends that Gore's candidacy comes at a new
stage of American politics. Clinton's challenge was to deal with
the Democratic Party's past, to convince disaffected voters that
the Democrats were not ``a big-spending party that's culturally
elitist,'' Greenberg said. Gore's challenge is to build on that
credibility and show that Democrats ``can manage the future,''
Greenberg said, modernizing institutions like Medicare and the
public school system wisely and carefully, and using the surplus
for great national needs.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Greenberg asserts, George W. Bush's huge tax
cut proposal represents a failure of vision: ``That we're going to
take the surplus and give it to individuals, now, to spend it, now,
with no sense of what it would mean for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Sen. John McCain, Bush's former rival for the
Republican presidential nomination, Greenberg added, ``McCain
understood this moment much better than Bush does.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg has spent much of his professional life trying to
synthesize the various themes of the Democratic Party and reconnect
it to the middle-class and working-class voters it lost in the '70s
and '80s. One of two sons of a bookkeeper and what he called a
``self-taught environmental engineer,'' Greenberg grew up in
Washington and Silver Spring, Md., a product of public schools and
the middle-class neighborhoods he studies so intensely today.
</P>
<P>
   He got his doctorate from Harvard, with a dissertation on the
politics of poor neighborhoods, and eventually joined the faculty
at Yale. One of his early academic passions was South Africa _ he
worked on Nelson Mandela's presidential campaign in 1994 _ but he
inexorably moved into American politics in the early 1980s. After
the Democrats' landslide defeat in 1984, the United Auto Workers
and the Michigan Democratic Party hired him to study Macomb County,
Mich., and determine why what was once the most Democratic suburb
in America gave Ronald Reagan 67 percent of its vote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He determined that middle-class voters believed that the
Democratic Party had abandoned them, was using their hard-earned
tax dollars on ``giveaway'' programs that did not benefit them, and
was out of touch with their values. Clinton, whose thinking was
headed in the same direction, hooked up with Greenberg in the late
1980s, and they soon began a campaign that revolved around ``the
forgotten middle class,'' ``the people who work hard and play by
the rules,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg says he continues to have good relations with Clinton,
despite their break after 1994. When asked his opinion of
Greenberg, Dick Morris, now a commentator and president of
Voter.com, said: ``I'll quote President Clinton to you _ `He never
told me what to do. He would always tell me on the one hand, on the
other hand, but never tell me what to do.' '' (Greenberg said he
had no comment on that.)
</P>
<P>
   Married to Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., Greenberg has a home in
New Haven, Conn., and a town house on Capitol Hill. He has three
children by a first marriage; one is Anna Greenberg, a political
scientist at Harvard, with whom he recent co-authored an essay on
the Democrats' need to promote ``family-centered values.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said he did not worry that his opponents would think
he had gone global, lost touch with the nuances of American
politics. ``I'll leave it to them to figure out what I bring to the
table,'' he said. But he dismissed the notion that the Bush team,
clannish and focused, was the dangerous equivalent of the winning
Clinton team of 1992. ``They may have too tight a team and maybe
too mechanical a vision of how to get him elected president,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual moment in American politics, he says _ one he
clearly did not want to miss.

FIVE HOSTAGES RELEASED IN PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Relieved, bitter and still frightened for
their companions, five foreign hostages were released by kidnappers
in the southern Philippines on Sunday for a reported $5 million
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The releases were a half-step toward ending a strange
four-month-long standoff in which the tiny island of Jolo has been
flooded with ransom money both for the hostages and for a dozen
journalists who were seized and then released while trying to
interview them.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those freed Sunday were from the original group of 21
people kidnapped on April 23 at a nearby diving resort in Malaysia.
The fifth was a French television reporter who had been taken
captive when she trekked into the jungle to film them on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other Westerners remained hostages on the island,
including the last five kidnapped in Malaysia and two other members
of the same French television crew. A Filipino worker at the diving
resort was also being held, as well as 12 Filipino evangelical
Christians who walked into the mountains two months ago to pray
with the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, a small band of gunmen calling themselves Abu
Sayyaf and saying that they were Muslim separatists, had already
received $5.5 million in ransom for 11 hostages who were released
earlier, the Philippine military said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the government insists that no ransom has been paid,
but large amounts of cash are known to have been transferred to the
rebels. Kidnapping is a cottage industry in the southern
Philippines, and payoffs _ commonly described as ``room and board''
_ are part of the normal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers seem to have made a point on Sunday of dividing
the hostages, releasing a wife but not her husband, a father but
not his son, and a woman but not her boyfriend. The gunmen are
demanding more ransom for the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The chief government negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said he
hoped the other hostages would be freed in the coming days but
added, ``There's still a lot of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier statement from the kidnappers said the partial
release Sunday was intended to discourage the government from a
military reprisal. It said further releases would depend on
additional payments.
</P>
<P>
   There was little joy among the hostages released Sunday as they
arrived by helicopter at the southern Philippine city of Zamboanga.
Some were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel relieved but we are not happy, because there are still
people left behind,'' said Marie Moarbes, 33, a French-Lebanese
woman. On videotapes taken during the captivity, she had been the
strong one, comforting her companions as they trembled at the sound
of distant gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Still angry, as he had appeared on the videotapes, Werner
Wallert, 57, a German, said: ``My son is still there. You don't
expect me to be happy.'' An emissary said the father and son had
embraced and wept Sunday, each insisting that the other be the one
to leave. Wallert's wife, Renate, had been the first of the
hostages to be released, on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The others freed Sunday were a French woman, Sonia Wendling, and
a South African, Monique Strydom, as well as the television
reporter, Maryse Burgot. They were to be flown to Libya, which was
the broker for the release. Libya was also reportedly paying the
ransom, which officials described as development aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Libyans, we know what we are doing,'' said the Libyan
ambassador, Saleem Adam, dismissing an accusation that his country
was trying to polish its international image by acting as
go-between. ``This is a humanitarian mission. It has no other
motivation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Six Malaysians from the diving resort were freed earlier. One
French man, one South African, one German and two Finns, as well as
the Filipino resort worker, are still being held in connection with
the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have been difficult and seemingly amateurish,
with the Philippine side making sometimes contradictory and
counterproductive public statements and the kidnappers squabbling
among themselves, changing their demands and backing out of
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   A planned release was canceled two weeks ago when the gunmen
said they were afraid they would be attacked, and demanded more
money.
</P>
<P>
   There was another cancellation last week after two members of
the gang were arrested at a local bank when they tried to convert
$240,000 into Philippine pesos. The release proceeded Sunday after
the government released the two men, though not their money.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the earlier ransom money is reported to have been spent
on weapons, as the Abu Sayyaf band, originally numbering perhaps
200, has vigorously recruited new members to help guard the
hostages and secure them against a huge military deployment.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators say they have assured the gunmen that they
will not be attacked, government officials have predicted strong
military action once the last of the hostages is freed.

``immigration enterprise zone,'' and the ideas range from seeking
an exemption to immigration quotas to urging companies to recruit
aborad. By Pam Belluck.

AT LONG LAST, A BAHAMIAN BAND HAS A HIT ON ITS HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was 7, Isaiah Taylor began having dreams that he
compares to the visions God sent Joseph in the Bible. His own
vision was of leading a group of musicians from his home in the
Bahamas to worldwide success.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, Taylor's dream could not have been further
from reality. He was 50, and his group, the Baha Men, had been
together in various incarnations for over two decades, merging pop
and funk with traditional Bahamian junkanoo music. The band had
been dropped from two major labels in the United States, most
recently from Mercury Records as a casualty in the merger of
Universal Music and Polygram. And there was a further blow when its
lead singer, Nehemiah Hield, left the group.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when pop music is ruled by the fresh-faced teen-age
dreams of Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys, it did not seem
likely that an aging Bahamian band without a major label deal would
have a grain of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the world of pop music is strange, and no one knows why some
bands get second, third and fourth chances, while others do not get
even one. As much as music executives like to think they have the
market sewn up, popular music follows no one's rules but its own.
And this summer Taylor's childhood dream became a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Baha Men's single ``Who Let the Dogs Out,'' released and
distributed independently, is turning into the summer anthem of
2000, say radio programmers like Ed Lambert of KISS-FM in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Baha Men may be the first casualty of the Universal merger
to come back with a hit through an independent label. And the tale
of the making of that hit is one that crosses borders and spans
generations, changing the fortunes of a Trinidadian soca singer, a
Bahamian junkanoo band and a record executive who would not give
up.
</P>
<P>
   With its signature guttural barking and breezy island rapping,
the song can be heard blasting everywhere from passing convertibles
to baseball games. As is usually the case with such instant hits,
some find the song irresistible, others find it obnoxious, and many
find it both.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week viewers of Nickelodeon chose it as their video
of the day over 'N Sync's ``It's Gonna Be Me.'' On other days on
Nickelodeon the Baha Men have beaten out Britney Spears, the
Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter and other teen-age idols. Since its
release in late July the band's album has been on fire. In its
first week it was not even on the pop charts; by last week, it had
climbed to No. 59 from 103, and it is likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the great Cinderella story,'' said Steve Greenberg, who
put out the new Baha Men album as the first and only release so far
on his own independent label, S-Curve. Greenberg had signed the
group to two different record companies _ Atlantic and Mercury _ in
the last decade, with no success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song's been floating around for two years, the band has
been floating around in some version for 30 years, and the label's
12 weeks old,'' Greenberg said. ``It's the most unlikely hit ever.
I couldn't even get arrested with this band on a major label.''
</P>
<P>
   If the band's story offers any lesson, it is that there is no
such thing as a final chapter in a pop music career. Whether it is
Santana reaping his greatest success 30 years after his prime, the
rap producer Dr. Dre engineering his own comeback years after
hip-hop advanced without him, or the Baha Men becoming a
teeny-bopper sensation long after having been written off by the
music business, the sweetest prizes in popular music sometimes go
to those who stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes way back, man,'' Taylor said of his band's success.
``God gave me the dream, and I actually had visions of doing all
these things as a kid. When I sat down with my band and told them
this, some of them probably thought I was crazy. But now they all
see it coming to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that as a child he had no interest in music and
would skip music classes in school. But he could not escape his
destiny, he said, and he formed the Baha Men in the early 1980s as
High Voltage, a collective of local junkanoo, rhythm-and-blues and
disco musicians who had already been playing for years.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg first heard High Voltage in 1991. He was working as a
talent scout at Big Beat/Atlantic records when a Bahamian
songwriter gave him a High Voltage cassette.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg changed the band's name to the Baha Men and released
two of its albums on Big Beat. When Greenberg left the label for
Mercury during an executive power struggle, Big Beat dropped the
Baha Men.
</P>
<P>
   At Mercury, where he signed successful bands like Hanson,
Greenberg stuck with the Baha Men as a pet project. He released two
more of the band's records, the last of which sold fewer than 700
copies, which is not only a failure in the music business but an
embarrassment as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a standing joke in the industry that every time I
came to a new label, the first band I'd sign would be the Baha
Men,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time in Trinidad a soca star named Anslem Douglas
was writing a song for the 1998 carnival. At previous carnivals,
Douglas said, there were songs in which men made coarse references
to women. Davis decided to create a way for women to respond and
wrote a song around a local street cry, ``Who let the dogs out!''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always calling guys `dogs' anyway,'' Douglas said.
``This was a way to legitimize it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flirtatious, suggestive song begins with a party setting in
which the men start making passes at the women, who bark in
response, ``Get back, you flea-infested mongrel.''
</P>
<P>
   The song became a hit in the Caribbean and eventually found its
way onto Greenberg's desk when a musician stopped by his office at
Mercury with a version he had recorded himself. ``That version was
horrible,'' Greenberg said. ``But the song stayed in my head for
two years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After the sale of Polygram's music holdings to Seagram, which
owns Universal, Greenberg left his job to write a novel, and the
Baha Men were dropped from the label. But Greenberg could not get
the song out of his head. He wrote in his diary last December:
``I'm going to record that song, `Who Let the Dogs Out,' with the
Baha Men, and we're going to have a worldwide hit. I'm sure of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Taylor lost Hield, who quit to pursue solo
projects and tour as a backup vocalist with Lenny Kravitz, who is
part-Bahamian. The band held open auditions in Nassau and ended up
with not one replacement singer but three.
</P>
<P>
   One was Hield's nephew, Omerit Hield. ``I was working as a
teller at a bank,'' he said. ``Being in the Baha Men was something
I always wanted to do, but I never thought I'd have a chance. When
I went to the audition, there were at least 75 people there.'' He
got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Then Taylor almost turned down the song that would catapult the
band to success. ``This is going to sound crazy,'' Taylor said.
``But when Steve Greenberg said `Who Let the Dogs Out' would be a
good song to cover, I said, `I don't want to do that song.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Taylor's mind the song was too popular in the Caribbean and
too specific to the region for audiences in other countries to
understand. But he finally relented. After recording the song using
a number of different singers, backing tracks and studios, the band
finally got it right by recording in the home of its producer,
Michael Mangini.
</P>
<P>
   The barking sounds, Hield said, came naturally. ``If you go to
Nassau, you'll see dogs running around in the streets. So we
listened to them, and it was easy to imitate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg started his S-Curve label and made distribution and
promotion deals with the independent companies Red and Artemis,
owned by his former boss at Mercury, Danny Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg played the song for a friend, Winston Simone, who runs
a music publishing company, Desmone Music, with, among others, the
songwriter Desmond Child. ``I said, `Oh my god, this is a smash!'
when I heard it,'' Simone said.
</P>
<P>
   He tracked down the writer, Douglas, at his aunt's house and
bought his entire catalog of songs, secured a publishing deal for
him and helped place ``Who Let the Dogs Out'' on the ``Rugrats in
Paris'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably stands to be a millionaire if things keep going
this way,'' Simone said of Douglas. ``In the middle of the night
sometimes I worry, `What's he going to do with his money?' He's
going to have a big hit, and I want to make sure he's always going
to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said not to worry. ``It's every writer's dream to be
published,'' he said excitedly. ``It takes the financial strain
off, the mental strain off. Finally, my ship has come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trinidadian newspapers are already pinning their crossover
hopes for regional soca music on Douglas' lapels, with one
newspaper declaring that ``the future of soca is cash register
success on the Billboard charts, and Anslem's foot is in the
door.'' Douglas, however, is looking forward to new challenges. He
said he was awestruck when Simone suggested that he work on a song
with Child for the new Ricky Martin album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been up there with the soca stars like Super Blue,
but now I'm seeing my career take a whole new turn,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Life has changed for the Baha Men, too. Hield summed up the last
month most succinctly: ``I've never barked so much in my life.''

A TENSE POWER STRUGGLE SPILLS OVER INTO LEBANON ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN KIFNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONSOURIEH, Lebanon _ Confident as an old-time Chicago ward
boss, Walid Khatter, Interior Minister Michel Murr's man in this
Greek Orthodox village, stood in the doorway of his polling station
Sunday afternoon and predicted the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have around 1,000 voters in this district. There will be
about 800 for the Michel Murr ticket,'' he said, adding
dismissively, ``about 200 for the others.''
</P>
<P>
   How could he be so sure? a visitor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we know,'' he said with a shrug and a grin, opening a hand
bedecked with three huge gold rings to show a stack of palm cards
listing Murr's slate of candidates. An aide materialized from the
crush of more than a dozen Murr campaign workers _ the whole area
around the polling station was festooned with portraits of Murr _
with numbers scratched on a sheet of paper and nodded assent.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by reminders of their tribal politics, Lebanese went
to the polls on Sunday in the beginning of a two-stage
parliamentary election overshadowed by Syrian dominance and a
bitter struggle between the current government and its critics.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Christian heartland of Mt. Lebanon, among the
suburban sprawl running up the mountains from Beirut, the focus was
on the battle between a slate headed by the powerful Murr, one of
Syria's biggest supporters, and an opposition slate headed by
Nassib Lahoud, a wealthy businessman and former ambassador to the
United States, who is a cousin of the president, but nonetheless a
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has come under fierce criticism from the opposition because
of his multiple roles as a candidate running for re-election, a
staunch supporter of the government, and ultimately the man in
charge of running the elections. With his government post, he
controls police and internal security forces, the granting or
withholding of various licenses and patronage over a huge number of
public employees.
</P>
<P>
   His power was evident on Sunday. Entrances to many of the
polling places were surrounded by election workers in baby blue
T-shirts and baseball hats. The Arabic legend on the T-shirts read
simply: ``Michel Murr.''
</P>
<P>
   Every seat in Parliament is assigned to one of the country's 17
officially recognized religions, minutely derived from a census
taken in 1932. (There has never been one since for fear of
political upset.) In the voting on Sunday, citizens went into
separate rooms in the polling places, divided both by men and women
and by each religious sect in a district: Maronite Catholic,
Armenian Catholic, Sunni Moslem and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Khattar's district here is so homogeneous that there are only
two sets of voting rooms: Greek Orthodox and, he said,
``assorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafik Hariri, the multibillionaire builder trying to make a
comeback as prime minister, is locked in a bitter struggle with
President Emile Lahoud, who has unleashed much of the government's
power against him, including hours of ill-supported accusations and
ridicule on state television.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has become so intense in recent days that the new
Syrian President, Bashar Assad, has summoned leading Lebanese
political leaders to Damascus, and Syria's long effective regent in
Lebanon, Maj. Gen Ghazi Kanaan, has been meeting with them here in
an effort to restore calm.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, 63 of the Parliament's 128 seats were at
stake in three districts: Northern Lebanon, largely Christian, but
with a big Sunni Moslem population in Tripoli; the Metn, the
mountains north and east of Beirut that are the Christian
heartland; and the Chouf, traditional home of the Druze. Beirut,
and the largely Shi'ite areas of the Bekaa Valley and southern
Lebanon, vote next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Taif agreement of 1989, which helped end the bloody
15-year civil war in which some 150,000 people died and much of the
country was destroyed, the president is to name the prime minister
supported by blocks forming a simple majority in Parliament after
``binding negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the voting seemed to go smoothly, there were
troubles throughout the day in Bourj Hammoud, an Armenian ghetto
near the port long dominated by its ethnic Tashnak Party, which is
supporting Murr. In a rare move, Lahoud's opposition slate put up a
candidate for an Armenian Orthodox seat in the Metn district
usually held by Tashnak.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition candidate, Raffi Madoyan, was attacked and beaten
twice during the day by Tashnak supporters, and local television
cameramen filmed men smashing windows in his fleeing car with
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud's political adviser, Joe Bahout, said the opposition had
hoped to pick up between 8,000 and 10,000 votes in Bourj Hammoud
and was worried that Tashnak supporters were ``trying to create a
panic by physical violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning in Bourj Hammoud, an opposition poll
watcher, Wassim Lahoud, stood in frustration outside a polling
place at the Mar Youssef church, complaining that his crew had not
been given their proper credentials to go inside, and that Murr's
supporters had illegally set up a computer to track voters inside
another polling station. Indeed the computer operation so enraged
the opposition that one of its candidates, former Information
Minister Michel Samaha, stormed into the municipal building and
turned the table over.
</P>
<P>
   Murr turned up at that polling station toward midday in a
caravan of police vehicles, greeted warmly by all the election
workers inside with hugs, handshakes and a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' he replied in French when asked about charges
of vote rigging. ``Do you see anyone who is pressuring?''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, scores of blue-shirted Murr campaign workers
had set up their computer operation again on a series of tables
under a white sun umbrella inside the police lines and were busily
checking the voters in.

CLINTON URGES NIGERIA TO ACT ON AIDS AND ITS PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ Seeking to breaking down the taboos shrouding a
disease that has devastated Africa, President Clinton on Sunday
urged Nigerians to show the same resolve they displayed in enduring
decades of dictatorship in confronting what he called the
``tyranny'' of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, standing beside a man infected with the same virus that
afflicts some 24 million Africans and has become the continent's
leading killer, applauded Nigeria's efforts to control the spread
of AIDS. But he offered a blunt reminder to Africans that AIDS is
preventable _ if people will only speak frankly about how it is
spread, and then act.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is 100 percent preventable _ if we are willing to deal
with it openly and honestly,'' Clinton said. ``In every country, in
any culture, it is difficult, painful, at the very least,
embarrassing to talk about the issues involved with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a
child die of AIDS who could have lived if the rest of us had done
our part?'' the president added. ``Is it harder to talk about than
to comfort a child whose mother has died? We have to break the
silence about how this disease spreads and how to prevent it. And
we need to fight AIDS, not people with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks presented a bold challenge, not only to
Nigerians but to all in Africa, where health workers and experts
have lamented that the social stigma surrounding the disease and an
absence of public education and discussion of its dangers and
impact have contributed greatly to the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced some increased aid for Nigeria's fight _ $20
million to control the spread of AIDS, malaria and polio, and a
plan to include AIDS education as part of the military training
that U.S. troops are giving to Nigerian peacekeepers headed to
nearby Sierra Leone, which has been ravaged by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience of young people, religious leaders and
women leaders that Nigerians, despite the much-heralded
introduction of civilian rule last year, will never be free until
they bring infectious diseases under control. An estimated 5.4
percent of Nigeria's population of 114 million _ about 2.6 million
people _ are currently infected with AIDS.

   ``I am amazed at the courage of the people of Nigeria in
struggling against the oppression that you endured for too long
until you got your democracy,'' Clinton said. ``I urge you now to
show that same kind of courage to beat the tyranny of this disease
so you can keep your democracy alive for all the children of
Nigeria and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, frustrated by the lack of action by some African
governments, have praised Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo for
making the fight against AIDS a priority. But the Nigerian
president stressed Sunday that it was a disease that his country
could not battle alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a disease you can say if you eradicate it in Nigeria
it is eradicated for good,'' said Obasanjo. ``Those from Nigeria
who go outside and have sexual relations with those who have
HIV-AIDS or have blood transfusions with them will bring it back.
We don't see it as a Nigerian disease. We see it as a world disease
that is ravaging Africa most.''
</P>
<P>
   Africans have reacted coolly to the United States' offer of $1
billion in annual loans to finance the purchase of anti-AIDS drugs
in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that the approach would add to
countries' already heavy debt burden of some $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Clinton's two-day visit here, Obasanjo has repeatedly
raised the issue of debt relief, encouraging the wealthy nations of
the world to forgive the large sums amassed by previous African
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, elected 15 months ago as part of Nigeria's transition
to democracy, did not directly address the U.S. AIDS plan. But in
toasting Clinton at a state dinner on Saturday night, he made a
plea for financial relief from the United States and other wealthy
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we cannot achieve our desire for economic
development if we continue to bleed from the gushing wounds of an
ever-penetrating debt repayment lance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in addressing business leaders Sunday, said that past
leaders of Nigeria _ a country that has suffered under callous and
corrupt dictators for most of its modern history _ had squandered
the country's riches and that leaders now must be careful to focus
any debt relief on improving the lives of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Clinton toured a small African village, walking
through muddy paths past huts that were hooked up to electricity
only month ago. Guided by Mohammedu Baba, the chief of the village,
Ushafa, Clinton entered a small medical clinic that had been
stocked with supplies by the State Department just the day before.
</P>
<P>
   A clinic worker told the president that the clinic had treated
234 cases of malaria this year. There are no HIV cases, villagers
said, although nearby villages have cases and surrounded urban
areas are heavily affected.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance Clinton announced Sunday included $2 million in
the current budget to produce insecticide-treated bed nets to keep
malaria-infected mosquitoes at bay, as well as $9 million in new
money to battle polio and $10 million more to assist Nigeria's AIDS
fight. The White House has requested a $100 million increase, to
$342 million, in international AIDS financing in the 2001 fiscal
year budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just Nigeria's fight, or Africa's fight,'' Clinton
said. ``It is America's fight and the world's fight too.'' The
president's remarks heartened John Ibekwe, who heads an
organization in Nigeria for people living with AIDS. ``With you as
an advocate on our side, governments in Africa will do more than
they are doing,'' Ibekwe said in introducing the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves for Tanzania on Monday for an update from
former South African President Nelson Mandela on the Burundi peace
talks, began his day at a Baptist church in Abuja, where he heard
the Rev. Israel Akanji preach on the parable of the good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbers have come. Bandits have come. We have been left
wounded, bleeding and dying,'' Akanji said of his country's
struggles against its own leaders. ``Is there a good Samaritan
passing by?''

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Relieved, bitter and still frightened for
their companions, five foreign hostages were released by kidnappers
in the southern Philippines on Sunday for a reported $5 million
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The releases were a half-step toward ending a strange
four-month-long standoff in which the tiny island of Jolo has been
flooded with ransom money both for the hostages and for a dozen
journalists who were seized and then released while trying to
interview them.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those freed Sunday were from the original group of 21
people kidnapped on April 23 at a nearby diving resort in Malaysia.
The fifth was a French television reporter who had been taken
captive when she trekked into the jungle to film them on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other Westerners remained hostages on the island,
including the last five kidnapped in Malaysia and two other members
of the same French television crew. A Filipino worker at the diving
resort was also being held, as well as 12 Filipino evangelical
Christians who walked into the mountains two months ago to pray
with the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, a small band of gunmen calling themselves Abu
Sayyaf and saying that they were Muslim separatists, had already
received $5.5 million in ransom for 11 hostages who were released
earlier, the Philippine military said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the government insists that no ransom has been paid,
but large amounts of cash are known to have been transferred to the
rebels. Kidnapping is a cottage industry in the southern
Philippines, and payoffs _ commonly described as ``room and board''
_ are part of the normal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers seem to have made a point on Sunday of dividing
the hostages, releasing a wife but not her husband, a father but
not his son, and a woman but not her boyfriend. The gunmen are
demanding more ransom for the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The chief government negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said he
hoped the other hostages would be freed in the coming days but
added, ``There's still a lot of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier statement from the kidnappers said the partial
release Sunday was intended to discourage the government from a
military reprisal. It said further releases would depend on
additional payments.
</P>
<P>
   There was little joy among the hostages released Sunday as they
arrived by helicopter at the southern Philippine city of Zamboanga.
Some were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel relieved but we are not happy, because there are still
people left behind,'' said Marie Moarbes, 33, a French-Lebanese
woman. On videotapes taken during the captivity, she had been the
strong one, comforting her companions as they trembled at the sound
of distant gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Still angry, as he had appeared on the videotapes, Werner
Wallert, 57, a German, said: ``My son is still there. You don't
expect me to be happy.'' An emissary said the father and son had
embraced and wept Sunday, each insisting that the other be the one
to leave. Wallert's wife, Renate, had been the first of the
hostages to be released, on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The others freed Sunday were a French woman, Sonia Wendling, and
a South African, Monique Strydom, as well as the television
reporter, Maryse Burgot. They were to be flown to Libya, which was
the broker for the release. Libya was also reportedly paying the
ransom, which officials described as development aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Libyans, we know what we are doing,'' said the Libyan
ambassador, Saleem Adam, dismissing an accusation that his country
was trying to polish its international image by acting as
go-between. ``This is a humanitarian mission. It has no other
motivation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Six Malaysians from the diving resort were freed earlier. One
French man, one South African, one German and two Finns, as well as
the Filipino resort worker, are still being held in connection with
the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have been difficult and seemingly amateurish,
with the Philippine side making sometimes contradictory and
counterproductive public statements and the kidnappers squabbling
among themselves, changing their demands and backing out of
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   A planned release was canceled two weeks ago when the gunmen
said they were afraid they would be attacked, and demanded more
money.
</P>
<P>
   There was another cancellation last week after two members of
the gang were arrested at a local bank when they tried to convert
$240,000 into Philippine pesos. The release proceeded Sunday after
the government released the two men, though not their money.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the earlier ransom money is reported to have been spent
on weapons, as the Abu Sayyaf band, originally numbering perhaps
200, has vigorously recruited new members to help guard the
hostages and secure them against a huge military deployment.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators say they have assured the gunmen that they
will not be attacked, government officials have predicted strong
military action once the last of the hostages is freed.

   MONSOURIEH, Lebanon _ Confident as an old-time Chicago ward
boss, Walid Khatter, Interior Minister Michel Murr's man in this
Greek Orthodox village, stood in the doorway of his polling station
Sunday afternoon and predicted the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have around 1,000 voters in this district. There will be
about 800 for the Michel Murr ticket,'' he said, adding
dismissively, ``about 200 for the others.''
</P>
<P>
   How could he be so sure? a visitor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we know,'' he said with a shrug and a grin, opening a hand
bedecked with three huge gold rings to show a stack of palm cards
listing Murr's slate of candidates. An aide materialized from the
crush of more than a dozen Murr campaign workers _ the whole area
around the polling station was festooned with portraits of Murr _
with numbers scratched on a sheet of paper and nodded assent.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by reminders of their tribal politics, Lebanese went
to the polls on Sunday in the beginning of a two-stage
parliamentary election overshadowed by Syrian dominance and a
bitter struggle between the current government and its critics.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Christian heartland of Mt. Lebanon, among the
suburban sprawl running up the mountains from Beirut, the focus was
on the battle between a slate headed by the powerful Murr, one of
Syria's biggest supporters, and an opposition slate headed by
Nassib Lahoud, a wealthy businessman and former ambassador to the
United States, who is a cousin of the president, but nonetheless a
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has come under fierce criticism from the opposition because
of his multiple roles as a candidate running for re-election, a
staunch supporter of the government, and ultimately the man in
charge of running the elections. With his government post, he
controls police and internal security forces, the granting or
withholding of various licenses and patronage over a huge number of
public employees.
</P>
<P>
   His power was evident on Sunday. Entrances to many of the
polling places were surrounded by election workers in baby blue
T-shirts and baseball hats. The Arabic legend on the T-shirts read
simply: ``Michel Murr.''
</P>
<P>
   Every seat in Parliament is assigned to one of the country's 17
officially recognized religions, minutely derived from a census
taken in 1932. (There has never been one since for fear of
political upset.) In the voting on Sunday, citizens went into
separate rooms in the polling places, divided both by men and women
and by each religious sect in a district: Maronite Catholic,
Armenian Catholic, Sunni Moslem and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Khattar's district here is so homogeneous that there are only
two sets of voting rooms: Greek Orthodox and, he said,
``assorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafik Hariri, the multibillionaire builder trying to make a
comeback as prime minister, is locked in a bitter struggle with
President Emile Lahoud, who has unleashed much of the government's
power against him, including hours of ill-supported accusations and
ridicule on state television.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has become so intense in recent days that the new
Syrian President, Bashar Assad, has summoned leading Lebanese
political leaders to Damascus, and Syria's long effective regent in
Lebanon, Maj. Gen Ghazi Kanaan, has been meeting with them here in
an effort to restore calm.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, 63 of the Parliament's 128 seats were at
stake in three districts: Northern Lebanon, largely Christian, but
with a big Sunni Moslem population in Tripoli; the Metn, the
mountains north and east of Beirut that are the Christian
heartland; and the Chouf, traditional home of the Druze. Beirut,
and the largely Shi'ite areas of the Bekaa Valley and southern
Lebanon, vote next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Taif agreement of 1989, which helped end the bloody
15-year civil war in which some 150,000 people died and much of the
country was destroyed, the president is to name the prime minister
supported by blocks forming a simple majority in Parliament after
``binding negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the voting seemed to go smoothly, there were
troubles throughout the day in Bourj Hammoud, an Armenian ghetto
near the port long dominated by its ethnic Tashnak Party, which is
supporting Murr. In a rare move, Lahoud's opposition slate put up a
candidate for an Armenian Orthodox seat in the Metn district
usually held by Tashnak.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition candidate, Raffi Madoyan, was attacked and beaten
twice during the day by Tashnak supporters, and local television
cameramen filmed men smashing windows in his fleeing car with
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud's political adviser, Joe Bahout, said the opposition had
hoped to pick up between 8,000 and 10,000 votes in Bourj Hammoud
and was worried that Tashnak supporters were ``trying to create a
panic by physical violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning in Bourj Hammoud, an opposition poll
watcher, Wassim Lahoud, stood in frustration outside a polling
place at the Mar Youssef church, complaining that his crew had not
been given their proper credentials to go inside, and that Murr's
supporters had illegally set up a computer to track voters inside
another polling station. Indeed the computer operation so enraged
the opposition that one of its candidates, former Information
Minister Michel Samaha, stormed into the municipal building and
turned the table over.
</P>
<P>
   Murr turned up at that polling station toward midday in a
caravan of police vehicles, greeted warmly by all the election
workers inside with hugs, handshakes and a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' he replied in French when asked about charges
of vote rigging. ``Do you see anyone who is pressuring?''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, scores of blue-shirted Murr campaign workers
had set up their computer operation again on a series of tables
under a white sun umbrella inside the police lines and were busily
checking the voters in.

RUSSIAN-BACKED LEADER OF CHECHNYA BATTLES REBELS, AND THEIR
DISTRUST

<P>
   TSENTORA-YURT, Russia _ The Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya
gestured toward the crowd that had gathered to wish him a happy
birthday at his heavily guarded home here in Chechnya. Some, he
noted dryly, could well be rebel agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are everywhere and nowhere,'' Akhmed Kadyrov said with a
shrug. ``Some of them might even be among these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov ought to know. He has already survived several
assassination attempts, including one two months ago, which was
averted when a huge bomb was discovered along the road 100 yards
from his house. Last year, a bomb that was apparently intended for
Kadyrov killed five of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It is just another week in Chechnya, a battered, dispirited but
proud land that continues to present Russia's gravest security
challenge. A year after Russian troops poured into Chechnya, the
breakaway republic is no longer the scene of major Russian
artillery barrages and pitched battles involving thousands of
soldiers against rebels who are seeking an independent republic.
</P>
<P>
   But the war has not gone away. Russian casualties mount every
week as the fighting has shifted from large-scale assaults to
skirmishing and ambushes that have turned Chechnya into a nasty
quagmire for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his top
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone agrees that Russian firepower alone cannot bring
an end to the fighting and that a political solution is necessary.
That is where Kadyrov is supposed to come in, but so far a
resolution of the conflict seems as distant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war can't be ended by military means,'' Kadyrov said. ``We
Chechens have to stop it ourselves. If we can't, the war will go on
for 10 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the baking summer heat, Chechnya often seems deceptively
quiet. There is a weary routine about the searches at the Russian
checkpoints, the noisy helicopter flights to and from the Russian
strongholds and the bustle at Chechen marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Even a good day, however, can be grim and frighteningly
unpredictable. Grozny, Chechnya's nominal capital and a ruin of a
city, still lacks gas, electricity and any visible efforts at
restoration. Only a few thousand people still seem to live there,
but now they include rebels who have managed to sneak back into the
city.
</P>
<P>
   They shoot at the Russian checkpoints at night, prompting noisy
firefights that residents say keep them awake. Squads of
Kalashnikov-bearing Russian soldiers move past the kiosks and
makeshift shops but do not linger long. In one brazen attack last
week, two Russian soldiers were shot to death at point-blank range
while they were shopping in Grozny's central market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more dangerous,'' said Yuri Vasilkov, a
19-year-old draftee from the southern Russian town of Taganrog who
was manning a Grozny checkpoint. ``A major attack could come at any
time _ tonight, tomorrow, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russian generals contend that this is nothing to
worry about. The guerrilla attacks, they insist, are just the final
phase of a terrible war that is all but won. The Russian military,
in fact, has already made plans to station a permanent garrison in
Chechnya to secure the peace.
</P>
<P>
   It consists primarily of the army's 42nd Division, a new unit
whose members are being sent to four strategic locations. With
15,000 members, the unit is larger and better equipped than most.
But at Borzoy, a mountain village that sits astride a potential
rebel supply corridor to Georgia, half of the division's troops are
young conscripts with no previous experience in Chechnya. The other
half are ``kontraktniki,'' essentially mercenaries who often have
some military experience and fight for pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is peace,'' insists Andrei Fyodorov, the 39-year-old
colonel who commands the Borzoy detachment. ``The situation is
under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Russian officers, however, have a dimmer view. They say
the rebels may only have several thousand full-time fighters
compared with the approximately 80,000 soldiers and policemen the
Kremlin has sent to Chechnya, but the rebels have also adapted
their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mounting large and costly attacks against major
Russian bases and troop concentrations, the rebels plant mines, set
off bombs and try to pick off small groups of Russian soldiers _
pinprick attacks that are slowly bleeding Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   According to official statistics, 17 Russian troops were killed
and 52 wounded the week of Aug. 13, a tranquil week by Chechnya
standards. All told, more than 2,500 Russian fighters have been
killed and 7,500 wounded in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also sought to infiltrate village
administrations throughout Chechnya, hoping to gain control of food
and other supplies so they can divert them to their fighters in the
woods and mountains. When Russian officials uncovered a rebel camp
last month in the Shatoy mountain region, they discovered that it
was filled with goods sent to aid the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Village officials who resist the rebels are often the targets of
attacks, along with their relatives. In two weeks this month, local
officials in Meskety, Nozhay-Yurt and Urus-Martan were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have cases where local administrations have been
infiltrated,'' Kadyrov said. ``We are setting up a new commission
now to check all of the officials in Chechnya, to find out who is
charge of what and check all aspects of what they are doing.`
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, nobody knows the difficulty of controlling Chechnya
better than Kadyrov, the 49-year-old Chechen whom Putin appointed
two months ago to administer the republic. Kadyrov is the first
Chechen leader to be installed by Moscow since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A former Muslim cleric, Kadyrov opposed the Russians during the
first Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, a rout against Russia that
gave Chechnya de facto independence. Kadyrov supported Aslan
Maskhadov, the Chechen commander who became the first president of
the breakaway republic after that war.
</P>
<P>
   But after Islamic militants based in Chechnya invaded
neighboring Dagestan and Russian troops responded by invading
Chechnya, Kadyrov broke with Maskhadov and decided to work with the
Russians. Each has denounced the other as a traitor, dimming the
already bleak prospect for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov appeared relaxed at his birthday celebration last
Wednesday with his family and Chechen officials, even as
machine-gun-toting bodyguards stood by, chanting Muslim prayers
before feasting on lamb, potatoes and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not matter if we are part of Russia or independent,''
Kadyrov said. ``What does a man really need? He needs a permanent
job and salary. And he needs to be able to leave his house safely
to go to work and to come back safely in the evening. That is what
freedom means. And where should we go? We are surrounded by
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a political solution, he has been negotiating with
several field commanders, including Ruslan Gelayev. Several minor
rebel leaders have come over to his side. But Kadyrov says he will
never make a deal with Shamil Basayev or the rebel chief known as
Khattab, two of the best-known rebel commanders, or with Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics doubt that Kadyrov will be able to establish his
authority in Chechnya. They note that he cannot even control Bislan
Gantamirov, a former mayor of Grozny who was jailed for
embezzlement and released by the Russians so that he could fight on
their side. Unlike Kadyrov, Gantamirov controls a Chechen militia,
and he has especially close ties with much of the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   When Kadyrov fired some local officials loyal to Gantamirov, the
former Grozny mayor led a band of his men to Gudermes, the
administrative capital of Chechnya and the site of Kadyrov's
government headquarters. It was a blunt show of force, and
relations between the two pro-Moscow Chechens are still frosty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadyrov does not have the means to control the situation
inside the Chechen republic,'' said Malik Saidullayev, a Chechen
businessman and a rival.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov asserts that he can prevail. He plans to attend a
religious conference in the United States and, making use of his
common ground with them as a former cleric, ask the Arab conference
members not to provide the financial support that has been sent to
the rebels from Muslims around the world.
</P>
<P>
   His hardest task, however, is to convince the Chechen people
that they have more to gain by accepting Russian control over their
republic and putting down their guns. For all the Russian
firepower, he said, the fighting will not end until ordinary
Chechens stop giving aid and sanctuary to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hiding them,'' Kadyrov said. ``We Chechens, not
Kadyrov. We give them shelter. We feed them. If we closed all the
doors to them, then everyone would see them. This is the only way
to solve this problem.''

   TSENTORA-YURT, Russia _ The Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya
gestured toward the crowd that had gathered to wish him a happy
birthday at his heavily guarded home here in Chechnya. Some, he
noted dryly, could well be rebel agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are everywhere and nowhere,'' Akhmed Kadyrov said with a
shrug. ``Some of them might even be among these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov ought to know. He has already survived several
assassination attempts, including one two months ago, which was
averted when a huge bomb was discovered along the road 100 yards
from his house. Last year, a bomb that was apparently intended for
Kadyrov killed five of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It is just another week in Chechnya, a battered, dispirited but
proud land that continues to present Russia's gravest security
challenge. A year after Russian troops poured into Chechnya, the
breakaway republic is no longer the scene of major Russian
artillery barrages and pitched battles involving thousands of
soldiers against rebels who are seeking an independent republic.
</P>
<P>
   But the war has not gone away. Russian casualties mount every
week as the fighting has shifted from large-scale assaults to
skirmishing and ambushes that have turned Chechnya into a nasty
quagmire for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his top
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone agrees that Russian firepower alone cannot bring
an end to the fighting and that a political solution is necessary.
That is where Kadyrov is supposed to come in, but so far a
resolution of the conflict seems as distant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war can't be ended by military means,'' Kadyrov said. ``We
Chechens have to stop it ourselves. If we can't, the war will go on
for 10 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the baking summer heat, Chechnya often seems deceptively
quiet. There is a weary routine about the searches at the Russian
checkpoints, the noisy helicopter flights to and from the Russian
strongholds and the bustle at Chechen marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Even a good day, however, can be grim and frighteningly
unpredictable. Grozny, Chechnya's nominal capital and a ruin of a
city, still lacks gas, electricity and any visible efforts at
restoration. Only a few thousand people still seem to live there,
but now they include rebels who have managed to sneak back into the
city.
</P>
<P>
   They shoot at the Russian checkpoints at night, prompting noisy
firefights that residents say keep them awake. Squads of
Kalashnikov-bearing Russian soldiers move past the kiosks and
makeshift shops but do not linger long. In one brazen attack last
week, two Russian soldiers were shot to death at point-blank range
while they were shopping in Grozny's central market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more dangerous,'' said Yuri Vasilkov, a
19-year-old draftee from the southern Russian town of Taganrog who
was manning a Grozny checkpoint. ``A major attack could come at any
time _ tonight, tomorrow, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russian generals contend that this is nothing to
worry about. The guerrilla attacks, they insist, are just the final
phase of a terrible war that is all but won. The Russian military,
in fact, has already made plans to station a permanent garrison in
Chechnya to secure the peace.
</P>
<P>
   It consists primarily of the army's 42nd Division, a new unit
whose members are being sent to four strategic locations. With
15,000 members, the unit is larger and better equipped than most.
But at Borzoy, a mountain village that sits astride a potential
rebel supply corridor to Georgia, half of the division's troops are
young conscripts with no previous experience in Chechnya. The other
half are ``kontraktniki,'' essentially mercenaries who often have
some military experience and fight for pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is peace,'' insists Andrei Fyodorov, the 39-year-old
colonel who commands the Borzoy detachment. ``The situation is
under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Russian officers, however, have a dimmer view. They say
the rebels may only have several thousand full-time fighters
compared with the approximately 80,000 soldiers and policemen the
Kremlin has sent to Chechnya, but the rebels have also adapted
their tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mounting large and costly attacks against major
Russian bases and troop concentrations, the rebels plant mines, set
off bombs and try to pick off small groups of Russian soldiers _
pinprick attacks that are slowly bleeding Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   According to official statistics, 17 Russian troops were killed
and 52 wounded the week of Aug. 13, a tranquil week by Chechnya
standards. All told, more than 2,500 Russian fighters have been
killed and 7,500 wounded in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also sought to infiltrate village
administrations throughout Chechnya, hoping to gain control of food
and other supplies so they can divert them to their fighters in the
woods and mountains. When Russian officials uncovered a rebel camp
last month in the Shatoy mountain region, they discovered that it
was filled with goods sent to aid the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Village officials who resist the rebels are often the targets of
attacks, along with their relatives. In two weeks this month, local
officials in Meskety, Nozhay-Yurt and Urus-Martan were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have cases where local administrations have been
infiltrated,'' Kadyrov said. ``We are setting up a new commission
now to check all of the officials in Chechnya, to find out who is
charge of what and check all aspects of what they are doing.`
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, nobody knows the difficulty of controlling Chechnya
better than Kadyrov, the 49-year-old Chechen whom Putin appointed
two months ago to administer the republic. Kadyrov is the first
Chechen leader to be installed by Moscow since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A former Muslim cleric, Kadyrov opposed the Russians during the
first Chechen war, from 1994 to 1996, a rout against Russia that
gave Chechnya de facto independence. Kadyrov supported Aslan
Maskhadov, the Chechen commander who became the first president of
the breakaway republic after that war.
</P>
<P>
   But after Islamic militants based in Chechnya invaded
neighboring Dagestan and Russian troops responded by invading
Chechnya, Kadyrov broke with Maskhadov and decided to work with the
Russians. Each has denounced the other as a traitor, dimming the
already bleak prospect for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov appeared relaxed at his birthday celebration last
Wednesday with his family and Chechen officials, even as
machine-gun-toting bodyguards stood by, chanting Muslim prayers
before feasting on lamb, potatoes and soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not matter if we are part of Russia or independent,''
Kadyrov said. ``What does a man really need? He needs a permanent
job and salary. And he needs to be able to leave his house safely
to go to work and to come back safely in the evening. That is what
freedom means. And where should we go? We are surrounded by
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a political solution, he has been negotiating with
several field commanders, including Ruslan Gelayev. Several minor
rebel leaders have come over to his side. But Kadyrov says he will
never make a deal with Shamil Basayev or the rebel chief known as
Khattab, two of the best-known rebel commanders, or with Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics doubt that Kadyrov will be able to establish his
authority in Chechnya. They note that he cannot even control Bislan
Gantamirov, a former mayor of Grozny who was jailed for
embezzlement and released by the Russians so that he could fight on
their side. Unlike Kadyrov, Gantamirov controls a Chechen militia,
and he has especially close ties with much of the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   When Kadyrov fired some local officials loyal to Gantamirov, the
former Grozny mayor led a band of his men to Gudermes, the
administrative capital of Chechnya and the site of Kadyrov's
government headquarters. It was a blunt show of force, and
relations between the two pro-Moscow Chechens are still frosty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kadyrov does not have the means to control the situation
inside the Chechen republic,'' said Malik Saidullayev, a Chechen
businessman and a rival.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov asserts that he can prevail. He plans to attend a
religious conference in the United States and, making use of his
common ground with them as a former cleric, ask the Arab conference
members not to provide the financial support that has been sent to
the rebels from Muslims around the world.
</P>
<P>
   His hardest task, however, is to convince the Chechen people
that they have more to gain by accepting Russian control over their
republic and putting down their guns. For all the Russian
firepower, he said, the fighting will not end until ordinary
Chechens stop giving aid and sanctuary to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hiding them,'' Kadyrov said. ``We Chechens, not
Kadyrov. We give them shelter. We feed them. If we closed all the
doors to them, then everyone would see them. This is the only way
to solve this problem.''

`BASH': MONOLOGUES THAT REVEAL THE EVIL AND THE BANAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Neil LaBute's ``Bash: Latter-Day Plays'' wasn't written
originally for television, it translates so well it could have
been. The intimacy of this trilogy of one-act monologues, designed
as sparely as a SoHo dress store, seems made for television, and
not just because one of the actors is Ally McBeal (aka Calista
Flockhart). The characters spill their secrets in a confessional
rush, like guests on a talk show.
</P>
<P>
   But the familiarity is deceptive, which simply adds another
layer to LaBute's insistent investigation of the nastiness lurking
beneath the most placid exteriors. As a filmmaker (``In the Company
of Men'') and a playwright, he specializes in exhuming the worm
within. Evil isn't always interesting, he insists. It exists in the
blandest of men and women. When you've stepped into LaBute's
fantasy neighborhood, you'd better watch out for the apple-cheeked
boy next door. He might go berserk and kill you.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these one-act confessionals LaBute has his characters
inflict a gory surprise on the audience that feels like a betrayal,
as it should, given his world view. People may want to be good, he
implies, but they will be bad.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute understands that words matter, especially in a work that
relies almost entirely on storytelling, not on dialogue or action.
He's tuned in to the strangely poetic rhythms in everyday speech
and the telling details of workaday life. When one of his
characters recalls her seduction and subsequent pregnancy at 13 by
her schoolteacher, she says: ``I went home with our baby inside me
and watched `Hogan's Heroes' on TV. Like I do every afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he misses a beat and contrives poetry where prose
would do. A callow character who fumbles trying to remember
contemporaries of F. Scott Fitzgerald, as well as proper grammar,
says of a man he's brutalized, ``We feasted on him like carrion and
left nothing but bones.'' You feel like flossing after taking in a
mouthful like that, from a man like that.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute has shrewdly directed this film version of his play
(which was directed for the theater by Joe Mantello) from a live
performance, using the camera mainly to emphasize the confidential
feeling the stark stage setting provides. Not surprisingly the
camera doesn't fail Flockhart, who appears in two of the pieces.
She's a giddy young woman in ``A Gaggle of Saints,'' about two
Boston College sweethearts recalling an unforgettable weekend in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rudd, as her cute boyfriend, carries the drama in this
story, about a superficially good-natured frat boy whose banality
is laced with a lust for violence. He's so cocky and complacent
that he feels it's his birthright to attack anyone who disturbs his
vision of how things should be. Though he does nothing more than
narrow his eyes as he casually recalls his terrible crime, Rudd
seems transformed as he reveals his character's ugly soul.
Flockhart on the other hand remains innocent and chipper in her
pretty evening dress: more or less a corsage, a lovely, retro
adornment.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Medea Redux'' her skill and bravery as an actress
emerge front and center in the role of the woman who as a girl was
impregnated and then abandoned by her teacher. Stringy-haired and
red-eyed, appearing even frailer than usual, she seems to be
clutching at language for dear life _ her character has already
lost her grip on sanity _ as she tells her story to a tape recorder
at a police station.
</P>
<P>
   The last ``bash,'' ``Iphigenia in Orem,'' is the least
convincing, through no fault of Ron Eldard's; he perfectly relays
the cautious banter of the bland businessman, a man who describes
himself as ``slightly above'' average. Here, too, LaBute captures
the incongruities in human behavior. When the businessman, whose
child suffocated under a blanket, explains that he and his wife ate
pizza afterward, he realizes how absurd it seems. But even when
tragedy strikes, he observes, you have to eat. LaBute recognizes
that the terrible and the mundane are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the unexpected turns in the first two acts, however, the
chilling surprise here feels contrived. When the evil emerges from
circumstance (in ``Medea'') or character (in ``Gaggle''), it's
disturbing and calls up basic questions of morality and human
resilience. LaBute is a Mormon, and these works carry crosscurrents
of religious devotion and hypocrisy. But the events in the third
piece seem grounded only in the sour assumption that betrayal and
the raw desire for redress may be the only traits built into the
human genome. A grim conclusion, but spoken well.  &QL;

   MONSOURIEH, Lebanon _ Confident as an old-time Chicago ward
boss, Walid Khatter, Interior Minister Michel Murr's man in this
Greek Orthodox village, stood in the doorway of his polling station
Sunday afternoon and predicted the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have around 1,000 voters in this district. There will be
about 800 for the Michel Murr ticket,'' he said, adding
dismissively, ``about 200 for the others.''
</P>
<P>
   How could he be so sure? a visitor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we know,'' he said with a shrug and a grin, opening a hand
bedecked with three huge gold rings to show a stack of palm cards
listing Murr's slate of candidates. An aide materialized from the
crush of more than a dozen Murr campaign workers _ the whole area
around the polling station was festooned with portraits of Murr _
with numbers scratched on a sheet of paper and nodded assent.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by reminders of their tribal politics, Lebanese went
to the polls on Sunday in the beginning of a two-stage
parliamentary election overshadowed by Syrian dominance and a
bitter struggle between the current government and its critics.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Christian heartland of Mt. Lebanon, among the
suburban sprawl running up the mountains from Beirut, the focus was
on the battle between a slate headed by the powerful Murr, one of
Syria's biggest supporters, and an opposition slate headed by
Nassib Lahoud, a wealthy businessman and former ambassador to the
United States, who is a cousin of the president, but nonetheless a
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has come under fierce criticism from the opposition because
of his multiple roles as a candidate running for re-election, a
staunch supporter of the government, and ultimately the man in
charge of running the elections. With his government post, he
controls police and internal security forces, the granting or
withholding of various licenses and patronage over a huge number of
public employees.
</P>
<P>
   His power was evident on Sunday. Entrances to many of the
polling places were surrounded by election workers in baby blue
T-shirts and baseball hats. The Arabic legend on the T-shirts read
simply: ``Michel Murr.''
</P>
<P>
   Every seat in Parliament is assigned to one of the country's 17
officially recognized religions, minutely derived from a census
taken in 1932. (There has never been one since for fear of
political upset.) In the voting on Sunday, citizens went into
separate rooms in the polling places, divided both by men and women
and by each religious sect in a district: Maronite Catholic,
Armenian Catholic, Sunni Moslem and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Khattar's district here is so homogeneous that there are only
two sets of voting rooms: Greek Orthodox and, he said,
``assorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafik Hariri, the multibillionaire builder trying to make a
comeback as prime minister, is locked in a bitter struggle with
President Emile Lahoud, who has unleashed much of the government's
power against him, including hours of ill-supported accusations and
ridicule on state television.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has become so intense in recent days that the new
Syrian President, Bashar Assad, has summoned leading Lebanese
political leaders to Damascus, and Syria's long effective regent in
Lebanon, Maj. Gen Ghazi Kanaan, has been meeting with them here in
an effort to restore calm.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, 63 of the Parliament's 128 seats were at
stake in three districts: Northern Lebanon, largely Christian, but
with a big Sunni Moslem population in Tripoli; the Metn, the
mountains north and east of Beirut that are the Christian
heartland; and the Chouf, traditional home of the Druze. Beirut,
and the largely Shi'ite areas of the Bekaa Valley and southern
Lebanon, vote next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Taif agreement of 1989, which helped end the bloody
15-year civil war in which some 150,000 people died and much of the
country was destroyed, the president is to name the prime minister
supported by blocks forming a simple majority in Parliament after
``binding negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the voting seemed to go smoothly, there were
troubles throughout the day in Bourj Hammoud, an Armenian ghetto
near the port long dominated by its ethnic Tashnak Party, which is
supporting Murr. In a rare move, Lahoud's opposition slate put up a
candidate for an Armenian Orthodox seat in the Metn district
usually held by Tashnak.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition candidate, Raffi Madoyan, was attacked and beaten
twice during the day by Tashnak supporters, and local television
cameramen filmed men smashing windows in his fleeing car with
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud's political adviser, Joe Bahout, said the opposition had
hoped to pick up between 8,000 and 10,000 votes in Bourj Hammoud
and was worried that Tashnak supporters were ``trying to create a
panic by physical violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning in Bourj Hammoud, an opposition poll
watcher, Wassim Lahoud, stood in frustration outside a polling
place at the Mar Youssef church, complaining that his crew had not
been given their proper credentials to go inside, and that Murr's
supporters had illegally set up a computer to track voters inside
another polling station. Indeed the computer operation so enraged
the opposition that one of its candidates, former Information
Minister Michel Samaha, stormed into the municipal building and
turned the table over.
</P>
<P>
   Murr turned up at that polling station toward midday in a
caravan of police vehicles, greeted warmly by all the election
workers inside with hugs, handshakes and a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around,'' he replied in French when asked about charges
of vote rigging. ``Do you see anyone who is pressuring?''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, scores of blue-shirted Murr campaign workers
had set up their computer operation again on a series of tables
under a white sun umbrella inside the police lines and were busily
checking the voters in.

   TRANSITION _ ATLANTA _ If hearing all the high-tech hubbub makes
you think you're missing out, now may be the time for you to pack
up your skills and enter the fray. Although there are already some
10 million information technology workers in this country, there's
still plenty of room. The South has the highest number of IT
workers overall, according to the Information Technology
Association of America. Demand is hot, and it isn't expected to
cool off anytime soon. So many jobs, so few workers. One place they
will come from is the ranks of current jobholders, especially
women, who shift from the Old Economy to the New. (Mallory, Atlanta

   SNAIL-COLLECTORS _ PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jason D'Auria walks
barefoot into the moonlit waters of the canal, pulls mosquito
netting around his face and snaps on the lamp attached to his head.
In the distance, pairs of tiny red spots gently bob on the surface
of the water. ``I like the night because you can see everything,''
the 20-year-old D'Auria says. ``All of the alligators are up, and
you can see their eyes glittering in your headlamp. I'd rather see
them than not see them.'' Every few minutes he stops to pluck a
snail or two from the surface and drop it into the net. Soon the
net fills and D'Auria heaves the 50-pound haul to the grassy bank
of the canal, dumps the snails into a Styrofoam cooler and starts
over. (Crecente, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FALL-MOVIES _ You've heard it all summer long. Seen any good

steady but the summer drought has to do with more than your front
yard. Outside of maybe ``Gladiator,'' it's been one stinking summer
at the movies. That's about to change. With the onset of fall, a
couple of solid, winning movies are coming: Neil LaBute's blue
collar ``Nurse Betty'' and Cameron Crowe's '70s rock tour film
``Almost Famous.'' Plus, get ready for Denzel Washington's
made-in-Atlanta movie ``Remember the Titans.'' All three point to
well-written tales about American obsessions: soap operas, rock
music and football. And each focus on average Americans. Not the
$3,000 Italian sofa crowd of ``American Beauty,'' but the

   MUSIC-WEBERN _ ATLANTA _ Modernism comes in waves. The first

1945, with three quick gunshots. The war in Europe had been over
since May. An American soldier, Raymond N. Bell, was on a policing
raid when he encountered a man breaking curfew, puffing a cigar in
a doorway. The events of that evening remain unclear. What's known
is that Anton Webern, an impoverished composer, had fled the
turmoil of Vienna and was visiting his son-in-law, a Nazi turned
black marketeer. Webern had stepped outside for a smoke _ a
contraband gift, undoubtedly _ just as Bell arrived. After a
scuffle, shots were fired. So ended the career of one of the most
unlikely giants of 20th-century music. (Ruhe, Atlanta

TO STEM DWINDLING POPULATION, IOWA ROLLS OUT WELCOME MAT FOR
IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ No one would call Iowa a melting pot.
Nearly 96 percent white, this state, striated with farm fields and
trim small towns, may have more kinds of cows and corn than
nationalities of people.
</P>
<P>
   And the immigrants Iowa does have, about 2 percent of the
population, have become enough of a hot-button subject that twice
in the last three years the state legislature was embroiled in
debates over proposals, not passed, that English be made Iowa's
official language. Some Iowans contend that immigrants cause crime
and burden schools, health care and welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   So it is all the more surprising that Iowa is proposing
something no other state has done: an all-out immigrant recruitment
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is to make Iowa what a governor's commission calls
an ``immigration enterprise zone,'' and the possibilities include
seeking an exemption from federal immigration quotas _ an
unprecedented request that could require congressional action.
Other ideas involve making Iowa a priority destination for
refugees, helping companies recruit employees abroad, even having
the governor make sales pitches to prospective emigres. The state
also wants more federal immigration agents in Iowa's district to
process newcomers faster.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to ease Iowa's population deficit, bringing in
enough people to create a work force for a vibrant economy. Iowa,
which hemorrhaged families during the farm crisis of the 1980s and
still loses young people after high school, has fewer residents
than it did 20 years ago. And with an unemployment rate of 2
percent, there will not be enough workers to allow many new
businesses to open, or existing ones to expand or even replace
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is shared across the Midwest, where states like
Nebraska offer scholarships to keep bright students from leaving.
But Iowa's proposal is extraordinary because the state is convinced
that it must look outside this country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is we need more people,'' said Iowa's governor, Tom
Vilsack. ``Part of that can be done by trying to keep young people
here. Part of it can be done by trying to bring Iowans back to the
state. But an aspect of it has to be a program or plan or some kind
of method by which we become a welcoming state for people from
different cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack knows that some Iowans, and immigrants, may have trouble
adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not naive enough to think that this is going to be sort of
a Pollyanna type of deal,'' he said. ``It's going to be a
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   In Marshalltown, for example, a community of 30,000, the influx
of several thousand Mexican immigrants to work at a meatpacking
plant has not been universally embraced. This month, a petition was
submitted to the county board of supervisors calling for county
business to be printed in English only.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for liberals to say we're all immigrants,'' said
Biff Dysart, who edits Marshalltimes Magazine. ``But if you look
back at all of our families when they came here, they all did their
level best to assimilate. The current crop of immigrants not only
does not want to assimilate. They drive around town with Mexican
flags flying from their antennas, and they refuse to even learn the
language, many of them do.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants and those who welcome them say the state faces a
tough job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to need to work to deal with the stereotypes,''
said Sandra Charvat Burke, a demographer at Iowa State University
who lives in Marshalltown and heads a town diversity committee.
Burke said the state should be prepared to hire paraprofessionals
in the schools to work with immigrant students so native Iowans do
not feel their children are shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Cano, a Mexican immigrant who runs Taqueria El Cacheton,
said there should be more interpreters at health clinics and other
services and more English classes for adults. Cano, 31, said that
while some people in Marshalltown were friendly, she had also had
anti-immigrant epithets yelled at her and was denied service by a
cashier.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making Iowa an Ellis Island of sorts came from a
bipartisan committee appointed by Vilsack, Iowa's first Democratic
governor in 30 years, to devise a plan to help the state thrive by
2010. The committee of 37 prominent Iowans set goals like making
Iowa technologically competitive and developing nonagricultural
industries, like tourism.
</P>
<P>
   With each goal, the committee kept realizing, ``Gee, we can't do
this if we don't have any people,''' said Jerry Kelley, the mayor
of Indianola, who headed the 2010 Committee's population group.
``Don't you know we have a disaster?''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa ranks third in the nation in the percentage of elderly. The
average farmer is 58 years old; the average assembly-line worker at
the Maytag Corp. is 57.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Iowa retains every single one of its graduating high school
students between now and 2005, we'll have a decrease of 3 percent
of the available work force,'' said Kelley, adding that North
Dakota would be the only other state with a net loss.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended that Iowa, which has an estimated 2.87
million people, add 310,000 working people by 2010. That includes
building on recent efforts to urge young people to stay and lure
far-flung Iowans home. (Last year, Vilsack hit Manhattan, holding a
party at Tavern on the Green for former Iowans in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   But the committee became convinced that more immigrants were
vital, said its chairman, David Oman, an AT&AMP;T executive and former
Republican candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all sort of held our breath when it was time to release the
report,'' he said. ``We weren't sure what the reaction would be.''
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the report has certainly created a stir.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the plan calls for attracting a wide range of employees,
some skeptics worry that only low-wage workers will come to Iowa,
and depress wages. Others fear a flood of highly skilled employees
that would leave fewer choice jobs for Iowans.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant advocates like Sandra Sanchez, director of the
immigrant rights project of the American Friends Service Committee
in Des Moines, praise the proposal. But they also raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state is not really equipped to deal with a high
population of foreign-born immigrants,'' Sanchez said. State
services, she said, ``do not have bilingual staff; they haven't
received culturally appropriate training.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, immigrants _ from Bosnia, Sudan and especially
Mexico _ have been the only reason Iowa's population has had any
net growth. Many come after living in other states, easing their
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   The 2010 Committee proposes ``diversity welcome centers'' to
help immigrants find housing, learn English and find health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most other details remain undetermined, including the cost,
although the committee provided some estimates, like $7,700 plus
$3,100 monthly in relocation costs for an immigrant family of
three. Vilsack says he hopes much of the money can be simply
shifted from other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how or whether to exempt Iowa from federal
immigration restrictions, which generally require that immigrants
from one country not make up more than 7 percent of the annual
total, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman said. An
aide to Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, said one idea was
legislation allowing Iowa's immigrants to ``not count against the
overall number for a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack said he envisioned communities getting state help
preparing resources to accommodate foreigners and essentially
sponsoring groups of immigrants. He cited a program from the 1970s
in which Southeast Asian refugees were sponsored by families,
businesses, churches or towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1990s, immigration was primarily fueled by the need for
workers, and companies have a completely different agenda,'' he
said. ``They didn't give a thought about the impact that bringing
200 or 300 immigrants into a small community might have. And there
was trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack said people would be more accepting if they understood
immigrants' circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about a refugee that makes it easier to accept?''
he said. ``I suspect that it is an appeal to compassion, an appeal
to the hardship that they've been through. Well, the same aspect
can be applied to the sometimes heroic efforts on the part of
Mexicans to cross the border because they don't have economic
opportunity in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Marshalltown, Burke, of the town diversity committee, said,
``We've had some people supporting the immigrants very strongly,
and we have people who resent still hearing anything but English on
Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants here often work long hours at jobs Iowans reject, and
often have strong families. But the police say crime has increased
since Mexicans arrived, and a Mexican-made form of methamphetamine
has appeared. Some residents have focused on those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more people but we need the right kind of people,''
Dysart of Marshalltimes Magazine said, adding that he believes some
Mexicans have been productive, upstanding residents. ``We need a
doctor from Ghana, a schoolteacher from Brussels, a journalist from
Calcutta. What we don't need is 5,000 more Mexican meth dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Harrison, a lawyer organizing the English-only petition,
said, ``The non-English-speaking people continue to have their own
groups and it fosters ethnic problems and educational problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio Minjares, 39, a Mexican immigrant who works for the
Marshalltown Trowel factory, said he sometimes feels that people
stare at him warily in higher-income neighborhoods, and that his
boss is stricter with Latino employees. But he says he has also
been treated courteously here.
</P>
<P>
   And in Marshalltown schools, test scores have declined with the
influx of immigrants and there are too few bilingual teachers, said
the city's schools superintendent, Richard Doyle. But Latino
parents are often very involved in their children's schooling, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other day we were talking about how can we attract
more people to the community to work,'' Doyle said. ``If
immigration is what it's going to take, then I'm in favor of
that.''

SWEDISH BID FOR LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE IS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ OM Gruppen, which runs the Stockholm stock exchange, is
expected to make a formal offer, which could include a hostile bid,
for the London Stock Exchange, which rejected an informal 800
million pounds ($1.18 billion) proposal last week, executives close
to the discussions said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The bid would come just weeks before a shareholder vote on the
proposed merger between the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges,
which, along with an alliance with the Nasdaq stock market, would
create a pan-European powerhouse with a 24-hour global market.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish overture also revived interest from Euronext _ a
combination of the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris exchanges _ which
had approached the London exchange about a link-up last spring but
was rebuffed. The details of its proposal were never made public to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, OM Guppen offered 7 pounds ($10.30) in cash and 20
pounds ($29.50) worth of new OM stock for the London exchange,
which amounted to 15 percent more than the closing price of 23.50
pounds for the exchange's shares on Friday. A formal proposal is
expected to be roughly the same amount but would ``include more
specific numbers,'' said the executives close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   With a market value of 2.6 billion pounds, OM shares are trading
at a richly valued 80 times trailing earnings, which leads some
analysts to worry that the offer consists mainly of ``inflated
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The OM proposal was rejected out of hand because it didn't
make any sense commercially or financially,'' an executive close to
the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The jostling for the London exchange underscores the problems
that old-school European exchanges are facing as they merge to
offer single-currency trading and to compete better with
fast-growing electronic exchanges. Even before the Swedish bid, it
was unclear whether the London and German partnership would win the
75 percent shareholder approval needed to push the deal through as
regulatory and operational questions have mounted. Shareholders are
expected to vote on the deal on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the London exchange said there were no plans to
delay the vote in light of the Swedish bid.
</P>
<P>
   The London Stock Exchange is governed by the British takeover
panel, which could postpone the vote to allow shareholders more
time to assess the new information. Some shareholders have already
called for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to merge ``should be delayed so that all the
shareholders of the L.S.E. have information on the various
options,'' said Angela Knight, chief executive of Britain's
Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   In its overtures to Frankfurt, the London stock exchange is
hoping to gain scale and influence, and it thinks the Stockholm
exchange would bring it less of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to provide a strong European presence with
access to liquidity in a wide range of equities, which merging with
Germany would do,'' said the spokesman for the London exchange.
``Stockholm doesn't provide us with European consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger of the London and Frankfurt exchanges into iX, for
International Exchange, would control 53 percent of European equity
trading with a combined value of $4.29 trillion. That would make iX
the largest European exchange, ahead of Euronext, based in Paris,
which will trade stocks valued at $2.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Stockholm exchange has been aggressive and growing
quickly _ it is about to introduce an online system called Jiway in
a deal with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter _ it still controls only 5
percent of the European equity market. And its derivatives
operation, through the London-based OMLX, pales in comparison to
the Frankfurt exchange's Eurex, which is the world's largest market
for trading derivatives, the complex financial contracts whose
values are based on underlying assets like stocks, bonds,
commodities and currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Swedish interest, the iX merger was by no means
guaranteed. Stockbrokers and shareholders have questioned the
proposed operations of the new exchange, a concern echoed by the
Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Federal Securities
Trading Security Authority of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current terms of the merger, high growth stocks would
be traded under the rules laid out by Frankfurt, where the Neue
Market has different listing requirements than does Britain's
Alternative Investment Market.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks will follow British guidelines, which require
immediate reporting of most large trades to the exchange, a
guideline not required in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include the cost of new technology. The merged
entity would use Germany's Xetra trading system. The London
exchange has said it will contribute 8 million pounds to help its
members cover the conversion costs, but it remains unclear whether
that amount will be sufficient, or whether any savings can be
derived from the new system. &QL;

<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ Seeking to breaking down the taboos shrouding a
disease that has devastated Africa, President Clinton on Sunday
urged Nigerians to show the same resolve they displayed in enduring
decades of dictatorship in confronting what he called the
``tyranny'' of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, standing beside a man infected with the same virus that
afflicts some 24 million Africans and has become the continent's
leading killer, applauded Nigeria's efforts to control the spread
of AIDS. But he offered a blunt reminder to Africans that AIDS is
preventable _ if people will only speak frankly about how it is
spread, and then act.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is 100 percent preventable _ if we are willing to deal
with it openly and honestly,'' Clinton said. ``In every country, in
any culture, it is difficult, painful, at the very least,
embarrassing to talk about the issues involved with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a
child die of AIDS who could have lived if the rest of us had done
our part?'' the president added. ``Is it harder to talk about than
to comfort a child whose mother has died? We have to break the
silence about how this disease spreads and how to prevent it. And
we need to fight AIDS, not people with AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks presented a bold challenge, not only to
Nigerians but to all in Africa, where health workers and experts
have lamented that the social stigma surrounding the disease and an
absence of public education and discussion of its dangers and
impact have contributed greatly to the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced some increased aid for Nigeria's fight _ $20
million to control the spread of AIDS, malaria and polio, and a
plan to include AIDS education as part of the military training
that U.S. troops are giving to Nigerian peacekeepers headed to
nearby Sierra Leone, which has been ravaged by civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He told the audience of young people, religious leaders and
women leaders that Nigerians, despite the much-heralded
introduction of civilian rule last year, will never be free until
they bring infectious diseases under control. An estimated 5.4
percent of Nigeria's population of 114 million _ about 2.6 million
people _ are currently infected with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed at the courage of the people of Nigeria in
struggling against the oppression that you endured for too long
until you got your democracy,'' Clinton said. ``I urge you now to
show that same kind of courage to beat the tyranny of this disease
so you can keep your democracy alive for all the children of
Nigeria and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, frustrated by the lack of action by some African
governments, have praised Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo for
making the fight against AIDS a priority. But the Nigerian
president stressed Sunday that it was a disease that his country
could not battle alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a disease you can say if you eradicate it in Nigeria
it is eradicated for good,'' said Obasanjo. ``Those from Nigeria
who go outside and have sexual relations with those who have
HIV-AIDS or have blood transfusions with them will bring it back.
We don't see it as a Nigerian disease. We see it as a world disease
that is ravaging Africa most.''
</P>
<P>
   Africans have reacted coolly to the United States' offer of $1
billion in annual loans to finance the purchase of anti-AIDS drugs
in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that the approach would add to
countries' already heavy debt burden of some $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Clinton's two-day visit here, Obasanjo has repeatedly
raised the issue of debt relief, encouraging the wealthy nations of
the world to forgive the large sums amassed by previous African
rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, elected 15 months ago as part of Nigeria's transition
to democracy, did not directly address the U.S. AIDS plan. But in
toasting Clinton at a state dinner on Saturday night, he made a
plea for financial relief from the United States and other wealthy
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we cannot achieve our desire for economic
development if we continue to bleed from the gushing wounds of an
ever-penetrating debt repayment lance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in addressing business leaders Sunday, said that past
leaders of Nigeria _ a country that has suffered under callous and
corrupt dictators for most of its modern history _ had squandered
the country's riches and that leaders now must be careful to focus
any debt relief on improving the lives of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Clinton toured a small African village, walking
through muddy paths past huts that were hooked up to electricity
only month ago. Guided by Mohammedu Baba, the chief of the village,
Ushafa, Clinton entered a small medical clinic that had been
stocked with supplies by the State Department just the day before.
</P>
<P>
   A clinic worker told the president that the clinic had treated
234 cases of malaria this year. There are no HIV cases, villagers
said, although nearby villages have cases and surrounded urban
areas are heavily affected.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance Clinton announced Sunday included $2 million in
the current budget to produce insecticide-treated bed nets to keep
malaria-infected mosquitoes at bay, as well as $9 million in new
money to battle polio and $10 million more to assist Nigeria's AIDS
fight. The White House has requested a $100 million increase, to
$342 million, in international AIDS financing in the 2001 fiscal
year budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just Nigeria's fight, or Africa's fight,'' Clinton
said. ``It is America's fight and the world's fight too.'' The
president's remarks heartened John Ibekwe, who heads an
organization in Nigeria for people living with AIDS. ``With you as
an advocate on our side, governments in Africa will do more than
they are doing,'' Ibekwe said in introducing the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves for Tanzania on Monday for an update from
former South African President Nelson Mandela on the Burundi peace
talks, began his day at a Baptist church in Abuja, where he heard
the Rev. Israel Akanji preach on the parable of the good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbers have come. Bandits have come. We have been left
wounded, bleeding and dying,'' Akanji said of his country's
struggles against its own leaders. ``Is there a good Samaritan
passing by?''

 &HT;    Atlantan's gift of life proves temporary, but love endures
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It doesn't seem a fair exchange _ giving a healthy
liver and receiving a broken heart. But that was the painful price
for Curt Bludworth.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, Bludworth said his goodbyes over the telephone to
Raymond Munoz, the California man who had gone from stranger to
everlasting friend when a liver transplant linked them on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz died of respiratory failure at the University of Southern
California Hospital. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' said Bludworth, 33, of Atlanta. ``It's
been a very tough few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz had received about 60 percent of Bludworth's liver in what
was called the nation's first ``at-large'' liver donation,
involving two people who were not related and not connected by
community.
</P>
<P>
   Bludworth offered to donate part of his liver to a severely ill
patient after reading about the success of using living donors for
liver transplants. This is possible because the liver, the only
internal organ that regenerates, grows back in both the donor and
recipient. Although Bludworth and the Munoz family both welcomed
media coverage following the transplant, when the situation took a
turn for the worse, they sought privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't face the press,'' Bludworth said. ``I don't want
this to be about me with people saying, `I feel so badly for Curt.
Look at all he went through and what happened in the end.' I want
the focus on Ray. He suffered a lot and it breaks my heart that he
suffered so much.'' The transplant itself was considered a success,
and Munoz showed no signs of rejecting the organ. But he needed a
second surgery to repair a leaking bile duct. After that his
strength started faltering, and he contracted pneumonia from an
unknown infection, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, 562 liver transplants from living donors
have been performed. Among recipients, 85 percent are still alive
one year after the transplant, according to the United Network of
Organ Sharing. At least one donor, and possibly two, have died.
Among the 15 adult living-donor liver transplants performed at USC,
three recipients, and no donors, have died.
</P>
<P>
   Liver transplants using live donors are generally more
successful than those using cadaver organs because the organs are
healthier and doctors have flexibility in the timing of the
transplant, explained Dr. Reda Sobky of the Hepatitis C Global
Foundation. The majority of living-donor transplants are between
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz' liver actually held up best of all his organs as
infection took hold in his weakened body. ``It was ironic,''
Bludworth said. ``The liver was the only thing functioning when he
died. It was maddening, because the liver transplant itself was
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from hepatitis C and cirrhosis of the liver, Munoz was
running out of time early this year. For two years, he never went
anywhere without his pager, his link to USC's transplant center.
The beeper to signal a donor never went off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still consider Curt our angel,'' said Carmen Munoz, Ray's
wife. ``The only hope Ray had was that beeper in his hand. And
then, Curt came out of nowhere and gave us Ray back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the transplant, Munoz felt and saw an immediate
difference. ``Look at my hands,'' he said at the time. ``Look how
smooth my skin got overnight. I can't believe how good I feel. It's
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirits were always up, even toward the end,'' Carmen
Munoz said. ``I know Curt feels really bad. But I told him, `You
did give him life, Curt. The three months we had with him gives us
100 more memories.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen and Ray Munoz would have celebrated their 18th wedding
anniversary today. Bludworth served as an honorary pallbearer and
delivered a eulogy at the memorial service in Munoz' longtime
family church, Our Lady of Solitude in East Los Angeles. He told
the gathering of about 200 family and friends that he learned much
about Munoz while they recuperated. They took long walks around the
hospital floor, talking about their differences and similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Bludworth is a white, gay, upper-middle-class Republican who
drives a Mercedes, tools around on a retro Harley-Davidson
motorcycle and lives in a high-rise loft. Munoz, a
Mexican-American, was a working-class family man, a Democrat who
cherished his red Pontiac Trans-Am and never moved from the block
where he was born, off Cesar Chavez Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd only known him for three months, but I learned how much he
loved his family,'' Bludworth said. ``Every time he spoke of
Carmen, his eyes lit up. He loved his country and he loved his
church. All he wanted was the simple things for the rest of his
life. To be able to pick up his grandkids and not feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz had worked for 28 years with the Los Angeles Police
Department as a civilian police officer. He also was a soldier in
Vietnam. At the funeral he had a police escort, and an honor guard
of war veterans stood vigil at the graveside. He was buried with
full military honors.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Munoz gave Bludworth the crucifix that rested upon
Munoz's casket, a Catholic gesture usually reserved for family.
``Carmen and I are going to be friends the rest of our lives,''
Bludworth declared.
</P>
<P>
   Bludworth's recovery has gone well except for some numbing and
pain in his right arm, a lingering effect of having his arm propped
up and rib cage spread during surgery. The nerve damage is expected
to heal. He is back at work as a director of human relations for
Morrison Management Specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Bludworth is continuing with plans for a foundation that would
help people become living organ donors, a procedure that is being
used increasingly for liver and kidney failure. ``Even though this
didn't turn out the way we wanted it to, a lot of good has come out
of this that we may not know for years to come,'' Bludworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Munoz said she considers the transplant a success because
it is opening people's eyes to the need to become organ donors. ``I
told Curt, `Keep going with your dream. Go with your belief that
this type of transplant can help people. My husband was part of
your belief. Pay tribute to Ray with the foundation.' ''

 &HT;    Snail collecting is big industry in Florida
 &HT;    By Brian D. Crecente
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jason D'Auria walks barefoot into the moonlit
waters of the canal, pulls mosquito netting around his face and
snaps on the lamp attached to his head.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, pairs of tiny red spots gently bob on the
surface of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the night because you can see everything,'' the
20-year-old D'Auria says. ``All of the alligators are up, and you
can see their eyes glittering in your headlamp. I'd rather see them
than not see them.''
</P>
<P>
   He slowly walks through the water, net slung over his shoulder,
careful to tread lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes he stops to pluck a snail or two from the
surface and drop it into the net. Occasionally, one scoots past his
toes, and he stoops to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the net fills and D'Auria heaves the 50-pound haul to the
grassy bank of the canal, dumps the snails into a Styrofoam cooler
and starts over.
</P>
<P>
   During fall and winter, the snail treks are a nightly ritual for
dozens of collectors like D'Auria who make their living
criss-crossing South Florida in search of their next meal ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Ramshorn, Apple, Trapdoor _ put in an order, and
collectors know where to find these ornamental fish.
</P>
<P>
   Ask them for giant Peruvians, and more often than not they come
to Palm Beach County, looking to score a motherload of the
softball-sized snails that can fetch as much as $1.50 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty lucrative job,'' said Richard Bradwell, owner of
the Neighborhood Tropical Fish Farm in Miami. ``But you have to be
crazy to do it. They're climbing through the mud with water
moccasins, poisonous insects.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the danger, few collectors are killed in pursuit of
their quarry.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Ricky Reddick, 49, was looking for snails in a canal
when he fell face first into 18 inches of water and died. His
business partner, Kenneth Peterman, found him about 2:30 a.m. The
Palm Beach County medical examiner determined Reddick died of a
ruptured aneurism.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kraus, owner of Kraus Tropicals, near Tampa, said the pair
were among several collectors he had hired that week to collect
Golden Ramshorn snails.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus, who has been in the business first as a collector then as
a farmer for 15 years, has about a dozen collectors who work for
him. Each turns in thousands of requested ornamental fish a week,
which Kraus turns around and sells to aquarium suppliers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell over 1 million snails a year,'' he said. ``Florida is
where the country gets its snails. It's a big industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have aquariums, and sooner or later they are
going to want to put snails in them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report released last month by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Florida aquaculture farmers reported sales of $86
million in 1999. Tropical fish sales made up a little more than
half of that with about $43.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for more than 80 percent of the ornamental fish
sold in the entire country, USDA officials say.
</P>
<P>
   No one tracks the sales of collected ornamental fish, USDA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquarium business is the second largest hobby in the United
States,'' said Bradwell, who raises half a million snails in cement
vats at his fish farm.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraus starts to run low on a specific fish or snail, he
often just calls up his collectors and tells them what he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is good,'' he said. ``I'm keeping these guys
hopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Hypostomus Plecostomus eggs, or ``sucker fish'' eggs, are one of
the more popular things collected in the backwaters of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The fish, often placed in aquariums to clean algae off the
sides, lay their eggs near the bottoms of some canals.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors free-dive along the walls and slide their hands into
wrist- to shoulder-deep holes feeling for the spongy
racquetball-sized egg sacks that sometimes lie there. A typical
diver might collect 100 of the tangerine-colored egg clusters after
checking 500 holes, D'Auria said. A good day brings in several
hundred eggs. A good week could pay $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess doing this is odd to a lot of people, but it's an easy
way to make a living,'' said Kraus. ``But the guys who do this
would rather do this than spend the day packing groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus acknowledges the inherent dangers in his business, but
says the collectors usually live to tell their tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have stories,'' he said. ``Anybody who does this has
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   James Heinke's story is among the best:
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened on April 20, 1999. I still have medical bills I'm
paying. I was in the Tampa bypass canal, we call it Six Mile Creek.
We had seen her actually as we were working along the canal. She
was 200 yards up. We worked till we were 50 yards from her. We see
alligators all of the time, so it was no big deal. She was sitting
there with her nose on the shore, her head and eyes out. She was
just sitting there. We got out to try to get her to move, but when
we walked that way she went straight down. We waited, waited like
30 minutes. I was ready to get done, ready for lunch. I decided
we'd go back in. I walked into the canal, dove down and hung over
this ledge to get the eggs. As soon as I went down I knew what she
had done. The water was pretty murky, but I knew. I looked up and
that was it, that was the only chance I had to see her. All I had
time to do was flinch and turn my head to the right. She bit, but
she didn't hold on to me or nothing. When she bit me, her teeth
grabbed the left side of my cheek from probably just below the
corner of my eye down to the nose, through my lip and there was a
large gash on top of my head. I pushed away and swam. I was quick
about it. My dad was only 6 feet from me, and he had to ask what
happened. I said, 'That alligator bit me in the face.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, Heinke lost his taste for diving and snailing
for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything like it for a year, then I started
collecting snails again,'' he said. ``This is all I know. I quit
school at the beginning of my senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Auria, Heinke's cousin, also temporarily quit diving after he
surfaced in front of a 15-foot alligator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freaked me out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the next week, D'Auria was back at it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to the money,'' he said, ``and it's good money.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Auria said he doesn't plan to stay in the collecting end of
the business for much longer. He uses the $400 to $2,000 he earns a
week to help pay his way through college.
</P>
<P>
   Heinke, 23, doesn't dive anymore and says he never will.
Instead, he wants to start his own business reselling the
ornamentals instead of collecting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money might be good,'' he said. ``But I want to be able to
come home to my daughter every day.''

   CLINTON-AFRICA (Abuja, Nigeria) _ Seeking to breaking down the
taboos surrounding a disease that has devastated Africa, President
Clinton on Sunday urged Nigerians to show the same resolve they
displayed in enduring decades of dictatorship as they confront what
he called the ``tyranny'' of AIDS. By Marc Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Tsenturi, Russia) _ A year after Russian troops
poured into the region, the breakaway republic is no longer the
scene of huge Russian artillery barrages and pitched battles
involving thousands of soldiers and rebels seeking an independent
republic. But the war has not gone away. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-RESERVES (Washington) _ A look at the status of the
military's reserve forces. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   GORE (Undated) _ Campaigning with Gore. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA-IMMIG (Marshalltown, Iowa) _ No one would call Iowa a
melting pot. Nearly 96 percent white, this state can seem to have
more kinds of cows and corn than nationalities. But Iowa, which
hemorrhaged families during the 1980s farm crisis and has an
unemployment rate of only 2 percent, is proposing something no
other state has done: an all-out immigrant recruitment drive to
encourage foreigners to call Iowa home. The plan is to make Iowa an
``immigration enterprise zone,'' and the ideas range from seeking
an exemption to immigration quotas to urging companies to recruit
abroad. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-DONATE (New York) _ David Chang is at the center of a
widening federal inquiry into the possibility that New Jersey Sen.
Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign staff may have been complicit in
Chang's illegal political donations _ something the senator
strongly denies. Lawyers familiar with the case say Chang has given
prosecutors information suggesting that Torricelli's aides
accounted improperly for some of his contributions, and at least
two dozen FBI agents have been added to the inquiry in recent
weeks. Chang himself is something of an enigma. As a businessman,
many of his former employees say, Chang generated all sorts of
ambitious schemes but almost no apparent profit. So where did his
`political' money come from? By Tim Golden and David Kocieniewski.

<HEADLINE>
TREATS FROM SUMMERS PAST GET A NEW TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The highlight of breakfast _ at the site of another Montana
forest fire many summers ago _ was burnt toast. It was made edible
only by a thick application of strawberry jam.
</P>
<P>
   But that posed a problem. Every displaced hornet within 15 miles
had collected in or around a single, large jam pot at one end of
the chow line. Fear collided with hunger, generated by 13
consecutive hours on a fire line. So you grabbed a spoon, shoved it
carefully into the buzzing pot and while the hornets swarmed around
your hand and wrist, you closed your eyes and took a scoop.
</P>
<P>
   If you survived unstung, that piece of toast served as one of
the highlights of a Montana summer.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid my favorite holiday was Independence Day, which ran
from June 15 to Aug. 30, or as long as my personal stock of
firecrackers held out.
</P>
<P>
   And no, I never started a forest fire.
</P>
<P>
   In those days a daily check of baseball scores and statistics
provided another summertime bonus, although there were no major
league teams in Montana or in Seattle, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Movies _ particularly those featuring Humphrey Bogart, John
Wayne or Errol Flynn _ provided excitement and relief from the
Montana summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   Forest fires and _ I suppose _ hornets around jam pots are still
a reality of summertime in the West.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of other things have changed. This past Fourth of
July, I did not hear one firecracker between dawn and 10 p.m., and
I mourned for the lost joys of youth. My disappointment was
tempered by the fact that the skyrockets from our community show
were ignited less than 100 yards from my door.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, major league baseball executives admitted
that the biggest draws in baseball were not Mark McGwire, Sammy
Sosa or Alex Rodriguez _ but free Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw Bogart, Wayne or Flynn as I sought relief from the
summer sun, they were often swigging cold beer, martinis or gin and
tonics.
</P>
<P>
   The summertime ``drinks'' of choice today _ if I am to believe
the latest edition of Gourmet Magazine _ are homemade Popsicles
spiked with gin, rum or tequila.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps fortunate that Bogart, Wayne and Flynn will never
see film cowboys, private eyes or pirates humiliated by directors
and prop men who hand them Mango Daiquiri Ice Pops to suck during
tense showdowns under the unrelenting summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   Hard lemonade is another ``with-it'' drink and recalls a cowboy
movie starring Bob Hope, who walked into a tavern filled with
desperadoes and said, ``Gimme a lemonade.'' When the barkeeper gave
him a look, Hope quickly added, `` ... in a dirty glass!''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a dessert alternative that may look like a Betty Crocker
recipe. But I'm pretty sure she got it from Alice's mother.
</P>
<P>
   EDNA'S LEMON PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   SERVES SIX
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   grated rind of one lemon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks, well beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites, stiffly beaten
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the
lemon rind, lemon juice and egg yolks. Add the milk and then
carefully stir in the beaten egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   Pour this mess into a casserole, set in a pan of water 1 inch
deep and then shove the pan into a 350 degree oven and bake about
50 minutes. Serve warm or cold, with or without whipped cream.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a report to President Clinton last year, a group of leading
computer scientists warned that the nation faced a troubling
``software gap.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, made up of corporate executives and university
researchers, said that programmers simply could not keep pace with
exploding demand for high-quality software _ the computer code
needed for everything from Internet commerce to nuclear weapons
design.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the gap, the group said, the nation must not only
train more skilled programmers but also explore fresh, even
radical, approaches to developing and maintaining software.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, the group, known as the President's Information
Technology Advisory Committee, will recommend that the federal
government back ``open source software as an alternate path for
software development,'' according to a draft copy of the report,
which will be sent to the White House and published in a matter of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open source software'' seems a radical approach indeed. The
term stands for both an iconoclastic philosophy and a software
development model: software is distributed free and its ``source
code,'' or underlying instructions, are published openly so that
other programmers can study, share and modify the author's work.
</P>
<P>
   The open-source model represents a sharp break with the
practices of the commercial software business, which considers
source code a company's private property _ usually guarded
jealously and shared only rarely, under strict licensing terms.
</P>
<P>
   But open source, once viewed as an ideological movement at the
fringes of computing, is moving into the mainstream _ largely
because the spread of the Internet and personal computers makes it
easy for programmers to collaborate in far-flung, voluntary teams.
</P>
<P>
   Open-source software has already made real inroads with a pair
of showcase success stories: the Linux operating system for
computers used alone or in networks, and the Apache software system
for so-called server computers used for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Linux and Apache have attracted the support of established
companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard, and startups like Red Hat
and VA Linux. Both open-source programs have done best in the
market for Web server software. Apache is used on 63 percent of Web
servers, according to Netcraft, a research firm, while Linux is the
operating system on 36 percent of Web servers.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's fans say that open-source development, if widely
adopted, has the potential to help fill the software gap by more
efficiently delivering high-quality software. And open source, they
add, is forcing the software industry to rethink its traditional
development practices and its business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The point, they say, is not to destroy the profit motive that
has helped make software a $175 billion-a-year business worldwide.
The goal instead is to bring software development into the Internet
era by sharing knowledge widely, allowing programmers to build on
one another's work and accelerate the pace of software debugging
and improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the open-source economy would make money mainly by
tailoring programs for customers, and with service and support.
Software, open-source advocates say, would increasingly become a
service business _ compared with the the traditional model of
shipping proprietary code, shrink-wrapped, as if it were a
manufactured good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that the Internet
and open-source initiatives are the free marketplace way of dealing
with the extremely complex software issues we are facing,'' said
Irving Wladawsky-Berger, an I.B.M. executive and a member of the
presidential advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft is taking open source seriously, if warily.
``This issue of open source cuts to the core of the software
business,'' observed Jim Gray, a Microsoft researcher who is also a
member of the presidential advisory group. ``It is a real
challenge, masked by a great deal of hype.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report by the technology advisory panel is another sign
that open source is an emerging force. The group's recommendations
focus mainly on developing software in a rarefied niche of
computing _ the federally financed supercomputing centers devoted
to over-the-horizon research in fields like modeling the atmosphere
and simulating nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the report also notes that open-source development could
have ``a profound economic and social'' impact, and it clearly
regards the supercomputing centers as technology incubators for the
marketplace. (It was a team from the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, after
all, that helped spawn the Web revolution by creating the Mosaic
browser, Netscape's precursor, in 1993, and that built the server
software that became the foundation of the Apache project.)
</P>
<P>
   ``High-end computing should be a good test bed if you want to
find out if open source can produce high-quality, complex
software,'' said Larry Smarr, co-chairman of the open-source panel
of the presidential advisory committee, who was head of the
Illinois supercomputing center in the Mosaic days.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For all the momentum of the open-source model, uncertainties
abound. Making the transition from a movement to the mainstream,
industry analysts say, will mean overcoming some daunting cultural,
business and legal obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of open-source development go back to the 1970s and
the academic traditions of freely publishing research, subjecting
work to peer review and sharing one another's discoveries. The
early idealists, led by Richard M. Stallman, a revered programmer,
believed deeply that all software should be free and that
commercial software was all but immoral.
</P>
<P>
   But the leading figures in the open-source movement today,
however, have a more pragmatic bent. They believe in open-source
development mainly, they say, because it produces better software
and service _ not because it is morally superior to the traditional
commercial model. They are all for capitalism, and they welcome
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If open source is to succeed, it has to have a business
justification,'' said Brian Behlendorf, one of the creators of
Apache, and the founder and chief technology officer of Collab.Net,
a San Francisco start-up company that helps companies design and
run projects using open-source techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are in the open-source community because they
think it is the right thing to do,'' he added. ``But charity only
goes so far. You've got to make it sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 5 million software programmers worldwide,
Behlendorf figures that fewer than 50,000 participate in
open-source projects. ``The goal is to bring what works from open
source into this other 99 percent of the programming community,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collab.Net, founded last year, has about two dozen clients,
including Sun Microsystems, Oracle and Hewlett-Packard. Some of its
customers are experimenting with distributing source code freely.
But others are proceeding more cautiously, perhaps sharing some of
their proprietary code with business partners and customers as a
way to improve the quality and speed of its software development
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' said Bill Portelli, president of Collab.Net, ``this
is not about software being free. It's about the open-source
practices and principles _ a methodology for fast, effective
collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   To make money, Collab.Net charges fees for consulting, education
and coordinating software projects. Indeed, the business model for
open-source development is based on the premise that software is a
service and that the companies seeking to profit from it are
service suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial software business, open-source advocates say, is
locked in an industrial-era ``factory model'' of shipping programs
out the door as ``finished goods.'' Instead, such advocates say,
software should be seen as more like a living organism that is best
fed and cared for in the open-source environment. Even Microsoft,
they note, has said recently that its software effort will evolve
into a service business.
</P>
<P>
   So far open-source development has been more of an Internet-age
breakthrough in engineering management than a progenitor of new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The two marketplace triumphs of open source, after all, are
derivative rather than truly innovative. Linux is a version of the
Unix operating system, and the Apache Web server was derived from
software developed at the Illinois supercomputing center.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, some experts say the promise of open source is
being overstated. William N. Joy, a founder and chief scientist of
Sun Microsystems, created and distributed an open-source version of
Unix two decades ago at the University of California at Berkeley.
The Internet, he now says, has changed the context of things,
making collaboration easier. But real innovation, he says, remains
the work of a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, great software comes from great programmers, not
from a large number of people slaving away,'' Joy said. ``Open
source can be useful. It can speed things up. But it's not new, and
it's not holy water.''
</P>
<P>
   Open-source enthusiasts reply that Joy is correct when it comes
to the conceptual insight needed to forge a new direction in
software. Truly creative insights, they concede, will remain the
bailiwick of the ``lone craftsman'' programmer. But they hurry to
add that breakthrough innovation, while important, is only a small
part of the software economy. More than 75 percent of the time and
cost of a software project is typically consumed by what the
open-source approach is meant to do best: debugging, maintaining
and tweaking the code.
</P>
<P>
   Such work may seem mundane, but it represents a huge
problem-solving challenge that determines the speed of development
as well as the reliability of software.
</P>
<P>
   So when Linus Torvalds released an experimental version of Unix
onto the Internet as a student at the University of Helsinki in
1991, it may not have been breakthrough software. As the Web took
off, though, he soon found himself the steward of a developing
operating system project, dubbed Linux, spurred by the voluntary
contributions of programmers around the world. In the book ``The
Cathedral and the Bazaar,'' Eric S. Raymond, an open-source
evangelist, observed that Torvalds was ``the first person who
learned how to play by the new rules that pervasive Internet access
made possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules can be disorienting. Netscape Communications
learned some hard lessons after it opened the source code on its
Internet browsing software in early 1998. By then, Netscape,
following Microsoft's lead, had been forced to give its browser
away. But browser market share was still important to Netscape
because its software server sales and service contracts depended on
the popularity of its technology.
</P>
<P>
   By making its browser an open-source project, Netscape hoped to
enlist the widespread support among open-source programmers eager
to help the company in its battle against Microsoft. The
open-source project was called mozilla.org _ a playful combination
of Mosaic, the original browser, and Godzilla. But the effort drew
only limited support.
</P>
<P>
   Developers typically join open-source projects for the challenge
of solving interesting software problems and the resulting
recognition of their peers. That works best when a software program
is designed as many pieces, or modules, so ``there is a lot of
frontier to homestead,'' in open-source parlance.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape's browser was a big batch of programming code that
was not designed in modules. ``That made it hard for even strong
hackers to come in, stake a claim and do interesting work,'' said
Brendan Eich, a leading programmer and one of the six founders of
mozilla.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Corporate attitudes slowed things down as well. At first, for
example, the Netscape programmers were reluctant to post their
comments in the online area accessible to outsiders, preferring to
post them instead on in-house lists for Netscape engineers. ``There
was a whole mindset that had to change,'' Eich observed.
</P>
<P>
   The mozilla open-source project was weakened further by staff
defections after Netscape agreed to be acquired by America Online
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the project was also overhauled in the fall of 1998 in ways
that laid the groundwork for a turnaround. The mozilla leaders
adopted a modular code base called Gecko _ named after a small,
fast lizard _ for rendering Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, more outside developers joined the open-source
browser effort. Eich, the lone founding member of mozilla still
with Netscape, rattles off the names of several outside programmers
who have made significant contributions. Bugs are fixed quickly.
``More eyes looking at the code really helps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, America Online released a preview version of
its next-generation browser, Netscape 6.0, long delayed but praised
in the trade press for its streamlined design and novel features.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Microsoft seems to be entrenched as the leader in
browsers for personal computers. Still, the Netscape browser is at
least a counterweight to Microsoft on the desktop. Beyond that, the
mozilla open-source browser is designed for post-PC computing _ to
run easily on everything from cell phones to hand-held Internet
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've rounded the corner at mozilla,'' Eich said.
</P>
<P>
   The mozilla effort is also being watched as a model for
licensing _ a crucial issue for open source. There are many kinds
of open-source licenses, but they all require contributors who
modify an open-source program to make those improvements available
to all members of the project. The most restrictive licenses
require any code that touches an open-source program to be made
available freely. ``To some companies, that is a terrifying
thought,'' said Lawrence Rosen, executive director of the Open
Source Initiative, an education and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The mozilla license is an effort to let open source and
proprietary software coexist peacefully. Its license applies to
each of the software files _ building blocks of code _ in the
open-source browser. If someone modifies one of those files, the
improvement must be given back to the project as open-source code.
But if a company mingles some of its own proprietary software files
with the browser, those separate files can remain its private
property.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of accommodation, industry analysts say, is a step
toward making open source acceptable to corporate America. ``Open
source can't go mainstream unless it finds ways to work with
companies that have very different business models and believe that
intellectual property can be owned,'' said James F. Moore,
president of Geopartners Research, a consulting firm. ``That's a
big challenge.''

DEBUT OF INSIDE, THE MAGAZINE, RAISES STICKY QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To listen to the editors and publishers of the Web site
Inside.com and the magazine Industry Standard talk about the new
technology and entertainment magazine they are planning is to
imagine the excitement of ancient Mesopotamians discussing their
newly invented wheel.
</P>
<P>
   For the participants, it all seems so revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly magazine will be titled Inside: The Business of
Entertainment, Media and Technology. It is supposed to make its
debut by year's end, focusing on the effect of digital technology
on the media and entertainment industries. The magazine will be
published in a partnership between Standard Media International,
the parent company of the two-year-old Internet business magazine
Industry Standard, and Powerful Media, the parent of Inside.com, an
entertainment industry news Web site that started in June and is
still trying to find its way.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hirschorn, the editor in chief of Inside.com, said last
week that the Internet economy and digital technology were about to
undergo the long-predicted melding and transformation that would
make the magazine necessary reading across several industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think I'm a geek, but for example, I consider Napster to
be an epochal event,'' said Hirschorn, referring to the service
that lets people swap digital music files online with little regard
to copyrights. ``It is one of the things that will change the
Internet profoundly, forever. You have to accept the idea that
digital technology is going to transform each of the industries we
cover _ film, television, music, book publishing, magazines and
newspapers, and that is why this magazine is right, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its nowness, the debut of Inside, the magazine, prompts
several questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why would Inside.com, which initially introduced a
mediacentric Web site with high hopes for its solo success, now
introduce a print magazine, which is costly to produce and
distribute?
</P>
<P>
   _ What does Standard Media International, which is a unit of the
International Data Group and is already busy with the ad-rich
Industry Standard and the introduction of a European edition, get
from the deal?
</P>
<P>
   _ Perhaps most significantly, is the crowded magazine field
ready for a weekly title about the way that digital technology is
affecting the entertainment industry?
</P>
<P>
   Inside.com, as a Web site, has not attracted the number of
subscriptions it had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had anticipated 30,000 subscriptions, but we fell short of
that,'' said Deanna Brown, the chief executive of Powerful Media,
declining to be more specific. Brown said the cost of subscriptions
_ originally planned for $217 annually _ was not the problem, but
the Web site started late in recruiting subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But visitors to the free portions of the Inside.com have started
to come. Its 160,000 visitors in June compared with 80,000 that
same month for a competitor, Variety.com, according to Media
Metrix. Inside's new partner, the Industry Standard, which has a
free circulation in print of 200,000, drew many more visitors to
its own Web site in June: 490,000 more than Inside.com did.
</P>
<P>
   If subscriptions are the goal for the executives at Inside.com,
maybe a print magazine makes sense, even if it is expensive to
produce. It can offer the chance to attract more people who would
rather not cruise the Web, but it can also serve as an advertising
billboard for those who might also be interested in the site. Also
worth considering is the fact that the publishers of the Industry
Standard _ whose weekly circulation is relatively minuscule
compared with, say, Business Week's 950,000 _ are not expecting a
sudden, enormous circulation for the new publication.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard has had a heady advertising success, with
ad pages up 376 percent this year, according to Mediaweek magazine.
But some advertising executives are wary of the new venture's
narrow focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing that all aspects of the media are getting
niche-ier and niche-ier and more narrow and more vertical,'' said
David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a media
services company. ``It's gotten to the point where I am starting to
question whether some of these magazines ought to be newsletters.''
</P>
<P>
   Verklin also questioned whether a Web site that had failed to
meet its subscription demands could spin off a successful print
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, then you can turn around and look at how well the
Industry Standard is doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard, for its part, will get equity in the new
venture in exchange for the use of the Standard's back-office
operations to produce and distribute the magazine _ although the
Inside.com side of the partnership plans to supply much of the
editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is a financial component to this equation,
because they are providing a lot of services,'' Brown said. She
would not disclose the terms.
</P>
<P>
   John Battelle, the chief executive of Standard Media, who was a
founding editor at an earlier digital-revolution manifesto, Wired
magazine, said he did business with people if he liked them and
their work, and if he thought they would make money for his
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``And should they succeed, we want a piece of that success,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added that the team at the Industry Standard would also
gain entree to an exclusive world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get an introduction to the inner sanctums of some of
these industries,'' she said. ``You know, we did not hire a bunch
of 22-year-olds out of dot-com school to run this company. We hired
seasoned executives who have been around the block, and who know
people.'' (Last week, the magazine hired its first editor on a
consulting basis: Sarah Bartlett, the former editor in chief of
Oxygen Media.)
</P>
<P>
   Even some competing magazine editors said last week that the
concept behind Inside was a solid one. Ned Desmond, the editor in
chief of E-Company Now, a new monthly magazine published by Time
Inc., said the intersection of technology and entertainment was a
growth area that deserved watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly the case that there is a lot going on, as a
whole bunch of industries try to figure out digital technologies
and entertainment,'' he said. ``And we are fascinated by the same
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Company Now's own rate base _ the circulation guaranteed to
advertisers _ began at 200,000 earlier this year and will be
325,000 in January, Desmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one final question:
</P>
<P>
   What of Kurt Andersen _ book author, media celebrity, Giorgio
Armani model in the current issue of W magazine, former
contributing editor at the New Yorker, former editor in chief of
New York magazine, and one of Powerful Media's founders?
</P>
<P>
   Andersen said he would supervise and offer advice to the

RATE OF VIOLENT CRIME DROPS 10 PERCENT IN 1999, CONTINUING DOWNWARD
TREND 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rate of violent crime in the United States
continued a downward trend in 1999, with the 10 percent drop last
year representing one of the largest decreases in decades, the
Justice Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures, released by the department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics, show a continuation of declines in every major
type of personal and property crime between 1993 and 1999. During
this period, the rate of violent crimes in general declined 32.7
percent, while robbery with injury dropped 38.5 percent, aggravated
assault decreased 41.2 percent and rape fell 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, begun
in 1972, show that property crime rates continue a 25-year downward
trend. Crime rates involving property, including burglary and motor
vehicle theft, dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999, decreasing from
217 per 1,000 U.S. households to 198 per 1,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were more secure in their homes from 1998 to 1999,
with the number of completed burglaries dropping from 38.5 per
1,000 households to 34.1 per 1,000, an 11.4 percent fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a period of slow decline that was interrupted by an
increase from 1980 to 1981, the burglary rate fell each year
through the rest of the period,'' the Justice Department report
said. ``The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of
the adjusted rate of 1973.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime
rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher
sentences and more police officers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   As with earlier reports of similar declines, President Clinton
called the figures ``further proof that the Clinton-Gore
administration's anticrime strategy of more police on our streets
and fewer guns in the wrong hands has helped to create the safest
America in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush's headquarters, told The Associated Press:
``It's typical for the Clinton-Gore administration to take credit
for good things in America. But much of the credit for the decline
in crime has to go to governors and local officials who have passed
tougher laws, longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime rate report is based upon information on nonlethal
violent and property crimes gathered during the annual National
Crime Victimization Survey. In 1999, 42,895 households and 77,750
people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Although homicides were not included in the survey, the report
said preliminary data gathered separately by the FBI indicated that
the murder rate declined about 8 percent last year. Males account
for about three-quarters of murder victims. About one in eight of
these victims is under 18 years of age, and firearms are used in
seven of 10 homicides, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 44 percent of last year's violent crimes against
people were reported to police, compared with 34 percent of
property crimes. Robbery was the violent crime most often reported,
with 61 percent of incidents disclosed, while rape and other sexual
assaults were the least often brought to the attention of law
enforcement. Only 28 percent of these cases were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Males were more likely to be victims of violent crime, including
robbery and assault, than females in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Males experienced violent crime at rates 28 percent greater,
and were robbed at rates more than two times that of females,''
said the report. ``Females were victims of rape and sexual assault
at 7.5 times greater than the rate of males.''
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, it said, three females per 1,000 were raped or
sexually assaulted, compared with 0.4 per 1,000 for males.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO DOUBLE PRODUCTION IN ALABAMA, CONSULTANTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ DaimlerChrysler AG plans to announce on Monday that it
will nearly double production in Alabama, adding another assembly
line close to the site where it already builds M-Class sport
utility vehicles, auto industry officials and consultants said over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler said on Friday that it
would hold a news conference on Monday in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the
nearest large city to its sport utility vehicle factory in Vance.
The planned construction project is the latest sign that Alabama's
auto industry is growing. Honda has just begun building a minivan
factory near Vance, too.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler declined to comment on what the factory would
produce. But auto industry consultants working for automakers and
auto parts suppliers said the company would make a so-called
crossover vehicle that would combine the features of a minivan and
the M-Class sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the planned Mercedes project represents a new assembly
plant or an expansion of the existing one will likely be the
subject of some debate. State officials in Alabama began praising
the project on Friday as a new plant. But there is no consensus
among automakers over whether adding a second assembly line
represents a second plant or an expansion of an existing one.
</P>
<P>
   Because the second assembly line will produce a vehicle similar
to the M-Class, it is likely to work closely with the existing
assembly plant and receive shipments of many of the same parts.
``I'd put it more in terms of expansion'' of the existing factory,
rather than a second, independent assembly plant, said an auto
industry manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham (Ala.) News reported that Mercedes would receive
$150 million in state incentives for the new operation and that it
would create 1,750 jobs. Mercedes received $235 million in
incentives for the existing factory.
</P>
<P>
   It will be to DaimlerChrysler's advantage to portray the new
operation as an entire assembly plant to people in Alabama, where
the company has been seeking tax breaks and other assistance, while
portraying it in Michigan as an expansion of the existing
operation. The United Automobile Workers union, which represents
workers of the former Chrysler Corp., has been unable to organize
workers at the factory in Vance, and there is considerable
nervousness among workers and state officials in Michigan about the
pace of automakers' expansion in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW declined Sunday to comment on DaimlerChrysler's plans.
Although DaimlerChrysler has publicly declared its neutrality on
the question of whether the current assembly plant should be
organized, union officials have complained over the last year that
the company has remained hostile. Local businesses in the Vance
area have tried to rally factory workers against the UAW, fearing
that if the union is successful, that might discourage further
investment in the area. The UAW has not insisted on an actual vote
at the factory on whether to unionize, fearing that it might lose.
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Robinet, the director of forecast services at CSM
Worldwide Inc., a big auto production consulting firm based in
Northville, said over the weekend that Mercedes would change the
M-Class sport utility vehicle considerably several years from now
and then use the underbody from the new model to build a similar
vehicle at an adjacent site.
</P>
<P>
   The current M-Class uses a stiff, heavy underbody like that of a
pickup truck, which made it cheap to develop but also gives a bumpy
ride. Robinet said Mercedes would switch to a lighter, carlike
underbody for the next generation of M-Class vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers are increasingly combining the features of sport
utility vehicles with those of cars and minivans, using carlike
underbodies for better handling, fuel economy and safety. Examples
include the Lexus RX-300 sport utility vehicle and the new Pontiac
Aztek and Ford Escape. Because these vehicles still look mostly
like sport utilities on the outside, automakers have been
successful, with few exceptions, in convincing regulators that
these crossover vehicles are still eligible for the more lenient
safety, air pollution and fuel economy standards that apply to
light trucks, instead of the more stringent standards applied to
cars.

KLEZMER: TWO BOOKS ON A MUSICAL STYLE AND ITS YIDDISH ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that klezmer has become the generic name of a musical style,
it is worth noting that from medieval times until a few decades ago
the word referred not to a particular variety of music, but to a
particular kind of musician. Specifically this evocative
conjunction of the Yiddish words ``kley'' (vessel) and ``zemer''
(song) described the instrumentalists whose music enlivened
weddings in the shtetls of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Klezmer as we know it today is newfangled, having evolved in
tandem with other streams of Western music over several hundred
years. At its heart is an instrumental imitation of cantorial
singing, an emphasis on melodies in minor keys with alternately
drooping and ecstatic ornamentation. But its structures borrow from
the shtetl's non-Jewish neighbors: many of klezmer's classic forms
_doinas, horas, freylekhs and bulgars _ have Romanian and Ukrainian
folk roots.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that both Henry Sapoznik and Seth Rogovoy show in
their very different but complementary studies is that the music
now considered authentic, ``pure'' klezmer is just a point on an
evolutionary continuum. Because composers did not write down their
works, it was not until the first decades of the 20th century, when
the nascent record industry identified Jewish immigrants as a niche
market, that the sound of klezmer was preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Those early recordings, though, are as misleading as they are
enlightening. They preserve the sound and technique of spectacular
players, and they offer an overview of the repertory. But these
works that thrived on expansive improvisation were squashed into
the three or four minutes of a disc side, and musicians were
encouraged to play to their audiences' changing tastes. That meant
not only touching on nostalgia for the Old World, but accounting
for New World interests like Yiddish theater songs and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sapoznik and Rogovoy cast wide nets to gather klezmer's
unruly history. In the case of Sapoznik's ``Klezmer! Jewish Music
From Old World to Our World,'' the historical discussion regularly
veers away from klezmer itself to look at Yiddish theater and its
stars, Jewish-American popular recordings and the practice of
bringing cantorial music into the concert hall and recording
studio. These developments are not irrelevant: Sapoznik clarifies
the degree to which they both drew on and fed into the klezmer
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Rogovoy, in ``The Essential Klezmer,'' focuses more fully on
recent trends in which traditional klezmer has mingled with jazz,
rock and avant-garde experimental music. He is particularly fond of
the amalgam now known as Radical Jewish Culture, a catchall
appellation invented by the composer John Zorn. If some of this
music has only tenuous klezmer links, one can argue, as Rogovoy
does, that its family bonds make it a legitimate part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   That the evolution from traditional to free-form klezmer took
place at all is something of a miracle, because for three decades
in the middle of the 20th century klezmer was entirely eclipsed.
After World War II the tendency among American Jews _ especially
those born here _ was to set aside the remnants of Eastern Europe
in favor of an emerging American culture that was driven by film,
television and popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Sapoznik, the son of a cantor, grew up in a Yiddish-speaking
household in Brooklyn. Like many in his generation (he is in his
mid-40s), he abandoned his parents' culture during his teen-age
years, having suffered the mortification of having a klezmer band,
rather than a rock group, perform at his bar mitzvah celebration.
But he was also among the first to return to it, having made a
detour as a member of the Delaware Water Gap, a moderately
successful folk music band. The story of his return has become
klezmer lore: In 1977 Tommy Jarrell, a North Carolina banjo player
with whom Sapoznik was studying, asked him, ``Hank, don't your
people have none of their own music?''  &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Sapoznik's response was to become an architect of the movement
that brought klezmer back into the spotlight. He immersed himself
in the archives at YIVO, the New York Yiddish culture research
institute. He collected and cataloged countless recordings,
photographs and documents, and interviewed musicians. He was a
founder of Kapelye, one of the first and most accomplished of the
klezmer revival bands, and he produced scores for several
documentaries on the music and the culture that produced it.
</P>
<P>
   He also produced a string of crucial LP and CD reissues, among
them collections of recordings by Dave Tarras and Naftule
Brandwein, the two greatest klezmer clarinetists of the first half
of the 20th century, and the anthologies ``Klezmer Music
1910-1942,'' ``Klezmer Pioneers: European and American Recordings
1905-1952'' and ``Klezmer! Jewish Music From Old World to Our
World,'' released as a companion to his book. Sapoznik's liner
notes for these recordings, as well as a 1987 book of musical
transcriptions, ``The Compleat Klezmer,'' include a great deal of
historical information.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts Sapoznik in an odd position as a historian. His
research makes him the ideal person to write a history of klezmer,
but his active involvement in the music brings him too close for
objectivity. His book begins as a scholarly history, but at the
halfway point it becomes an autobiography, spiced with sharp,
amusing opinions but freighted with detail about the internal
politics of organizations like YIVO.
</P>
<P>
   This chattier, more personal section of the book has a certain
charm. But a reader looking for a dispassionate history will have
the sense of being yanked into a single tree after happily
contemplating the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Rogovoy, a music critic in western Massachusetts, began
listening to klezmer in 1997 and was so thoroughly seduced by it
that he listened to virtually every available recording with
klezmer links. His writing about the music's early history lacks
the depth and texture of Sapoznik's work, and it is beset by a
tendency to use contemporary pop as an all-purpose yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essential Klezmer'' comes to life, though, in the chapters
on the bands that have sprouted since the late 1970s. Whereas
Sapoznik's telling is weighted with closely observed detail,
Rogovoy's offers more sweeping, comprehensive surveys of the work
of Andy Statman, David Krakauer, the Klezmatics, Brave Old World,
the Klezmer Conservatory Band and even Sapoznik's own band,
Kapelye, to say nothing of the post-klezmer renegades led by Zorn.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes ``The Essential Klezmer'' invaluable is its
second half. An enthusiast's source book, this section includes an
extensive critically annotated discography as well as a guide to
klezmer Web sites, films, festivals, books and publications.
</P>
<P>
   Both authors are conscientious about defining the Yiddish and
Hebrew terms that pepper their texts.

SOME NEW MATH IN MSNBC'S BILLBOARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Bylines at end of each article)   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last few months, the cable network MSNBC has placed two
billboards along the West Side Highway in Manhattan that promote
its main nighttime news program in this way: ``THE NEWS WITH BRIAN
WILLIAMS _ Find Out Why 42 Million People are Watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign features a photograph of Williams, who is considered to
be among the heirs apparent to the NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw,
looking confident and authoritative. It tells viewers they can tune
in weeknights at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But the billboard has struck executives at some of MSNBC's
competitors as not only odd, but also a bit annoying because of the
large ratings figure the sign boasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of this year _ the most recent full
quarter for which cable ratings are available _ the 9 p.m. showing
of ``The News With Brian Williams'' was actually watched by an
average 203,000 people, according to Nielsen figures. It was in
fourth place in its time period among the cable news networks
behind CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' with 936,000 people watching each
night; CNBC's ``Rivera Live,'' with 374,000; and the Fox News
Channel's ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes,'' with about 308,000.
</P>
<P>
   So, how can MSNBC say the program is being watched by 42 million
people when its nightly audience is only a small fraction of that?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to some statistical ingenuity and vague language, the
MSNBC number is basically correct, according to MSNBC executives.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the calculus: Williams' program, which runs Monday
through Friday, is repeated four times a night after its initial 9
p.m. showing _ twice on MSNBC and twice on CNBC, NBC's financial
network. MSNBC executives said they arrived at the figure by taking
the total number of people who watched at least one minute of the
program in any of its runs in April.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if while clicking through the channels in April,
a viewer happened to pause for 60 seconds on Williams' program, she
became one of the 42 million.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of method is not all that different from one used to
determine audiences for Web sites. But it is quite different from
that usually used to measure television audiences, in which
statisticians track the number of people watching a particular
program from minute to minute and then produce an average
viewership number.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at MSNBC said they thought their method for the
billboard would better represent the real audience for Williams in
the course of a night since, they contend, many of his his viewers
tune in briefly for information and then head elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tune in to Brian Williams to get their news,''
said Robin Garfield, MSNBC's vice president for research. ``That's
the statement we want to make: We are the news broadcast of record
in cable.''

   PROGRAM IS HURT BY A LACK OF CHARACTERS
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' may have posted ratings last week that surpassed
everything this year but the Super Bowl, but ``Big Brother,'' the
other reality show on CBS, has muddled along with ratings so pale
by comparison that the show has had to fight off the impression
that it has been a total flop.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, one night after the ``Survivor'' finale soared to
a 28.4 rating, ``Big Brother'' scored a 6.3. (Each rating point
represents just over one million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   The network's official position on ``Big Brother,'' which has
locked 10 people all summer in a house filled with cameras, is
supportive. ``The show is putting up solid summer numbers,'' said
Chris Ender, CBS' spokesman for entertainment programs. ``Even its
lowest-rated broadcasts are doing far better than what we had in
those time periods last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But unofficially, many senior CBS executives are disappointed
with the show's ratings and its execution.
</P>
<P>
   The show is still pulling in more younger viewers than CBS is
accustomed to seeing. But it failed to capitalize on several
opportunities to build a steady audience in recent weeks when it
followed ``Survivor.'' Now it has to endure six nights a week until
Sept. 30 _ many of those nights going against the Olympics on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Michaels, a spokesman for Endemol, the Dutch company that
created ``Big Brother,'' said it expected interest to grow as the
number of people in the house dwindle in coming weeks. And he said
a series of provocative challenges were planned to increase the
tension among those who remain.
</P>
<P>
   Tension has been one factor cited as lacking in the show. Much
of the blame has fallen on the casting, the same element for which
``Survivor'' was widely praised. People close to the show say CBS
executives contend that Endemol had too much control over casting,
while Endemol has said that CBS executives had veto rights over the
final selections.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest shortcoming of ``Big Brother'' may be its inability
so far to create anything like the national discussion that
``Survivor'' has generated. In every other country where a version
of ``Big Brother'' has played _ including Britain, where the
country's version is now an enormous hit _ the show has generated
noisy public debate.
</P>
<P>
   That has not happened with ``Big Brother'' on CBS, where
``Survivor'' has been commanding so much attention.

   EXPERIMENT IN SERIOUS NEWSCAST STUMBLES
</P>
<P>
   Last February, the CBS station in Chicago, WBBM-TV, began a bold
experiment in local television news: It unveiled a 10 p.m. program
that presented its audience with plain old news and information.
Gone was the genre's usual reliance on sensationalism and
entertainment-world gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The anchor was Carol Marin, who quit her job at the local NBC
station, WMAQ, two years earlier, when it hired Jerry Springer as a
news commentator. ``No water-skiing squirrels'' became the mantra
of the program's staff, who were enthusiastic about the new
approach. So were the station's executives, especially Pat
Costello, the news director, and Hank Price, the station's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The 10 p.m. News With Carol Marin'' has done worse in the
ratings than the program that it had replaced. And, given recent
events, its once bright-eyed staff members are privately worried
about its future.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Price and Costello left WBBM, citing opportunities
at other stations that they could not pass up. It is unclear who
will take Costello's place as news director at WBBM.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Cheatwood, who was the vice president for news at the NBC
station when Marin left in protest, is now in charge of news for
the 35 TV stations CBS owns around the country. People at the
station say Cheatwood could have at least some say in selecting the
new news director.
</P>
<P>
   The new station manager, Walter F. DeHaven Jr., has said that he
hoped Marin's newscast will catch on with viewers but that the
ratings will have to come up soon. He had no comment last week. &QL;

LIEBERMAN CALLS FOR GREATER ROLE FOR RELIGION IN PUBLIC LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Conn., Miss., Calif.)   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Declaring that belief in God is the basis of morality
and of the nation, Sen. Joseph Lieberman on Sunday called for a
greater role for religion in American public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a people we need to reaffirm our faith and renew the
dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose,''
Lieberman, a Connecticut senator and Democratic vice-presidential
nominee, told the congregation of Fellowship Chapel, one of this
city's largest African-American churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Adams, second president of the United States, wrote that
our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,''
he said. ``George Washington warned us never to indulge the
supposition `that morality can be maintained without religion.'''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have been more overt about their religious faith
this year than in any other presidential campaign in memory. Gov.
George W. Bush has said that his favorite political philosopher is
Jesus, ``because he changed my heart,'' and Vice President Al Gore,
a professed born-again Christian, has said that when faced with
tough decisions, he asks himself, ``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the comments Sunday by Lieberman, the first Jew nominated
for national office by a major party, were striking for a moderate
Democrat. His words, if spoken by a conservative Christian, would
probably be received with alarm by many factions in Lieberman's own
party _ including many Jews _ who are wary of the political
activism of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many conservative Christian politicians, Lieberman has
not taken positions like advocating prayer in schools or, like
Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, saying that religious
groups should take over much of the burden of social services now
shouldered by government.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman _ who refers at every campaign stop to his Jewish
faith and the role of religion in Gore's life _ went further Sunday
than he previously had in this campaign in asserting a role for
religion in politics and public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   His themes _ and even his phrases _ were remarkably similar to
those commonly voiced by conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us reach out together to those who may neither believe nor
observe and reassure them that we share with them the core values
of America, that our faith is not inconsistent with their freedom,
and that our mission is not one of intolerance but one of love,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   But he bluntly made the case for allowing faith into politics.
``I want to talk to you this morning about another barrier that may
fall, as well, as a result of my nomination,'' he said. ``I hope it
will enable people, all people who are moved, to feel more free to
talk about their faith and about their religion. And I hope that it
will reinforce the belief that I feel as strongly as anything else,
that there must be a place for faith in America's public life.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``we know that the Constitution wisely separates
church from state, but remember: the Constitution guarantees
freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a litany of biblical traditions, he said, from ``the
commandments of Moses'' to ``the compassion and love and
inspiration of Jesus of Nazareth, it could never have been written,
and wouldn't have been written, in our Declaration of Independence,
`We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.'''
</P>
<P>
   From the day three weeks ago that Gore chose as his running mate
the first Democratic senator to publicly berate President Clinton
over his extramarital affair, the Gore campaign has made it plain
that it saw Lieberman's religion and rectitude as an antidote to
Republican attempts to tie the vice president to Clinton's ethical
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has often tied his talk of faith to his criticism of
vulgarity in popular culture, a link he reiterated Sunday, and one
that allies him, both in fact and in the public mind, with Tipper
Gore's long-standing campaign against sex and violence in popular
music. Gore took up the call at the Democratic National Convention,
speaking against what he said was ``a culture with too much
meanness and not enough meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The stop at Fellowship Chapel was the first in a string of
events intended, in part, to appeal to traditionally Democratic
constituencies that have viewed Lieberman warily as perhaps too
conservative for their tastes. Sunday afternoon, after a rally in
Southfield, a Detroit suburb, he held a closed-door meeting with 30
prominent Arab-Americans at the Southfield Civic Center. On Monday,
he is scheduled to address a convention of the Communications
Workers of America, one of the country's largest labor unions, in
Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At the church Sunday morning, the Rev. Wendell Anthony,
president of the Detroit branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, gave an impassioned defense of the
senator's bona fides as a defender of black people's interests.
</P>
<P>
   He told of the summer Lieberman spent campaigning for voting
rights for blacks in Mississippi in 1963, when he was a student at
Yale, and of his attendance at the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s ``I have a dream'' speech that year in Washington. And he
read a letter Lieberman wrote at the time that was published in The
Yale Daily News, explaining his views on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with why he went to Mississippi, because he
got involved in our struggle,'' Anthony said. ``It does mean
something. I ain't read about no Bushes in Mississippi. I ain't
seen no Cheneys on no freedom marches.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, too, spoke of his work in Mississippi and told of
meeting Dr. King and Rosa Parks. He also effusively praised Rep.
John Conyers, who was in the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon rally, which included Sen. Carl Levin and Rep.
Debbie Stabenow, who is running for the Senate, Lieberman focused
on the Democrats' plans to set money aside to protect Medicare and
Social Security, and to provide prescription drug coverage under
Medicare. He accused Bush of ignoring those issues.

DNA OFFERS LINK TO BLACK HISTORY

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Add to the list of the wonders of DNA: the ability, in
the not-so-distant future, to help African-Americans figure out
where their ancestors probably came from before they were enslaved.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston this fall, some 300 African-American schoolchildren
are to be sent home with swabs to gather DNA samples from inside
the mouths of their relatives, part of a nascent project that a
local molecular biologist hopes to extend to North Carolina and
other sites with longstanding African-American populations.
</P>
<P>
   At Howard University in Washington, a geneticist announced last
spring that he would offer DNA analysis, possibly as early as this
summer, to African-Americans wanting to find out their ancestors'
homelands, at $200 or $300 per test. He has since withdrawn that
price and moved his starting date to next year.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, the African Burial Ground project has been
assembling a database of the DNA of African-Americans buried long
ago on what is now the site of an office building. The project has
also been gathering the DNA of living Africans to help determine
where those buried on the site might have come from. It is open to
expanding the database to help the living find their past, project
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely the ability to ``show reasonably accurate
probabilities of association'' between living African-Americans and
African cultures will be possible in two years or so, given enough
financing, said Dr. Michael L. Blakey, director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts may be disparate, but this much seems clear:
Powerful new gene technology is being enlisted in black Americans'
search for their African ancestry, and it promises some answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest travesty for African-Americans is not the
diseases we suffer, not the sickle-cell and high blood pressure,
nor is it the social injustices we have to face; it is that we are
disconnected from our beginnings,'' said Bruce Jackson, director of
the biotechnology and DNA forensics programs at Massachusetts Bay
Community College, and the leader of the project that is to involve
Boston schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no connection to where we came from,'' Jackson said,
``and that is an affliction which has followed us for centuries. It
really has to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the DNA projects is that analysts can look for
telltale sequences in African-Americans' genes that also appear in
the current populations of various African regions, and thus link
the Americans to their probable point of origin.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists emphasize, however, that this DNA analysis is not
enough to provide decisive evidence for a link to a homeland and
that other fields of knowledge are essential, including history and
ethnology; also it will take time to develop the extensive
databases needed to encompass enough people and enough areas of
Africa. Researchers are tapping their African colleagues for help
in gathering those data.
</P>
<P>
   Such limitations contributed to some of the hubbub that arose in
recent months over the publicized plans of Rick Kittles, a
geneticist at Howard University, to offer individual DNA-based
origin-finding to African-Americans for a fee. In newspaper reports
last spring, he was quoted as saying that it would cost $200 or
$300 and would perhaps begin this summer; A Web site,
www.africanancestry.com, promotes the project.
</P>
<P>
   Objections arose from many quarters, including scientists who
said the databases could not yet provide findings meaningful enough
to market. Others argued that it was immoral to charge victims of
slavery for determining their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey of the African Burial Ground Project, where Kittles had
worked until last year, warned that the database still had major
gaps and technical problems. He also expressed unease about the
seeming commercial nature of Kittles' African Ancestry project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly seems to be a questionable matter that a former
researcher should take part of our program currently in development
and do what he is doing,'' Blakey said of Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   In general, said Thomas J. Parsons, the chief of research at the
Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, who is not involved in
the projects, such databases are of scientific interest and
constitute ``a very interesting way of relating populations that
exist in the U.S. to potential progenitor populations in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   But consider, Parsons added, the limitations on what can be
learned from mitochondrial DNA, which is one of two types of DNA
that the projects are using, because they are passed down virtually
unchanged. The mitochondrial DNA goes from mother to daughter and
Y-chromosome DNA follows the male line.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, Parsons said, an African-American man is
seeking to trace his mitochondrial DNA to the lineage of his
great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, he may succeed, but that
woman would have contributed only one-128th of his genetic
composition. ``What that means in terms of who you are is: It's
only a small portion of a potentially giant admixture,'' the rest
of which would still be undetermined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles has also acknowledged that although the project is meant
to trace African origins, it is likely to turn up a great deal of
European lineage, because slave owners and other whites interbred
with African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles has declined interview requests in recent weeks.
University officials first said that he was too busy. Then they
said he could not comment because, as Donna Brock, a university
spokeswoman, put it, ``his work is incomplete and has not been
peer-reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittles did say a few words last week, when asked in a brief
telephone interview whether he would be working with Jackson, the
Boston molecular biologist. ``I'm not collaborating with him at all
as it relates to African-American ancestry,'' Kittles said. As for
his own project, Kittles said, ``We're still working out the
logistics, we're still working on the research.'' He did not
elaborate on what the financial arrangements would be.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely coming,'' he said of his project. ``If you
look at what I said before, it will do what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that he and Kittles had talked, and that he hoped
they could work together. Jackson is the head of what he called the
only degree-granting program in the United States on DNA forensic
science, at Massachusetts Bay Community College, and an assistant
professor at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had dreamed for years of creating a database that
could let him and other African-Americans find their genetic roots.
He had been crestfallen to read last spring that Kittles had
already begun such an effort, but he decided to proceed anyway, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plans to collect DNA samples from Boston as well as the
islands off North Carolina and other sites with centuries-old
African-American populations, he said, and to build a DNA database
with thousands of profiles. He is seeking money for the project
through grants and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have kids take an active part in determining their
ancestry and also get an interest in science at an age when they
can,'' Jackson said. ``We want to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be some time before anyone is likely to find matches in
the database, he said, but with the Boston schoolchildren, who are
participating as part of a voluntary after-school program, ``We'll
take a wild shot in the dark with them _ a prayerful shot in the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   At the African Burial Ground project, Blakey said the goal of
the DNA database was to analyze the remains of those buried. Once
that has been done, he said, the database ``will be available for
the people, as many members of the public had asked.''
</P>
<P>
   The African Burial Ground project is being financed by the
federal General Services Administration, which built the office
tower at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Blakey said, using DNA to indicate their origins
could prove healing for African-Americans and could ``help restore
the specifics of identity that were deliberately damaged by
slaveholders in order to make enslaved Africans seem less human.''

ISRAEL DEFENDS ATTACK ON FUGITIVE'S HIDEOUT THAT KILLED 3
SOLDIERS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ ``Friendly fire'' may have been responsible for
killing three Israeli soldiers in a bungled West Bank anti-terror
operation Saturday, Israeli officials acknowledged Sunday. But they
defended the late-night attack on the hide-out of a man accused of
terrorism who heads Israel's most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   The wanted man, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, fled during the assault to
the nearby Palestinian-governed city of Nablus, where he
surrendered to local security officials and remained in their
custody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud, a leader of the underground military wing of Hamas,
is held responsible by Israel for the deaths of 21 civilians in the
terrorist bombings of an outdoor food market and pedestrian mall in
downtown Jerusalem in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is also accused of plotting further attacks in a calculated
attempt to disrupt peace negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians, which are entering a critical and perhaps definitive
phase in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man, Abu Hanoud, whose capture and interception was the
objective of this operation, is responsible for the deaths of
dozens of people in the past,'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Sunday. Had Abu Hanoud remained at large, the prime minister said,
it ``would have placed the lives of dozens of Israeli citizens in
jeopardy in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Israel may request Abu Hanoud's extradition. But
Palestinian officials, irked at Israel's failure to inform them of
the raid, insisted that Abu Hanoud would be tried in Palestinian
courts and if convicted would be sent to a Palestinian jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis made a mistake and paid the price,'' said Jibril
Rajoub, the director of Palestinian security in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The raid involved hundreds of troops and was led by an
undercover Israeli brigade tht specializes in plainclothes work in
Arab communities. It took place in a northern West Bank village
near Nablus, called Asira al Shamaliya, where Palestinians run
their own municipal affairs but Israel retains ultimate security
control.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israeli officials had told their Palestinian counterparts
that they had identified Abu Hanoud's whereabouts, the two security
forces could have worked together to secure his arrest ``without
bloodshed,'' Rajoub asserted. A senior Palestinian security
official said Sunday night that Israel and the Palestinian
Authority have not yet had any high-level communications about the
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army officers confirmed Sunday that one soldier was
wounded in the raid by Israeli army fire and said they could not
rule out the possibility that all three solders who died were also
the victims of Israeli bullets. Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli
army chief of staff, said he had ordered an internal army inquiry
into the episode, which he tentatively attributed to planning
errors and the misidentification of undercover forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that some of the dead and the injured soldiers
were hit by friendly fire _ a grave and painful operational mishap
second to none,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   The three deaths constituted the worst loss of life by Israeli
security forces in the West Bank since 1996, when nine soldiers
died in clashes with Palestinian rioters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Mofaz and Barak vigorously defended the raid,
stressing that Abu Hanoud has been apprehended, along with other
accused members of the clandestine Hamas military wing. ``This
operation served to disrupt, put off and even thwart an operation
that was fully prepared, from the point of view of the Hamas
terrorists from the area in question, to be carried out,'' Mofaz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the awkward truth was that while the death of the
Israeli soldiers was a grievous embarrassment for the military _ as
well as a tragedy for the soldiers' friends and families _ it was
not the diplomatic disaster that was initially feared.
</P>
<P>
   If the soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen, as was
first reported late Saturday night, the concern here was that it
could have put an abrupt halt to the peace negotiations, reviving
Israeli distrust of Palestinian negotiating partners. It also would
have brought the already weakened Barak government under further
attack for an apparent inability to rout out terror cells in
collaboration with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Israeli officials took pains Sunday to praise the
security cooperation of the Palestinian Authority, which they
consider crucial to the near cessation of terrorist attacks against
Israelis over the past year and a half. They also expressed
confidence that the authority would prosecute Abu Hanoud, who poses
as much of a political threat to Yasser Arafat as he does to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that the fact that he was hit and later
captured by the Palestinians will disrupt Hamas activity and limit
their ability to carry out terror attacks in the near future,''
Mofaz said.

 &HT;    Streaking Wallace all smiles over win, team
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ The swagger is back for Rusty Wallace, winner
of Saturday night's Goracing.com500. So is the smile and the
cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is the hottest driver in the Winston Cup Series, winning
three of the last five races and finishing second at Indianapolis.
He isn't the points leader, but feels he has the best team in
Winston Cup right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago not to brag, but there's one thing I
can brag about; that's my team,'' Wallace said. ``Anytime you've
got eight poles . . . four wins this year and close to 2,000 laps
led, I'd have to say in my book they're the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has dominated the circuit this year. He is the leader in
victories and poles and has led twice as many laps (1,439) than the
next closest driver (Tony Stewart, 656).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can compare (this season) really close to 1993, when I won
10 races,'' Wallace said. ``But I think as tough as NASCAR is
nowadays, that this year is more dominating than that year was in
'93. I'm just really proud of those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The only numbers that do not favor Wallace are the most
important _ the Winston Cup points standings. He is fifth, 290
points behind leader Bobby Labonte, with 11 races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's too late to get back in the battle,''
Wallace said. ``Right now, unfortunately, we're taking baby steps
at it, because the other (drivers) just won't break or blow up.
That's what we need to happen. They need to have some bad luck like
I had mine early (this year).
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, if we just keep trucking along and giving them
everything they can stand until the year's over . . . if we don't
make it to the head table, we'll hopefully make it close.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Wallace was the runner-up to Dale Earnhardt for
the Winston Cup championship. Wallace's only title was in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   While Labonte has been a model of consistency this season,
Wallace has not _ and it is not all the driver's fault. He blew an
engine while leading at Talladega with 72 laps to go. He was part
of bad decisions at Martinsville and the first Pocono race.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also has failed to take advantage of numerous pole
positions. Saturday night's race was the first time he started and
finished in the No. 1 position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got a win by sitting on the pole,'' Wallace said.
``In fact, when I got the pole the other day, a couple of people
around me said, `I don't know if this is bad luck or not.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we finally broke it.''

NEW ECONOMY: SKY-HIGH GERMAN TELECOM AUCTION RANKLES SOME BIDDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It was a free-market contest of the purest
sort, an airwave auction of the kind pioneered in the United States
and taken to dizzying new heights in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ever since the bidding ended on Aug. 17 in Germany's auction
of wireless licenses for so-called third-generation mobile
networks, even devoted market enthusiasts have started to wonder if
this is really the most rational way to go.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks and 173 rounds of bidding, six companies had bid
a total $46 billion for the rights to one license apiece. And that
total did not include an additional $4 billion or so that each
company would have to spend to build the new networks and drum up
customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been reeling, dumping the stocks of all the
winners: Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, British
Telecommunications, France Telecom, Telefonica of Spain and Sonera
of Finland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, warned that it
would probably lower most of the companies' credit ratings and
might even drop some to the triple-B level, not much better than
junk-bond status. Bond investors are bracing for a flood of
gigantic telephone bond offerings, but the uncertainties were high
enough that British Telecommunications postponed an offering last
week until its rating was clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, wireless opportunities are immense. Europe is well
ahead of the United States in rolling out digital wireless
telephones, and the new licenses will be used to offer high-speed
data communications that are eventually expected to galvanize
mobile electronic commerce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, the new third-generation mobile networks will
enable people to surf the Internet from a sidewalk, download video
clips onto their hand-held phones or simply locate a nearby
restaurant and book a table.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows what consumers will really want or how much
they will be ready to pay. And because the new systems will
increase competition in ordinary mobile phone service, analysts
predict that prices and profitability in voice service will decline
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists argue that risks are simply part of the game. If
companies overbid, they may have to fold tent and sell their
licenses to someone else at a loss. The world will go on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the German auctions also uncovered deep fissures in the
European telecommunications landscape that make the entire playing
field uneven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have all held auctions, won
by a variety of European players. But Spain and Finland, using a
so-called beauty contest approach, simply awarded licenses to
companies deemed most worthy. The licenses, granted primarily to
domestic applicants, came at a fraction of the price they might
have fetched at auction. France will hold a beauty contest, too,
but will charge a flat fee of about $4 billion a license.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives complain that companies from countries with very
low license costs can save billions at home and then plow the money
into auctions elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a level playing field in Europe,'' said Hans
Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom. ``We had to compete in
the bidding against companies like Telefonica from Spain, but we
were excluded from the Spanish market.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of auctions argue that they are the most effective way
to put licenses in the hands of those most likely to use them
profitably. Compared with beauty contests, auctions give the
participants no opportunity to exploit political connections or
bedazzle government bureaucrats with lofty promises that can later
be broken. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both the British and German auctions were open. But one of the
surprise winners in the German auction _ a bidder that Deutsche
Telekom and Vodafone both tried and failed to eliminate _ was a
group controlled by Telefonica of Spain and Sonera of Finland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish and Finnish companies had received new wireless
licenses at negligible costs from their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom bid for a license earlier this year in Spain,
where the license fees were relative peanuts: about $130 million
and 0.15 percent of future revenues. Deutsche Telekom teamed up in
the beauty contest with Jazztel, a fast-growing Spanish competitor
to Telefonica, but the team lost to three Spanish operators and a
fourth group led by Vivendi of France.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Finland, Pirjo Kekalainen-Torvinen, Sonera's senior vice
president for international business development, said her company
had not unfairly benefited by getting a Finnish license almost
free. ``We paid as much for our license in Germany as anybody
else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Finland had strong policy reasons for awarding
wireless licenses as cheaply as possible. Finland, home to Nokia,
the world's biggest wireless phone producer, Nokia, considers
wireless technology its biggest national industry. By giving out
next-generation wireless licenses as quickly and cheaply as
possible, government officials hope to promote and indirectly
subsidize innovative new technology and services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives blame Deutsche Telekom itself for the
high prices of the German licenses. Gerhard Schmid, chief executive
of Mobilcom, which was awarded a license in the auction, angrily
complained that the six final bidders could have ended up with the
same licenses and saved billions of dollars if they had simply
stopped bidding four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid blamed Deutsche Telekom for a misguided attempt to outbid
the Spanish-Finnish group for an extra license, a move that would
have reduced the number of rivals from six to five. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Telefonica and Sonera refused to give up, and Deutsche
Telekom executives capitulated after the total bidding had climbed
from 30 billion euros ($27.1 billion) to 50.5 billion euros. The
result was higher license prices and more licensees than most
investors had been expecting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors pummeled shares of Sonera and Telefonica
even more than they did those of Deutsche Telekom. Yet when Italy
begins auctions later this year, Deutsche Telekom plans to stay
out, saying it has no interest in Italy. But Telefonica and Sonera,
exuberant after their German adventure, plan to team up again.

BUNNY AUSTIN, 94, A PIONEER IN TENNIS SHORTS
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bunny Austin, an outstanding English player who introduced
shorts to tennis, died Saturday in a nursing home in Coulsdon,
England. He was 94 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Short pants or long, Austin was one of the world's
highest-ranked players in the decade before World War II. He and
the more celebrated Fred Perry led Britain to four consecutive
Davis Cup championships, defeating France in the challenge round in
1933, the United States in 1934 and 1935, and Australia in 1936.
After that, Perry turned professional for a $50,000 guarantee, and
Britain has not won the Davis Cup since.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, whose given name was Henry Wilfred, compiled a career
record of 36-12 in Davis Cup singles. In the four championship
years, his 15-3 record included victories over Don Budge, Wilmer
Allison, Sidney Wood and Frank Shields of the United States and
Jack Crawford of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 9 inches and 132 pounds, Austin was slim, quick and
graceful. His fluid strokes helped him to a world top 10 ranking
for 11 consecutive years, starting in 1928. He was ranked second in
the world in 1931 and 1938. In major tournaments, he was the
runner-up at Wimbledon in 1932 and 1938 and in the French
championship in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   When Austin started playing tennis, men wore long, heavy white
flannel trousers, no matter how hot it was. ``Fred Perry and I were
playing in the doubles at Longwood, and it was terribly hot,''
Austin told The Boston Globe in 1997, referring to a match at the
club in Brookline, Mass. ``I came off the court in those
sweat-soaked trousers feeling I was carrying an awfully lot of
unnecessary weight below my knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his days as a soccer player, Austin added: ``I
wasn't very big. I'd been a football player in school _ Repton and
Cambridge _ and of course we wore shorts. Best thing for running.
Why not for tennis? We went to New York for the singles at Forest
Hills, and I bought a pair and wore them. I got a lot of kidding,
but the wisdom of it was apparent. The next year, I introduced them
at Wimbledon. I expected a fuss there, but there was none. Slowly,
others followed. I don't know why we put up with long flannel
trousers for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin's innovation shocked the staid sport. John Kieran wrote
in The New York Times, ``With his white linen hat and his flannel
shorts, the little English player looked like an A.A. Milne
production.'' But at Wimbledon, King George V and Queen Mary
accepted the change without comment, and soon other men, and then
women, led by the American Helen Hull Jacobs, started wearing
shorts, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, Austin wrote in The Daily Mail of London that tennis
would have to take second place to business in his future plans
because he did not want to be ``a useless old man living in a
one-roomed flat.'' But he continued playing until he cut back to
help publicize the moral rearmament movement. With war seemingly
inevitable, he joined such other British athletes as the runners
Harold Abrahams and Sidney Wooderson, the golfer Bernard Darwin,
the cricketer Len Hutton and the jockey Gordon Richards in calling
for ``moral rearmament through sport.'' In 1940, with the blessing
of the British government, Austin moved to the United States to
continue the program to promote world peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all of us faced with the possible end of
civilization,'' he said. ``War threatened my wife, my daughter, my
parents and all I cared about with destruction. It seemed uncanny
to think of putting my baby daughter in a gas-proof tent.''
</P>
<P>
   His work was endorsed publicly by U.S. sports figures like Babe
Ruth, Henry Armstrong, Glenn Cunningham, Joe DiMaggio, Carl
Hubbell, Bobby Jones, Connie Mack, Jesse Owens and Gene Tunney. But
he and other resident aliens were subject to the draft, and in 1943
he was inducted into the U.S. Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, he married Phyllis Konstam, a British actress. She died
in 1976. They had a daughter, Jennifer, and a son, John.
</P>
<P>
   Austin was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame
in Newport, R.I., in 1997. He was confined to a wheelchair and
unable to attend, ``even though,'' he said, ``I'm a kid at the
nursing home where I live. Several plus-100s are among my
housemates.''

HARMFUL DEFENSE CUTS BEGAN UNDER CLINTON, CHENEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Cheney acknowledged Sunday that the military cutbacks he
and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have campaigned against began when
he was defense secretary for Bush's father, but he blamed the
Clinton administration for making ``far deeper'' cuts that he said
had left the military ``in decline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to this question of when the cuts started, we
obviously began reductions as the Cold War ended in 1990 and '91,
in the aftermath of Desert Storm,'' Cheney said Sunday on ABC's
``This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' one of three
morning talk shows he appeared on Sunday to discuss military
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we started with a reduction of 25 percent in force
structure,'' Cheney continued. ``They've gone far beyond that. The
number of divisions in the U.S. Army has gone from 18 to 10. The
number of wings in the Air Force has gone from 24 to 13. The number
of ships in the Navy has gone from almost 600, now headed to less
than 300. So they've cut far deeper, Sam, than anything anticipated
during my watch in the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have seized on the issue of military strength
since Bush told the Republican National Convention earlier this
month that the military is ``low on pay, parts and morale.'' He
said that two divisions of the Army were not ready for duty _ a
claim rebutted by the Pentagon, which said that two units had been
unprepared last fall, when soldiers were deployed in Bosnia and
Kosovo, but were now ``combat ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney echoed many of Bush's assertions Sunday, saying that the
armed forces suffered from low morale, unreadiness and difficulty
recruiting and retaining personnel. ``I think if you match our
forces today up against any others around the world, we've got the
best force,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``The problem is
it's in decline, and this administration has done very little to
reverse that decline.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly criticized Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
presidential nominee, for disputing the Bush campaign's assessment,
saying, ``the only conclusion I can draw from Al Gore's comments
about all this is that either he doesn't know what's going on in
the U.S. military, or he chooses not to tell the truth about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign took exception to this. ``I think Bush and
Cheney have lost all credibility on the defense issue,'' said Doug
Hattaway, a campaign spokesman. ``America has the strongest, most
capable fighting force in the whole world. Cheney has already
admitted that the military downsizing began under the
Bush-Quayle-Cheney administration. The Clinton-Gore administration
stopped this free fall and enacted the largest military investment
since Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Cheney, said that no
one had more credibility on military issues than Cheney, who, as
secretary of defense for President Bush, oversaw the Gulf War.
``Vice President Gore is trying to sweep the military preparedness
issue under the rug so he can be held blameless,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On all three morning programs, Cheney was asked about an issue
that has dogged him in recent weeks: the fact that upon his
retirement this month as the head of the Halliburton Co., an oil
services company, he was given millions of dollars' worth of stock
options that he cannot exercise for more than a year _ giving him a
potential conflict of interest if he is elected vice president,
since he will literally have a vested interest in the price of
Halliburton stock.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his assertions that he will do whatever is necessary
to avoid any conflict of interest, saying that he had ``smart
people'' working on the problem and that his options ranged from
giving any increase in the value of the stock to charity to
maneuvering so the price of the stock could be fixed before he
enters office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' if he would consider giving up
the stock options that have not vested, Cheney said: ``Well, I'd
like not to have to give away all my assets in order to serve the
public. I don't think that's required; it shouldn't be.''

 &HT;    FORESTS FIRE RISK PROGRAM(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JUDD SLIVKA(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has seized upon a Flagstaff-area
fire-danger reduction program as a possible national model for the
country's fire-ravaged forests. But even some locals involved in
the plan say it's not the sweeping success the administration would
like to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The forest-thinning plan is being touted to Congress and the
public as way to make forests more fire resistant - in effect, to
undo 100 years of uninformed forest management, decisions that have
left the nation's forests snarled with underbrush and thick with
diseased trees.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan has critics - even among those instrumental in
designing and implementing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hesitant about calling it a success right now, because
we've made so little progress on the ground,'' says Brad Ack,
executive director of the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership, the
coalition that developed the plan. ``We have the foundations of
success, but we're a long way from being there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those foundations were laid after the severe fire summer of
1996. A coalition of groups - the Grand Canyon Trust, Arizona
Public Service Co. and Northern Arizona University among them -
worked with the U.S. Forest Service to begin rehabilitating the
area's crowded, diseased fire-hazard forests.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was not to make forests fireproof. It was to make the
forests more closely resemble the way they were before the massive
migrations of Manifest Destiny - and the desire for homes in
bucolic settings - changed the way humans interacted with ponderosa
pine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that meant thinning forests out, selectively taking out
younger, less fire-resistant trees that fire could crawl up and
prey on. It means increasing the space between trees, letting grass
grow again in between them and introducing low-intensity fires back
into the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Works in some places
</P>
<P>
   It's worked before. This summer's ``Pumpkin'' fire was racing
along the crowns of trees in a densely wooded area, until it
reached a place that had been previously thinned.
</P>
<P>
   There the fire dived to the ground like a bird after a worm. The
trees ended up crispy, but not cooked. Most will live.
</P>
<P>
   But it also hasn't worked. In the fires currently burning in
Montana, flames have rampaged through areas that have been thinned
out by logging companies.
</P>
<P>
   Because lumber companies have long been the beneficiary of
thinning contracts, the practice is also anathema to many
environmentalists. Groups such as the Santa Fe-based Forest
Guardians have taken a no-thinning stance, a position going back to
the days when the U.S. Forest Service let timber companies run
roughshod over the nation's public forests.
</P>
<P>
   Using the National Environmental Protection Act, the Guardians
have successfully blocked timber sales and thinning across the
Southwest. Only in recent weeks has the group grudgingly
acknowledged that thinning might be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strategy that has no offense is a strategy that is doomed to
fail,'' said Ack, who works with the Grand Canyon Trust on Canyon
issues as well as heading up the partnership. ``The people saying
(don't cut) are people without offense. They say `We need to keep
bad things from happening.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, saying `We need to keep bad things from happening,' just
isn't good enough anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership's most ambitious project: treating 1,300 acres
in the Fort Valley area near Flagstaff. Marking different sizes of
trees to be logged out by contractors. Increasing space in the
forest, bringing it back to ``pre-settlement'' conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Objection to logging
</P>
<P>
   A good plan, the partnership agreed. Then the lawsuit happened.
Filed by Forest Guardians and several other groups, the suit was
designed to stop the thinning.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardians and local critics have objected to the logging and
to the 10,000-acre size of the Fort Valley plot, and have used the
National Environmental Protection Act to slow the process.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a year later, only 300 acres - a test area exempted from
administrative appeals - has been treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is that all those months and all that
(court-ordered) work didn't change the science in the document,''
Ack said. ``All we did was make it bulletproof for the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns linger. The Sierra Club's Sharon Galbreath has been a
longtime critic of the plan. The Sierra Club is planning a lawsuit
to protect those nests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should commend them (the Partnership) for some things, like
saying `no more old-growth forests should be cut,''' Galbreath
said. ``But the larger the tests become, it just turns into another
timber sale.''
</P>
<P>
   When the partnership was created, no one envisioned a
presidential administration seizing the small gains it made as a
banner to wave over the charred landscape - something that is
``going to keep Congress from breathing down their necks,'' Ack
said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Flagstaff plan has been a success. Observers
note that to get the Grand Canyon Trust and other participants
working with corporations and the national forest system is a no
small feat.

CLINTON'S VISIT SENDS CARTAGENA INTO A FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ At age 84, Antonia Sarmiento, nearly
toothless and dressed in tattered rags, has seen a lot of tragedy
in her life but never a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mayor Gina Benedetti de Velez knocked at the door of her
disheveled clapboard shack last week to say the local government
would rebuild her house for no charge. President Clinton would be
visiting the House of Justice across the street, the mayor
explained, and he should not have to see such misery in Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is a saint brought to me from heaven,'' said a
smiling Sarmiento, a widow of a police officer who lives with a
disabled son on the charity of family members. Watching workers
struggle to complete the front facade in time for Clinton's visit
Wednesday, she added, ``I'd love to invite him inside for a bowl of
sancocho'' _ a stew of chicken, potatoes and plantains _ ``but he
would never visit a house like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since local officials learned a month ago that Clinton would be
coming to this splendid Spanish colonial port of soaring church
steeples and mounted cannons, they have rushed into a breathless
urban renewal campaign perhaps not seen since Sir Francis Drake
sacked the city in 1586. A thousand workers are widening sidewalks,
fixing cracked streets, whitewashing government buildings and
planting palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important event in Cartagena's history since
President Bush came here in 1990,'' Benedetti said. ``But this is
even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit here to a regional presidential anti-narcotics
conference _ with the usual bevy of reporters and camera crews _
helped bring a 34 percent increase in tourists the following year,
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of tourists has decreased because of the
country's expanding war with Marxist guerrilla groups, to 535,103
tourists in Cartagena last year from 865,379 in 1994. So people
here are hoping this visit will cause another surge in tourism,
this city's most important industry.
</P>
<P>
   Benedetti is lobbying to urge Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea,
to ride through the old city in a horse-drawn carriage, Cartagena's
answer to Venice's gondolas, to show off its quaint narrow streets
shaded by rococo balconies draped by lush tropical flowers. She
also hopes to have a word with Clinton to press him to include an
exception for Cartagena to the State Department travel advisory
warning that Colombia is an exceptionally risky place for American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   No detail has been left to chance to create the perfect pictures
and sound bites. About 150 homeless children have been removed from
the streets to ``recreational centers'' on the outskirts of the
city, and 1,500 kiosk owners have been told to haul their rickety
wares off the presidential route on Tuesday and Wednesday. One
thoroughfare along the beach _ which taxi drivers have taken to
renaming Avenida Clinton _ has been closed entirely for a complete
repaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a girl fixing up her house for her boyfriend's first
visit,'' noted El Tiempo, Bogota's leading newspaper, ``and asking
that her parents and brothers behave themselves to make the best
impression.''
</P>
<P>
   The round-the-clock grooming effort will cost the city $1
million _ a handsome sum for a city with a total annual budget of
$160 million _ to fix up the route Clinton will take in his
eight-hour visit. And that does not count the contributions being
made by the local telephone, electric and water companies to fix up
damaged pipes, street holes and faulty wiring, or the efforts of
store owners, who are washing down everything from their curtains
to welcome mats.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit has produced an almost giddy response from
Cartagena residents, who seem to never tire of telling visitors
that they live in an ``oasis'' far from the kidnappings and
massacres that characterize the rest of the country. (Actually,
crime and violence in Cartagena are well below other Colombian
cities, and there have not been any major acts of violence since
two Medellin Cartel bombings here in 1989.)
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's visit will show the world that not all
Colombians are bad,'' said Dimas Ortiz Rondono, 58, a lottery
ticket seller who wears a row of rosary beads around his neck and
works beside the old slave market in the Plaza de los Coches, which
Clinton is scheduled to visit. ``And then the tourists will flock
back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   As Victor Prieto Castro, a 53-year-old reporter for the local
Victoria AM radio station, looked for foreign correspondents to
interview, he appeared excited about covering the biggest story to
come his way in some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy this kind of publicity,'' he said, ``We couldn't
be happier. This trip is going to give Colombia a whole new
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Cartagena residents are so certain a one-day visit by
Clinton will make a lasting difference for a country that has
suffered four decades of conflict or for a Caribbean tourist
destination that most cruise-ship companies would just as soon pass
on to keep their passengers calm. Some even express concerns that
the president could attract some terrorist attack, that would ruin
the city's reputation forever.
</P>
<P>
   Leonor Sanchez, a 40-year-old guide at the Palace of the
Inquisition, said she was happy Clinton was scheduled to visit the
Plaza de Bolivar outside the palace. But she said she was not sure
it was a good idea that Clinton visit the building's torture
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the dark side of Colombia's history, when power was
terribly abused,'' said Sanchez, a jolly lady with an encyclopedic
knowledge of the old ways of stretching and mutilating bodies. ``He
could get the bad impression that we have always been a violent
country.''

NEW ECONOMY: SKY-HIGH GERMAN TELECOM AUCTION RANKLES SOME BIDDERS  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After two weeks and 173 rounds of bidding
in Germany's auction of wireless licenses for so-called
third-generation mobile networks, six companies had bid a total $46
billion for the rights to one license apiece. And that total did
not include an additional $4 billion or so that each company would
have to spend to build the new networks and drum up customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been reeling, dumping the stocks of all the
winners: Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, British
Telecommunications, France Telecom, Telefonica of Spain and Sonera
of Finland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, warned that it
would probably lower most of the companies' credit ratings and
might even drop some to the triple-B level, not much better than
junk-bond status.
</P>
<P>
   The German auctions also uncovered deep fissures in the European
telecommunications landscape that make the entire playing field
uneven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have all held auctions, won
by a variety of European players. But Spain and Finland, using a
so-called beauty contest approach, simply awarded licenses to
companies deemed most worthy. The licenses, granted primarily to
domestic applicants, came at a fraction of the price they might
have fetched at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives complain that companies from countries with very
low license costs can save billions at home and then plow the money
into auctions elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a level playing field in Europe,'' said Hans
Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Both the British and German auctions were open. But one of the
surprise winners in the German auction _ a bidder that Deutsche
Telekom and Vodafone both tried and failed to eliminate _ was a
group controlled by Telefonica of Spain and Sonera of Finland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish and Finnish companies had received new wireless
licenses at negligible costs from their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Kekalainen-Torvinen, Sonera's senior vice president for
international business development, said her company had not
unfairly benefited by getting a Finnish license almost free. ``We
paid as much for our license in Germany as anybody else,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives blame Deutsche Telekom itself for the
high prices of the German licenses. Gerhard Schmid, chief executive
of Mobilcom, which was awarded a license in the auction, angrily
complained that the six final bidders could have ended up with the
same licenses and saved billions of dollars if they had simply
stopped bidding four days earlier.

POLAND FINDS ITSELF THE BORDER COP OF WEST EUROPE

   NIEZNANY BOR, Poland _ This is the border where Europe ends.
</P>
<P>
   In this little spot named ``the unknown forest,'' near
Bialowieza, is Poland's frontier with Belarus, which will soon
become the European Union's border with the wild, untamable,
unreformed east.
</P>
<P>
   Today you can walk into Belarus, at least for 100 yards or so.
Then you hit the border fences, with their electronic sensors and a
raked area to capture footprints, designed by the Soviet Union to
keep out even its allies the Poles.
</P>
<P>
   But Belarus is beginning to take down this Cold War barrier,
even as the European Union is urging the Poles to put up a new,
post-Communist one as part of the price of membership.
</P>
<P>
   Europe _ Germany and Austria most vocally _ want the Poles to
build what some are calling the ``Belgian Curtain,'' after the
country where the European Union has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Poles like it or not, much of the burden of blocking
illegal trade and immigration into the European Union will fall on
them. That will do real damage to the active cross-border trade
that helps keep this poorest part of Poland alive.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily agricultural, with little industry, this area east and
southeast of Bialystok has an average income only about 65 percent
of the national average, and a lot of hidden unemployment on the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Russian ruble collapsed in 1998, there was an enormous
amount of cross-border trade, with easterners bringing cheap vodka
to sell here, buying Polish and European products to sell at home,
then returning with more overvalued rubles with which to buy. Now
the ``suitcase trade'' is recovering along with the ruble, just as
Europe is pressing Poland to lock down the border.
</P>
<P>
   Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Poland's prime minister until the end
of 1997, represents this area in Parliament, and he urges a soft
border regime that would allow families and small traders to
continue to cross with as little hindrance as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst would be to apply European standards to this border
and then have terra incognita on the other side of the wall,'' he
said, making a political argument, too, about the spread of ideas
and freedom, as a small eagle circled overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to improve conditions on the other side,'' he said.
``Of course we have to control pathological aspects like crime and
illegal immigration, but not to stifle trade. But why should we
build a wall with our neighbors? We must rearrange Schengen not to
build too strong a border here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Schengen agreement allows people and goods to move
freely within the European Union without border checks, making it
vital to control the external borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the new outlying frontier of the European Union, Poland
will be in a very uncomfortable position,'' said Krzysztof
Bledowski, chief economist for the brokers Wood &AMP; Co. ``It will
have both the good and the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland will be a magnet and clearinghouse for trade, he said,
but also for more crime and smuggling along the long land border of
people, drugs and goods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bialowieza Forest, a national park here, is some of the
last remaining primeval forest in Europe, 12,350 acres with
lindens, maples, oak, spruce and ash _ strictly regulated now, full
of fox and lynx, bison and roe deer. Nearby, Cimoszewicz has
secured a hunting cabin, which he is refurbishing, combining
politicking with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But already, says the chief forester, Jerzy Lugowoj, tunnels
have been discovered under the Belarussian border fences, and at
least some illegal immigrants, including Afghans and Vietnamese,
have been captured.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's economy is growing at nearly 6 percent a year, while
Ukraine and Belarus have been stumbling backward. The average wage
in Ukraine is about $50 a month and in Poland nearly $400, so the
attraction of any kind of job in Poland, even temporary, is vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Witold M. Orlowski, of the Independent Center for Economic
Studies, specializes in the border question. The difference in
income levels between Poland and its eastern neighbors is now much
bigger than the difference between Poland and eastern Germany,
which is about 2.5 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   So Poland must satisfy its future European partners about its
ability to stop the smuggling of goods and people into the ``Europe
without borders'' while it is also trying to make life better for
those in Belarus and Ukraine to the east, to reduce the growing
economic divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends on what the River Bug will be in the
future,'' Orlowski said. ``Will it be the Rio Grande or the St.
Lawrence Seaway?'' _ in other words, will Poland's relationship
with the east be more like that of the United States with Mexico or
with Canada?
</P>
<P>
   This border is actually relatively new, formalized in Yalta
after the end of World War II, when Stalin got what he wanted in
Eastern Europe _ including a chunk of Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The former unity of the area is obvious in the architecture and
the skyline. There are many Russian Orthodox churches, including a
huge modern cathedral in nearby Hajnowka, the Church of the Holy
Trinity, consecrated in 1992 after nearly 20 years of construction.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Roman Catholic Poland meets Eastern Orthodoxy.
Hajnowka has almost twice as many Russian Orthodox as Roman
Catholics, and in outlying areas, the percentage who are Orthodox
is even higher. The border divides families, and as many as 500,000
ethnic Poles live on the other side of the border, and 300,000
Belarussians on this side.
</P>
<P>
   But while Poland feels it has an eastern vocation, arguing
within the European Union and NATO for better relations and special
ties with Belarus and Ukraine, Cimoszewicz says, the Europeans are
not particularly interested.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europeans are reconciled to a larger European Union that
swallows large Poland and other countries of Central and Eastern
Europe, a European Union ambassador said. ``But if you want to kill
support in the E.U. for expansion and enlargement, just talk of
Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What worries the Western Europeans as much as illegal
immigration is the smuggling of shoddy goods and unclean food, he
said, and Europe is pushing for big improvements in the Polish
customs service, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Poles will finally do what is necessary and apply full visa
regulations to Russians, Ukrainians and Belarussians as the
European Union is demanding, the ambassador said, as the Czechs
have already done.
</P>
<P>
   Orlowski says that despite the sometimes cogent arguments of
people like Cimoszewicz, Poland has no choice. With 70 percent of
its trade now with the European Union and only 10 percent with the
countries of the former Soviet Union, he said, Poland's future lies
with Europe and the West, not with the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans are drawing the borderline of Europe for the
next 50 years and don't care about Ukraine, Belarus and Russia,''
he said. ``We think it's wrong, but what can we do? We don't really
have an option.''

<P>
   Yahoo Inc., given the opportunity to buy a controlling interest
in the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, turned it down last week _ not
because it couldn't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo felt that since it is not a subscription-based company,
owning one team might offend other sports teams and restrict
Yahoo's ability to do business with them as an Internet portal,'' a
source told the Toronto Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
   One of the incentives pitched to Yahoo for buying the team is
the ability to market Canadiens merchandise globally on the Net.
All NHL on-line merchandise goes through NHL.com with revenue

DODGERS DO THE RIGHT THING
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Give it up to the Dodgers for heroically doing
what they had to do: Kiss and make up with the coupla over-made-up
tongue wrasslers for stupidly tossing 'em out into the Ravine just
because snooty folks around them complained about their overzealous
reaction to a Darren Dreifort home run.
</P>
<P>
   He does have that effect on some people.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, flinching to avoid the threat of a civil suit opens
up a whole new gooey mess.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move, donating a buncha tickets to some gay and lesbian
organizations, putting security people through sensitivity training
and giving the gals a pair of really cool seats behind home plate
for a game next week.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the latter. It'll make getting that Cecil B. Demented
girl-on-girl stuff on Diamondvision that much easier.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Dodgers are now so aroused as to orchestrate a
``Lesbian Appreciation Day,'' just wait'll the backlash in the name
of equal rights, equal treatment, equal representation.
</P>
<P>
   If fans run onto the field and moon a player (or unmotivated
manager) at their own discretion, is security now inhibiting their
right to free cheek speech?
</P>
<P>
   If that fellow who won ``Survivor'' is told he can't go prancing
through the pavilion buck naked, is his right to bare arms, legs
and saggy midsection being obstructed?
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those greasy poles we keep hearing about and really
don't wanna go sliding down. Not ourselves, that is.
</P>

   Meredith Kott and Danielle Goldey, a.k.a The Lesbians, they made
their point. But they also gotta realize they just can't go puttin'
on spit-swappin' exhibitions in the name of bring-it-on First
Amendment issues.

Girls,'' ``Sinful Desires,'' ``Knight in Shining Panties,'' ``Far

<TEXT>
<P>
   At his small suite of offices in Fort Lee, N.J., David Chang was
a tycoon without much to do.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 56, often rode to work in a Rolls-Royce and strode
through the door in a long mink coat, a cigarette dangling from his
lips. But although his holding company boasted of big, global deals
in everything from oil exploration to telecommunications, almost
none of those ventures ever got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really saw anybody there do anything,'' said Clark R.
Wilcox, a former banking executive who was hired to help run the
firm in 1997, only to quit soon after and successfully sue his
former employer for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, Chang cut a different figure. There he
attended state dinners at the White House and visited informally
with the president. He hired President Clinton's chief fund-raiser
as a consultant, and cultivated senators and congressmen from both
parties. The chairman of his company, a retired Navy admiral, had
been chief of staff to George Bush when he was vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of Chang's popularity among American politicians was
no secret: He and his employees gave generously to favored
candidates and their parties _ more than 100 contributions,
totaling $325,000. Chang also pledged at least $1 million toward
the presidential library that Clinton hopes to build in Little
Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's activities finally caught the attention of federal
campaign-finance investigators, who learned that he was spending
more money on politicians than he was reporting in taxable income.
In June he pleaded guilty to channeling over $53,000 in illegal
contributions to one of the Democratic Party's most important
fund-raisers, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chang is at the center of a widening federal inquiry into
the possibility that Torricelli's 1996 campaign staff may have been
complicit in Chang's illegal donations _ something the senator
strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the case say Chang has given prosecutors
information suggesting that Torricelli's aides accounted improperly
for some of his contributions, and at least two dozen FBI agents
have been added to the inquiry in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli and other politicians now cast Chang as an
unscrupulous con man, and themselves as his unwitting victims.
Through his Washington lawyer, Chang declined to comment. But
Chang's credibility is likely to be a central issue in any new case
that is brought.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of Chang _ drawn from interviews, court records and a
thick file of lawsuits by and against him _ shows a man of glaring,
sometimes comical contradictions: He claims to have been educated
at England's best schools but speaks broken English; his closest
business contacts included communist officials from North Korea and
a former Republican congressman from New Jersey; he rallied
American politicians to help him buy a billion-dollar South Korean
insurance company but never had even a small fraction of the money
he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a guy like Chang can get hooked up with all these
people?'' asked Wilcox, his former employee. ``As a citizen, quite
frankly, it makes me very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   As a businessman, many of his former employees say, Chang
generated all sorts of ambitious schemes but almost no apparent
profit. Though he has owned large houses, expensive cars and the
235-room Fort Lee Hilton hotel, just across the George Washington
Bridge from New York City, it is unclear where he has gotten his
money, large chunks of which have arrived in wire transfers from
abroad, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   And while Chang's generosity won him many attentive friends in
Washington, it did not buy him all the political favors he sought.
His most important request, that the Clinton administration help
him win repayment of tens of millions of dollars that he said he
was owed by North Korea for grain shipments, made almost no
progress at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anything go wrong?'' said a spokesman for Clinton, Jake
Seiwert. ``His proposals were neither accepted nor acted upon. What
he wanted to do didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the story of Chang's education in money politics is a
remarkable chapter in the saga of Washington influence bought and
sold. In a world of fund-raiser business executives, deal-savvy
senators and retired officials who increasingly exploit their
connections abroad, Chang was a magnet for the powerful _ even
after he was publicly identified as having given illegal donations
to two different election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Contradictions
</P>
<P>
   Who David Chang is has been difficult to ascertain.
</P>
<P>
   At a bail hearing earlier this year, prosecutors noted that
Chang had used at least two passports and three Social Security
numbers, listed two different birthplaces and three different birth
dates, and was married to two women at the same time _ not
including a reputed girlfriend who has also been listed as his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Chang is a chronic liar,'' one of his many former
lawyers, Michael S. Kimm, asserted in a recent lawsuit, which, like
several suits by other people, claims that Chang failed to pay him
what he owed. ``David Chang believes that he can say anything at a
given moment and get away with it because he is arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the basic facts of his background, Chang has
contradicted himself repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In one set of court papers, he said he was born in Beijing in
1943 and emigrated to South Korea soon after the communist takeover
of China six years later. In an interview last year with a South
Korean newspaper, he said he was born in Korea and left his
homeland in 1963, when he hopped a freighter and sailed to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Chang told his employees that he spent the '70s
and '80s working as a high-flying oil trader in London and the
Middle East, cultivating friendships with members of the Saudi
royal family. Through his Washington lawyer, David Schertler, Chang
said he had worked abroad for his own oil company, Nikko Petroleum,
and moved its operations to New York in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chang's profile began to rise in the United States around 1990,
when he became an American citizen. By then he was calling his firm
Nikko Enterprises Inc. and had moved it into offices in Fort Lee.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed himself as a man of discreet but powerful patrons.
He told associates that he had named his firm for its sponsorship
by Nikko Securities Co., Japan's third-largest brokerage, and that
he had a rich young wife in Japan, the daughter of a Nikko
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Nikko Securities have nothing to do with Chang but
it also apparently persuaded him to stop using its name, prompting
him to reincorporate his company in 1994 as Bright &AMP; Bright. Soon
enough, though, he found new sources of respectability in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first and most important of Chang's Washington
contacts was Daniel J. Murphy, a high-profile lobbyist with a
gleaming government resume. A retired four-star admiral, Murphy had
commanded the Navy's 6th Fleet, had served as chief of staff to
George Bush when he was vice president, and had been a deputy
director of the CIA, and a deputy undersecretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from Bush's staff in 1985, Murphy went to work
as a lobbyist, first for Gray &AMP; Co., a firm closely tied to the
Reagan administration, and then on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly built a reputation for putting business ahead of
politics, representing the Marxist government of Angola, trying to
drum up business in Gen. Manuel Noriega's Panama, and maintaining a
friendship with the former South Korean lobbyist and intelligence
agent Tongsun Park long after Park's ties to American congressmen
touched off a political scandal involving U.S. officials in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who declined to say anything about his relationship with
Chang, began working for him as a consultant and lobbyist by at
least 1990, according to Schertler, Chang's lawyer. Murphy soon
became a business partner as well, helping Chang open some of the
more important doors in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at the White House once a month, when I was there,''
said one former assistant who worked for Chang during the latter
half of the Bush administration. Bush's spokesman said the former
president did not recall ever meeting Chang, and there are no
records that Chang ever made a private visit to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a Niche
</P>
<P>
   Chang used his Washington contacts in part to carve out an
unusual business niche, trying to supply goods and services to
countries hostile to the United States. Besides shipping wheat to
North Korea, his former employees said, he tried to send ambulances
and other equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On a more mundane level, he bought U.S. real estate and Asian
stocks, tried to sell repackaged cigarettes in Russia and beer
snacks in South Korea, and explored building a fleet of miniblimps
for advertising. Almost none of his start-ups, however, seem to
have even gotten off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what Chang was using for capital. For his grain
deal with North Korea, he received at least $60 million from South
Korea's Shinhan Bank, and from L.G. International, the New Jersey
subsidiary of one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Chang obtained one of the first Commerce Department
licenses authorizing the sale of food to North Korea, which was
then subject to U.S. trade sanctions. By 1994, court records show,
he had shipped the government there some 560,000 tons of wheat,
with a value of $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chang accused the North Korean government of failing to pay him
$71 million on the deal and reneging on a $1.2-billion contract for
further shipments. He made the accusations in a libel suit filed
against a Korean-language newspaper based in New York, which
published an article accusing him of giving free rooms at the Fort
Lee Hilton to visiting North Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
   The paper stood by its story; Chang dropped his suit three years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever misgivings Chang had about doing business with the
North Koreans apparently eased. By 1998, he had been back to North
Korea on a contract to provide logistical support for a U.S. Army
team that sought to recover the remains of American soldiers
missing there since the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   New Alliances
</P>
<P>
   With Bush out of the White House and South Korean financiers
pressing him for repayment on the grain deal, Chang began to
cultivate new allies among the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Until then he had been a relatively modest and mainly Republican
donor. In 1992, for instance, he gave $25,000 to Republicans and
$1,000 to Torricelli, then his local congressman. But by the
1995-96 election cycle, the balance of his generosity shifted to
Democrats, and Torricelli became his most favored politician.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, a spokesman for Torricelli said his campaign
fund-raisers merely found Chang's name _ along with hundreds of
others _ on a list of New Jersey donors provided by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``He was not one of the senator's
inner circle of fund-raisers,'' the senator's chief of staff, Eric
B. Shuffler, said. ``Not in any way, shape or form anything close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of Torricelli's friends and former aides tell of a much
closer relationship. ``All of a sudden,'' one former aide recalled,
``he became a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Chang and his aides gave $8,000 to
Torricelli, and Chang was named to the finance committee for
Torricelli's 1996 campaign. Chang gave Torricelli use of his
corporate jet during his 1996 Senate campaign, and investigators
are now examining whether the campaign fully reimbursed Chang for
the 19 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Chang gave another $30,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, of which Torricelli was named vice chairman and then
chairman, and $5,000 to a legal-defense fund set up on Torricelli's
behalf for a House ethics inquiry involving Torricelli, who was
ultimately cleared.
</P>
<P>
   As his relationship with the White House grew, Chang and his
companies gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee and
$70,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Over
the same period, Chang, his aides and his companies gave only about
$44,000 to the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Between late 1995 and 1996, Chang also arranged for another
$53,700 in illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign,
funneling the money through friends, business associates and even
the former chairman of the Bergen County Republican Party, Berek
Don. Don has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and is
cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Torricelli, who declined to answer questions
about the matter himself, said the senator's office did almost
nothing for Chang in return for his support.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it looks strange, but this is not a guy who we did
anything for,'' Shuffler said. ``No one on our staff, in our
Washington office, ever spoke to Chang or met him.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, several other politicians and current and former
Torricelli aides remember the relationship differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seen as someone who Torricelli was actively engaged
with,'' one former aide said. ``This was a guy who was important to
Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Torricelli went to South Korea just days
before a presidential election there. The U.S. Embassy, concerned
that Torricelli might be seen as meddling in the campaign, balked
at setting up political meetings for him. Chang swept into the
void.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-page statement issued in response to written questions,
Torricelli's office denied that Chang was present on the trip, made
any of the arrangements for it, or communicated about it with any
members of the senator's staff.
</P>
<P>
   But two people with detailed knowledge of the trip said Chang
did stay in the same hotel as Torricelli, while Chang's aide,
Christopher Kim, helped set up meetings for the senator with the
two opposition candidates, Kim Dae-jung, who won the vote, and Rhee
In-je. In a brief interview, Kim also acknowledged that Chang sent
him to Seoul to help with the arrangements and to act as the
senator's tour guide as he met with Korean officials and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the week of Torricelli's visit, one of Chang's companies also
made a $30,000 donation to the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking Payback
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Torricelli also insisted that despite all of
Chang's financial support, Torricelli never helped his patron with
the matter of his greatest concern _ persuading the Clinton
administration to transfer frozen North Korean assets to him, or to
pressure the North Korean government to repay the debt. But other
politicians were apparently more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last fall, a handful of legislators, from the
relatively liberal Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to
conservative Republicans like Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming, wrote
to the administration on Chang's behalf, urging it not to ease the
sanctions on North Korea without pressing for the repayment of
debts to U.S. companies like Bright &AMP; Bright.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Lautenberg said they wrote a pro forma letter for him
because he was a New Jersey resident. An aide to Thomas said the
Wyoming senator supported Chang's appeal after being lobbied on his
behalf by one of his business partners, James A. Courter, the
former Republican congressman from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   According to two politicians close to Clinton, Chang was
introduced to the president by Torricelli at a fund-raising event
for the senator. Under questioning by the head of the Justice
Department's campaign-finance task force, Robert J. Conrad Jr.,
Clinton said that Torricelli might have made the introduction, but
that he could not remember.
</P>
<P>
   When South Korea's president visited Washington in June 1998,
Chang and his then 30-year-old assistant, Audrey Yu, were among the
guests at a state dinner. Barely a month later, on July 14, Clinton
invited Chang again, this time to watch a movie in the White House
screening room.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton traveled to Seoul, South Korea, that November,
Chang and others said, he was invited to the president's hotel room
for conversation and pizza. Days before Christmas, Chang was
invited to the White House again, this time for a holiday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Early the following spring, Chang was invited to the White House
to watch the NCAA basketball finals with Clinton. And when the
Chinese prime minister, Zhu Rongji, visited that April, Chang and
Yu were invited to another state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Over the year that he was so assiduously wined, dined and
entertained by Clinton and other administration officials, Chang
and his companies donated over $150,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McAuliffe, the president's close friend and chief
fund-raiser, said, Chang ``was treated no differently from any
other supporter.'' White House officials suggested that while
senior National Security Council officials were dispatched twice in
1998 to meet with Chang and listened to his ideas about U.S. policy
on the Middle East, North Korea and Iraq, mostly they just humored
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Chang became a more prized Democratic donor, his
legal troubles were in fairly plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   The Biggest Deal
</P>
<P>
   His role in making $12,000 in illegal campaign contributions to
the 1992 campaign of former Rep. Jay Kim, a Korean-American
Republican from California, had come to light in news articles by
August 1997. (Chang was not charged, after agreeing to cooperate
with federal prosecutors.) His involvement in illegal contributions
to the 1996 Torricelli campaign surfaced clearly in May 1999, when
Don, the former Bergen County chairman, pleaded guilty to funneling
Chang's money through employees at his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there much evidence that Chang was flourishing in
business.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1998, while he donated over $270,000 to various
political causes, Chang reported only $183,000 in income. Over a
one-year period starting in the fall of 1998, he also lost nearly
$300,000 gambling in Atlantic City, N.J., federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Seiwert, the White house spokesman, said a White House visitor
and major donor like Chang should typically have been vetted by the
Democratic National Committee, the Secret Service and a White House
research unit. He said administration officials were ``still
checking'' to determine how that vetting was done in his case.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Chang hired McAuliffe to help him try to buy a bank
in South Korea. McAuliffe said that before signing a yearlong
consulting contract with Chang, he checked with several people,
including Courter, the former congressman who was listed on company
documents as the president of the new trading company that Chang
established in late 1997, Panacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the contract said Torricelli provided an
enthusiastic reference, telling McAuliffe: ``He's a legitimate
person, a legitimate businessman. His wife's family owns Nikko
Securities.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's aides deny that he or any staff member ever vouched
for Chang.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said that he never discussed Chang's business deals
with Clinton, and that he ended his consulting arrangement after
about six months. Roughly six months after that, however, he agreed
to work for Chang again, this time as an investment banker when
Panacom sought to buy the troubled Korea Life Insurance Co., South
Korea's third-largest insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said he went back after learning that Murphy was
acting as Panacom's chairman, and after Courter assured him that
Chang had enough money to buy the company. He said one of Chang's
lawyers also gave him a Korean newspaper clipping indicating that
Bush had already met with Korean officials on Panacom's behalf,
something that one of Chang's former lawyers, Michael Critchley,
also asserted during a hearing in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Gian-Carlo A. Peressutti, said this was
untrue. The former president, he said, had been in Korea on behalf
of another U.S. firm, Carlyle Group, which is headed by former
senior officials from Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Life deal would have been by far Chang's biggest yet,
one that three of the world's largest multinational insurance
companies had already bid on and lost by the summer of 1999, when
Murphy and Chang stepped into the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of a surprise, because no one had ever heard of
them,'' recalled Lee Jong-Koo, a senior Finance Ministry official
who attended the meeting. ``Chang and Admiral Murphy asked
questions about KLI and they indicated that they could raise
abundant funds to acquire the company from various sources,
especially New Jersey pension funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his office in Seoul, Lee said Korean
officials repeatedly sought further evidence from Chang that
Panacom could assemble the roughly $1.5 billion that they were
seeking for the company. Instead, they heard about Chang's
politician friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember David Chang said he knew Senator Torricelli and
other politicians,'' Lee said. ``He also said that he knew
President Clinton and that he had eaten pizza with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the Korean prime minister, Kim Jong-pil, began to
receive letters from politicians in Washington and New Jersey. Rep.
Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., wrote to ``highly recommend Panacom for this
acquisition because of their strong record in investment, trade and
finance for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who received $2,000 from Chang and
his assistant in 1998, wrote a similar letter, as did Torricelli
and a New Jersey state finance official, Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The two representatives said through spokesmen that they did so
because they believed Panacom was a legitimate business with
operations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to one lawmaker said they also checked first with
Torricelli's staff, which vouched strongly for Chang. A spokesman
for Torricelli denied that this happened.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli agreed to provide The New York Times with a copy of
the letter he wrote to the Korean government on Panacom's behalf.
After several weeks, however, his aides said the letter could not
be found.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening Troubles
</P>
<P>
   As Chang's push for the insurance deal continued last summer,
Korean officials became openly suspicious that he was acting as a
front man for the former owner of the insurance company, who had
been imprisoned on corruption charges but was trying to win it
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this guy Chang was lying to me,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe flew to Seoul in late August to help move the deal
ahead. But he said that after only two discussions with Panacom
lawyers, he turned around and flew home, refusing to meet with
Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Life deal finally fell through last fall, as Chang's
legal troubles were deepening in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure from federal prosecutors growing, the lawyer
then leading Chang's defense, Critchley, did something that stunned
many of the lawyers following the case.
</P>
<P>
   After Chang's arrest on campaign-finance, conspiracy and
obstruction-of-justice charges, Critchley announced in court that
Chang had ``no information about any criminal wrongdoing'' by any
public officials, mentioning Clinton, Torricelli and McAuliffe by
name. With that, Critchley, who is active in Democratic Party
politics in New Jersey, seemed to foreclose the possibility that
Chang would ever cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, however, as Chang prepared to go to
trial with a new lawyer, he indicated to prosecutors that he might
in fact have that kind of information and agreed to cooperate with
the authorities. He became the sixth person to plead guilty to
making illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign.

FIVE HOSTAGES RELEASED IN PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes end of 6th-last graf to prevent ambiguity.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Relieved, bitter and still frightened for
their companions, five foreign hostages were released by kidnappers
in the southern Philippines on Sunday for a reported $5 million
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The releases were a half-step toward ending a strange
four-month-long standoff in which the tiny island of Jolo has been
flooded with ransom money both for the hostages and for a dozen
journalists who were seized and then released while trying to
interview them.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those freed Sunday were from the original group of 21
people kidnapped on April 23 at a nearby diving resort in Malaysia.
The fifth was a French television reporter who had been taken
captive when she trekked into the jungle to film them on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other Westerners remained hostages on the island,
including the last five kidnapped in Malaysia and two other members
of the same French television crew. A Filipino worker at the diving
resort was also being held, as well as 12 Filipino evangelical
Christians who walked into the mountains two months ago to pray
with the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, a small band of gunmen calling themselves Abu
Sayyaf and saying that they were Muslim separatists, had already
received $5.5 million in ransom for 11 hostages who were released
earlier, the Philippine military said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the government insists that no ransom has been paid,
but large amounts of cash are known to have been transferred to the
rebels. Kidnapping is a cottage industry in the southern
Philippines, and payoffs _ commonly described as ``room and board''
_ are part of the normal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers seem to have made a point on Sunday of dividing
the hostages, releasing a wife but not her husband, a father but
not his son, and a woman but not her boyfriend. The gunmen are
demanding more ransom for the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The chief government negotiator, Roberto Aventajado, said he
hoped the other hostages would be freed in the coming days but
added, ``There's still a lot of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier statement from the kidnappers said the partial
release Sunday was intended to discourage the government from a
military reprisal. It said further releases would depend on
additional payments.
</P>
<P>
   There was little joy among the hostages released Sunday as they
arrived by helicopter at the southern Philippine city of Zamboanga.
Some were in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel relieved but we are not happy, because there are still
people left behind,'' said Marie Moarbes, 33, a French-Lebanese
woman. On videotapes taken during the captivity, she had been the
strong one, comforting her companions as they trembled at the sound
of distant gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Still angry, as he had appeared on the videotapes, Werner
Wallert, 57, a German, said: ``My son is still there. You don't
expect me to be happy.'' An emissary said the father and son had
embraced and wept Sunday, each insisting that the other be the one
to leave. Wallert's wife, Renate, had been the first of the
hostages to be released, on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The others freed Sunday were a French woman, Sonia Wendling, and
a South African, Monique Strydom, as well as the television
reporter, Maryse Burgot. They were to be flown to Libya, which was
the broker for the release. Libya was also reportedly paying the
ransom, which officials described as development aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Libyans, we know what we are doing,'' said the Libyan
ambassador, Saleem Adam, dismissing an accusation that his country
was trying to polish its international image by acting as
go-between. ``This is a humanitarian mission. It has no other
motivation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Six Malaysians from the diving resort were freed earlier. One
French man, one South African, one German and two Finns, as well as
the Filipino resort worker, are still being held by the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have been difficult and seemingly amateurish,
with the Philippine side making sometimes contradictory and
counterproductive public statements and the kidnappers squabbling
among themselves, changing their demands and backing out of
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   A planned release was canceled two weeks ago when the gunmen
said they were afraid they would be attacked, and demanded more
money.
</P>
<P>
   There was another cancellation last week after two members of
the gang were arrested at a local bank when they tried to convert
$240,000 into Philippine pesos. The release proceeded Sunday after
the government released the two men, though not their money.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the earlier ransom money is reported to have been spent
on weapons, as the Abu Sayyaf band, originally numbering perhaps
200, has vigorously recruited new members to help guard the
hostages and secure them against a huge military deployment.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators say they have assured the gunmen that they
will not be attacked, government officials have predicted strong
military action once the last of the hostages is freed.

U.S. OPEN IS IN A ZONE ALL ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From ``the luck of the draw'' to ``dangerous
floaters'' tennis players tread lightly about their destiny during
a Grand Slam tournament. If you can finesse your way through seven
singles matches over two weeks, you are, indeed, a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the Australian, French, Wimbledon and the
U.S.Open carries an unmistakable mystique for players and fans. At
the Open, which begins Monday at the National Tennis Center,
solving certain puzzles can be as demanding for most players as
topspin lobs or angled crosscourts:
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the more intriguing language zones:
</P>
<P>
   LUCK OF THE DRAW
</P>
<P>
   Staring at a tough first-round match can destroy a player's
psyche in a Grand Slam event even before a ball is hit. Building
momentum through each round, with opponents that can test you but
not beat you or grind you down, is the luck of champions. A look
inside this year's draw says Martina Hingis will have a strenuous
path to a title, with Monica Seles, Venus Williams and Lindsay
Davenport or Serena Williams from the quarters on. For someone
whose game is fashioned more on mental toughness than on power,
Hingis' draw is not lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men, Andre Agassi could have Thomas Enqvist, Pete
Sampras and Yevgeny Kafelnikov before hitting the final.
</P>
<P>
   Best Draw: Venus Williams, who should have comfortable early
matches, Hingis in the quarters and perhaps her sister Serena, but
not until the final.
</P>
<P>
   OPENING BLASTS
</P>
<P>
   Every Grand Slam tournament has first-round matches that promise
to be lively, unpredictable and possibly (for the men) five-set
epics. The best of this year's openers are Goran Ivanisevic (who
else?) against Dominik Hrbaty, Todd Martin-Vincent Spadea and
Magnus Norman-Paul Goldstein. The only first-rounder among the
women that promises big hits and perhaps some drama is
fourth-seeded Mary Pierce against 19-year-old Alexandra Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   DANGEROUS FLOATERS
</P>
<P>
   These are good unseeded players who can spoil the party for
favorites. This year, the floaters to fear are Patrick Rafter, a
former Open champion, the enigmatic Karol Kucera and the
hard-serving Richard Krajicek among the men, Chanda Rubin and
Jelena Dokic in the women's draw.
</P>
<P>
   AFTER DARK
</P>
<P>
   The Open was the first Slam to initiate night play 25 years ago
(Australia also has night matches now). The initial response of the
players was frustration: Europeans fretted about diminished vision
and the perception that balls travel faster at night, especially on
hard courts. They also felt that seeded stars got to pick their
nights against opponents they thought would be less effective under
the stars, a charge continually denied by officials.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers don't lie. Pete Sampras has a 13-0 won-lost record
in night matches. Martina Navratilova (16-0) and Chris Evert (14-0)
also went unbeaten at night. Jimmy Connors, with fists pumping,
produced a 24-2 career record after dark.
</P>
<P>
   TIEBREAKERS
</P>
<P>
   The Open was ahead of the game on what the tours call
``tiebreaks,'' to the dismay of purists. Under the stewardship of
the late Bill Talbert, 9-point sudden-death tiebreakers (the
brainchild of a Rhode Island rogue, Jimmy Van Alen) were instituted
at the Open in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   While 12-point tiebreaks are the norm on today's circuits, the
Open remains the only Grand Slam event that uses the tiebreak to
decide a final set.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 years, 94 fifth-set tiebreaks have been played in men's
singles, including five last year, four in the first round. In
women's singles, 84 three-setters have gone to a decisive tiebreak
at 6-all, including two finals that Martina Navratilova lost, in
1981 to Tracy Austin and 1985 to Hana Mandlikova. Navratilova also
won a third-set tiebreak over Steffi Graf in a 1986 semifinal en
route to the title.
</P>
<P>
   WILD CARDS
</P>
<P>
   Every tournament has wild cards, but wild-card invitations at a
Grand Slam event (16 at the Open) are considered special. This
year, for example, wild cards went to Andy Roddick, the world's No.
1 junior, and Alex Kim, the national collegiate champion, who faces
Andre Agassi Monday night. Among the women, the lone New York
resident in the singles draw, Dawn Buth, 22, of Riverdale in the
Bronx, received a wild card and drew another American, Ansley
Cargill.
</P>
<P>
   Some wild-card entries are disliked by other players who feel
these pros have gotten a ``free pass'' into the tournament through
internal politics without going through ``qualies.'' Hence,
opponents will try harder against a wild-card opponent as a
reminder to tournament officials.
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY LOSERS
</P>
<P>
   Players who lose in the last round of qualifying can gain a spot
in the 128-player main draws through injury withdrawals (they are
selected by rank order). Their stays are usually short: Only one
male lucky loser (Laurence Tieleman in 1999) has managed to reach
the third round of singles. Maria Jose Gaidano (1993) is the only
woman to have advanced as far as the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   Fans love it, television promotes it, players loathe it. The
packaging of one men's semifinal, the women's singles final and a
second men's semifinal on the last Saturday means no rest day for
the men before Sunday's final. Foreign players unhappily expect to
play the early semi if seeded Americans like Sampras and Agassi are
still around because television wants the bigger names for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Is the scheduling fair? No. But the Open dares to be different,
for better or worse.

SPORTS COLUMN: COOPER LEAVING BEHIND A LEGACY OF GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>
  By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Playing for Segovia in the plains in Spain, and for
Parma and Alcamo amid the hills of Italy, she had dreamed a fading
dream of one day playing professional basketball in America, maybe
in Los Angeles where she grew up in Watts _ or, well, anywhere in
the States, especially so that her mother, Mary Cobb, could see her
play regularly. So that her mother could see that she had truly
made something of herself.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she said, she had wished to make her mother proud,
her mother who had raised her and her seven siblings on her own.
</P>
<P>
   She had been instrumental in the University of Southern
California making four trips to the Final Four, and winning two
national championships, but in 1987 there were no professional
leagues for women here. So she packed her sneakers and her
aspirations and went off to Europe to earn a living at what she did
best.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman had been playing in Europe for 10 years, been a
star there _ league-leading scorer or second in each of those years
_ but she was 33 years old. ``I knew that one day there would be a
women's professional basketball league in America,'' Cynthia Cooper
said, ``but I thought it would pass me by.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was wrong. In January of 1997, Cynthia Cooper came home,
signing with Houston of the fledgling WNBA. Four seasons later, she
has established herself here as not only one of the most exciting
of contemporary athletes, but one of the grittiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cynthia Cooper is the Michael Jordan, the Larry Bird, the
Magic Johnson of this league,'' Rich Adubato, the coach of the New
York Liberty, said. ``She's the type of person who will not let her
team lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this with full respect and full regrets, since Cooper
had just hit a twisting scoop shot to seal the victory against his
team in the first game of the WNBA finals Thursday in Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the league's four seasons, Cooper was the league's most
valuable player in the first two, and the MVP in each of its
championship series, all won by the Houston Comets. She had been
the league scoring leader in each of the first three seasons,
averaging more than 22 points a game each time.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last week, with the Comets ahead by 1-0 in the
best-of-three title series against the Liberty, they had a chance
to win their fourth straight championship. The end of the road for
her, Cooper had said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Cooper, the lithe, 5-foot-10-inch guard with the short
ponytail that appears to help propel her, had announced that she
was retiring after this season. No longer would crowds thrill to
her running one-hander in traffic that banks so sweetly off the
backboard, or see her move as stealthily as a fox to a hen's egg as
she picks off a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was reflecting on this Saturday morning, shortly before
Game 2 of the WNBA finals in Houston. What will she do when she
retires? Could she ever duplicate the excitement of basketball?
``No,'' she said, ``and I don't expect to. I don't think anything
can duplicate playing before 20,000 people, who are screaming for
you or at you. And nothing can duplicate the pressure that you feel
building before a big game like this, or being on the free-throw
line and having to make important free throws, or the big shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She untied a sneaker to relieve a cramp. ``But it's time to move
on,'' she said. ``I'll just have to redirect my energies beyond the
basketball court. I have a lot of interests. I might try
broadcasting or coaching. I have a foundation that I want to spend
more time with.'' She was referring to the Mary Cobb's Building
Dreams Foundation, which helps raise funds for breast cancer
research. She is also involved with many inner-city youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Game 2 on Saturday, when the crunch came, she rose in
customary fashion to the occasion. She sank a 3-point shot with
21.5 seconds to go in the game to tie it at 64-64 and send it into
overtime. In the extra five-minute period, she scored on a drive
and one of her patented runners _ she finished with 25 points _ to
help give the Comets a lead they would not relinquish in their
79-73 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then, fittingly, she grabbed a defensive rebound with just
seconds to go and she dribbled out the clock. When the buzzer
blared, she ran in little circles, and into the crowd, cradling the
ball in one hand and with the other waving four fingers, indicating
the number of WNBA titles won.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Comets' victory celebration, as the confetti rained
onto the court like the deluge on Noah's ark, one recalled a moment
before the game. In the locker room, Cooper had talked about some
tough times, last year being one of the worst, when both her mother
and a dear friend and teammate, Kim Perrot, had died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a toll on you,'' Cooper said. ``I can just see mom
jumping up and down when we won our championships, when she saw me
being successful, how much she'd love to have been here now.''
Cooper paused. ``I'd better stop before I start crying. ... I'm,
I'm just eternally grateful. ...''
</P>
<P>
   She turned away. ``OK,'' she said, her voice cracking slightly,
``that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. But 40 game-minutes later _ no, 45 minutes, including
the overtime _ it was, finally, enough.
</P>

NORMAN WINS U.S. OPEN TUNEUP BUT FEELS FOR A FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
  By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ When the double fault smacked into the net to
end his match Sunday afternoon, Magnus Norman frowned, picked at
his racket strings and walked slowly toward the net, his head down.
</P>
<P>
   Norman had not lost. He had just had a great tuneup for the U.S.
Open, staving off two championship points and winning his second
straight Hamlet Cup title, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5. But on the other side of
the net stood his close friend Thomas Enqvist, whom he had beaten
for the first time in five meetings and who had leg cramps during
the final two games of the match.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanged a few words in Swedish before walking off the
court together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `This is not the way I wanted to beat you,''' said
Norman, who a few moments later was smiling and waving to his many
fans in the sellout crowd of 5,000. ``He said, `You deserve it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Enqvist put it: ``I was close to winning, but I was also
close to losing in two straight sets. Too many unforced errors, too
many double faults.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Enqvist, 26, who will face the clay-court specialist
Mariano Puerta of Argentina in the first round of the U.S. Open as
the seventh-seeded player, had 11 double faults and 60 unforced
errors in the final _ this after not dropping a set on the way to
the final.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, 24, who made it to the fourth round of the U.S. Open
last year before retiring with a back injury, is seeded third this
year. He was quick to pounce Sunday, electing to receive and
getting the break he needed in the first game when Enqvist made
three straight unforced forehand errors.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes continued to pile up for Enqvist, who served up
more double faults (five) than aces (four) in the first set and
handed point after point to Norman with unforced errors from both
his forehand and his backhand. Enqvist, seeded third here, had only
one chance to break Norman in the first set, during the fourth
game, but sent his backhand into the net to go back to deuce before
losing the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Norman quickly went up a break in the fourth game of the second
set on Enqvist's sixth double fault of the match and was serving
for the match at 5-3 when things inexplicably flip-flopped. Ahead
by 30-0, Norman got a bad bounce off the tape, then mis-hit a
forehand after an extended rally and hit two backhands into the net
to give Enqvist his first break.
</P>
<P>
   Enqvist, his forehands finally finding their mark, then ripped
through the next three games to take the second set, and went up by
5-2 in the third. But Norman stubbornly dug in, breaking back as
Enqvist, his upper left thigh beginning to cramp, was serving for
the match. Norman fought off two match points after going down by
30-40 on his serve, and then tied it at 5-5 on another Enqvist
double fault. He broke Enqvist again in the 10th game, on a double
fault, and then went ahead, 6-5, firing three aces along the way.
</P>
<P>
   After getting treatment from Alex Stober, the ATP trainer,
Enqvist was still having trouble with his first serve. Fighting off
one match point with a brilliant volley, Enqvist double-faulted
once, then twice, to hand Norman the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the cramps; it really didn't bother me,'' Enqvist
said. ``I lost because I was not able to put the match together.
Magnus is a very tough player''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who with the victory earned his fourth title in five
finals this year, said he felt confident heading into this week's
Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great _ I couldn't ask for a better warm-up for the
Open,'' said Norman, who will face the baseliner Paul Goldstein in
the first round of the Open, which begins Monday. ``I got a lot of
confidence and I know I can build on that. I know I can go all the
way, but I'm only looking at the first match right now.''

PLEASANT BREEZE INJURED IN VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The front-running Pleasant Breeze
galloped to an easy gate-to-wire victory in the Saratoga Breeders'
Cup here Sunday but startled his trainer, James Bond, by pulling up
awkwardly after the finish line and being taken off in an equine
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Racing Association veterinarian, Celeste Kunz, said
it did not appear as if the 5-year-old gelding had sustained a
fracture. ``He pulled up sore in his left front leg,'' she said.
``There does not appear to be any displacement of any bones, but he
is going back for evaluation. His leg was put in a splint.''
</P>
<P>
   His jockey, Jorge Chavez, said Pleasant Breeze ran smoothly
throughout the 1 1/4-mile race, in which he easily repelled the
challenge of the second- and third-place finishers, Catienus and
Gander.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back galloping nice and easy, I felt he was
missing a step,'' Chavez said. ``He seemed to be favoring his left
front. He could have stepped on a stone for all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   After X-rays were taken, Bond agreed that Pleasant Breeze's
injury appeared to be minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot find anything,'' the trainer said. ``We're hoping
it's just a wrench. He's 100 percent now. So far there's no heat or
swelling.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant Breeze won by 2 3/4 lengths in 2:02, paid $4.00 to win
and earned $180,000 for his owner, William L. Clifton Jr. &QL;

MILITARY RESERVES ARE FINDING IT HARDER TO SIGN UP NEW RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's military Reserves are increasingly
struggling to fill their ranks with new recruits, even as the
Pentagon relies on them more heavily than ever to conduct
operations around the world, according to military officials and
Pentagon documents.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last three years, the Army, Naval and Air Force
Reserves have each fallen short of their recruiting goals; last
year, the Air Force Reserve missed its objective by nearly 40
percent, signing up only 7,518 of the 11,791 recruits it needed.
Only the Marine Corps Reserve has steadily recruited enough new
troops in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting problems have continued _ with the three Reserve
forces unlikely to make their targets by the time the fiscal year
ends on Sept. 30 _ even though the active-duty services have turned
around their own dismal recruiting record after an infusion of new
recruiters, increased advertising and enlistment bonuses, according
to Pentagon records.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1997, the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps are all expected to meet their recruiting goals this
year _ an achievement Secretary of Defense William Cohen and other
officials have attributed in part to sharper marketing strategies
and a string of military pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty in persuading young men and women to sign up
as part-time soldiers, sailors and airmen has been a sobering
counterpoint. It is also raising questions about the Pentagon's
strategy to turn to the 864,000 members of the Reserves and
National Guard for humanitarian missions, peacekeeping operations
and fighting the nation's wars.
</P>
<P>
   The readiness of the military _ particularly its efforts to
recruit new soldiers and re-enlist the ones it has _ has already
become an issue in this year's presidential campaign, and the
latest recruiting numbers could provide fodder for both Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore can point to the recruiting turnaround for the active
forces, Bush can emphasize the shortages on the Reserves' side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same concerns about morale, recruiting and
re-enlistment for the Reserves as we do for the regular forces,'' a
spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray Sullivan, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign did not respond to questions about Reserve
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recruiting challenges facing the Reserves are the
same ones that have besieged the entire military in recent years.
The economy is thriving, creating more, better-paying alternatives
to military service. More and more high school graduates also are
heading directly to college, while there has been a steady decline
in young people expressing any interest in enlisting in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   The Reserves, however, are facing unique problems.
Traditionally, the largest pool of Reserve recruits has been people
leaving full-time active duty, but as all the services shrank from
their Cold War levels, so has that pool.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence that people leaving active duty are less
willing than ever to join the Guard or Reserves. In the last three
years, the percentage of those leaving the Army who said they would
consider continuing to serve part-time has declined to 21 percent
from 41 percent, according to the Army Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attribute that at least in part to the increased
missions of the Guard and Reserves. Reservists who not long ago
could count on serving the minimum of a weekend a month and two
weeks a year are now busier than ever, serving beside their
full-time counterparts in missions from the Persian Gulf to the
Balkans. The average Air Force reservist served 58 days last year,
while air crews served 110.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids getting off active duty right now are looking at what
we're doing and they're saying, `Whew! I'm not going to join the
Reserves or the Guard. I mean you're going where I just came
from,''' Maj. Gen. David R. Smith, vice commander of the Air Force
Reserve Command, said during an interview earlier this month in his
headquarters at Robins Air Force Base in central Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and senior Pentagon officials said that the problem has
not yet become a crisis, but they acknowledged that the difficulty
in signing up part-time soldiers, sailors and airmen has created
spot shortages, especially in units that require special skills
like medical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard has done better meeting its recruiting goals
nationally this year and last, but individual states have fallen
short, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, South
Carolina and Tennessee, some of which are 5 percent to 10 percent
below their authorized strength.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in recruits with prior military service has also
meant the Reserves have had to rely on new enlistees with no
experience, resulting in higher training costs and less seasoned
units.
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to be a challenge,'' Charles L. Cragin, the
assistant secretary of defense for Reserve affairs, said in an
interview on Friday. ``Obviously, if it continues, you're going to
have an impact on units.''
</P>
<P>
   Cragin and Reserve commanders said they have watched the trends
in recruiting and retention closely, but in recent years much of
the attention _ and money _ has gone to reversing the recruiting
slide in the active forces.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, for example, paid for television advertising for
the first time last year _ increasing its overall advertising
budget to $76 million from $22 million the year before _ but the
campaign focused almost entirely on recruiting for active duty. The
Air Force Reserve's advertising budget, by contrast, fell to $8.5
million this year from $8.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also increased the number of recruiters by nearly
400 this year, to 1,450, and, in addition, it temporarily assigned
169 more. The Air Force Reserve has only 146 recruiters in the
field this year.
</P>
<P>
   While active-duty recruiting campaigns appear to have had some
success _ with the Air Force, for example, already reaching this
year's goal of 34,000 recruits, after falling 1,700 short last year
_ the efforts have yet to trickle down to the Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   After falling short by more than 4,000 recruits last year, the
Air Force Reserve is projected to fall nearly 2,000 short of a
smaller target of only 11,321 recruits this year. The Naval Reserve
is projected to fall short of its target of 18,410 by as many as
4,000, a year after missing its target by 4,700 recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials noted that the figures this year showed slight
improvement over last year. In fact, with a month to go in the
fiscal year, the Army Reserve may still meet its target, officials
said, and any shortage may be offset by an increase in reserve
re-enlistments.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have attributed the Reserve recruiting problems to a
variety of factors, but Smith and other officials at Robins Air
Force Base said the most significant was the dwindling size of the
active force.
</P>
<P>
   When the Air Force, like all the services, was shrinking through
the 1990s, there were thousands of airmen and officers leaving
active duty who chose to stay in the Reserves, often to keep their
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the number we were processing, people were walking in the
door,'' Lt. Col. Kevin L. Reinert, deputy chief of Reserve
recruiting, said. ``Now we have to beat the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Reserves have increased signing bonuses, especially
for slots that require speciality skills. Doctors who join the Army
Reserve can now receive as much as $40,000 to pay off medical
school bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Reserve is also focusing much of its efforts on
the dwindling pool of those leaving active duty. At Robins, every
airman or officer who leaves has to meet with the base's ``in
service'' recruiter, Tony E. Vinson, an amiable master sergeant who
has the persistence of a door-to-door salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a position for them out there, we'll find it for
them,'' Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On his wall is a map showing every Air Force Reserve unit in the
country, and he quizzes every prospect about where they plan to
settle after leaving the force. He also offers them training
courses or, more significantly, positions that might not require
them to deploy overseas as often as they did on active duty.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the pace of operations _ or ``ops tempo'' _ appears to
be a significant reason why people with prior service are less
willing to join the Reserves. Five of 19 questionnaires that Vinson
had would-be reservists fill out cited ``ops tempo'' as their main
reason for leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials agreed that the increasing likelihood that a
part-time reservist will be mobilized has contributed to the recent
recruiting problems, but they disagree on the extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks who are coming in now kind of know that it's likely
they will be called up,'' said Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Plewes, chief of
the Army Reserve. ``They know you won't be sitting around the
Reserve centers like in the old days, like when I first came in the
Reserves, trying to figure out something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the pace of deployments has forced
more and more reservists to juggle their military service with
their civilian jobs and families _ what Smith called ``the Reserve
triad.'' And that has clearly made some prospects, either those
with previous service or those without it, think twice about
joining or staying in the Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of them really compete for time,'' he said, ``and
the one that loses is the family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the same time, however, some of the reservists called up most
often _ including those in the Army Reserve's civil affairs units,
for example _ actually have a higher rate of re-enlistment than the
rest of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get an opportunity to take part in a contingency
operation, it is actually a morale booster,'' said Col. F.C.
Williams, commander of the 419th Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force
Base in northern Utah, which just sent 165 people and a squadron of
F-16s to Turkey to conduct operations over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The wing has had its recruiting woes. Williams said he expected
to miss his recruiting goal of 220 by as many as 65. Part of that
shortage, however, will be offset by improvements in
re-enlistments, which he attributed to pay increases and the
satisfaction derived from deployments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, there are limits. In the last four years, the
wing has deployed reservists to Turkey for more than a month three
times and to the Persian Gulf once. That has put a strain on
reservists, their families and their civilian employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' Williams said, ``where the line is.''

CHINA SEIZES BOOK WITH PICTURE OF DALAI LAMA, HALTING U.S.
DELIVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also moving in `i' news file.) 
 By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of copies of a new book by a former official White
House photographer were confiscated by Chinese customs officials as
the books were being prepared for shipment from a bindery in
southern China, effectively blocking its release in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher and printer said the book, ``The Clinton Years,''
was seized because among its 227 black-and-white photographs was a
picture of President Clinton clasping hands and chatting at the
White House with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan
Buddhism. The Chinese government opposes the Dalai Lama, who has
lived in exile since China's invasion of Tibet in 1959, because he
remains a symbol of cultural and political separatism to his
Tibetan followers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to block the book's shipment startled publishers
and printers in the United States who have come to rely on Hong
Kong and southern China as a center for making illustrated books.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure also stands in contrast to the image that the
Chinese government is striving to present to the American public,
as the Senate prepares to take up a bill this fall to normalize
trade relations with China. In an effort to smooth the
legislation's passage, China's State Council Information Office and
its Ministry of Culture are spending $7 million on an elaborate
exhibition of Chinese culture that is touring cities across the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very stupid time to do this,'' said Patricia
Schroeder, president of the American Association of Publishers and
a former member of Congress. ``To exercise political censorship,
dealing with freedom of religion, over a book about the president
of the United States _ that is just not very wise right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The printing was arranged by Palace Press International, an
American company in San Francisco, Calif., which acts as a broker
between publishers and printing companies in Asia. Gordon Goff, the
director of Palace Press, which hires printers in China for about
500 titles each year on behalf of about 300 publishers, said he was
stunned when he learned of the book's seizure last week.
</P>
<P>
   The book is an album of photographs taken by Robert McNeely
while he was Clinton's official photographer from 1992 to 1998. The
president and his wife approved the use of the photographs, but
they have no financial stake in the book.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher is Callaway Editions in New York. The first batch
of 8,000 copies of the book had already been bound and shipped to
the United States at the beginning of August. But about three weeks
ago the Chinese officials seized the next 16,000 copies, which had
been printed in Hong Kong and sent to Schenzen for binding.
</P>
<P>
   Goff said that about two weeks ago Chinese officials also
impounded the entire 10,000-copy first printing of another book,
``Celestial Gallery,'' a collection of colorful Tibetan Buddhist
art which Palace Press was also handling for Callaway Editions.
Goff said Palace Press was appealing to officials in Beijing, in
hopes of having the books released.
</P>
<P>
   Printers and publishers including Goff, the printing giant
Donnelly &AMP; Sons, the art book publisher Harry N. Abrams, and others
said that they had not previously heard of Chinese customs
officials blocking shipment of books for religious or political
reasons. Last year, for example, Palace Press successfully shipped
from China 10,000 copies of ``The Dalai Lama,'' a daily meditation
and prayer guide published by a small American publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Zhang
Yuanyuan, after consulting with Chinese cultural officials who are
visiting the United States, said that China maintained a consistent
ban on the production of printed material deemed to be politically
sensitive, like depictions of the Dalai Lama, even in books
intended for export.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the consistent policy of the government to actually
control the political content of printed materials,'' Zhang said.
``Such books were never allowed to be printed on Chinese soil, and,
if in the past they were not intercepted at the border, it was just
a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeely took the photograph that has offended the Chinese on
April 28, 1994, as the Dalai Lama held Clinton's hand during a
meeting at the White House. An introduction by the historian
Douglas Brinkley notes that Clinton met with the Dalai Lama in the
vice president's office that day instead of the Oval Office out of
deference to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   In another picture, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, signed a
gift book on the history of Tibet for Clinton, who looked on
without enthusiasm. The Chinese president had just told Clinton
``that when he finished reading it he would understand why Tibet is
and always has been a part of China,'' McNeely recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The confiscation of ``The Clinton Years'' and ``Celestial
Gallery'' comes at a crucial time for Callaway Editions. Until
recently, Callaway had been a book packager _ conceiving ideas for
illustrated books, hiring artists and writers and selling the
finished products to other publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But for this fall, Callaway is publishing its own books for the
first time. McNeely's photographic study of the Clinton
administration, planned for release in September, was to be
Callaway's most heavily promoted book of the season. But the
shipment delay by Chinese officials could push the release past the
fall and even until after Clinton is out of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a difficult position right now,'' said Nicholas
Callaway, the company's founder. Still, he noted, the Chinese
censorship may have backfired. ``What the officials don't realize
is they are going to immortalize these books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because making illustrated books is complicated and expensive,
American book publishers have long sent much of their illustrated
book production overseas, where labor is cheaper. Printers in Hong
Kong and southern China, in particular, have earned a reputation
for high-quality production and low-cost labor.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing an oversized book like ``Celestial Gallery,'' for
example, which entails polychromatic images and a hand binding,
costs about $20 a copy to produce in China, compared with about $50
a copy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the books' seizure, critics of freer trade with China
were quick to note the irony of a book about a staunch free-trader
like Clinton running afoul of China's censors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of free trade is compromised when you are dealing
with a government that is unwilling to respect individual rights
like freedom of expression,'' said Mickey Spiegel, a research
consultant with the nonprofit organization Human Rights Watch. ``In
this case, free trade puts the Chinese government in the position
of being able to censor what Americans read.''

CHINA SEIZES BOOK WITH PICTURE OF DALAI LAMA, HALTING U.S.
DELIVERY

ECOMPANIES AND SPRINT PLAN WIRELESS VENTURE
</HEADLINE>
 By LAURA M. HOLSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sprint's wireless division and the Internet incubator Ecompanies
plan to announce a new venture on Monday to finance start-up
companies in wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, to be called Ecompanies Wireless, will receive a
$15 million investment from Spint's wireless unit, Sprint PCS, said
Bill Blessing, vice president for strategic planning at the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Like many wireless companies these days, Sprint PCS is eager to
capitalize on what industry executives hope will be exploding
demand for new types of data services and Internet access over
cellular phones and other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS has announced several other forays in this area. Last
week it introduced its Wireless Web for Business, which will offer
wireless access to things like company e-mail and corporate
directories via Sprint PCS telephones. It also announced an
alliance with Wireless Knowledge, a company backed by Microsoft and
Qualcomm, which hopes to help business users receive company
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint is betting that they are moving so quickly they will be
the first to capitalize on any new technology,'' said Ira Brodsky,
president of Datacomm Research in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Ecompanies, for its part, gets access to Sprint's expertise, as
well as its cash. Five Ecompanies executives are already working on
this project, said Sangam Pant, executive vice president at
Ecompanies. And a handful of Sprint PCS executives based in both
Santa Monica, Calif., home of Ecompanies, and Kansas City, Mo.,
where Sprint has its headquarters, will be on hand to advise
entrepreneurs. The new venture will be based in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will be to guess what services consumers really
want. Recently the stock prices of wireless concerns have
languished, in part because investors do not believe they have yet
delivered on the rosy growth predictions for wireless services.

E-COMMERCE: COMPANIES LEARNING HOW TO PERSONALIZE SERVICE ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 By SUSAN STELLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  Ask a handful of Internet executives to define the term
``personalization,'' and invariably the conversation turns to the
analogy of a shopkeeper who knows not only his customers' names,
but how much they can afford to spend and what size shirt they
wear.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This old-fashioned ideal of personalized service _ albeit,
updated with new economy motives _ is the next hurdle for Internet
companies trying to achieve profitability in an increasingly
competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   What this means in practice is that rather than displaying the
same set of pages to every visitor, a Web site would present
different information to each customer based on the person's data
profile. A person who has shown online interest in classical music
might be presented with a special price on Bach compact discs,
whereas someone who has bought a Britney Spears CD might be offered
a discount on N'Sync.
</P>
<P>
   This type of personalized experience, alternatively described as
``one to one marketing'' or ``targeted merchandising,'' has long
been touted as one of the key benefits of the Web. But so far, very
few Internet companies have been able to take advantage of this
potential, mainly because the technologies for delivering it are
still in the early stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the industry is gradually catching up to the hype
surrounding personalization, as a growing number of companies have
installed tools enabling them to present customized Web pages _ if
not to a single individual, then at least to groups that have been
identified as having a similar profile. This trend is going to
raise the ante for companies doing business online, both in terms
of investors' and customers' expectations. It is also going to
raise new privacy issues concerning what type of information is
collected about consumers and how that data is used.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some degree of personalization has existed for years
online, most notably through sites like Yahoo or Excite, which
allow members to create a page that displays information based on
preferences they have entered, like stock symbols or categories of
news. That type of service is now referred to as ``customization,''
whereas the techniques known as ``personalization'' are based on
information companies have more discreetly gathered about
consumers, like their purchase history or the Web pages they have
viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Cormac Foster, an analyst at the research firm Jupiter
Communications, said the difference involves explicit versus
implicit data. ``Customization is giving users what they've told
you they want,'' he said, ``and personalization is anticipating
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, one of the leaders in the personalization
arena is Amazon.com, which began its efforts in 1997 with a ``book
matcher'' feature. To use that feature, customers had to fill out a
form indicating their interests, and the system would match them
with books tailored to their entries. The problem with that
feature, according to Josh Petersen, Amazon's director of
personalization, was that it required too much work on the user's
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have had to walk into a store of old and fill out
a questionnaire,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Amazon focused its efforts on building a system
based on implicit data, like a customer's past purchases, which now
feeds into the site's ``New for You'' and ``Recommendations''
features. Using technology primarily developed by Amazon, these
services recommend products to customers based on algorithms that
take into account factors like the ratings a customer has assigned
various products on the site and the purchasing patterns of
customers with similar profiles.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the impact of errant data, Amazon allows users to
exclude certain purchases from their profile; that way, a Pokemon
game purchased for a niece will not skew a pattern of buying
mystery novels and Woody Allen videos. The system also makes some
automatic assumptions, like excluding gift-wrapped items.
</P>
<P>
   John Samuel, vice president of interactive marketing for AMR's
American Airlines, would be the first to agree that current
implementations of personalization technologies are still in their
infancy. American overhauled its AA.com Web site in 1998, with a
new version that allows the site to present pages that have been
tailored for each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said the company had a head start in its personalization
efforts because of its AAdvantage frequent-flier program, which has
gathered information about 40 million members. American uses that
information, as well as data collected from customers who fill out
a profile online, to tailor the offers that customers see when they
visit the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, that translates to knowing someone is in college
versus knowing someone is retired or often flies business class,''
Samuel said. ``The communication to those customers should be very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said that American has been careful to err on the side of
being explicit about collecting data, which is why the company asks
customers to fill out a profile, even if that information is easy
to deduce from an individual's travel history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be hard for us to infer a customer's home
airport,'' he said. ``But we still ask on the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for American Airlines and other companies
experimenting with this level of personalization will be
negotiating a delicate balance between providing consumers with
services and offers they want, and appearing to know too much and
risk scaring those customers away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot, and our customers know we know a lot,'' Samuels
said. The question is, ``What permission do we have from the
customer to use that knowledge?''

 &HT;    Reds draw the fans for all the wrong reasons
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They are the best road draw in the game, better than
the Yankees or Braves, the Cowboys or the Ice Capades, a sum of 2.4
million people around the country inexorably drawn to the
Cincinnati Reds this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. has done that, his appeal to a new league and
its new cities undeniable, even if that appeal has changed as the
summer has drawn on. If advance sales were linked to the arrival in
the National League of one of the game's biggest stars, fans now
come to view the Reds not for who they are but what they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   What is today's folly? What's Junior's gripe today? What has
gone wrong now? It wasn't supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Reds play the first of four tonight at Turner
Field in his first and only Atlanta appearance of the season. In
April, this series was gigantic. Today with the Reds (64-65)
struggling just to maintain a .500 record, none of the four games
is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get on a roll and get a winning streak going, we've got
a shot,'' said outfielder Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to believe. The Reds, who took two of
three in Florida over the weekend, just recently lost seven of nine
to bottom-feeders Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, including
a three-game sweep by the Brewers. They are 31-34 at Cinergy Field,
the only team with a winning road record and losing home record.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has been criticized and he has bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's human,'' he said. ``You're not some piece of
meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have gone 5-5 against NL Central front-runner St. Louis
(while being outscored 47-55) but two of those wins belong to the
departed Denny Neagle. Nor have the Reds seen the Cardinals since
they fortified themselves with Will Clark, Carlos Hernandez and
Mike Timlin. Cincinnati comes to Atlanta trailing the Cards by
8-1/2 games and are 12-1/2 back for the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we have going for us is we have the final three
games of the year with the Cardinals,'' general manager Jim Bowden
said. ``If we're within three games going into that series and we
sweep, we're in the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden also punctuated his week by hanging his head to close to
the netting of the batting cage and took a foul face to the face,
drawing blood. Reds Fever.
</P>
<P>
   It had all begun so warmly. The franchise made a marketing
campaign of saluting the 10th and 25th anniversaries of Reds
championship teams of 1990 and 1975. Tony Perez and Sparky Anderson
were going to be inducted into the Hall of Fame and broadcaster
Marty Brennaman was voted the Ford C. Frick Award, getting him into
Cooperstown too.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly every publication with a national circulation
picked the Reds to win the Central, the club started coolly. Then
in June, it fell apart. Between June 5 and July 5, Cincinnati went
from a modest one-game divisional lead to trailing St. Louis by 10.
Neagle was dealt to the New York Yankees and the clubhouse wondered
why. Captain Barry Larkin was dealt to the New York Mets, refused
to go and the clubhouse wondered about Bowden's medication.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest lightning rod has been Griffey, who has hopped
from one loud issue to another. While he reached 100 RBIs in the
second-shortest time in his career, public opinion had waned early
in the season, when he hit just .212 over the first two months. A
Cincinnati Enquirer poll, when asking who was to blame for this
season, found only 4 percent of respondents blame Griffey (Bowden
led with 35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Yet ranked fourth in NL RBIs and six in homers (35), Griffey
found his performance severely questioned for perhaps the first
time in his career and has not enjoyed the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you're mistreated and you say something, they
tell you to stop whining,'' Griffey said. ``It ain't about whining.
If you get mistreated at a 9-to-5 job, when you say something, they
don't say you're whining. But since it's me or any other athlete
who says something, that's what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Griffey has found himself in headlines all
year. He pushed the Reds to un-retire Perez's No. 24 so he might
where it, until Perez finally spoke out on how the episode hurt
him. (Griffey wears No. 30, his father's old number).
</P>
<P>
   He was vilified back in Seattle for manipulating the Mariners to
trade him. He bristled again when asked why his old team is playing
better without him. The ESPN story broke, charging Griffey had been
in contact with the station for showing less Junior highlights and
more involving St. Louis' Jim Edmonds. Junior grappled briefly in
the dugout with his father, the team's bench coach, after he was
pulled from a game.
</P>
<P>
   Then came last week's dust-up with Brennaman, a local legend in
his 26th year calling Reds games. Criticized on the air by
Brennaman for not running out what he thought to be a potential
double, Griffey stopped on his way to batting practice Wednesday to
challenge his opinion. Not wisely, Griffey did so right in front of
the writers who cover the team daily.
</P>
<P>
   Unfairly or not, the residual of all this has been to identify
Griffey as image-obsessed and thin-skinned. He joshed about
retaining Johnny Cochran to defend him. He said ``I play better
when I stir things up.'' But in a season where the Reds are
celebrating their rich past, a current team has fallen far short of
its own expectations, which hurts most of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has some type of feelings,'' Griffey said. ``Some
people block it out and some can't.''

UP NEXT, VARGAS VS. TRINIDAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ People are beginning to believe Fernando Vargas
could actually beat Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over capable but overmatched Ross Thompson doesn't
mean much in boxing terms. Even a victory as emphatic as the IBF
junior middleweight champion's fourth-round stoppage here on an
electric Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   However, that, combined with impressive victories over Ike
Quartey, Raul Marquez and Yory Boy Campas and a gutsy decision over
Winky Wright, have lifted Vargas to the top of his field. This all
comes at the age of 22 _ after a mere 20 fights _ and makes his
tentative title-unification bout with Trinidad on Dec. 2 as
compelling as any in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating questions abound:
</P>
<P>
   Is Trinidad too experienced for Vargas, as he was against David
Reid? How will Vargas react if he encounters a crisis? Can Vargas
handle Trinidad's punching power? Is Trinidad too strong for
Vargas?
</P>
<P>
   Is Vargas technically too efficient for Trinidad? Is Vargas too
strong for Trindad? If Vargas puts Trinidad down early in the
fight, will he be able to put him away? Is it simply Vargas' time?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Vargas would say the answer to that last question is
yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will doubt me again,'' he said. ``If you analyze it, I
definitely have better legs than him, I'm a better boxer than him
in the sense of being intelligent, using my legs, my ring
generalship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the power is equal, although I don't think so. I've
been at 154 (pounds) longer. And I think I'm stronger than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I just think I'm a more well-rounded fighter than he is
regardless of experience. I respect him. He's a great fighter. I
just know I can beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' performance against Thompson was just what he needed
going into the Trinidad fight.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence didn't need a boost but it got one anyway. That
kind of annihilation of a No.1 contender _ three knockdowns before
the referee stopped the fight _ has that affect on a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   And the victory added to Vargas' already considerable
credibility. He'll probably be an underdog because of the relative
inexperience, but the odds just got a little tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he surely won more fans, who yearn for such violent
destruction. The crowd at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino went nuts
Saturday as Vargas ripped Thompson apart. Certainly, the same thing
must have happened in living rooms across the country.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, a CBS Sportsline poll asked after
Saturday's fight who of the following seven nonheavyweight fighters
is the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The results: Roy Jones Jr., 48.9 percent; Trinidad, 16.7;
Vargas, 15.7, Shane Mosley, 8.4, Oscar De La Hoya 5.9, Naseem Hamed
3.4 and Zab Judah, 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   That Vargas and Trinidad are so close in the minds of fans is a
testament as to how far Vargas has come in a very short time.
</P>
<P>
   He and Trinidad are both hard-punching, aggressive, exciting,
supremely confident champions who could combine to create the
classic bout so many had hoped De La Hoya-Trinidad would be. All
the ingredients are there:
</P>
<P>
   NEGOTIATIONS: Vargas and Trinidad have agreed to meet but no one
has signed a contract. An announcement could come within a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   OLD FRIENDS: Vargas met Trinidad while traveling as a young
amateur and the two hit it off. They remain friends _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice guy, a great human being'' Vargas said. ``But in
the ring, there are no friends. When we fight, it will be like two
lions in there fighting over two steaks _ his belt (WBA) and my
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   FORGIVENESS: The anger melted away after Saturday's fight.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, livid over Thompson's prefight behavior, was impressed
that the challenger showed up at the postfight news conference
after such a beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to get up there after being defeated like that.
He showed me he's a man,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who said repeatedly before the fight that Vargas is
overrated, admitted he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be one of the top fighters,'' Thompson said.
``His speed is much better than I thought. Fernando is a true
warrior, a true champion.''
</P>
<P>
   MR. GARCIA: Many marvel at Vargas' calm demeanor in the ring,
particularly in light of his age.
</P>
<P>
   That trait can be attributed in part to his soft-spoken trainer,
Eduardo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Thompson's behavior, Vargas lost his cool Saturday
more than in any other fight. It was Garcia who reeled him back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hey, what's going on? Be intelligent first and then
be brave,''' Vargas recalled. ``He said, `Take your time and
eventually you'll get this guy.' And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   TYSON SIGHTING: Mike Tyson, apparently a fan of Vargas, asked in
Vargas' dressing room prior to the fight whether he could accompany
the junior middleweight champ into the ring on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said with a laugh that he had no choice, a reference to
the former heavyweight title holder's imposing presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Hey, no one is going to tell you you can't,'''
Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   VARGAS-DE LA HOYA? Vargas gave De La Hoya a bit more of his own
medicine at the postfight news conference, saying he'd never fight
De La Hoya because ``I want to fight the best fighters out there
and he's not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one thing could change his mind: money.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked immediately after he made those statements what he
would do if he received the right offer to fight his rival.
</P>
<P>
   He paused and then said with a sheepish grin, ``Well, we'd have
to sit down at the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The hundred or so people at the news conference laughed at the
slightly awkward situation and Vargas responded with a big smile:
``Hey, I'm a businessman, too.''
</P>
<P>
   DE LA HOYA-MOSLEY: Mosley wants to know this week whether De La
Hoya is interested in a rematch of their June bout at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has been busier with his singing career and trying to
sort out a reportedly strained relationship with his promoter, Bob
Arum, than negotiating with Mosley's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know what he wants to do,'' said Norman Horton,
Mosley's publicist. ``If he doesn't want to fight, then we'll move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley reportedly will fight Arturo Gatti in December if he
doesn't reach terms with De La Hoya. &QL;

GORE, SENSING AN EDGE, PUSHES BUSH FOR MORE SPECIFICS ON HEALTH
CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore attacked Gov. George W. Bush on health
care policy Sunday, using a telephone interview to reiterate his
own proposals in detail and to mock his opponent's positions as
lacking ``a minimal standard of substance for serious debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments came on a day when each campaign dispatched a
surrogate to attack the other's positions on health policy, and
when Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, acknowledged in two
television interviews that Bush does not yet have a detailed plan
for financing a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.
Providing such a benefit under Medicare, at a cost estimated at
$253 billion over 10 years, is a centerpiece of Gore's platform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's interview on health care, initiated by his campaign,
elaborated on a theme that he plans to address throughout a
four-day trip this week. It was a clear attempt to keep the
campaign's agenda firmly on Democratic turf and to push Bush
further on the defensive after a rocky week. Bush plans to spend
the week talking about education on a six-state tour that begins
Monday. He had hoped to do the same last week, but wound up
devoting much of his time to defending his tax cut plan from a
daily assault by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore have made it clear that they believe health care
is a winning issue for the vice president. Recent polls have given
Gore an overwhelming advantage when voters were asked which
candidate would do a better job dealing with health care in general
and with prescription drug prices in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his aides also have used health care to highlight the
risks they see in Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion, 10-year reduction
in income tax rates, which they claim would leave little of the
federal surplus for new programs. And because Gore focused much of
his attention on health care during his 16 years in the House and
the Senate, his campaign views health policy as an issue that can
reinforce the notion that Gore is more knowledgeable and better
prepared than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone interview, Gore used several similar
constructions to question Bush's seriousness. ``What's good for the
American people is to have an adult, intelligent discussion of the
specifics of these issues,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the interview, which Gore conducted by telephone from
his residence in Washington, the vice president criticized recent
television advertisements by the Bush campaign and the Republican
National Committee. The Bush advertisement, which began airing late
last week, said that Bush, the governor of Texas, would ``make
prescription drugs available and affordable for every senior who
needs them,'' while the party's commercial accused Gore of
``pushing a big government plan that lets Washington bureaucrats
interfere with what your doctor prescribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore scoffed at those claims. ``We need to honor our democracy
and redeem the promise of the American system and not hide behind
glib television advertising that disguises what really's been
proposed,'' he said. ``I'm waiting for the plan. The ad says
there's a plan. Where is the plan?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a prescription drug benefit that would, after
being phased in over 10 years, pay all drug costs for the
approximately 13 million uncovered Medicare recipients with incomes
of 135 percent of the poverty level and below. That would cover
individuals making about $12,000 a year and couples making about
$14,000 a year, Gore aides said. Those with higher incomes would
pay half of the cost of their drugs up to $5,000 and then would pay
nothing more once they had spent $4,000 of their own money in a
given year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the governor would ``build
on'' a plan devised by a bipartisan commission headed by Sens. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., and John Breaux, D-La.
</P>
<P>
   That plan would seek to spur competition between public and
private health insurance plans for Medicare recipients, giving
consumers a choice of public and private plans, some of which would
provide a prescription drug benefit. Bush also has said he supports
a sliding prescription drug subsidy for the low-income elderly, but
would leave exact amounts to be determined in negotiations with
Congress, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer and other Bush aides have said that the governor's
plan for paying for prescription drugs would not cost the federal
government any money because other reforms to the Medicare system
would save enough to pay for the drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Sunday about the details of the Republican plan on
ABC's ``This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' Cheney
said that ``the specifics are being worked on right now.'' He
added: ``It's a high priority for us, and we will shortly have the
details of a proposal to lay out on the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Cheney said that the current lack
of a prescription drug benefit flowed from the Clinton
administration's failure to make needed changes in the Medicare
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration's been there for seven and a half years
and hasn't dealt with it or addressed it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview to address the Clinton administration's
failure to pass a universal health care plan in its first two
years, Gore said, ``Well, first of all, this campaign is about the
future and not the past.'' He later cited the creation of the
Children's Health Insurance Program, which has, since its passage
in 1997, provided health care coverage for about 2 million
children. About 11 million children remain uninsured out of 44
million total uninsured in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also noted the so-called Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation that
made it easier to maintain health insurance after changing
employers and the administration's efforts to extend the solvency
of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged some disappointment in the failures of the
administration's early years. ``Clearly we wanted to do more in the
first two years and that was not to be,'' he said. And then the
Republican takeover of Congress ``made it hard to follow up with
second efforts,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he did not think it was risky for a Democratic
candidate to place such a heavy emphasis on health policy in light
of his own administration's high-profile failures in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the need is so obvious and so great that people expect
a well thought-out plan,'' he said. But he said that ``one of the
lessons that comes out of the 1990s is that we should go
step-by-step instead of trying to cover everybody in one fell
swoop.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Gore would begin that process by expanding the Children's Health
Insurance Program and Medicaid to provide coverage for all children
by 2005. In all, Gore would spend more than $500 billion over 10
years on health care initiatives, about one of every three dollars
available from the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday afternoon, the Gore campaign put Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services, on a conference call with
reporters to promote the vice president's health care plans.
Several hours later, the Bush campaign responded by making Frist
available for a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   He derided Gore's prescription drug proposal as a
``one-size-fits-all'' government plan whose benefit to the elderly,
after premiums and co-payments, would amount to only 13 cents a
day. ``Seniors won't have the wool pulled over their eyes,'' he
said. ``They clearly won't get what's being advertised by Vice
President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours earlier, the Bush campaign had issued a news release
claiming that the benefit would amount to only 5 cents a day, but
changed the number after a recalculation, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gore emphasized that his prescription drug
plan ``covers every senior, and I have budgeted for it, spelled out
the cost, and fit it within a balanced budget.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bush's plan ``for providing a tiny drug subsidy to
insurance companies'' would not work because the premiums needed to
cover drug costs would remain unaffordable for many seniors.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore has repeatedly blamed the pharmaceutical
and insurance industries for driving up drug costs and limiting
access to coverage. Today, he said he was not bothered by the fact
that his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, had
taken substantial campaign contributions from those industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has voted on high-profile matters against the wishes of the
big pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies,'' Gore
said. ``The fact that many of them are headquartered in his state
and have supported him is not of concern to me in any way to me.''

COMMENTARY: POLITICAL TONGUE TWISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporters covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign are
having a field day with his so-called Bushisms. It's
understandable. They're irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all hear the universal call to like your neighbor just
like you like to be liked yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was his message to struggling workers: ``I know
how hard it is to put food on your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, move over. Let the governor of Texas hit some
malaprop-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Back in February, Bush said of John McCain, ``He can't take the
high horse and then claim the low road.''
</P>
<P>
   You want economic insight? ``We ought to make the pie higher,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   These comments should not be dismissed as mere gaffes. We owe it
to the governor to take him somewhat seriously. Consider the
following question, which he posed in New Hampshire: ``Will the
highways on the Internet become more few?''
</P>
<P>
   Whew!
</P>
<P>
   The danger if Bush keeps this up is that we will start to think
of him as some kind of champ in the fine art of malaprophesizing.
That would be a mistake. Consider, for starters, that the term
Bushism initially referred to that great malapropartist George
Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st president of the United States and
father of the current contender.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush once said, ``We're enjoying sluggish times, and
not enjoying them very much.'' He said, ``It's no exaggeration to
say the undecideds could go one way or another.'' He said, in a
reference to Dan Quayle: ``My running mate took the lead, was the
author of the Job Training Partnership Act. Now, because of a lot
of smoke and frenzying of bluefish out there, going after a drop of
blood in the water, nobody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, as you see, this ability of the younger Bush to get
entangled in the obscurer thickets of the language is not that
unusual. The plain truth is that politicians have always been
brilliant at finding new ways to insert their feet into mouths that
inevitably are running too much. Which is why you have books with
titles like, ``Political Babble: The 1,000 Dumbest Thing Ever Said
by Politicians.'' And, ``The 267 Stupidest Things Democrats Ever
Said.'' (There's one for Republicans, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown, commenting on an earthquake when he was
governor of California, said: ``This is the worst disaster in
California since I was elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut nicely bungled an
appearance on behalf of a Democratic Senate candidate in South
Carolina by saying; ``We've got a strong candidate. I'm trying to
think of his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention Dan Quayle? He may be the champ. ``Republicans,''
he said, ``understand the importance of bondage between parent and
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president was a master at mangling the language.
He once said: ``I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward
more freedom and democracy. But that could change.''
</P>
<P>
   His most famous foul-up, now enshrined in Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations, was a reference to the motto of the United Negro
College Fund: ``A mind is a terrible thing to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Quayle: ``What a waste it is to lose one's mind, or not to
have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago was terrific at this
sort of thing. These were some of his best: ``I resent your
insinuendoes.'' ``The police are not here to create disorder.
They're here to preserve disorder.'' ``We shall reach greater and
greater platitudes of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was Ronald Reagan. Entire books have
been written about his flubs. I loved the time when, annoyed by
something Ed Asner had said, Reagan snapped, ``What does an actor
know about politics?''
</P>
<P>
   So Bush should take heart. He's not the only one out there
hacking away at the language. He might say on ``Meet the Press,''
``Laura and I really don't realize how bright our children is
sometimes until we get an objective analysis.'' Or, on the
``Today'' show: ``I don't have to accept their tenants. I was
trying to convince those college students to accept my tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not alone. As Daley happily pointed out, ``No man is
an Ireland.''

COMMENTARY: CLINTON IN CAIRO 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service     WASHINGTON _ Having presided at
Camp David over Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's previously
unimaginable concessions _ giving up almost all the West Bank and
sharing sovereignty in parts of Jerusalem _ President Clinton goes
to Cairo tomorrow. He will plead with Egypt's president, Hosni
Mubarak, to tell Yasser Arafat to grab the deal before an astounded
and dismayed Israeli public rises up and tosses out its Great
Conceder.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lame-duck American will promise Egypt to continue billions
in U.S. foreign aid to prop up its regime, as we have for a
generation. Clinton also promises Arafat tens of billions to
finance his future operations in payments fungible enough to arm an
ever-growing ``police force.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that future Congresses may not want to pick up the tab for
history's most expensive Nobel prize, Clinton will argue that if we
ever renege on his departing budget commitments, blame for a new
war will fall on the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Barak predicts ``tragedy'' if his concessions are not
accepted by Palestinians. That message is also aimed at Israeli
voters: if you do not support my division of Jerusalem and
withdrawal from the Jordan valley, then you will have to fight
Palestinian terrorists, with an unsympathetic world saying that you
brought it on yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Barak, with Clinton's active ``facilitating,'' has
emboldened Arabs who are now convinced the Jews will cut a deal at
any price. Such inflated expectations drove up the price and made
agreement less likely. It is also why the frustrated Barak is now
bruiting about coalition with Likud; the prospect of Arik Sharon as
deputy prime minister is designed to shock Arafat into signing.
</P>
<P>
   What if Clinton in Cairo convinces Egypt's Mubarak that American
largesse will cease if he doesn't lean on Arafat to take this
once-in-a-lifetime offer? And what if the Palestinian leader
graciously accepts the split-level sovereignty that gives him
ownership of the Temple Mount and lets Israel keep the Temple
underneath?
</P>
<P>
   At that point, as Barak's concessions lead to a grand photo-op
on the White House lawn in time to meet American political and
legacy needs, the go-it-alone prime minister would have to submit
to Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, his public support is hemorrhaging. Likud's leaders
want to replace the government rather than join it. Bibi Netanyahu,
though interminably hectored by investigators, leads Barak in
polls; Likud leader Arik Sharon is close behind, and Limor Livnat,
the Jewish Maggie Thatcher, is in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to shore up his former leftist support and to appeal
to the Russian immigrants, Barak has now called for a ``civic
revolution'' against the religious parties. Israel could benefit
from less religio-political activism, but this is Barak's second
time around; after hawking this secular line before his election,
the victorious loner surprised supporters by embracing the
religious parties as soon as he came to power. Now his sudden
reconversion smacks of political panic and many, even on the
Israeli left, are disinclined to be triple-crossed.
</P>
<P>
   The good to have come out of this negotiation is to show that
for Arab leaders, the issue is less territorial than existential.
Abu Dis, the Jerusalem suburb, was not enough; soon East Jerusalem
will not be enough; eventually all Jerusalem will not be enough.
But the Barak-Clinton concessions cannot be withdrawn until the
conceders leave the political scene.
</P>
<P>
   In light of escalating Arab demands, new negotiators need to
consider alternative strategies. In five years, Iran and Iraq are
likely to have weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver
them. At that time Israel's nuclear deterrent will be matched in
the region much as America's was by the Soviet Union. What happens
when each adversary has the power to totally destroy the other?
</P>
<P>
   Unless madmen take charge, you do not have nuclear war. Instead,
as when the Warsaw Pact faced NATO, conventional defenses help keep
the peace. Super-tech anti-missile defenses may also cause future
military leaders to turn to tanks and even (gasp!) infantry. If so,
the Jordan valley escarpment, which Barak is so ready to give away,
would be vital to Israel's survival.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late. If Clinton's call on Cairo leads to Arafat's
agreement, Israel's last line of defense will be its belatedly
aroused electorate.

A MAYOR'S PLUG; REDEEMABLE STAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Minn.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 750 local governments now use the Web site operated by
NetClerk to put the construction-permit process online. But so far,
only the mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, has become part of
NetClerk's advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NetClerk put a picture of Brown and the city's seal
on www.netclerk.com, the company's Web site, along with a letter
the mayor had written praising the company for, among other things,
helping reduce lines at city hall.
</P>
<P>
   So far, NetClerk's PermitCentral service has been used to issue
more than 1,000 building permits in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we enjoy interacting with each and every person who
comes to city hall, waiting in line may not be the best use of a
contractor's time,'' the mayor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter may have been less than a spontaneous testimonial.
Jon Fisher, founder of NetClerk, said the company began discussing
a ``public relations partnership'' with the San Francisco's mayor's
office about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a letterhead partnership play out?
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of San Francisco is well known for its forward
thinking, technological savvy,'' the mayor wrote. ``NetClerk offers
a perfect example of how technology can improve a current system to
the satisfaction of all parties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brown, of course, the satisfaction comes from bolstering his
image as a technology supporter and promoter of the Bay Area's
high-technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, NetClerk, based in South San Francisco, is part
of that economy.

   Redeemable Stamps Online
</P>
<P>
   The Carlson Cos. could be called the grandfather of customer
loyalty programs, dating to 1938, when the company first started
giving out Gold Bond Trading Stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Now Curtis C. Nelson, grandson of the founder and Carlson's
chief operating officer, wants to take it back to its roots _ this
time, online.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, Minneapolis-based owner of the TGIF restaurant chain,
Radisson Hotels, Thomas Cook Travel and a long list of other
businesses, is beginning to offer redeemable Gold Points to
customers on a new site, 24k.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the site will be the online hub of the
company's rewards program, both as a shopping portal and an online
redemption catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Much like S&AMP;H Green Stamps, Gold Bond Trading Stamps were doled
out by the thousands the last half century, typically as a way for
supermarkets, gas stations and shops to differentiate themselves in
competitive markets.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers redeemed their stamps for a range of consumer items
like toasters and hair dryers _ that is, until they began shopping
at discount warehouses and the practice fell by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   The online customer loyalty business is already fairly crowded,
what with S&AMP;H and others already doling out electronic trading
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   But today's online loyalty programs are an entirely different
beast from their predecessors. Among other things, they take
advantage of Internet data collection that allows merchants to
pitch specific products to customers based on their past shopping
behavior. And these days, customers can redeem their stamps for
much more than toasters.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says that Carlson has a leg up on other redemption
programs because of the variety of brands it owns. And where it
does not have its own brand, he says, the company will join forces
with other companies to fill the void. Already, 24k.com either owns
or has a partnership with 1,500 sites that offer Gold Points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective,'' Nelson said, ``is to touch the customer 365
days a year, across all facets of their life.''

WIND RIVER SYSTEMS AGREES TO ACQUISITION OF ICESOFT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   Wind River Systems, the maker of
software that is embedded in dozens of digital devices, is expected
to announce on Monday that it has agreed to acquire ICEsoft, a
Norwegian developer of Web-browsing software for Internet
appliances, for $24.5 million in cash.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deal will allow Wind River, based in Alameda, Calif., to
integrate Internet browsing functions into devices like set-top
boxes, digital televisions, Web phones and other devices. Wind
River's embedded software powers devices like Sony's Network
Walkman NW-E3, Hewlett-Packard's printers and Eastman Kodak's
digital cameras. The software is embedded into microchips that are
designed by companies like Intel and Hitachi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of smart, connected devices is just beginning,'' said
Tom St. Dennis, the president and chief executive of Wind River.
``Already millions and every soon billions of devices will be
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ICEsoft, based in Bergen, Norway, developed a highly popular Web
browser for devices with limited computing power called ICE
Browser. The program is written in Java, the software standard
developed by Sun Microsystems, and supports XML, a type of software
coding that will allow for the seamless interchange of all sorts of
dynamic data across different computer programs. ICEsoft will
continue to operate in Bergen. Wind River has 15 other offices in
Europe.

MORGAN STANLEY DROPS A FAMILIAR IMAGE TO TAKE AIM AT ONLINE
BROKERAGE FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember those grainy commercials that showed a
white-haired actor portraying a brokerage firm executive that many
people mistook for the real Dean Witter? Well, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. wants you to forget them.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley may still measure success one investor at a time,
but the firm has a more urgent message for investors in the
Internet age: ``Move your money.'' In a new ad campaign coming this
week to newspapers, magazine and TV screens, Morgan Stanley's
brokerage unit is dropping the slogan it has used for more than a
decade and is centering its $150 million advertising budget on a
bolder, blunter approach.
</P>
<P>
   Under the theme ``Well connected,'' the ads take dead aim at the
electronic brokerage firms that have flooded the airwaves with
pitches for stock trading at discounted prices. They equate online
brokerage firms with con men and depict investors being led by them
onto paths that dead-end in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a departure from some of the ethereal, aspirational
images out there,'' said Bob Sloss, the firm's executive vice
president for brokerage marketing. Sloss said the firm's research
showed that consumers recalled the ads of traditional brokerage
firms but had trouble distinguishing among their messages.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Internet came along and spawned a new breed of
competitors, most brokerage firms relied on images of trust and
wisdom. In the 1980s, Dean Witter briefly used the slogan ``You
look like you just heard from Dean Witter,'' while a defunct
competitor used ``When E.F. Hutton speaks, people listen.''
</P>
<P>
   That sameness was shattered in the late 1990s by big-spending
newcomers, like the ETrade Group and Ameritrade Holdings. Those
electronic brokers built their brands with irreverent ads mocking
stockbrokers and treating stock trading like a sport.
</P>
<P>
   Even Morgan Stanley joined in the fun. Two years ago, it ran a
separate online brokerage operation named Discover Brokerage
Direct, after the firm's Discover credit card. Discover Brokerage
ran a pair of popular TV ads that depicted a truck driver who had
bought his own island with his stock-trading profits and a
teen-ager who had his own helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Those ads incurred the wrath of Arthur Levitt, the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Levitt said they were
inappropriate and could create false expectations of instant riches
among small investors, and the commission began scrutinizing online
brokerage firm ads. (Last week, ETrade, which has been sued for
advertising said to be deceptive, disclosed that regulators were
screening its ads before they were published or broadcast.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that, and we definitely addressed that head on,'' Sloss
said, referring to the regulators' displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a rival securities firm, Merrill Lynch,
announced that it would offer online trading, Morgan Stanley folded
Discover Brokerage into its traditional brokerage operation and
renamed it Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online. The first ads for the
renamed unit struck a decidedly more conservative tone, cautioning
investors to ``know your source'' of stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   The new ads, led by one bearing the headline ``Life's not
fair,'' tell investors that there are no shortcuts to investment
success. The ads lay out the resources the firm has that the
upstarts do not, like proprietary stock research and a high ranking
as an underwriter of technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can repatriate some of that group of investors who
thought that full-service brokers could not meet their needs,''
Sloss said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, some ads show a younger and more diverse group of
faces than those that usually appear in ads for Wall Street firms.
But the mood is not as upbeat as in a spot for, say, Gap khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not mollycoddling people,'' said Jeff Finkler, executive
creative director at Leo Burnett USA. in Chicago, which created the
ads. ``We're going to be very blunt. Nowhere is there a vague
promise of some promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   Also absent is any glimpse of a Morgan Stanley broker, a marked
contrast to the TV and print ads Merrill Lynch started running this
year. Merrill's ads profile particular brokers and clients to
emphasize that providing advice to individuals and small businesses
is the heart of its brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   Sloss said the brokers will get more attention after the first
round of ads in the campaign. He described the ``well connected''
theme as a ``platform'' that could be part of Morgan Stanley's
advertising for years to come, as the firm evolves and incorporates
new technology, like access to its services from cellular phones
and other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the firm is taking a risk in shifting away from a
tried-and-true advertising formula, said Bruce Brittain, president
of Brittain Associates, a marketing consulting firm in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers tend to think of Morgan Stanley before most other
financial services companies ``because of their long-standing
campaign, which stuck with a particular theme,'' he said. ``It's
very well known and highly associative. If they do walk away from
that, I think they're giving up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-running ads with an actor playing a brokerage firm
chief became so ingrained in the popular consciousness that they
were the object of a classic parody on ``Saturday Night Live.''
Even Finkler seemed to have been flattered by the imitation, which
he called ``hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloss said the firm intended to work the ``one investor at a
time'' line into some of the new ads. More than 10 print ads have
been created to promote different aspects of the firm's business to
different audiences. The headline on one is ``Hear the word on the
street before it's on the street.'' Another reads: ``The new old
boys' club. Less old. Less boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV ads will make their debut next weekend during the
broadcast of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Sloss said.

TIME IS SHORT FOR ADS AT TOP OF WEB PAGES

<P>
   In an effort to give media planners more information about
advertising patterns online, a study to be released on Monday found
that a majority of online advertisements had short life spans,
running three weeks or less.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in keeping with the short attention spans of most
Internet users, 23.7 percent of all online advertisements run one
week, while 16 percent run two weeks, and 11.9 percent run three
weeks, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, most advertisers reach a very small audience, the
study said, with a huge majority getting less than a 0.01 percent
share among all online advertisements running at a particular time.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done by AdRelevance, a unit of the Internet measuring
service Media Metrix, analyzed standard ad banners on the top 500
Web sites, as determined by Media Metrix, between July 1999 and
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Buchwalter, vice president for media research for
AdRelevance and an author of the study, said the findings indicated
that advertisers were using online ads more for short-term direct
marketing than to create brand awareness. ``As time goes by,'' he
said, ``the average duration of campaigns will start increasing as
people understand more about the brand impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey did find differences in the length of online
campaigns run by various industries. While the auto industry
scheduled online ads to run the longest, an average 7.8 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the average online ad campaign in the
second quarter of 2000 registered 7,265,000 impressions, a measure
of the number of times an ad is viewed. But more than half of all
advertisers ran campaigns that registered fewer than 44,000
impressions in the second quarter, equivalent to about 0.0003
percent of all ads displayed in that period on a site like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwalter said that over all, the study's findings reflected
the fact that advertisers were still learning what works best in a
relatively new medium. ``With all the growth that is happening in
the online ad industry,'' he said, ``It's still in its infancy.''

<P>
   A city office designed to improve race relations in Scottsdale
has spent nearly $1.2 million in three years to tout diversity, but
critics say it's more spin than substance.
</P>
<P>
   And next month, the City Council will appoint its first Human
Relations Commission, an arm of the office, but only 10 citizens -
including three Blacks and apparently no Hispanics - have applied
for the seven volunteer positions.
</P>
<P>
   Sales representative Kim Bass, 33, a five-year resident, hopes
to be one of the minorities named to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the African-American community be
represented on this board,'' she said. ``I'd like to see more
minorities living in Scottsdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale's Diversity and Dialogue Office - the first in the
Valley - was created in 1998 after a lawsuit alleging that police
racism sparked a threat of protest at the nationally known Phoenix
Open golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity Director Don Logan oversees a $400,000 annual budget
and a three-person staff. He says the office does diversity
training, education and recruiting, handles discrimination
complaints and sponsors multicultural events. Critics - White,
Black and Hispanic - call the office an overreaction to the
perception of Scottsdale as an unfriendly place for minorities. The
city's population is about 91 percent White, 6 percent Hispanic and
less than 2 percent African-American, Native American or
Asian-American. Logan says he expects the city's volunteer
commission to mirror Scottsdale's White majority.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Sandra Rembrandt calls the diversity office a ``snow
job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, he (Don Logan) has absolutely no
integrity when it comes to looking at and addressing the problems
of ethnic minorities in Scottsdale,'' said Rembrandt, a Black
entrepreneur who runs a Web site devoted to health care issues for
minorities. ``He doesn't live in this community. You have people in
this community who would do this job for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan, a Chandler resident who is Black, said the ``window
dressing'' criticism is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said some critics expect him to be especially tough on the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not my style. I'm doing this job because I'm
sincere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, a 21-year city employee who is paid $84,000 a year,
attends police internal affairs briefings every Wednesday. He says
his office deals in intangibles, such as ``community dialogues,''
that can't be measured. Logan has to sign off on every city
employee who's slated to be fired. He said he prevented the
dismissals of two Hispanic employees for visiting X-rated web sites
because White employees had done the same thing and received a
lesser penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Though Logan stepped up for those men, Jess Torrez said Logan
misled him. Torrez, a former city police officer, was awarded
$100,000 in 1997 after he sued, arguing that he was fired for
exposing racism in the department. Logan worked in the city
manager's office at the time, but part of his job dealt with
diversity issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Logan guaranteed me I would not get fired, and the day
after I went to see him I was fired,'' Torrez said. ``Don Logan is
a schmoozer; he's a token mouthpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan said he didn't know Torrez was going to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Torrez's termination had nothing to do with his meeting
with me,'' he said. The diversity office was created three months
after Torrez's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Logan has kept a low profile in the city's most recent racial
controversy, and he's defending the city. In July, 10 city
employees filed a $10million lawsuit claiming deliberate
mistreatment of Hispanic workers at the city-owned WestWorld horse
and entertainment park.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time Scottsdale activist Frances Young says the diversity
office is missing its mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a cultural diversity office to put on a Cinco
de Mayo lunch or to put on an MLK breakfast,'' she said ``I would
love for someone in the city to admit there are problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity office's first annual report, released this
summer, was criticized because it carried portraits of minority
people who don't live or work in Scottsdale. Logan said using a
commercial photo collection saved the city $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members have sharply different views of the office.
Councilman George Zraket calls it a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see these so-called accomplishments having a value of
$1 million to the taxpayers,'' Zraket said. ``To me, these are
simple tasks that could be done by one part-time employee.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Ortega, elected last spring as the first Hispanic on
City Council, said the department is ``essential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the human need side of the city,'' Ortega said.
``I don't get involved in racial politics, but Scottsdale has a
large influx of people from diverse backgrounds. This office should
not be viewed as public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Scottsdale City Manager Dick Bowers, who pushed for the
creation of the diversity, said criticism is part of being a trend
setter in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most major corporations have a diversity office. And they
don't do it for the return on investment,'' he said. ``We're better
off today.''

<P>
   At his small suite of offices in Fort Lee, N.J., David Chang was
a tycoon without much to do.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 56, often rode to work in a Rolls-Royce and strode
through the door in a long mink coat, a cigarette dangling from his
lips. But although his holding company boasted of big, global deals
in everything from oil exploration to telecommunications, almost
none of those ventures ever got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, Chang cut a different figure. There he
attended state dinners at the White House and visited informally
with the president. He hired President Clinton's chief fund-raiser
as a consultant, and cultivated senators and congressmen from both
parties. The chairman of his company, a retired Navy admiral, had
been chief of staff to George Bush when he was vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of Chang's popularity among American politicians was
no secret: He and his employees gave generously to favored
candidates and their parties _ more than 100 contributions,
totaling $325,000. Chang also pledged at least $1 million toward
the presidential library that Clinton hopes to build in Little
Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's activities finally caught the attention of federal
campaign-finance investigators, who learned that he was spending
more money on politicians than he was reporting in taxable income.
In June he pleaded guilty to channeling over $53,000 in illegal
contributions to one of the Democratic Party's most important
fund-raisers, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chang is at the center of a widening federal inquiry into
the possibility that Torricelli's 1996 campaign staff may have been
complicit in Chang's illegal donations _ something the senator
strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the case say Chang has given prosecutors
information suggesting that Torricelli's aides accounted improperly
for some of his contributions, and at least two dozen FBI agents
have been added to the inquiry in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli and other politicians now cast Chang as an
unscrupulous con man, and themselves as his unwitting victims.
Through his Washington lawyer, Chang declined to comment. But
Chang's credibility is likely to be a central issue in any new case
that is brought.
</P>
<P>
   Chang used his Washington contacts in part to carve out an
unusual business niche, trying to supply goods and services to
countries hostile to the United States. Besides shipping wheat to
North Korea, his former employees said, he tried to send ambulances
and other equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At first Chang was a relatively modest and mainly Republican
donor. In 1992, for instance, he gave $25,000 to Republicans and
$1,000 to Torricelli, then his local congressman. But by the
1995-96 election cycle, the balance of his generosity shifted to
Democrats, and Torricelli became his most favored politician.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, a spokesman for Torricelli said his campaign
fund-raisers merely found Chang's name _ along with hundreds of
others _ on a list of New Jersey donors provided by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``He was not one of the senator's
inner circle of fund-raisers,'' the senator's chief of staff, Eric
B. Shuffler, said. ``Not in any way, shape or form anything close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of Torricelli's friends and former aides tell of a much
closer relationship. ``All of a sudden,'' one former aide recalled,
``he became a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Chang and his aides gave $8,000 to
Torricelli, and Chang was named to the finance committee for
Torricelli's 1996 campaign. Chang gave Torricelli use of his
corporate jet during his 1996 Senate campaign, and investigators
are now examining whether the campaign fully reimbursed Chang for
the 19 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Chang gave another $30,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, of which Torricelli was named vice chairman and then
chairman, and $5,000 to a legal-defense fund set up on Torricelli's
behalf for a House ethics inquiry involving Torricelli, who was
ultimately cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Between late 1995 and 1996, Chang also arranged for another
$53,700 in illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign,
funneling the money through friends, business associates and even
the former chairman of the Bergen County Republican Party, Berek
Don. Don has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and is
cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Torricelli, who declined to answer questions
about the matter himself, said the senator's office did almost
nothing for Chang in return for his support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Chang became a more prized Democratic donor, his
legal troubles were in fairly plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   His role in making $12,000 in illegal campaign contributions to
the 1992 campaign of former Rep. Jay Kim, a Korean-American
Republican from California, had come to light in news articles by
August 1997. (Chang was not charged, after agreeing to cooperate
with federal prosecutors.) His involvement in illegal contributions
to the 1996 Torricelli campaign surfaced clearly in May 1999, when
Don pleaded guilty to funneling Chang's money through employees at
his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressure from federal prosecutors grew, the lawyer then
leading Chang's defense, Michael Critchley, did something that
stunned many of the lawyers following the case.
</P>
<P>
   After Chang's arrest on campaign-finance, conspiracy and
obstruction-of-justice charges, Critchley announced in court that
Chang had ``no information about any criminal wrongdoing'' by any
public officials, mentioning Clinton, Torricelli and McAuliffe by
name. With that, Critchley, who is active in Democratic Party
politics in New Jersey, seemed to foreclose the possibility that
Chang would ever cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, however, as Chang prepared to go to
trial with a new lawyer, he indicated to prosecutors that he might
in fact have that kind of information and agreed to cooperate with
the authorities. He became the sixth person to plead guilty to
making illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign.

AVEN A HIT FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The pennant race was in other cities while the Chicago
Cubs and Dodgers were at Wrigley Field, but that doesn't mean there
can't be a little edge.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were agitated with the other for pitches that seemed
to have intent and it started when Dodgers' fill-in left fielder
Bruce Aven hit his second homer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And though the game dragged nearly four hours and the Cubs
bullpen showed exactly why general manager Ed Lynch was fired
earlier this season, there was still plenty of emotion after the
Dodgers' 7-6 victory in 10 innings in the series finale. The
winning run scored on a two-out wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion began when Cubs starter Kerry Wood _ who struck
out 11 in seven innings only to have the bullpen blow it _ allowed
a two-run homer to Aven in the fifth, pulling the Dodgers to within
5-3. Wood followed with a pitch he threw behind Alex Cora's head,
the ball actually bouncing off his bat.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes
threw his first pitch high and inside to Mark Grace. Home plate
umpire Mark Wegner warned the benches, causing Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson to argue. He was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is head-hunting, behind him, and (Wegner) does nothing,''
Johnson said of Wood's pitch. ``My guy comes (inside) and it's a
warning. When you throw (behind the head), that's totally out of
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' 3-1 pitch to Grace plunked the first baseman on the
shoulder and earned a stunned Valdes and bench coach Jim Tracy, the
acting manager, ejections of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can gain respect, but not by throwing at the head of
hitters,'' said Valdes, whose ejection came after a miserable
four-inning outing in which he allowed five runs. ``That could be
your career, who knows? Nobody knows. I think he learned his
lesson. He has to learn how to get respect and that's not the way.
There are a lot of ways to get respect, but throwing at the head of
a guy, you're messing with his career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers weren't the only ones upset. Though Valdes said he
and Grace are friends, it was Grace who criticized Valdes during
his time with the Cubs earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wood) did what he had to do,'' Grace said. ``Had the roles
been reversed, we would've retaliated. Once they hit me, it was
even. It was bad timing on my part (to be leading off).''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (68-62) pulled to within six games of first-place
San Francisco after being nine out a week ago, and did it without
their staple of late _ the long ball.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros tied it 5-5 with a two-run, one-out single in the
top of the eighth and the Dodgers took a 6-5 lead on Adrian
Beltre's sacrifice fly. Left-handers were batting .159 against
Dodgers reliever Mike Fetters until Roosevelt Brown, called up
earlier in the day to replace Rondell White, homered to the
opposite field with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers, with their $98 million payroll, used the
bargain boys to scratch across the go-ahead run in the 10th. Jeff
Branson led off with a walk, was sacrificed by Beltre to second and
went to third on Aven's groundout. With Cora at the plate, Cubs
reliever Todd Van Poppel's wild pitch allowed Aven to score. &QL;

VOICESTREAM IS SAID TO SEEK TO BUY WIRELESS PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Tenn., Fla., Wash.)   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and SIMON ROMERO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VoiceStream Wireless, the U.S. wireless carrier that Deutsche
Telekom plans to acquire, is expected to announce Monday that it
has agreed to buy Powertel, a wireless operator in the Southeast,
for as much as $5.8 billion, according to executives close to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Powertel would fill a crucial gap in
VoiceStream's network and its goal of offering seamless access
across the nation. The deal would give VoiceStream coverage in 24
of the nation's top 25 markets, adding cities including Atlanta;
Jacksonville, Fla.; and Memphis and Nashville, Tenn. VoiceStream's
network now covers 22 of the top 25 markets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal illustrates how consolidation in the telecommunications
industry, and in wireless communications in particular, is picking
up speed. Use of wireless services is also increasing, with
carriers adding an estimated 30,000 subscribers each day.
</P>
<P>
   While Powertel has only about 720,000 customers and is not one
of the top 10 wireless companies in the United States, its network
uses the same technical standard _ global system for mobile
communications _ that VoiceStream uses and is compatible with
Deutsche Telekom's network and most others in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the deal, shareholders of
Powertel, which is based in West Point, Ga., would receive about
$85 for each of their shares. That represents no premium, because
Powertel shares rose $4.69 to close at $86.63 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream would assume about $1.2 billion of Powertel's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The complex deal also involves a collar, which is a method to
determine stock prices in which a specific price range is agreed
upon instead of the establishment of an exact cost per share. If
VoiceStream's shares increased beyond $130.77, shareholders of
Powertel would receive 0.65 of a share of VoiceStream for each of
their shares. If VoiceStream shares fell below $113.33, Powertel
shareholders would receive 0.75 of a Voicetream share for each
Powertel share.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes a bonus payout if Deutsche Telekom's
acquisition of VoiceStream receives regulatory approval.
Shareholders of Powertel would receive $105.36 a share in Deutsche
Telekom stock, representing 2.6353 Deutsche Telekom shares for
every one share of Powertel. In this instance, there is no collar.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the transaction would guarantee that
Powertel shareholders would receive about the same amount of money
for their shares regardless of how VoiceStream shares fluctuate.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the VoiceStream-Powertel deal said they
hoped that both transactions would be completed in six to nine
months. Some analysts have questioned whether Deutsche Telekom is
paying too much for VoiceStream, which is based in Bellevue, Wash.,
but others have suggested that the acquisition of Powertel would
make the VoiceStream deal more palatable to Deutsche Telekom
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powertel is a critical enabler in VoiceStream's need for
nationwide coverage,'' said Andrew Cole, a wireless communications
consultant with Renaissance Strategy Worldwide. ``Now, Deutsche
Telekom is at least buying a car with the brakes included.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not clear yet whether Deutsche Telekom's plan
to buy VoiceStream for more than $50 billion will be approved after
resistance to the transaction emerged in Congress. Critics were
concerned about the acquisition of a U.S. telecommunications
company by a large foreign concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shrewd for Deutsche Telekom to expand in the U.S. by
buying a minor player in the wireless industry, but now it seems
that strategy is changing,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent
telecommunications analyst based in Atlanta. ``The bigger the deal
appears, the more resistance the Germans could get from
regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stanton, VoiceStream's chief executive, sees things
differently. ``Just because this deal scales us up in the Southeast
isn't that meaningful when it comes to the regulatory issues,''
Stanton said in a telephone interview. ``I would say passionately
that there are still no national security or technical reasons why
the Deutsche Telekom deal should not be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced in July, VoiceStream's shares have
declined 8 percent, to $118.19 from $128.50, while Deutsche Telekom
has fallen more than 10 percent, to $40.31 from $45.  &QL;

A FEARLESS HAMPTON LETS THE METS CATCH THEIR BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO 
 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sight of Mike Hampton sliding on the infield
grass and swinging like he was the cleanup hitter Sunday left Bobby
Valentine shaking his head. How could the Mets pitcher risk another
injury? But the concern in the visiting dugout at Shea did not set
in until Hampton remained on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton returned from a stress fracture in his right ribs Sunday
and did everything possible to boost the Mets' playoff chances and
demoralize the Diamondbacks. His eight dominant innings led the
Mets to a 2-1 victory and helped them win this three-game series.
They gained a game on the Diamondbacks in the wild-card standing,
and many more in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a comfort level to see Mike out there today,'' Mets
pitcher Al Leiter said. ``You know if he gets in trouble, he's
going to get out of it and that translates into their dugout. They
know it's going to be a tough game.''
</P>
<P>
   As disheartening as it was on Friday for Arizona to see Randy
Johnson again look mortal against the Mets, they had to sense a
bigger loss Sunday. The victory put the Mets five and a half games
ahead of the Diamondbacks in the National League wild-card race. A
sweep this weekend would have written off Arizona. Losing two of
three came close. Hampton's return made it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is a sign of relief that he's healthy, or
almost healthy,'' John Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't 100 percent, I'd hate to see him healthy,''
Arizona Manager Buck Showalter said. ``He was outstanding. He was
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's cracked right rib originated from a high school
football injury. But he also strained an oblique muscle on Aug. 17
and missed his last scheduled start. Hampton (13-7) allowed one run
on three hits in eight innings Sunday and is 4-0 with a 2.18 earned
run average in his past six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's late in the season,'' Hampton said. ``I'm not out there
just trying to get through. I'm out there trying to help my team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani's solo homer in the fourth inning gave the Mets a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's only struggle came in the fifth inning, when seven of
his first eight pitches were balls. Catcher Mike Piazza thought
Hampton was rushing his delivery. Arizona's Kelly Stinnett, who led
off with a walk, scored when Danny Bautista lined a two-out single
over Edgardo Alfonzo's outstretched glove at second base to tie the
score, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura nearly gave the Mets the lead in the bottom of the
fifth, but settled for nostalgia. Ventura hit a leadoff drive to
straight-away center field, where last October Steve Finley leaped
in vain for Todd Pratt's division series-clinching 10th-inning home
run. Finley robbed Piazza of an extra-base hit at the wall earlier
Sunday, but finally scaled the wall on Ventura. Finley leaped,
turned his back toward home plate and reached 3 feet above the wall
for the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get it out of his reach to be sure,'' Ventura
said. ``You just shake your head and go back to the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks needed this victory and let the starter Armando
Reynoso (10-9) pitch the game's decisive moment. Alfonzo and Piazza
each had one-out singles in the seventh to put runners on first and
second. With a 1-1 count on Ventura, Reynoso tried to pick Alfonzo
off second base and nearly did. But he appeared upset when Alfonzo
was ruled safe, which television replays verified.
</P>
<P>
   The call either rattled Reynoso or he was extra cautious
pitching to Ventura. Three straight balls loaded the bases for Todd
Zeile, who hit a slow roller to the hole between shortstop and
third. Hanley Frias caught the ball but could only get a forceout
at second, allowing the eventual winning run to score.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Hampton. His delivery was unaffected by the
injury, which had been the Mets' greatest fear. Athletic trainers
said Hampton could do no further damage, basing his ability to
pitch on tolerating pain. Hampton admitted he had lingering pain
and said he would most likely pitch with some discomfort for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between having pain and being hurt,''
Hampton said. ``This is just a pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine did not stop worrying about Hampton. He cringed when
Hampton slid on his knees to field a grounder down the first-base
line in the third inning and appeared displeased when Hampton took
a full cut in his first at-bat despite the advice from the pitching
coach Dave Wallace, which was, Valentine said: ``Be smart with this
thing. Use your head.'' Hampton said the swing was instinctive when
he saw a pitch over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The rib pain flares mostly when Hampton throws his four-seam
fastball, a pitch that can reach 92 miles an hour. Hampton threw
only 10 of those Sunday, relying instead on his lively sinking
fastball, changeup and breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton did not, however, buy Valentine's contention that
missing one start may have been a blessing in disguise by resting
him for the playoff race. Hampton said he has felt strong for
months and plans on feeling that way come October.
</P>
<P>
   With Hampton out of the game, Jay Bell made a long out to the
left-field wall and Jay Payton dropped a line drive for an error in
the ninth before Armando Benitez recorded his 35th save. Later,
Hampton wore a straight face while answering reporters' question
until he was reminded that other pitchers have started in the
playoffs with similar injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will too,'' he said with a smile. &QL;

IS HUNDLEY A CUB IN DODGERS' CLOTHING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley spent a significant
portion of his life in Chicago when his father, Randy, played for
the Cubs, and the younger Hundley said he's thought about playing
for his hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm concentrating on this team and this year, and in
time that will take care of itself,'' said Hundley, who admitted to
harboring a feeling of one day playing for the Cubs. ``That's
always the case. A guy's home team is always special to them. But
the bottom line is I want to play on a winning team next year.
That's the bottom line with me. Of course, you think of your home
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-one games. That's what it would be. It's my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's eligible for free agency after the season, and one
area the Dodgers may be able to trim their $98 million payroll is
with their catcher. Hundley's making $6 million this season, and
signing him to a big contract next season probably won't make much
financial sense _ even to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers management will make a hard run at re-signing
right-hander Darren Dreifort, also eligible for free agency after
the season, and extending the contract of right-hander Chan Ho
Park. The Dodgers are also expected to be heavily involved in the
courting of free-agent-to-be Mike Hampton of the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have already said they were interested in re-signing
catcher Chad Kreuter after the season. And with catching prospects
Angel Pena and Paul LoDuca both at Triple-A Albuquerque, Hundley is
considered expendable despite producing well offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley went to high school in nearby Palantine, Ill., and his
parents still live in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hundley's been on the disabled list twice (strained
oblique muscle, broken right thumb) this season, he's still having
a big year at the plate. Hundley, who recently stopped
switch-hitting and is batting only left-handed, is hitting .303
with 22 homers and 56 RBI in 69 games.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Hundley's nine errors are tied for most among
National League catchers. Though he's thrown much better this
season, he's still thrown out just 16 of 77 runners (20.7 percent)
trying to steal.
</P>
<P>
   BROWN, SHEFFIELD STATUS: Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown, ill
through the weekend, said he plans to make his scheduled start
today in the series opener at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling much better than I was a few days ago,'' Brown
said. ``I'm just going to go out and do what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sheffield's status isn't as simple to determine. He was
eligible to play Sunday after serving his five-game suspension, but
he missed his seventh straight game with a flu-like illness.
Sheffield's status continues to be a mystery to the Dodgers, who
remain hopeful he can return to the lineup Tuesday. However, as of
late Sunday they weren't sure when Sheffield was coming to
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Manager Davey Johnson's ejection in the fifth
inning was his third of the season. ... Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood
batted left-handed against right-hander Ismael Valdes to protect
his tender left oblique muscle. He had a base hit in his first
at-bat. Wood batted right-handed against lefty Carlos Perez in the
sixth inning. &QL;

SEARCHING FOR A STAR IN GENERATION NEXT
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sedan slithered through the traffic down Broadway
on an indelicate approach to Times Square. In the face of the
halogen spectacle, the passenger, Marat Safin, snapped out of his
groggy state, flung open his eyes like shutters and absorbed the
plunge into a mosh pit of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding Safin, a 20-year-old Russian, were models on
billboards jostling with morning-show icons pictured on big screens
above the street and blown-up sitcom stars bumping against an MTV
set where squealing teen-agers wave at rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his passage through America's addiction to pop
culture, Safin was amazed _ and a little amused. Although he has J.
Crew good looks to go with his No. 6 seeding at the U.S. Open,
Safin is from a country where he moves without notice from
restaurants to discos and from shops to airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, people don't go, `Oh, there he is,' '' Safin said
with a smile during an interview in midtown on Friday. ``There is
no screaming. In America, you like more show. You like big things
here. Andre Agassi, you see him on TV. He's hot. Russia, it is
colder reaction. Americans like hot things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have 100 programs in Russia. It's only in the United
States you have 100 channels. Of course, in the hotel, there are 20
channels, but also pay TV. Here, it's TV, TV, TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, ratings are used to measure a sport's worth. For years,
Agassi and Pete Sampras have been the pontoons for the popularity
of men's tennis. Today, the U.S. Open begins with the tantalizing
possibility of a Sampras-Agassi semifinal next week, but the life
span of this rivalry is nearing its end.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems inspired to fill the void. There have been six No.
1s in this year's ATP Champions Race, a system that was designed to
create fan interest by counting results from Jan. 1 that has
actually left fans more confused than ever. Still, the system
aside, no player has performed consistently enough to be a favorite
to reach the Open final, much less capture the public's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tiger Woods phenomenon has reinforced anything, it is
that people are mesmerized by domination. As if to manufacture a
star on the tour, and do it before a U.S. audience over the next
two weeks, the ATP has begun a campaign, ``New Balls Please,'' to
promote the next generation. On Sunday, Juan Carlos Ferrero of
Spain, Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, Tommy Haas of Germany and
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil were escorted into an interview room and
lined up as tightly as piano keys for pictures and questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete and Andre are the guys that make things happen,'' Haas
said. ``We are, like they say, the next generation. We're young
guys. We still have a lot to learn. With time, hopefully we're
going to be the next people to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The colorful Kuerten, with his bandanna, blond curls and
barbed-wire physique, is the one voted most likely to succeed. But
if Kuerten, a two-time French Open winner, is to advance his
popularity in America, he will have to perform on a hard court and
get through a tricky draw. In his quarter, Patrick Rafter, a
two-time winner at this event, and Mark Philippoussis are looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kuerten has personality, and he's well-liked,'' the CBS
analyst John McEnroe said. ``He's got a lot of drive you don't see.
The other guys are unpredictable. Pete and Andre are still going to
be there for a couple of years, but there are not a lot of other
guys right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Safin is one of the unknown variables. After a forgettable 5-11
start to the season, and through 48 rackets broken during fits of
frustration, the 6-foot-4-inch Safin has won 40 of his last 50
matches. To usher him toward a coming-out party at the Open, he has
a favorable path in his quarter of the draw, with third-seeded
Magnus Norman posing the major threat. Safin, of course, does not
want to discuss his fortuitous draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how many guys think this is their moment?'' he said.
``All 128 want to win and become a star.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is resistant to the characterization, Safin has star
qualities. He has a sense of humor that squeezes through the cracks
in his unpolished English and a powerful game that, at times, falls
short on control. He is talented and tanned, but sometimes appears
to be teetering on a Philippoussis-like line. For several years,
the Australian's performance was diluted by his fast-paced
bachelor's life. Safin believes his night life is within the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, at night, I like to have a drink or have a beer,''
Safin said. ``But right now, when I'm at tournaments, I have to
stay in my room, and try to do things in the right way. And I have
to be nice to myself. Get rest.''
</P>
<P>
   On most days, he likes to sleep until noon. On Friday, a prank
call awoke Safin at 9 a.m., and it was hard to recover. But even in
a weary state, Safin was eager to discuss any subject, from
politics to poverty. And when asked about his budding popularity,
he did not seem moved by the hype. If anything, he knows humility.
Safin grew up in Moscow during political upheaval, when tennis
balls were considered a luxury item.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult time,'' he said. ``There was nothing in the
shops. It was difficult to find even good cheese, and to get sugar
was a big problem. If you don't have shops that have food, how are
you going to have tennis balls and rackets?''
</P>
<P>
   How could he develop at all? When Safin was 14, his parents made
the difficult decision to pack their son's belongings and send him
to Spain. Although he lived with a sponsor and trained with a
coach, Safin was lonely and too poor to join his friends at
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, at the beginning, you say, `Where's my family;
where's my mother; where's my father and my sister?''' Safin said.
``But after a few weeks, you start to become a normal person. You
realize this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how the career started for Safin. This was the beginning
for one member of tennis' Generation Next. Just how familiar the
public becomes with his story will unfold this week. If Grand Slam
fame strikes, Safin will not give stardom a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you have to prepare for it?'' he said. ``You move
to another level, raise your ranking, but you are still living in
the same world. You walk on the street with everyone, with the
people. Maybe there is a lot of media, a lot of attention, but so
what? Nothing should change.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   At his small suite of offices in Fort Lee, N.J., David Chang was
a tycoon without much to do.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 56, often rode to work in a Rolls-Royce and strode
through the door in a long mink coat, a cigarette dangling from his
lips. But although his holding company boasted of big, global deals
in everything from oil exploration to telecommunications, almost
none of those ventures ever got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really saw anybody there do anything,'' said Clark R.
Wilcox, a former banking executive who was hired to help run the
firm in 1997, only to quit soon after and successfully sue his
former employer for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, Chang cut a different figure. There he
attended state dinners at the White House and visited informally
with the president. He hired President Clinton's chief fund-raiser
as a consultant, and cultivated senators and congressmen from both
parties. The chairman of his company, a retired Navy admiral, had
been chief of staff to George Bush when he was vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of Chang's popularity among American politicians was
no secret: He and his employees gave generously to favored
candidates and their parties _ more than 100 contributions,
totaling $325,000. Chang also pledged at least $1 million toward
the presidential library that Clinton hopes to build in Little
Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's activities finally caught the attention of federal
campaign-finance investigators, who learned that he was spending
more money on politicians than he was reporting in taxable income.
In June he pleaded guilty to channeling over $53,000 in illegal
contributions to one of the Democratic Party's most important
fund-raisers, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chang is at the center of a widening federal inquiry into
the possibility that Torricelli's 1996 campaign staff may have been
complicit in Chang's illegal donations _ something the senator
strongly denies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the case say Chang has given prosecutors
information suggesting that Torricelli's aides accounted improperly
for some of his contributions, and at least two dozen FBI agents
have been added to the inquiry in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli and other politicians now cast Chang as an
unscrupulous con man, and themselves as his unwitting victims.
Through his Washington lawyer, Chang declined to comment. But
Chang's credibility is likely to be a central issue in any new case
that is brought.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of Chang _ drawn from interviews, court records and a
thick file of lawsuits by and against him _ shows a man of glaring,
sometimes comical contradictions: He claims to have been educated
at England's best schools but speaks broken English; his closest
business contacts included communist officials from North Korea and
a former Republican congressman from New Jersey; he rallied
American politicians to help him buy a billion-dollar South Korean
insurance company but never had even a small fraction of the money
he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can a guy like Chang can get hooked up with all these
people?'' asked Wilcox, his former employee. ``As a citizen, quite
frankly, it makes me very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   As a businessman, many of his former employees say, Chang
generated all sorts of ambitious schemes but almost no apparent
profit. Though he has owned large houses, expensive cars and the
235-room Fort Lee Hilton hotel, just across the George Washington
Bridge from New York City, it is unclear where he has gotten his
money, large chunks of which have arrived in wire transfers from
abroad, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   And while Chang's generosity won him many attentive friends in
Washington, it did not buy him all the political favors he sought.
His most important request, that the Clinton administration help
him win repayment of tens of millions of dollars that he said he
was owed by North Korea for grain shipments, made almost no
progress at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anything go wrong?'' said a spokesman for Clinton, Jake
Seiwert. ``His proposals were neither accepted nor acted upon. What
he wanted to do didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the story of Chang's education in money politics is a
remarkable chapter in the saga of Washington influence bought and
sold. In a world of fund-raiser business executives, deal-savvy
senators and retired officials who increasingly exploit their
connections abroad, Chang was a magnet for the powerful _ even
after he was publicly identified as having given illegal donations
to two different election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Contradictions
</P>
<P>
   Who David Chang is has been difficult to ascertain.
</P>
<P>
   At a bail hearing earlier this year, prosecutors noted that
Chang had used at least two passports and three Social Security
numbers, listed two different birthplaces and three different birth
dates, and was married to two women at the same time _ not
including a reputed girlfriend who has also been listed as his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Chang is a chronic liar,'' one of his many former
lawyers, Michael S. Kimm, asserted in a recent lawsuit, which, like
several suits by other people, claims that Chang failed to pay him
what he owed. ``David Chang believes that he can say anything at a
given moment and get away with it because he is arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the basic facts of his background, Chang has
contradicted himself repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In one set of court papers, he said he was born in Beijing in
1943 and emigrated to South Korea soon after the communist takeover
of China six years later. In an interview last year with a South
Korean newspaper, he said he was born in Korea and left his
homeland in 1963, when he hopped a freighter and sailed to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Chang told his employees that he spent the '70s
and '80s working as a high-flying oil trader in London and the
Middle East, cultivating friendships with members of the Saudi
royal family. Through his Washington lawyer, David Schertler, Chang
said he had worked abroad for his own oil company, Nikko Petroleum,
and moved its operations to New York in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chang's profile began to rise in the United States around 1990,
when he became an American citizen. By then he was calling his firm
Nikko Enterprises Inc. and had moved it into offices in Fort Lee.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed himself as a man of discreet but powerful patrons.
He told associates that he had named his firm for its sponsorship
by Nikko Securities Co., Japan's third-largest brokerage, and that
he had a rich young wife in Japan, the daughter of a Nikko
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Nikko Securities have nothing to do with Chang but
it also apparently persuaded him to stop using its name, prompting
him to reincorporate his company in 1994 as Bright &AMP; Bright. Soon
enough, though, he found new sources of respectability in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first and most important of Chang's Washington
contacts was Daniel J. Murphy, a high-profile lobbyist with a
gleaming government resume. A retired four-star admiral, Murphy had
commanded the Navy's 6th Fleet, had served as chief of staff to
George Bush when he was vice president, and had been a deputy
director of the CIA, and a deputy undersecretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from Bush's staff in 1985, Murphy went to work
as a lobbyist, first for Gray &AMP; Co., a firm closely tied to the
Reagan administration, and then on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly built a reputation for putting business ahead of
politics, representing the Marxist government of Angola, trying to
drum up business in Gen. Manuel Noriega's Panama, and maintaining a
friendship with the former South Korean lobbyist and intelligence
agent Tongsun Park long after Park's ties to American congressmen
touched off a political scandal involving U.S. officials in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who declined to say anything about his relationship with
Chang, began working for him as a consultant and lobbyist by at
least 1990, according to Schertler, Chang's lawyer. Murphy soon
became a business partner as well, helping Chang open some of the
more important doors in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at the White House once a month, when I was there,''
said one former assistant who worked for Chang during the latter
half of the Bush administration. Bush's spokesman said the former
president did not recall ever meeting Chang, and there are no
records that Chang ever made a private visit to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a Niche
</P>
<P>
   Chang used his Washington contacts in part to carve out an
unusual business niche, trying to supply goods and services to
countries hostile to the United States. Besides shipping wheat to
North Korea, his former employees said, he tried to send ambulances
and other equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On a more mundane level, he bought U.S. real estate and Asian
stocks, tried to sell repackaged cigarettes in Russia and beer
snacks in South Korea, and explored building a fleet of miniblimps
for advertising. Almost none of his start-ups, however, seem to
have even gotten off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what Chang was using for capital. For his grain
deal with North Korea, he received at least $60 million from South
Korea's Shinhan Bank, and from L.G. International, the New Jersey
subsidiary of one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Chang obtained one of the first Commerce Department
licenses authorizing the sale of food to North Korea, which was
then subject to U.S. trade sanctions. By 1994, court records show,
he had shipped the government there some 560,000 tons of wheat,
with a value of $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chang accused the North Korean government of failing to pay him
$71 million on the deal and reneging on a $1.2-billion contract for
further shipments. He made the accusations in a libel suit filed
against a Korean-language newspaper based in New York, which
published an article accusing him of giving free rooms at the Fort
Lee Hilton to visiting North Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
   The paper stood by its story; Chang dropped his suit three years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever misgivings Chang had about doing business with the
North Koreans apparently eased. By 1998, he had been back to North
Korea on a contract to provide logistical support for a U.S. Army
team that sought to recover the remains of American soldiers
missing there since the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   New Alliances
</P>
<P>
   With Bush out of the White House and South Korean financiers
pressing him for repayment on the grain deal, Chang began to
cultivate new allies among the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Until then he had been a relatively modest and mainly Republican
donor. In 1992, for instance, he gave $25,000 to Republicans and
$1,000 to Torricelli, then his local congressman. But by the
1995-96 election cycle, the balance of his generosity shifted to
Democrats, and Torricelli became his most favored politician.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, a spokesman for Torricelli said his campaign
fund-raisers merely found Chang's name _ along with hundreds of
others _ on a list of New Jersey donors provided by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``He was not one of the senator's
inner circle of fund-raisers,'' the senator's chief of staff, Eric
B. Shuffler, said. ``Not in any way, shape or form anything close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of Torricelli's friends and former aides tell of a much
closer relationship. ``All of a sudden,'' one former aide recalled,
``he became a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Chang and his aides gave $8,000 to
Torricelli, and Chang was named to the finance committee for
Torricelli's 1996 campaign. Chang gave Torricelli use of his
corporate jet during his 1996 Senate campaign, and investigators
are now examining whether the campaign fully reimbursed Chang for
the 19 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Chang gave another $30,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, of which Torricelli was named vice chairman and then
chairman, and $5,000 to a legal-defense fund set up on Torricelli's
behalf for a House ethics inquiry involving Torricelli, who was
ultimately cleared.
</P>
<P>
   As his relationship with the White House grew, Chang and his
companies gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee and
$70,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Over
the same period, Chang, his aides and his companies gave only about
$44,000 to the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Between late 1995 and 1996, Chang also arranged for another
$53,700 in illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign,
funneling the money through friends, business associates and even
the former chairman of the Bergen County Republican Party, Berek
Don. Don has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and is
cooperating with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Torricelli, who declined to answer questions
about the matter himself, said the senator's office did almost
nothing for Chang in return for his support.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it looks strange, but this is not a guy who we did
anything for,'' Shuffler said. ``No one on our staff, in our
Washington office, ever spoke to Chang or met him.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, several other politicians and current and former
Torricelli aides remember the relationship differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seen as someone who Torricelli was actively engaged
with,'' one former aide said. ``This was a guy who was important to
Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Torricelli went to South Korea just days
before a presidential election there. The U.S. Embassy, concerned
that Torricelli might be seen as meddling in the campaign, balked
at setting up political meetings for him. Chang swept into the
void.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-page statement issued in response to written questions,
Torricelli's office denied that Chang was present on the trip, made
any of the arrangements for it, or communicated about it with any
members of the senator's staff.
</P>
<P>
   But two people with detailed knowledge of the trip said Chang
did stay in the same hotel as Torricelli, while Chang's aide,
Christopher Kim, helped set up meetings for the senator with the
two opposition candidates, Kim Dae-jung, who won the vote, and Rhee
In-je. In a brief interview, Kim also acknowledged that Chang sent
him to Seoul to help with the arrangements and to act as the
senator's tour guide as he met with Korean officials and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the week of Torricelli's visit, one of Chang's companies also
made a $30,000 donation to the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking Payback
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Torricelli also insisted that despite all of
Chang's financial support, Torricelli never helped his patron with
the matter of his greatest concern _ persuading the Clinton
administration to transfer frozen North Korean assets to him, or to
pressure the North Korean government to repay the debt. But other
politicians were apparently more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last fall, a handful of legislators, from the
relatively liberal Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey to
conservative Republicans like Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming, wrote
to the administration on Chang's behalf, urging it not to ease the
sanctions on North Korea without pressing for the repayment of
debts to U.S. companies like Bright &AMP; Bright.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Lautenberg said they wrote a pro forma letter for him
because he was a New Jersey resident. An aide to Thomas said the
Wyoming senator supported Chang's appeal after being lobbied on his
behalf by one of his business partners, James A. Courter, the
former Republican congressman from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   According to two politicians close to Clinton, Chang was
introduced to the president by Torricelli at a fund-raising event
for the senator. Under questioning by the head of the Justice
Department's campaign-finance task force, Robert J. Conrad Jr.,
Clinton said that Torricelli might have made the introduction, but
that he could not remember.
</P>
<P>
   When South Korea's president visited Washington in June 1998,
Chang and his then 30-year-old assistant, Audrey Yu, were among the
guests at a state dinner. Barely a month later, on July 14, Clinton
invited Chang again, this time to watch a movie in the White House
screening room.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton traveled to Seoul, South Korea, that November,
Chang and others said, he was invited to the president's hotel room
for conversation and pizza. Days before Christmas, Chang was
invited to the White House again, this time for a holiday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Early the following spring, Chang was invited to the White House
to watch the NCAA basketball finals with Clinton. And when the
Chinese prime minister, Zhu Rongji, visited that April, Chang and
Yu were invited to another state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Over the year that he was so assiduously wined, dined and
entertained by Clinton and other administration officials, Chang
and his companies donated over $150,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Terry McAuliffe, the president's close friend and
chief fund-raiser, said, Chang ``was treated no differently from
any other supporter.'' White House officials suggested that while
senior National Security Council officials were dispatched twice in
1998 to meet with Chang and listened to his ideas about U.S. policy
on the Middle East, North Korea and Iraq, mostly they just humored
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Chang became a more prized Democratic donor, his
legal troubles were in fairly plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   The Biggest Deal
</P>
<P>
   His role in making $12,000 in illegal campaign contributions to
the 1992 campaign of former Rep. Jay Kim, a Korean-American
Republican from California, had come to light in news articles by
August 1997. (Chang was not charged, after agreeing to cooperate
with federal prosecutors.) His involvement in illegal contributions
to the 1996 Torricelli campaign surfaced clearly in May 1999, when
Don, the former Bergen County chairman, pleaded guilty to funneling
Chang's money through employees at his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there much evidence that Chang was flourishing in
business.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1998, while he donated over $270,000 to various
political causes, Chang reported only $183,000 in income. Over a
one-year period starting in the fall of 1998, he also lost nearly
$300,000 gambling in Atlantic City, N.J., federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Seiwert, the White house spokesman, said a White House visitor
and major donor like Chang should typically have been vetted by the
Democratic National Committee, the Secret Service and a White House
research unit. He said administration officials were ``still
checking'' to determine how that vetting was done in his case.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Chang hired McAuliffe to help him try to buy a bank
in South Korea. McAuliffe said that before signing a yearlong
consulting contract with Chang, he checked with several people,
including Courter, the former congressman who was listed on company
documents as the president of the new trading company that Chang
established in late 1997, Panacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the contract said Torricelli provided an
enthusiastic reference, telling McAuliffe: ``He's a legitimate
person, a legitimate businessman. His wife's family owns Nikko
Securities.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's aides deny that he or any staff member ever vouched
for Chang.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said that he never discussed Chang's business deals
with Clinton, and that he ended his consulting arrangement after
about six months. Roughly six months after that, however, he agreed
to work for Chang again, this time as an investment banker when
Panacom sought to buy the troubled Korea Life Insurance Co., South
Korea's third-largest insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said he went back after learning that Murphy was
acting as Panacom's chairman, and after Courter assured him that
Chang had enough money to buy the company. He said one of Chang's
lawyers also gave him a Korean newspaper clipping indicating that
Bush had already met with Korean officials on Panacom's behalf,
something that one of Chang's former lawyers, Michael Critchley,
also asserted during a hearing in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush, Gian-Carlo A. Peressutti, said this was
untrue. The former president, he said, had been in Korea on behalf
of another U.S. firm, Carlyle Group, which is headed by former
senior officials from Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Life deal would have been by far Chang's biggest yet,
one that three of the world's largest multinational insurance
companies had already bid on and lost by the summer of 1999, when
Murphy and Chang stepped into the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of a surprise, because no one had ever heard of
them,'' recalled Lee Jong-Koo, a senior Finance Ministry official
who attended the meeting. ``Chang and Admiral Murphy asked
questions about KLI and they indicated that they could raise
abundant funds to acquire the company from various sources,
especially New Jersey pension funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his office in Seoul, Lee said Korean
officials repeatedly sought further evidence from Chang that
Panacom could assemble the roughly $1.5 billion that they were
seeking for the company. Instead, they heard about Chang's
politician friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember David Chang said he knew Senator Torricelli and
other politicians,'' Lee said. ``He also said that he knew
President Clinton and that he had eaten pizza with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the Korean prime minister, Kim Jong-pil, began to
receive letters from politicians in Washington and New Jersey. Rep.
Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., wrote to ``highly recommend Panacom for this
acquisition because of their strong record in investment, trade and
finance for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who received $2,000 from Chang and
his assistant in 1998, wrote a similar letter, as did Torricelli
and a New Jersey state finance official, Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The two representatives said through spokesmen that they did so
because they believed Panacom was a legitimate business with
operations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to one lawmaker said they also checked first with
Torricelli's staff, which vouched strongly for Chang. A spokesman
for Torricelli denied that this happened.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli agreed to provide The New York Times with a copy of
the letter he wrote to the Korean government on Panacom's behalf.
After several weeks, however, his aides said the letter could not
be found.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening Troubles
</P>
<P>
   As Chang's push for the insurance deal continued last summer,
Korean officials became openly suspicious that he was acting as a
front man for the former owner of the insurance company, who had
been imprisoned on corruption charges but was trying to win it
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this guy Chang was lying to me,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe flew to Seoul in late August to help move the deal
ahead. But he said that after only two discussions with Panacom
lawyers, he turned around and flew home, refusing to meet with
Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Life deal finally fell through last fall, as Chang's
legal troubles were deepening in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure from federal prosecutors growing, the lawyer
then leading Chang's defense, Critchley, did something that stunned
many of the lawyers following the case.
</P>
<P>
   After Chang's arrest on campaign-finance, conspiracy and
obstruction-of-justice charges, Critchley announced in court that
Chang had ``no information about any criminal wrongdoing'' by any
public officials, mentioning Clinton, Torricelli and McAuliffe by
name. With that, Critchley, who is active in Democratic Party
politics in New Jersey, seemed to foreclose the possibility that
Chang would ever cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months later, however, as Chang prepared to go to
trial with a new lawyer, he indicated to prosecutors that he might
in fact have that kind of information and agreed to cooperate with
the authorities. He became the sixth person to plead guilty to
making illegal contributions to Torricelli's campaign.

SOUTHERN CAL REDUCES PENN STATE OFFENSE TO A DULL ROAR 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Penn State's first play Sunday
short-circuited with a false start and a 5-yard penalty. Moments
later, split end Eddie Drummond sustained a knee injury that put
him out of the game. Before long, the Nittany Lions' first
possession imploded with a blocked punt that created a Southern
California touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Three tedious hours later, Penn State's first game of the season
ended in a sloppy 29-5 victory for the Trojans in the Kickoff
Classic in Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams first met in the Rose Bowl of 1923. If they are
to meet there again this winter as winners of their conferences,
both will need to improve upon Sunday's ragged display of nerves
and errors.
</P>
<P>
   As the season opener for both sides, it was almost an exhibition
game in terms of impact. The leaves on most trees have not changed
color yet; conference games are still weeks away for USC and Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be a good team and maybe this will
accelerate it,'' said USC Coach Paul Hackett, whose team finished
6-6 in 1999. ``Defensively, wow! They could not run the football
against us. There was some question about USC football. We took a
step nationally. We were carrying the banner for the Pac 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, a member of the Big Ten, gained only 6 net yards
rushing, the lowest total in Joe Paterno's 35 years as head coach.
The Nittany Lions had 142 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the margin of victory, the Trojans' offense had little
to show for its ball control (USC ran 50 times) _ probably because
quarterback Carson Palmer was rusty in his return from a broken
collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scoring on the blocked punt, USC scored another
first-half touchdown on a 43-yard interception return by Troy
Polamalu, who picked off a pass from Rashard Casey, Penn State's
troubled quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also made a few mistakes. They gave up a safety on a
blocked punt and missed an extra point. Their best attacker was
Sultan McCullough, who ran 28 times for 128 yards. Much of that
yardage was gained on runs up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Voted the most valuable player of the game, McCullough said he
was ready to assume the starring role in the USC tailback
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm a track star, but my first love is football,''
McCullough said. ``I can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had run the 40-yard dash in 4.2 seconds and could
probably run it in 4.1. He said his coaches told him: ```It's your
turn to shine,' so that's what I did. It's my first game. It's my
big opener. It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so good was Casey, who returned to his home state and some
troubling memories. He was charged with assaulting an off-duty
police officer in nearby Hoboken, his hometown, last May. The case
is still pending as is a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Casey ``lacked some consistency,'' according to Paterno, in
completing 7 of 24 passes for 106 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of playing better than that, let's put it that
way,'' Paterno said. ``It was a tough outing for him, for a lot of
reasons. This was a tough preseason for him, for a lot of reasons.
He's got this one out of his craw. He can concentrate on having a
little more fun. It's not easy for him to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, replaced early in the fourth quarter by Matt Senneca,
said: ``I'm glad to have this one out of the way, but I'm not glad
the way it turned out. You take the good with the bad. Today, I
think I might have put too much pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his linemen, tackle Kareem McKenzie, said Penn State's
five penalties for false starts resulted from ``not being focused
on the plays called and the snap count itself; not being as focused
as we should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had our number all day long,'' McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat kept Paterno six victories short of Bear Bryant's
Division I-A record of 323.
</P>
<P>
   Including the end of last season, Penn State has lost four
consecutive regular-season games (although the Lions won the Alamo
Bowl last December).
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive victory for USC, which won its
final three games in 1999 after losing six of the previous seven
after a season-ending injury to Palmer. A sophomore, Palmer
completed 10 of 20 passes for 87 yards Sunday against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Petros Papadakis scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and David
Newbury kicked field goals of 47, 27 and 44 yards for Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's best chance to rally came in the third quarter,
when the Lions blocked a punt into the USC end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Had Penn State fallen on the ball for a touchdown, as the
Trojans had earlier, the score and an extra point could have cut
the lead to 23-10 and changed the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern Cal's Marcell Allmond recovered, the Lions got only
2 points and the crowd of 78,902 soon began to file out. &QL;

REPORT QUESTIONS A NUMBER IN MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How many applications dance on the head of a
hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   In his antitrust ruling against Microsoft, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson argued that a crucial barrier confronting
the company's potential competitors are the 70,000 programs written
to run solely on the Windows operating system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge made his ruling in April based on trial testimony
about the number of Windows programs _ testimony that was not
disputed by Microsoft. The judge concluded that the vast library of
Windows-based programs discouraged competitors and made the
possibility of competing against Microsoft impractical. At issue
are so-called application programs _ word processors, spreadsheets,
personal-finance software and the like _ that run on top of the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But an economist who has surveyed the personal computer software
market contends that the 70,000 figure is grossly overstated. There
are probably fewer than 10,000 Windows programs in use today and
most users probably have no more than a handful on their computers,
according to the economist, Richard B. McKenzie, a conservative
scholar at the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The lower figure indicates that Microsoft is not the impregnable
fortress depicted in the antitrust trial, McKenzie writes in a
paper that presents the results of his survey.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is to be published this week by the Cato Institute, a
libertarian research group based in Washington. McKenzie also
recently published ``Trust on Trial: How the Microsoft Case Is
Reframing the Rules of Competition,'' a book that attacks the
Justice Department's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In his paper, McKenzie contends that Microsoft may have
contributed to the misconception when it claimed in marketing and
advertising materials in 1997 that as many as 100,000 programs
existed for the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that their marketing behavior has come back to bite
them,'' McKenzie said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had embarked on his research after failing to find
any documentation to support a contention made during the trial by
John Rose, a Compaq Computer executive and Microsoft witness, that
the 70,000 applications were the reason that Compaq shipped Windows
with its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' by the claim, McKenzie recalled. After
failing to find documentation for the claim and conducting a
survey, he said he asked the company why it had not challenged the
figure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft executives told him that they did not wish to
undermine the credibility of their witness. ``They were between a
rock and a hard place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000 figure might actually represent the number of
applications that have been written during the entire history of
the personal computer industry, he said. Or it may be an
exaggeration based on the fact that many software programs go
through multiple versions during their life spans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon lists only 8,301 `software programs' under its
productivity software categories,'' McKenzie writes in his paper,
titled ``Microsoft's Applications Barrier to Entry: The Missing
70,000 Programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a large number,'' the paper continues, ``but it counts
programs written for all available operating systems, including Red
Hat Linux, IBM OS/2, and Apple Mac, as well as Microsoft Windows.
Many of the software programs are also listed several times in the
various subcategories.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman said that despite McKenzie's analysis, the
company believed that the larger number cited by the Compaq witness
and by the judge were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie draws a different lesson. Because there are actually
only a few crucial programs used by most PC users _ like Microsoft
Office _ the company's applications business, he said, should be
vulnerable to a program like StarOffice, which is being distributed
free by Sun Microsystems. &QL;

LAZIO, FUND RAISING IN CHAPPAQUA, TAKES RACE TO RIVAL'S NEW HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio took his U.S. Senate campaign
almost literally to Hillary Rodham Clinton's back yard Sunday,
appearing at a fund-raiser at a private home four miles from
Clinton's new house.
</P>
<P>
   And, as is typical in this contentious race, he had some
unneighborly words for his opponent, who moved here just seven
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at New York as being Mrs. Clinton's
neighborhood,'' Lazio said when asked how it felt to stand just
four miles from the house President and Mrs. Clinton bought here in
December to establish residency for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he dashed off to begin the fund-raiser, he added with a
grin, ``It's great to be here in Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lazio's first trip here, but aides would not rule out a
follow-up visit to the community, which voted for Bill Clinton in
the last two elections. Recent polls have shown Lazio doing well in
the New York City suburbs, a swing battleground fruitful in votes
and money. The fund-raiser here was one of four he attended in and
near Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was not in town during Lazio's two-hour visit,
which also included an unscheduled stop at a downtown pizzeria.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio certainly has a friend in the host of the fund-raiser,
Ed O'Keefe, a retired corporate lawyer and chairman of the New
Castle Republican Committee. (Chappaqua is a village in the town of
New Castle; those who pay taxes to its school district, like
O'Keefe and the Clintons, consider themselves residents of the
village.)
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said he did not schedule the fund-raiser here to
deliberately tweak the first lady. O'Keefe said he offered to hold
it as a loyal Republican ``because I thought it was time for Rick
to come up here to Chappaqua to say hello to the folks.'' O'Keefe
estimated that 130 people, paying on average $300 each, would
attend. (As usual, campaign officials declined to give the actual
attendance or total raised.)
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Lazio campaign relished the idea of
Lazio's stomping on Mrs. Clinton's turf; his fund-raisers are
usually closed to the news media. But this time, after word spread
that Lazio would be in Chappaqua, his campaign office called a
brief news conference on O'Keefe's lawn before the event.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, for his part, said he would talk up his plan to cut taxes
by $776 billion over 10 years, an issue that has dominated the
campaign since Lazio unveiled it Thursday in his first major policy
address.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio defended the plan again Sunday, attacking his opponent for
asserting that his numbers understate the effect on the economy.
Clinton says Lazio's plan would actually cost $1.24 trillion, an
amount she said would threaten the surplus, drive up interest rates
and destroy the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in fantasyland,'' Lazio told reporters. ``They have
no plan. All they can do is attack and pull down and rip apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does have a tax-fighting plan, though more modest than
Lazio's. Hers amounts to about $496 billion in cuts over 10 years,
a less risky course, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first plan is a big tax scheme that just doesn't add up,''
Clinton told supporters at a rally in Kingston Sunday, citing
reports Sunday in Newsday and the New York Daily News asserting
that some of Lazio's figures are wrong. She also accused the
congressman of trying to be ``Bush Lite'' with his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Lazio's visit and his remark about New
York's not being Clinton's neighborhood, her spokesman, Howard
Wolfson, replied, ``Congressman Lazio can't defend his phony tax
plan, so he has to resort to personal insults.''

AFTER CARRIAGE RIDE, A SCARY TIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four tourists were slightly hurt Sunday when a
horse-drawn carriage tipped onto its side in Central Park, tossing
the tourists, a vacationing British family, onto the asphalt, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 11:15 a.m. just inside the park near
its entrance at Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage driver, Naim Aydin, said he had just completed a
circuit of the park with the family aboard and had stopped at a
trough to water the horse, a 13-year-old black Persian. As he led
the animal through a left turn, the old green carriage tilted past
its balance point and suddenly slammed onto its side, dumping out
Colin Howe, 55, his wife, Pauline, 54, and Charlotte and Michael,
their two children, who are 13 and 10. The police did not know
where the Howes lived in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just fell over,'' Aydin said. ``I am unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the accident created an alarming scene _ the Howes were
strapped to immobilizing back boards and then taken away in
ambulances _ the authorities said the accident was not serious. The
Howes were treated at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center and
released. A hospital administrator said they had minor cuts in
bruises and planned to resume their vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Aydin nor the horse, which he said was brought to the
city from upstate two days before, were injured. The horse
apparently did not tip with the carriage.
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent damage to the carriage was a dent on the left
fender. The horse was led by hand back to its stable on West 52nd
Street and 12th Avenue, leaving Aydin and a friend to grunt and
sweat as they pushed the carriage 13 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Two men familiar with the carriage said it was a model, made 50
to 100 years ago in Canada, that is known to be easily tipped.
Aydin said he did not own the carriage and declined to give the
owner's name.

LARGEST STATE BOND ACT STILL MISSING DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It just may be the quietest $3.8 billion in New York political
history. In November, voters will be asked to decide the largest
bond act in state history, to pay for transportation projects. But
so far, there has been barely any campaign for it, and none against
it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as unsettling for people inclined to support the measure is
that it is more than two months after the deadline set by Gov.
George Pataki and legislative leaders for producing an agreement on
how the money would be spent. The lack of such an agreement makes
it hard for anyone to know what it is they may be campaigning for
or against.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could bode ill for a borrowing measure that has been
billed as a necessary step for building the first stages of a
Second Avenue subway line and other projects in the ambitious
capital building program for the New York mass transit network. New
York voters have turned down bond acts more often than they have
approved them, and the ones that have passed, like the 1996
environmental bond act championed by the governor, have been
supported by broad-based coalitions that raised large amounts of
money for television advertising _ exactly the kind of thing that
has been nowhere in sight this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get bond issues passed, you really have to do a job in
terms of selling it to the public,'' State Comptroller Carl McCall
said. ``This is reducing the amount of time you can go out and
educate the public about what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall described himself as being inclined to support the
measure, and said he was asked daily ``by reporters, the financial
community, by union leaders, environmentalists'' what he thought of
it. But he added that he ``can't render an opinion until I see the
specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   A major sponsor of the measure, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
said he was not concerned about the late start. In fact, Silver,
who heads the state's most potent Democratic machinery, said he had
no plans to organize a campaign for it or to raise money for such a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in the last two months, the local officials, the
contractors, the unions, who are all interested in making it
happen, will get the message out,'' he said. ``I would expect to
see an across-the-board campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond act is a crucial piece of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority's $17.1 billion, five-year capital plan
for upgrading the region's rail and bus system, including the first
work in a generation on a Second Avenue line, and the start of work
on a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central
Terminal. Of the $3.8 billion the state would borrow under the bond
act, $1.6 billion would go to the authority and the rest would go
to other transit agencies across the state and to pay for highways
and bridges.

ALLEN WOODY, 44, BASS PLAYER WITH ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas Allen Woody, a former bass guitarist for the Allman
Brothers Band and a spinoff group, Gov't Mule, died on Saturday at
the Marriott Courtyard motel in Queens. He was 44.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was unknown, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for
the New York City medical examiner's office. An autopsy performed
Sunday was inconclusive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Woody, as he was known, was born in Nashville, Tenn.,
where his father, a truck driver, weaned him on the blues, country
and rock oldies. Inspired by watching Paul McCartney play with the
Beatles, he began learning the bass guitar at age 14. Not long
afterward he first heard the Allman Brothers Band on the radio and
became interested in exploratory Southern rock.
</P>
<P>
   Woody majored in music at Middle Tennessee State University and
sold instruments at Gruhn Guitars in Nashville, where he met many
of the city's top musicians. In the mid-'80s, he joined the Artimus
Pyle Band, led by the former drummer for Lynyrd Skynyrd. Pyle
introduced Woody to Butch Trucks of the Allman Brothers Band, who
suggested that Woody audition as bass guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Woody joined the Allman Brothers Band when the group re-formed
after a seven-year hiatus in 1989. The band had lost three members
to early deaths, two of them bass guitarists and the other its
co-founder, Duane Allman, who was killed in a 1971 motorcycle
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The revised lineup, with Woody on bass and another newcomer,
Warren Haynes, on guitar, helped bring the band new commercial and
critical success. In 1994, while still touring with the Allmans,
Woody and Haynes formed a side trio with a drummer, Matt Abts,
called Gov't Mule. They recorded for Capricorn, a label that had a
long-standing feud with the Allman Brothers over record royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Woody and Haynes left the Allman Brothers to
devote themselves to their trio. Gov't Mule added a harder edge to
its jams and explored a wide terrain that included free jazz and
the alternative rock of Radiohead.
</P>
<P>
   An avid biker with tattoos and a handlebar mustache, Woody was
distinguished by his ability to move from slow, blues-drenched
playing to fast, pronounced runs. He was also known for playing
customized instruments, like a double-necked combination of a
guitar and a mandolin.
</P>
<P>
   Gov't Mule recorded five albums for Capricorn and was set to
begin a tour on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Woody is survived by his wife, Jenny, and a daughter, Savannah,
both of Nashville. &QL;

ON PRO BASKETBALL: KNICKS NEED TO PUT SUMMER OF ADVERSITY BEHIND
THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When this summer to forget began, the Knicks had four
items on their to-do list, and trading Patrick Ewing was not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to acquire Grant Hill _ a long shot, they knew, but
one they hoped a videotaped presentation featuring some of their
celebrity fans and the many opportunities that New York City
presented Hill's songstress wife, Tamia, might actually make
happen.
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to obtain a rugged power forward who would
catapult them from the bottom of the league's offensive rebounding
ranking, and improve themselves at point guard by acquiring a
penetrating playmaker who would end the every-basket-is-a-war
nature of their halfcourt set. Beyond that, in what would have been
a bonus, the Knicks hoped to get a small forward with touch from
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   But an off-season that began with cheery optimism and grand
aspirations has degenerated into one of the franchise's most
fruitless and embarrassing summers in recent memory. Not only have
the Knicks failed to reach even one of their goals, but their
well-publicized string of near misses has left them facing a
potential disaster, one that nothing less than complete and
selfless professionalism on the part of their players can avert. In
a profession where egotism abounds, and to a degree is beneficial,
the Knicks must grudgingly check theirs at the doors of the College
of Charleston at the start of training camp in October.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's sloppy handling of the Ewing saga _ in which the
great center was essentially traded, castigated by the public and
the news media and then untraded _ has left the Knicks in the
awkward position of having to coexist with an angry and humiliated
star who is growing old ungracefully. But there are also the
potentially bruised egos of some of Ewing's teammates. Who knows
how feeling unappreciated and perhaps unwanted could affect the
games of Marcus Camby, Chris Childs, Larry Johnson and Allan
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   Camby, a rising star a year ago, watched in silent aggravation
as the Knicks all but drooled over Brian Grant and then battled the
Golden State Warriors for Danny Fortson, both of whom threatened to
slice his already limited minutes. As for Childs and Johnson, they
must know that the Knicks have shopped them and their burdensome
contracts all over the place, only to find no takers. And while
Houston knows he is valued by the club he is also smart enough to
realize that the Knicks' fascination with Glen Rice most likely
meant they had intentions of dealing him for a power player up
front.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for debilitating discontent in the locker room is
so strong that before figuring out a way to squeeze more offensive
rebounding out of the same old crew, Jeff Van Gundy must take into
account that five of his top players _ including three starters _
know that if the Knicks had their druthers, they would be
elsewhere. A coach whose team always seems to be embroiled in
turmoil could be facing his toughest challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really going to test their professionalism and Van
Gundy's professionalism,'' said one Eastern Conference coach, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Van Gundy is good at turning a
negative into a positive and that's what he'll have to do in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is that while General Manager Scott
Layden's every plan was being foiled, the Miami Heat, the Knicks'
fiercest rival, was emerging as one of the champions of the
off-season. While Layden found himself shackled by the Knicks'
surplus of high salary-low production players, Riley found ways to
pull off two complicated trades that landed Eddie Jones, Anthony
Mason and the coveted Grant.
</P>
<P>
   But while on the surface there appears to be little reason to
feel good about the Knicks, Layden's statement to the news media on
Thursday that ``we feel good about our chances'' was not totally
baseless. Hope can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ewing is upset about remaining in New York and probably
hurt by the mean-spirited boot out of town he was about to receive,
he is, even so, one of the hardest working and most professional
players in the league. He has performed admirably in light of
public scorn and perceived slights by the organization before and
will probably do so again. And even if Ewing's bitterness is too
deep, his desire to earn big money for two more years after this
season will force him to put forth his best effort on the court.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not stay healthy for most of the season, play well
and show that he can handle being a supporting offensive player
rather than the focal point, he can forget about any team giving
him a lucrative contract. So a mad but motivated Ewing could play
even better than he did last season, when he gave the Knicks a
solid 15.1 points and 9.7 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks to recapture the magic of two seasons ago, it is
imperative that Ewing and his humbled teammates behave as
professionals, shaking off the off-season affronts and just playing
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Camby, as he was in the 1999 playoffs, could be the X-factor,
but only if he thickens his skin and ignores the Knicks' pursuit of
front-line reinforcements, or in Grant's case replacements, and
stays healthy. Before his plague of injuries began in late
November, Camby averaged 15 points and 10.3 rebounds through the
first six games while starting at center for the injured Ewing. But
when he returned from the injuries, he did so without his
explosiveness, and the Knicks were much the worse for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that an injury free Camby, who is expected to be
100 percent for training camp, can re-energize the Knicks,
particularly on the offensive glass. If that happens, it will be as
if the Knicks did add a new player this summer, and that would go a
long way in eliminating the distress of this off-season of
disappointment and adversity.

PARENTS DEAD, FORMER DOCTOR IS NOW SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., V.I.)   By ELISSA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As far as neighbors could tell, Dr. I. Kathleen Hagen was not
just an accomplished Harvard-educated doctor but a devoted daughter
who left her home in the Virgin Islands and returned to care for
her ailing parents in their modest home in Chatham Township, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Hagen, 54, was living on the island of St. Thomas, the
couple's neighbors said, she visited her parents frequently,
working in the garden with her father and, when Tropical Storm
Floyd hit, helping pump water out of the sloping driveway next to
her parents' home _ a three-bedroom 1950s ranch home surrounded by
more stately houses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, neighbors, the police and prosecutors are struggling to
piece together the chain of events that led to Hagen's being
charged this weekend with the murder of her parents, Idella F.
Hagen, 92, and James Hagen, 86.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45 a.m. Saturday, Hagen telephoned the police to say that
her parents were dead, said Capt. Christopher D. Linne, a spokesman
for the Morris County prosecutor's office. Linne said ``there were
additional conversations'' between Hagen and the police, but he
would not say whether she had confessed.
</P>
<P>
   When the police arrived at the Hagen home, at 614 Fairmont Ave.,
they found the elder Hagens in their nightclothes in twin beds in
the master bedroom, Linne said. The Morris County medical examiner
determined that they had been asphyxiated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had been dead for three to seven days when their
bodies were discovered, officials at the prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen's bail has been set at $2.5 million, and she is scheduled
to appear before a Morris County Superior Court judge either Monday
or Tuesday, said the Morris County prosecutor, John B. Dangler.
Even though Hagen has ``a sizable amount of personal wealth,''
Dangler said, she has not moved to post her own bail and she
remains in the Morris County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they had not determined a motive for the
killing. , But for Hagen, the arrest is the latest twist in an
unconventional life in which she left an apparently successful
career in urology to manage a small island inn.
</P>
<P>
   Records indicate that Idella Kathleen Hagen graduated from
Harvard Medical School in 1973. She was an intern and a surgery
resident at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston until 1975,
when she became the first female urology resident there. By 1979,
Hagen was a fellow at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Daily Record of Morris County, Hagen was
appointed chief of the urology division at Rutgers Medical School
in 1982 and was chief urologist at Rutgers' main teaching hospital,
Middlesex General in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   While officials said that Hagen's medical license was valid
until next year, she seemed to have dropped her medical career in
the late 1980s, when she moved to the island of St. Thomas with her
husband at the time, William Tyrrell of Stuart, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrrell did not return several telephone calls to his home
Sunday. The prosecutor's office said that Hagen had been married
and divorced twice.
</P>
<P>
   From about 1987 until 1992, Hagen and Tyrrell lived on St.
Thomas, where they operated the West Indies Inn, said their
landlord, Richard Doumeng, the general manager of the Bolongo Bay
Beach Club. They left that business after a series of storms
ravaged the building and hurt tourism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had put so much of their blood, sweat and tears into the
place, and then it got severely damaged,'' Doumeng said. ``They
just didn't have the energy to do it again.'' Doumeng said the inn
was Tyrrell's dream more than his wife's. ``Their time here took a
toll on them as a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagen had been living with her parents since last month, the
authorities said. ``She was in between careers and was torn between
staying with her parents and going back down to the Virgin
Islands,'' said Scott Tucker, 48, a neighbor.

<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In prerevolutionary Tehran, when the pop
singer Googoosh got a new haircut, her fans rushed out to get one,
too. When she wore a particular style of dress, they'd adopt it as
well. And this weekend, as she stood before many of those fans for
the first time in two decades and broke down in tears, thousands of
ecstatic Iranian emigres cried, too.

1979, when Islamic clerics silenced her career, her fears must now
be allayed. About 10,000 fans, some old enough to remember her days
as a child star, others too young even to remember Iran, converged
at the Nassau Coliseum to pay homage to an icon whose life story
represents the hopes and disappointments of so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for her for 20 years,'' said Aldo Zadeh, 40, as
he stood in the balcony. ``When I was a kid, her poster was in my
room, on my ceiling, on my walls.''
</P>
<P>
   As Googoosh performed, spotlights illuminated a sea of raised
arms, swaying and clapping.
</P>
<P>
   They were drawn from the estimated 500,000 to one million
Iranians in the United States, including about 45,000 in the New
York region, many of whom fled their country after the shah of Iran
was deposed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Googoosh,'' a voice cried out in English. The star
paused, overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're teasing me,'' she accused the crowd in Farsi. Laughing
wryly at herself, she wiped away tears with one hand, clearly taken
aback by her own emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Googoosh, whose given name is Faegheh Atashnin, rose to
superstar status in the 1970s. Her charisma, beauty, and
independence appealed to westernized middle- and upper-middle-class
Iranians. As Americans did with Elvis and Madonna, they watched her
personal life, including several marriages, as closely as they
watched her film and stage career.
</P>
<P>
   When the new regime banned pop music and female vocal
performances, many singers fled to Los Angeles, where a
mini-industry of Iranian exiles sprang up. But Googoosh retired
into private life.
</P>
<P>
   For a new generation of fans, her music became a symbol of
resistance to stringent social codes as well as a touchstone for
their parents' prerevolutionary nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   For Parisa Samii, 26, raised in the United States, the Iran she
knew from television had been one of dour clerics and of women
wearing tent-like chadors covering their entire bodies _ until this
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm getting a glimpse of what the Iran my parents
tried to describe to me was like,'' she said. ``The society was so
much more open. I've never seen it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Yeganeh Samii, had attended concerts in Iran and
collected all of Googoosh's albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to explain,'' Yeganeh Samii said. ``I feel
I'm in shock, I feel very emotional. She shows her emotions, too,
and that connects us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Audience members ranged from toddlers to old women with canes. A
few women wore head scarves, testimony to Googoosh's appeal even
among less westernized Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance on Long Island was the fourth stop on a North
American tour that marks the first time Googoosh has performed in
public since the Iranian revolution. And the tour sparked
speculation amongthe Iranians about whether she would return to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Masoud Jamali, Googoosh's promoter at Caspian Entertainment
Group, Los Angeles, said: ``We don't know yet if she's going to go
back or stay here. She has more concerts planned for the United
States, Europe, Australia and some Arab countries and plans to keep
touring at least until summer 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Some among the Iranians here wonder if the fact that Googoosh
was allowed to leave Iran and perform abroad is a sign that the
hard-line clerics who control the government are softening. Maboud
Ansari, a sociologist at William Patterson University in Wayne,
N.J., said, ``There is a perception among Iranians that this is
another sign of change.''
</P>
<P>
   At the concert's end, the audience got another reminder of
prerevolutionary Iran when they spotted Farahnaz Pahlavi,
37-year-old daughter of the deposed shah. People quickly swarmed
Pahlavi, seeking her autograph, or perhaps just to touch her.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the evening held a special meaning for her, Pahlavi
shook her head. ``For all of us it means the same,'' she said. ``It
brings back our home to us.''

IRANIAN POP STAR REVIVES MEMORIES OF LOST YOUTH AND LOST COUNTRY

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In prerevolutionary Tehran, when the pop
singer Googoosh got a new haircut, her fans rushed out to get one,
too. When she wore a particular style of dress, they'd adopt it as
well. And this weekend, as she stood before many of those fans for
the first time in two decades and broke down in tears, thousands of
ecstatic Iranian emigres cried, too.
</P>

WOODS BEATS NIGHTFALL TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Calif.)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Tiger Woods won the race against nightfall,
winning $1 million in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the last few holes in near darkness, Woods cruised to an
11-stroke victory Sunday in the NEC Invitational and set a
tournament scoring record that added to his remarkable year. Woods
was 21-under par for the tournament (259, 64-61-67-67), breaking
the previous record (262) set by Jose Maria Olazabal in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard, who shot a 4-under 66, and Phillip Price of
Wales, who shot 68, tied for second place at 10-under, sharing the
second-place check worth $437,000, in this 37-player World Golf
Championships event with a $5 million purse.
</P>
<P>
   It was Woods' second consecutive victory, his fifth in his last
seven starts, and his eighth in 16 starts on the PGA Tour this
year. How can a professional golfer complete August winning 50
percent of the tour events he has played? How could Woods not only
avoid a letdown after winning the PGA Championship, but also
dominate a world-class field a week later?
</P>
<P>
   What Woods has done this year almost defies belief, yet he
continues to take his game to new levels while leaving the
competition further behind. Sunday, after a nearly three-hour delay
because of bad weather that threatened to extend the tournament
until Monday, Woods finished his round, and ended the tournament
with another magic moment. At the par-4 No. 18, Woods hit a
spectacular 8-iron approach shot from 169 yards that landed 2 feet
from the pin. It was almost impossible to see the pin from where
Woods was standing in the fairway, yet he hit a near-perfect shot
that set up an easy birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of how I played growing up, playing a few holes
trying to beat the dark,'' Woods said. ``Because of the lead I had,
everyone wanted to finish. I guarantee if it had been tied, we
wouldn't have finished.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods walked to the 18th green at Firestone Country Club, it
was a surreal scene, with the gallery applauding in the dark,
photographers' lights providing a strobe effect, and people holding
cigarette lighters aloft as if they were attending an outdoor
concert. But when it comes to professional golf, everyone sees the
light: Woods is the world's best player, by a margin that seems to
be growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a better player than I was last year,'' said Woods, who
also won eight times last year, but who won this year's last three
majors _ the U.S. Open, the British Open and the PGA. ``I'm going
to try and keep getting better.'' For the opposition, that must be
a disturbing thought.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, this tournament was decided Saturday, when Woods
built a nine-stroke lead and left his pursuers to battle for second
place. That battle became Sunday's day's subplot, especially for
Price, who probably secured his PGA Tour card for next year by
winning $437,000, although a bogey on No. 18 cost him $63,500.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will fly to California for Monday night's exhibition
against Sergio Garcia, a made-for-television event that will be
shown live on ABC. Woods would have still made it to California if
play had been suspended Sunday, but finishing Sunday night, instead
of playing a few holes Sunday, will make the cross-country trip a
lot less rushed.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, who was paired in the final group with Woods, tried
to put early heat on the world's No. 1 player, but it did not last.
Sutton birdied three of the first five holes, and when Woods
bogeyed No. 6, his lead was over Sutton down to five strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum changed, however, with a two-shot swing at No. 8,
when Woods birdied and Sutton bogeyed. Woods never led by fewer
than six strokes thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   And by making his birdie at No. 18, Woods satisfied his caddie,
Steve Williams, by finishing 21 under par. Twenty-one is Williams'
favorite number.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the last hole, I asked for a new glove, and
Steve handed me a glove that he wrote No. 21 on,'' Woods said.
``When my shot landed on the green, I've never seen him that
excited. I've won major championships before and I've never seen
him have that kind of reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Woods, it has been some kind of year. He has already set
a tour record with more than $7.69 million this year, and he has a
realistic chance to become the first player to win $10 million in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   But after Monday, Woods plans to take time off. He has battled
the flu for a few days, and after what he has accomplished this
year, he could use a rest. However, his opponents could use a break
as well.

VARGAS TURNS HIS FOCUS TO MATCHUP WITH TRINIDAD
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL ARKUSH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ An angry Fernando Vargas dispensed with his
challenger Ross Thompson on Saturday night. An ambitious Vargas
then turned his attention to another night _ in December, when he
hopes to dethrone the highly regarded Felix Trinidad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Vargas, the undefeated IBFjunior middleweight
champion, was angered by the way Thompson had behaved at a news
conference on Thursday. Thompson punched Vargas and his promoter,
Gary Shaw, who had gotten in the way, and called Vargas ``a bogus
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The display certainly generated more interest in the fight _
and, not surprisingly, more interest from Vargas. Before that, the
bout was seen by many as nothing more than a tuneup for the
Trinidad duel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Vargas responded with a left hook
that knocked Thompson off the dais. During the fight, before 5,327
fans at the Mandalay Bay Events Center, the 153-pound Vargas came
back with a lot more. He sent Thompson to the canvas twice in the
third round and once in the fourth before Referee Joe Cortez
stopped it at 1 minute 7 seconds of that round. The 27-year-old
Thompson, a heavy underdog from Buffalo, could provide no defense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross Thompson had never been knocked out, never been down,''
said Vargas, of Oxnard, Calif., who earned $1 million and improved
his record to 20-0 with 18 knockouts. ``I had to show him what type
of fighter I was.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He will try to prove that same point to Trinidad, who is the WBA
super welterweight champion and is considered one of the world's
best fighters. Trinidad, who is also undefeated, has victories
against Oscar De La Hoya and David Reid on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been finalized, but it seems quite likely that the
bout will be Dec. 2 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the hands of the attorneys,'' Shaw, Vargas' promoter,
said. ``They're crossing the t's and dotting the i's.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vargas predicted it would be a special evening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm moving on to bigger and better things,'' he said. ``I'm
going to be Felix Trinidad's worst enemy. I guarantee that it will
be the biggest non-heavyweight fight in ratings. I guarantee that
it will surpass De La Hoya's ratings. Mark my words.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw added: ``He's not only going to win that fight. He is
knocking Felix Trinidad out. He knows how to finish a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   After Vargas had finished off Thompson, who is 24-4-1 and earned
$300,000, the two held another news conference. This one was much
more peaceful, featuring praises instead of punches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a true champion,'' said Thompson, who was fined
$10,000 by the Nevada Athletic Commission for his behavior at the
earlier news conference. ``You are going to go on to be one of the
top fighters in the world.'' &QL;

IRAN'S SILENCED STAR, BRIDGING A 21-YEAR GAP
</HEADLINE>
 (With NY-IRANIAN-DIVA) 
By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Googoosh kept having to wipe tears from her eyes when she
performed on Saturday night at the Nassau Coliseum. So did many of
her fans. Googoosh, who was Iran's queen of pop in the 1970s, was
performing again after 21 years of public silence and seclusion,
the 21 years since Iran's Islamic revolutionary government came to
power and banned nearly all music.
</P>
<P>
   In prerevolutionary Iran, Googoosh was Iran's Barbra Streisand,
Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Edith Piaf and Madonna rolled into one: not
just a magnificent singer but a fashion trailblazer and a symbol of
modernity. Her songs were romantic, not political, and while they
drew on Western styles, they held onto both the fervor of Persian
love poetry and the sliding, quivering, impassioned phrasing of
traditional Persian music.
</P>
<P>
   Although Googoosh stopped singing and performing, her old songs
stayed popular both among Iranian expatriates and, sold illegally,
within Iran. Like the Buena Vista Social Club from Cuba, she now
carries forward music from a prerevolutionary era that has taken on
new connotations.
</P>
<P>
   Her songs about eternal love and the pain of separation have,
two decades later, become not just vows of devotion but invocations
of nostalgia, longing and, for Iranians in North America, the pain
of exile. They also hint at a cultural path Iran rejected, one that
it may resume under its current reformist government: not trying to
seal itself off from Western pop culture, but using Western
elements to create something distinctly Persian.
</P>
<P>
   This year Googoosh, who is now 50, was given permission to tour
abroad, where she will also make movies directed by her husband,
Massoud Kimiai. (In Iran women are still not allowed to sing as
soloists for audiences that include men.) Onstage Googoosh had all
the trappings of a Western pop diva: giant video screens,
scaffolding full of lights and an eight-violin string section along
with her pop-rock band. But she was decidedly modest, wearing long
dresses and gesturing almost entirely with graceful arms and hands,
restraining herself from motion below the shoulders. For her encore
she came back barefoot. It was an uptempo song, and she was shaking
with, apparently, the suppressed urge to dance, until she allowed
herself a final kick.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice is intact: lustrous, supple, full of heartache and
tender determination. Songs rose to imperious declarations, then
turned gentle in the course of a sustained note. Where many Western
divas work their way through songs until they get a chance to let
loose and belt, Googoosh treats the peaks of her songs like a
Persian singer, letting notes slide and cascade as if her melodies
were melting in the heat of her emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Every old song brought shouts and ululations of recognition, and
many audience members sang every word. In lyrics suffused with
imagery from nature, Googoosh sang about love so luxuriant it could
make the desert bloom, so joyful it could fill the air with bird
songs. There were bouncy tunes that harked back to 1960s bubble-gum
and spy-movie themes. There were uptempo songs that seemed to be
rooted in old Persian dance rhythms, and others with a touch of
disco. There were cabaret-style ballads with Romantic piano
flourishes. And there were slow songs, accompanied only by a piano
or a guitar, that Googoosh sang with elaborate Middle Eastern
ornamentation and a melancholy dignity.
</P>
<P>
   She has just released a new album, ``Zoroaster'' (Kia
Entertainment), that updates her music; she performed one new song
on Saturday that used flamenco guitar along the lines of the Gipsy
Kings. A few of her new songs also hinted at messages that were not
only personal.
</P>
<P>
   One, which can be translated from the Farsi as ``The Captive
Soil'' or ``The Captive Land,'' was about having her heart torn
into tiny pieces; at the end in a spoken coda she said, ``I have a
million sisters like 50 suns shining, and a million brothers, who
are green and red around me.'' The Iranian flag is red, green and
white. She continued, ``Imprisonment was cold/I have patience that
is old/I have love that is warm.'' And in ``Zoroaster,'' the
album's title song, she sang about crying for the children of war,
and promised, ``I will lend my voice to history.''
</P>
<P>
   What such declarations mean in Iran, to which Googoosh has said
she will return, is impossible to determine from abroad. For fans
who never expected to see her perform again, her reappearance was
cause enough for gratitude.

TORRE SAYS HE PLANS ON MANAGING NEXT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Joe Torre intends to return as the New York
Yankees' manager next year, the last season of his current
contract, and he said Sunday he hadn't ruled out the possibility of
managing in 2002 or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming I'm coming back,'' he said. ``And being under
contract, in my mind, I'm going to manage next year, because that's
what I'm under contract to do.''

   Torre could have left the Yankees last year, when he was treated
for prostate cancer, but he came back for this season. ``I'm
probably more interested in coming back this year than I was last
year,'' he said, referring to his plans for the upcoming season,
``only because healthwise I'd come through a lot emotionally, and I
had to think about it a little bit. But this year it's like, `This
is my job and that's what I'm going to do until I decide not to
work.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun,'' Torre said. ``You work your whole life to
get to that point, you work to make that choice, and it's your
choice. I'm fortunate at this point in time, that when it stops
being fun, I'd think I'd be content enough to move on. But right
now, I'm enjoying it. I still enjoy winning. I still have the fire
in my belly, and that's the important thing. Plus my wife is
wonderful: She wants me to retire right now, but not if this is
something I want to do. She's been saying that for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he hadn't thought about whether to manage in 2002.
``But I'll tell you one thing, I haven't dismissed it either,'' he
said while sitting in the visitors' dugout of the Network
Associates Coliseum. ``Once you make that decision, that's probably
it. It's not like I would leave the game for five years and come
back at 65.''
</P>
<P>
   A columnist speculated in Newsday on Sunday morning that Torre
had become fed up with the management style of George Steinbrenner,
the Yankees' principal owner. ``I don't think I've ever said that
to anybody,'' Torre said. ``I don't feel any different than I did a
year ago, or even two years ago, for that matter. Five years ago,
over the last couple of years, I've gotten into a comfort zone of
knowing what it's like here. I don't think that has changed since
I've settled into that.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Steinbrenner released a statement that
subtly chastised Torre after he did not publicly embrace the
acquisition of the slugger Jose Canseco. At the time, Torre was
asked about this and responded simply that Steinbrenner was the
boss, effectively defusing a potentially explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Torre nor Steinbrenner has discussed that matter since,
and they have maintained communication. ``In fact, I was talking to
George yesterday morning,'' Torre said. ``We're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre did not seem as sure about whether Don Zimmer, his bench
coach for five seasons, would be back. Zimmer has been hobbled for
almost two years by knee trouble. ``I don't know,'' Torre said,
grimacing a bit. ``Every year it's the same thing. He's had a tough
year physically this year, the knee didn't respond.'' Torre said he
hoped Zimmer would return.
</P>
<P>
   Torre mentioned that when he retired, he would think about going
into broadcasting, something he did before resuming his managerial
career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He will also become eligible
to be selected by the Veterans Committee for baseball's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hall of Fame, if that ever happens, would be a wonderful
honor,'' he said. ``But after waiting as long as I did to get to
the World Series and then winning, God, it's going to have to go a
long way to make me feel as good as that did _ or does now, after
winning two more.''

   O'Neill Still in Pain
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, is out indefinitely
with a hip pointer that has not improved. O'Neill, who has not
played since last Tuesday, took batting practice Sunday, tried
running and then walked off the field disconsolately. He received a
shot of cortisone before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get out there,'' said O'Neill, who could play
Wednesday. ``The last few days, I didn't get to where I wanted to
be. Hopefully, this will knock it out and we'll get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre suggested before the game that if O'Neill's condition did
not improve, the outfielder might return to New York for rest and
treatment. ``I know he's getting frustrated with it,'' Torre said.
``He's a guy who's used to being able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, on the disabled list with weakness in the back
of his right shoulder, will throw off a mound this week as part of
his effort to rejoin the team by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are likely to add outfielder Ryan Thompson from
Triple-A Columbus when the major-league rosters expand on Sept. 1.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Penn State's first play Sunday
short-circuited with a false start and a 5-yard penalty. Moments
later, split end Eddie Drummond sustained a knee injury that put
him out of the game. Before long, the Nittany Lions' first
possession imploded with a blocked punt that created a Southern
California touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Three tedious hours later, Penn State's first game of the season
ended in a sloppy 29-5 victory for the Trojans in the Kickoff
Classic in Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams first met in the Rose Bowl of 1923. If they are
to meet there again this winter as winners of their conferences,
both will need to improve upon Sunday's ragged display of nerves
and errors.
</P>
<P>
   As the season opener for both sides, it was almost an exhibition
game in terms of impact. The leaves on most trees have not changed
color yet; conference games are still weeks away for USC and Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be a good team and maybe this will
accelerate it,'' said USC Coach Paul Hackett, whose team finished
6-6 in 1999. ``Defensively, wow! They could not run the football
against us. There was some question about USC football. We took a
step nationally. We were carrying the banner for the Pac 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, a member of the Big Ten, gained only 6 net yards
rushing, the lowest total in Joe Paterno's 35 years as head coach.
The Nittany Lions had 142 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the margin of victory, the Trojans' offense had little
to show for its ball control (USC ran 50 times) _ probably because
quarterback Carson Palmer was rusty in his return from a broken
collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scoring on the blocked punt, USC scored another
first-half touchdown on a 43-yard interception return by Troy
Polamalu, who picked off a pass from Rashard Casey, Penn State's
troubled quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also made a few mistakes. They gave up a safety on a
blocked punt and missed an extra point. Their best attacker was
Sultan McCullough, who ran 28 times for 128 yards. Much of that
yardage was gained on runs up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Voted the most valuable player of the game, McCullough said he
was ready to assume the starring role in the USC tailback
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm a track star, but my first love is football,''
McCullough said. ``I can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had run the 40-yard dash in 4.2 seconds and could
probably run it in 4.1. He said his coaches told him: ```It's your
turn to shine,' so that's what I did. It's my first game. It's my
big opener. It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so good was Casey, who returned to his home state and some
troubling memories. He was charged with assaulting an off-duty
police officer in nearby Hoboken, his hometown, last May. The case
is still pending as is a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Casey ``lacked some consistency,'' according to Paterno, in
completing 7 of 24 passes for 106 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of playing better than that, let's put it that
way,'' Paterno said. ``It was a tough outing for him, for a lot of
reasons. This was a tough preseason for him, for a lot of reasons.
He's got this one out of his craw. He can concentrate on having a
little more fun. It's not easy for him to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, replaced early in the fourth quarter by Matt Senneca,
said: ``I'm glad to have this one out of the way, but I'm not glad
the way it turned out. You take the good with the bad. Today, I
think I might have put too much pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his linemen, tackle Kareem McKenzie, said Penn State's
five penalties for false starts resulted from ``not being focused
on the plays called and the snap count itself; not being as focused
as we should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had our number all day long,'' McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat kept Paterno six victories short of Bear Bryant's
Division I-A record of 323.
</P>
<P>
   Including the end of last season, Penn State has lost four
consecutive regular-season games (although the Lions won the Alamo
Bowl last December).
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive victory for USC, which won its
final three games in 1999 after losing six of the previous seven
after a season-ending injury to Palmer. A sophomore, Palmer
completed 10 of 20 passes for 87 yards Sunday against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Petros Papadakis scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and David
Newbury kicked field goals of 47, 27 and 44 yards for Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's best chance to rally came in the third quarter,
when the Lions blocked a punt into the USC end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Had Penn State fallen on the ball for a touchdown, as the
Trojans had earlier, the score and an extra point could have cut
the lead to 23-10 and changed the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern Cal's Marcell Allmond recovered, the Lions got only
2 points and the crowd of 78,902 soon began to file out. &QL;

USC DISMANTLES PENN STATE IN KICKOFF CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It just figured that USC would celebrate
wildly for its fans gathered behind an end zone at Giants Stadium.
Nothing else the Trojans did Sunday was at half-speed, so why
should the party be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Even USC coach Paul Hackett was still clutching the Kickoff
Classic championship trophy 45 minutes after the Trojans routed
Penn State 29-5 in front of a record crowd of 78,902.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a normal day for a USC football team, at least not
in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy of the team was the one thing that we had out
there,'' Hackett said. ``The energy, and a lot of it came from
coaches, was different. And everyone on the team believed in it.
There was just a lot of energy everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued the Trojans were wired up like rarely before
in recent memory. USC's victory over the 22nd-ranked Nittany Lions
was the first over a ranked team on a road or neutral site since
the 1996 Rose Bowl. It was just the second time they have done it
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why everyone was so eager to explain what
it all meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a force to be reckoned with,'' offensive lineman Faasea
Mailo said. ``A lot of people thought we would get dominated the
way we dominated them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added linebacker Zeke Moreno: ``We know that everyone now knows
that we're no joke. I came here because of the football and
tradition and all of that is back. I think we got a lot of
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15th-ranked Trojans (1-0) dominated Penn State (0-1)
offensively and defensively in ways that were not totally expected:
</P>
<P>
   -- Tailback Sultan McCullough, the game's most valuable player,
gained a career high 128 yards in 29 carries. But instead of
breaking long runs, he became a power back.
</P>
<P>
   -- Kicker David Newbury, who was 11 for 20 last season, made all
three field goals, which Hackett called ``mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The offensive line, the Trojans' weak link, actually wore
down Penn State's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see their defense say, `Oh no, here they come
again,''' Mailo said.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it without a single false start, an almost
unheard-of occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   -- Then there was the defense, which USC thought was its
strength, and which did little to dispel that theory. They held
Penn State's star quarterback, Rashard Casey, to 106 yards passing,
including zero in the second half, and minus-20 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had nowhere to go,'' Moreno said. ``We had great
containment on him. We showed what we are capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   USC also won without its vaunted passing game. Quarterback
Carson Palmer, considered the Trojans' single most important
player, completed just 10 of 20 passes for 87 yards and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can have a nonexistent quarterback and still win, that
says a lot about us,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Want more bizarreness?
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions were held to six yards rushing, the lowest
total in any game Penn State legend Joe Paterno has coached in his
35 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time the Nittany Lions had not scored a
touchdown since 1998. And when USC strong safety Troy Polamalu
returned an interception 43 yards for a touchdown, it was the first
time that happened in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have it,'' Paterno said. ``They're very
aggressive. They were certainly a better team than we were today.''
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent from the outset. On the game's first
possession, USC safety Frank Strong broke through the line and
blocked David Royer's punt. The ball skipped off Kris Richard's
fingers and into the hands of Sandy Fletcher, who ran six yards for
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions cut the lead to 7-3 on a 37-yard field goal by
Ryan Primanti, but that hardly fazed the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC turned into a power-running team, with the line opening
holes for McCullough, who carried the ball five times for 42 yards
on the drive, and also caught a 6-yard pass. Palmer then hit
Marcell Allmond on a 22-yard pass before Petros Papadakis scored on
a 2-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   That gave USC a 14-3 lead, and began to place doubts in the
minds of the overwhelmingly pro-Penn State crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line was telling me, `Run behind me.' They were all
motivated to run the ball,'' McCullough said. ``We ran the ball
down their throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Already with an unexpected special-teams touchdown, the Trojans
got another one from their defense. Polamalu, in his first career
start at strong safety, snagged a terrible Casey pass and
zig-zagged 43 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reacting to what I saw,'' Polamalu said. ``I just saw
Casey but I had three blockers in front of me and I tried to use
them. It felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   If Paterno wasn't already feeling fate was against him, Newbury
stunned Hackett by hitting field goals of 47, 27 and 44 yards. His
only slip-up was a missed extra point, but it hardly mattered.
USC's defense never allowed another point after Primanti's field
goal, with Penn State managing only a safety after blocking Mike
MacGillivray's punt in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were real tired of hearing the myth that Pac-10
football was done and that we couldn't stop the run,'' defensive
tackle Ennis Davis said. ``Sultan is running the ball like he owns
it, he's running real hard, and the defense is playing tough. I
think we've got a nice team.'' &QL;

AFTER CARRIAGE RIDE, A SCARY TIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (DELEATES breed ``Persian'' from 3rd graf)  
 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four tourists were slightly hurt Sunday when a
horse-drawn carriage tipped onto its side in Central Park, tossing
the tourists, a vacationing British family, onto the asphalt, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 11:15 a.m. just inside the park near
its entrance at Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The carriage driver, Naim Aydin, said he had just completed a
circuit of the park with the family aboard and had stopped at a
trough to water the horse, a 13-year-old black. As he led the
animal through a left turn, the old green carriage tilted past its
balance point and suddenly slammed onto its side, dumping out Colin
Howe, 55, his wife, Pauline, 54, and Charlotte and Michael, their
two children, who are 13 and 10. The police did not know where the
Howes lived in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just fell over,'' Aydin said. ``I am unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the accident created an alarming scene _ the Howes were
strapped to immobilizing back boards and then taken away in
ambulances _ the authorities said the accident was not serious. The
Howes were treated at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center and
released. A hospital administrator said they had minor cuts in
bruises and planned to resume their vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Aydin nor the horse, which he said was brought to the
city from upstate two days before, were injured. The horse
apparently did not tip with the carriage.
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent damage to the carriage was a dent on the left
fender. The horse was led by hand back to its stable on West 52nd
Street and 12th Avenue, leaving Aydin and a friend to grunt and
sweat as they pushed the carriage 13 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Two men familiar with the carriage said it was a model, made 50

   (NYT1) SAN DIEGO, Calif. -- Aug. 27, 2000 -- OPEN-SOURCE -- In a
report to President Clinton last year, a group of leading computer
scientists warned that the nation faced a troubling ``software
gap.'' The group, made up of corporate executives and university
researchers, said that programmers simply could not keep pace with
exploding demand for high-quality software -- the computer code
needed for everything from Internet commerce to nuclear weapons
design. Larry Smarr, right, a presidential committee member, speaks

UNIVERSITY FINALLY FINISHED RECOVERING FROM NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time since the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake, Susan Curzon will stretch her legs and enjoy silence as
the new academic year begins at California State University,
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the whining saws now that the campus's $407 million
reconstruction project is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the office and classroom trailers spread over fields
and parking lots across campus for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't leave them fast enough,'' said Curzon, dean of the
university's Oviatt Library, which sports a $22 million face lift
featuring 100,000-square-foot east and west wings. The library, the
first campus building to reopen this year, will be dedicated in
September.
</P>
<P>
   By March, faculty and staff will move into the last of five
rebuilt university buildings, and the campus will be whole once
again.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, enrollment is expected to surge to a record 28,000
students this fall, while 70 new faculty members will start Monday
and more parking will be available thanks to the removal of
temporary classrooms. Also, CSUN will debut its first cybercafe _
complete with a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's new president, Jolene Koester, said she's looking forward
to the start of the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful time for me to be starting here because this
year sees the completion and restoration of all of our buildings,
which symbolize the university's renewed sense of mission and
purpose,'' Koester said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that library services have moved back, Curzon can take
pleasure in watching students spread their books and papers out in
one of the building's new study rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy seeing the library patrons making themselves
comfortable all over the library,'' Curzon said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, officials expect to start moving into the $5.7
million, 31,000-square-foot expansion of the Art and Design Center,
and after that the $14 million, 85,500 square-foot College of
Health and Human Development and University Technology Center.
</P>
<P>
   By semester's end on Dec. 21, Koester will move into new
quarters in the $13 million, 82,000-square-foot Administration
Building. The biggest of the rebuilding projects, the $17 million,
88,000-square-foot Arts, Media and Communication Building, is
slated to open in March.
</P>
<P>
   The school has also rebuilt its enrollment, which was at 27,300
when the earthquake hit, dropped and then rose back to 27,700 in
1997 and has risen slightly ever since. This year, registration is
running about 600 more students than last year at the same time, so
officials expect enrollment will easily pass a record 28,000 this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all of the fresh concrete, bricks and mortar,
there will be new blood added to the university, Koester said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 70 new full-time faculty members will start their first
semester at the university. Most of them will replace retiring
faculty, many of whom were hired in the 1960s when the campus was
young.
</P>
<P>
   Students will also come back to a new treat: A Krispy Kreme
outlet like no other in the nation. This purveyor of doughnuts and
coffee will feature six IMac desktop computers plugged into the
campus network and the Internet and 14 ports to provide network
access for patrons' laptops.
</P>
<P>
   And parking, a chronic problem since trailers took up so much
space after the earthquake, will be relieved slightly this year. A
village of temporary classrooms will be removed in September,
freeing up about 70 spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Washington, who was accompanying his 18-year-old
daughter, Paige, to an orientation last week, said he is impressed
with how quickly the campus has recovered from the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like things are really state-of-the-art now,'' said
Washington, who knows something about recovering from earthquakes.
He works for the city of Oakland, which he says is still working on
replacing buildings damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Marcos Morales, who works part time at the library,
has a more practical reason to enjoy the near-completion of the
campus' reconstruction project. Last year, Morales had to walk
several blocks to make copies of newspaper and magazine articles,
kept on microfilm and microfiche in a trailer far from the Oviatt
Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to take all day,'' Morales said. ``Now I just go
upstairs. It's like, really convenient; everything's right there.''

YANKEES DON'T GIVE IN TO PANIC, OR TO OAKLAND
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ They talked about situations like this in
their meeting Friday _ doing what it takes to win games in the late
innings. The New York Yankees trailed Oakland by two runs in the
eighth inning Sunday when center fielder Terrence Long lost a fly
ball in California's sun, and Derek Jeter said it was a
``no-doubter'' _ the Yankees were sure they were going to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   This is their time. Summer is surrendering to fall and on their
25-man roster, the Yankees' players have the cumulative experience
of 54 World Series. They know how to react under duress and
recover, as they did in a 7-5 victory over Oakland. ``The door is
open, and you explode right through it,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finally prevailed in their staredown with Boston:
The Yankees and Red Sox had matched victory for victory and loss
for loss over the last eight days, and the Yankees' advantage in
the American League East held at three games.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Yankees began their game here Sunday afternoon,
they could all see on the scoreboard in left field that the Red Sox
were deep into an 11-7 loss at Kansas City. The Yankees had an
opportunity to push their lead to four games.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle floundered through the first inning, again,
allowing a hit and a walk and then a three-run homer to Mike
Stanley, and Sal Fasano ripped another homer in the second to give
Oakland a 4-0 lead. The Yankees were in jeopardy of losing for the
second time in the three-game series. All the talk in Friday's
meeting would seem like nothing more than talk if they couldn't
come back.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle (4-4) limited the Athletics to one run over the next five
innings; the Yankees scored a run in the third and two in the
fourth. Jim Mecir relieved Gil Heredia in the seventh, assuming a
5-3 edge, and the pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill battled him through a
10-pitch at-bat before striking out. Jeter whiffed on five pitches,
and although the Yankees hadn't scored, they had pushed Mecir _
accustomed to throwing about 20 pitches per outing _ to expend 15
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees prepared to bat in the eighth, Roger Clemens
chatted with Jose Canseco, discussing what Mecir might try to
throw; as Canseco walked to the on-deck circle, Clemens drew two
hands together in a clap and encouraged Canseco. Bernie Williams,
limited to batting right-handed because of a strained rib cage,
waited on the bench, in case he was needed as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice walked to lead off, and Canseco turned on an
inside fastball and smashed a single to left; first and second,
nobody out. Jose Vizcaino ran for Canseco. The Athletics' fans here
murmured.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez lifted a high fly to center field, harmless except
that as Long stared into the sky through his sunglasses _ without
using his glove as a shield _ the sun was eclipsing the ball. At
the last second, the rookie reached unsteadily, lowering his glove
to his waist to attempt a basket catch.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit his glove, fell, and Justice and Vizcaino scrambled
to reach third and second, respectively. Bases loaded, nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Mecir struck out Jorge Posada, and Luis Sojo fell behind, no
balls and two strikes. ``All I wanted to do in that situation,''
Sojo said, ``was just put my bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo reached and swung and chopped a grounder toward third,
looked up and glanced at third baseman Eric Chavez, and was
surprised to see how deep Chavez was playing. Chavez moved in to
field the ball, and Sojo chugged down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sojo saw Stanley, the first baseman, lurching off the bag:
Chavez's throw was so high and wide that the first base coach Lee
Mazzilli dived chest-first to the ground, and the ball bounded into
the Coliseum's huge foul territory. Justice scored, Vizcaino
scored, tie game, runners at second and third. The Yankees were
yelling and high-fiving on their bench.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius was stepping to the plate, Clay Bellinger was on
deck, and manager Joe Torre told Williams that if Brosius was
walked, then Williams would pinch-hit for Bellinger.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, who hadn't batted left-handed since Aug. 18
because of his strained rib cage, told Torre he wanted to bat
left-handed against Mecir. Torre and the trainer, Gene Monahan,
tried persuading Williams to bat right-handed against the
right-handed Mecir, to protect his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to bat right-handed,'' Williams said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Manager and player debated a bit. Mecir, who had now thrown more
than 40 pitches, walked Brosius intentionally, filling the bases.
Williams wanted to bat left-handed. Monahan and Torre consulted
quickly and agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mecir fell behind, two balls and no strikes, and then Williams
slapped a grounder to the left side. Martinez raced home as the
Athletics tried to turn a double play, but Williams beat the relay
to first.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when right fielder Paul O'Neill was unavailable because
of his hip pointer, Torre had used two pinch-hitters and a
pinch-runner trying to come back from the early deficit, forcing
him to restructure his defense for the eighth. Brosius moved to
left field, Sojo shifted from second to third, and Vizcaino stepped
in to play second base _ and because Vizcaino had been used a
pinch-runner for the designated hitter, Canseco, the Yankees had to
sacrifice the DH to do this.
</P>
<P>
   When Dwight Gooden came on to pitch the eighth, he was slotted
into the leadoff spot. But his place in the batting order wasn't as
unusual as the simple fact that Gooden was called upon to protect a
one-run lead in the eighth, a job usually assigned to the
right-hander Jeff Nelson or the left-hander Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   He got two outs, and Mariano Rivera took over from there,
getting the last four outs, and soon the Yankees were on their way
to Seattle, their lead over the Red Sox at four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a very big win for us,'' Torre said. ``A lot
depends on what we do the rest of the road trip, but this could
mean a lot to us. It was a big game, because we kept going at
people.''
