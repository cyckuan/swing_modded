<HEADLINE> Shooting Continues In Liberian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic shooting resumed in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia this morning as armed rebels
continued their protests against attempts by the armed police to
arrest their leader on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said that after a day of panic in
Monrovia, the shooting died down at dawn today, only
to resume around 7 am.
</P>
<P>
Early yesterday the Liberian security forces clashed with
supporters of ousted faction leader Rooselvelt Johnson, in the
northeastern Sinkor District of Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Johnson is currently facing murder charges and failed to
comply with an order by Liberia's ruling Council of State to turn
himself in by mid-afternoon on Friday to answer charges of
murder.
</P>
<P>
The armed police were confronted by the supporters of Johson,
who led the Krahn wing of the United Liberation Movement until a
majority of his senior commanders ousted him in early March.
</P>
<P>
But those still loyal to him broke out of a cordon erected
around Sinkor and moved into the city center, starting to shoot
and loot and forcing thousands of residents to flee for safety,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Around 7:30 this morning, the sound of heavy weapons could be
heard coming from Sinkor. And UN sources were quoted as saying
that they believed fighters of other factions -- the Liberia
Peace Council, the Mandingo wing of Ulimo and the National
Patriotic Front of Liberia -- were involved in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
So far no official casualties have been released.

</P>
<P>
Lebanon
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- One southern Lebanese civilian was
killed and three others were wounded tonight by a mine planted by
the Israeli forces and their client militia, causing a fear in
northern Israel for a retaliatory attack by Hezbollah guerrillas
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that Mazel Imad
Farhat, 16, was killed by a blast of the mine planted on a branch
road leading to the southern lebanese village of Barashit opposite
an Israeli-occupied buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
And the mine blast also wounded his brother Ibrahim, 8,
Mohammed Hussein Obeid, 6, and Ali Kamal Shehab, 25, the security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that all the wounded were transferred to a hospital
in the southern Lebanese port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation for a revenge by guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, the Israeli army asked the residents
in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Shmona at northern Israel to
resort to shield, police sources in the settlement reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah always considers the killing of civilians in
southern Lebanon as a violation of a U.S.-mediated understanding
which put an end to an Israeli blitz in the South in July, 1993.
</P>
<P>
And according to the understanding, Israeli promised to
refrain from attacking civilian targets in south Lebanon in an
exchange for Hezbollah's guarantee for the safety of the Jewish
residents in northern Israel.

LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria
is determined to eliminate the winner-take-all syndrome which
characterizes the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General, Jeremiah Useni, minister of the Federal Capital

At a reception in honor of the outgoing members of the
Caretaker Committees of the four area councils in the FCT and the
newly-elected chairmen and councillors, Useni advised the new
officials to be "fair and just" in making decisions, regarding
everyone in their areas as their subjects regardless of their
political beliefs.

The zero-party election of local government leaders, the first
step of the military government toward the return to civil rule,

<HEADLINE> Fighting Stops In Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia, between the government forces and a rebel faction during
the weekend halted apparently today as a result of foreign
intervention.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said, streets in Monrovia
remained deserted following a night disturbed by only a few
isolated gunshots, most residents staying indoors after two days
of clashes between the Krahn wing of the United Liberation
Movement (ULIMO) and the government forces.
</P>
<P>
It is said to be the worst fighting Monrovia had seen in four
years.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources in the city said the chairman of the West African
regional organization ECOWAS, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings,
and other African presidents had intervened to stop the fighting,
as well as foreign diplomats in the capital.
</P>
<P>
OAU Chief Salim Ahmed Salim also calleld for an end to
fighting, saying it threatened to derail efforts to end six
years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting in Monrovia represents a new, dangerous and
unacceptable escalation of the conflict," Secretary General of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim said in a
statement in Addis Ababa today.
</P>
<P>
The weekend's clashes flared up early Saturday when armed
police tried to arrest former faction leader Roosevelt Johnson,
who had failed to turn himself in on a murder charge, at his home
in the northeastern district of Sinkor.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's supporters later on Saturday broke out of a police
cordon and moved into central Monrovia where they went on a
shooting and looting spree, forcing thousands of residents, many
of whom had fled Sinkor, to run for safety.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting broke out on Sunday when government forces in
pursuit of Johnson were attacked by members of the Krahn faction.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source said Rawlings and others who intervened have
suggested "another way out other than the military solution."
</P>
<P>
All seven of Liberia's factions signed a peace accord last
August aimed to end the civil war that broke out in December
1989 and left more than 150,000 people dead.

</P>
<P>
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish troops have launched a
large-scale operation, killing 90 Kurdish rebels in the past three
days, reported the government authorities today.
</P>
<P>
But 27 Turkish soldiers also lost their lives in the
search-and-destroy operation, the highest casualties the
government forces suffered this year.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale operation has been carried out since last Friday
night in Turkey's southeastern provinces of Diyarbakir and Bingol,
said the Diyarbakir-based Emergency Rule administration in an
issued statement.
</P>
<P>
Government forces started the operation from five different
spots and the clashes were still going on.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia news agency reported that a large amount of weapons
have been seized during the operation.
</P>
<P>
Parallel to the spring campaign inside its border, Turkey on
Sunday also sent air force jets and ground troops into northern
Iraq to attack the rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) who
entrenched there, according to unconfirmed reports.
</P>
<P>
The jets and troops have returned home after fulfilling
their missions, said the reports. The Turkish government is expected
to make an official statement on the reported cross-border
operation on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Attempt On Mubarak's Life State-Sponsored: Ethiopia FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia today considered
that the foiled assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak last June here was a state-sponsored terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, the Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry said the assassination attempt was a serious crime, not
only because the target was a head of state or it involved the
violation of Ethiopia's sovereignty, but also because it was a
state-sponsored terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Sudanese government even by the end of
March, the deadline given to it, had failed to comply with United
Nations resolution 1044 which demanded Sudan hand over, among
other things, the alleged terrorists to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The pressure being applied by the Security Council is on the
Sudanese Authorities, not on the Sudanese people, the release
said, adding that the target should always be the Sudanese regime
which sponsored the crime.
</P>
<P>
It also said, Ethiopia "will await how the Security Council
will be discharging its heavy responsibility regarding an issue
which involves the discovery of a country being engaged in
sponsoring terrorism in a clear and naked manner."
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia is very much proud of what it has done so far in
order to ensure that the crime committed by Sudanese authorities
is brought to light and is referred to the appropriate regional
and international bodies," it added.

<HEADLINE> American Children Watch Less Television: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- With the popularity of computers
and videocassettes, American children are watching less television
than they used to do, according to a special report released by
The New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that most of the nation's 28.2 million children
aging two to 11 spend an average of 21 hours a week watching
television, down five hours a week from the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
This has become a trend that has been quietly developing from a
dozen years ago, it noted.
</P>
<P>
With one-third of households in the United States having
personal computers, the report said, more and more children spend
time playing computers.
</P>
<P>
It is true that computers account for a portion of the falloff
and fragmentation of the chidren's television viewing audience,
but data from the report show that even when children are sitting
in front of the television, they would rather view a rented or
purchased videocassette.
</P>
<P>
This trend has raised concerns among children television
programmers. They complained that because of much of children's
programming gravitating towards other things, it is difficult for
them to provide children with best television programming that
could help give the nation's youth a common basis for
understanding the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations appealed
today for an end to fighting in Monrovia, capital of Liberia,
according to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general,
told the noon news briefing that the fighting between government
troops and the rebel force broke out last Saturday and continued
for the third day today.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the 90 U.N. military observers had taken
refuge in the U.S. Embassy compound while the offices of the Food
and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization had
been looted.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was very concerned
about the deteriorating situation and appealed to the parties to
desist from any further escalation of the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No decision has been taken on the evacuation of the U.N.
staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the capital started when government troops tried to
arrest rebel leader Roosevelt Johnson from home in the eastern
suburb of Sinkor. Johnson is wanted on the murder charges stemming
from clashes killing several people in the capital last week.
Government troops overran Johnson's compound Sunday, but he
escaped and remained at large today.
</P>
<P>
The African peacekeepers have stayed out of the fighting. They
have helped maintain security in Monrovia since the civil war
broke out in 1990. The war has killed about 150,000 people and
displaced over one-third of its 2.9 million population, resulting
in more than 700,000 seeking refuge in the neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls on Peacekeepers in Liberia to Put End to Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Immigration
Ali Al-Khilil today called on the African peacekeeping forces in
Liberia to put an end to rampant fightings in Monrovia, capital of
the African country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at his residence in the southern
Lebanese port city of Saida, the Lebanese minister asked the
peacekeeping forces to enable the Liberian government to resume
their official function so as to help the Lebanese there and to
provide them with material necessities, in event they need such
help.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia earlier today, Johnson's militia held 25 Lebanese
captive for unknown purposes.
</P>
<P>
Khilil said that he had contacted with the Lebanese embassy in
Monrovia to try to secure a release of the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
There are some 1,500 Lebanese residing in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes erupted in the Liberian capital Saturday, and
Lebanese leaders and ministers concerned held intensive
consultations and contacted Liberia and other countries to ensure
the safety of the Lebanese in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz said on Sunday night
that some 1,000 Lebanese had fled their residences in that city
and some of them found a sanctuary in the Lebanese embassy.
</P>
<P>
He said that fighting was going on only 300 meters
away from the embassy premises.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that he had called the U.S. embassy in Beirut and
the Lebanese embassy in Washington to inquire whether there was
an American ship in a near distance from the Liberian coast,
which could be used to evacuate the Lebanese from the western
African country, in case of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Monrovia said that all the Lebanese
in that city had fled their residences after the fighting erupted,
some of them went in a panic to the Lebanese Embassy while others
rushing to hotels near the U.S. embassy in Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan Trying to Calm Panic Caused by Merill Lynch Report (by Wen Xinnian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian officials, ranging from
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti to bank managers, are busying
in calming the great jitters in the Jordanian business community
caused by a report of an international assessment company.
</P>
<P>
Merill Lynch, a U.S.-based international financial consultancy
firm whose advice is taken seriously by many investors, said in a
report published late last month that the Amman Financial Market
(AFM) is among the poorly valued in the world and the least
attractive one in the region.
</P>
<P>
It asserted that it does not envisage any change in the
situation of the AFM as long as the authorities remained focused
on pegging the Jordanian dinar with the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to the Central Bank of Jordan's (CBJ)
move to fix the exchange rate between the dinar and the
U.S. dollar late last year to put to rest speculations that a
devaluation of the dinar was imminent and to maintain a higher
yield on dinar deposits than the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The report, once published in the local press, gave the
Jordanian government a big surprise, caused great fears and
deepened the lack of confidence in the AFM and the national
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Prices tumbled by nearly five percent last week at the already
sluggish AFM. In the four days of successive trading, shares of
nearly 70 companies out of the 120 listed in the market declined
sharply.
</P>
<P>
The weekly report of the market said the drop was the largest
weekly dip in more than three years, and raised the decline in
share prices this year to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline prompted the prime minister to pay an
unprecedented visit to the AFM Wednesday in order to dispel
negative comments raised against the government's monetary
policies and to inject a new dose of confidence into the market.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti reassured market officials and traders that the
economic status and performance of the country were very stable
and there was no cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that there was a "crisis" in the bourse, but that
it had no reflection on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that "all justifications for the continuation of
high interest rates would no longer be present" in the next two
months and that the government would seek to bring down interest
rates beginning in June.
</P>
<P>
The premier defended the government monetary policy during his
visit to the CBJ Sunday, saying that "at this stage, interest
rates are justified and supported by the government because they
have achieved their purpose of boosting the country's foreign
currency reserves."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his government's satisfaction with "the CBJ's
performance and its monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
"The government realizes that there is need for the bank to
achieve a balance between savings and investments," he added.
</P>
<P>
Implicitly criticizing the Merill Lynch report, he said,
"international standards and figures will prove those who cast
doubts on the performance of the Jordanian economy wrong."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the same firm had issued a positive assessment of
the market in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Umayyah Touqan, director general of the AFM, accused the local
press of misinterpreting and overplaying the Merill Lynch report,
saying the ups and downs of stock market are very normal.
</P>
<P>
Jawad Hadid, general manager of the Arab Banking Corporation
(Jordan), said there is a globalization of economy at present,
and Jordan, as part of it, will be subject to being evaluated
positively or negatively by world institutions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the report "should not frighten us and should
not have been accorded the importance and not been given the quick
and strong negative reaction," noting the decisions of local
investors do not always depend on the views of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the low volume of trading at the AFM to much
liquidity flowing to other investments, such as real estate, where
investors found an easy and quick profit.
</P>
<P>
"At the end, land prices will be saturated and overvalued and
that is when liquidity will seek other channels and flow back to
the stock exchange," Hadid added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the defense of the monetary policy
by high-ranking officials including Minister of Planning Rima
Khalaf will not offset completely the negative impact the Merill
Lynch report made on the business confidence.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Politely Refuses Rafsanjani's State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today politely
refused the state visit by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani to Pretoria in a bid not to offend Americans.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said at a press
conference here that two days before he left for Iran, President
Nelson Mandela told him that he would welcome an unofficial visit
by Iran's President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani "if he was passing by
in the area."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports here had indicated that a state visit by
Rafsanjani to South Africa was scheduled for March or April this
year.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that it was not the question of "the desire" to extend
an official invitation.
</P>
<P>
"We want to pay a very special attention to the visit by the
Iranian president to our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that was not "a state visit."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the South African minister said, the problems
between Iran and the United States will not affect relations
between Tehran and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Nzo stated that his country pursues an independent foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who arrived here today, is on a second visit to
Tehran. His first visit was in November 1994. During his current
three-day visit, he would inaugurate the South African Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Iran reestablished ties with South Africa after Pretoria abolished
the apartheid system. Relations between Tehran and Pretoria have
remained friendly despite U.S. pressure on Mandela to limit or
sever ties with Iran.

<P>
ATHENS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government expressed its
displeasure today at a decision by Belgrade to recognize the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (YROM) as the "Republic of
Macedonia."
</P>
<P>
A Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia's decision "does not help the stability and improvement
in relations between the nations in the region, and cannot be
considered a friendly gesture towards Greece."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Costas Bikas made the comments in
Washington, the U.S., where he is accompanying Greek Premier
Costas Simitis on his official visit.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government, just as the other nations of the
European Union, has recognized the former YROM and supports its
recognition by other former Yugoslav republics under such name," a
dispatch by the Athens News Agency from Washington said.
</P>
<P>
The solution of the name issue between Athens and Skopije
(capital of Macedonia) is being sought within the framework of
negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- OAU Chief Dr. Salim Ahmed
Salim today expressed concern at the current situation in Liberia
and called on the faction leaders to exercise utmost restraint
and put an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) said, Dr. Salim pointed out that the fighting in Monrovia
represents a new, dangerous and unacceptable escalation of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is particularly sad this fighting should take place in the
liberian capital at a time when Africa and the world community
expected that all the faction leaders would do their utmost to
ensure security and stability in Monrovia and in the country
within the context of the Abuja agreement, Dr Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Secretary General particularly appealed to Liberia's
faction leaders to ensure the safety and security of the innocent
citizens of the country as well as of the other residents of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance and urgency of a scrupulous
implementation of the Abuja agreement which inter alia provides
for a ceasefire and a mechanism to address whatever differences
that emerge between the factions.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Axworthy handed over Canadian Prime

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Transfer 16 Suspected War Criminals  to Pale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb authorities
transferred to Pale 16 prisoners of war charged with war crimes
against Serbs, Serb Deputy Justice Minister Goran Neskovic said
today.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were immediately visited by representatives of
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), he said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim and Croat war crimes suspects were first grouped in
the northwestern city of Banja Luka and then transferred to Pale,
the Serb administrative center near Sarajevo, at the request of
Michael Steiner, deputy high representative of the international
community for Bosnian civilian affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Since there is no prison in Pale, the prisoners were placed in
a reception center in the local high school," the Tanjug news
agency quoted Neskovic as saying.
</P>
<P>
Neskovic said Steiner insisted that the prisoners suspected of
war crimes be grouped in a diameter of 30 kilometers around
Sarajevo, and the closest prison in the area is in Srbinje, some
80 km northwest of Pale.
</P>
<P>
Neskovic confirmed that evidence material against the 16 war
crime suspects had been sent Sunday to the Hague War Crimes
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The international community had demanded that the three parties
in Bosnia free all prisoners of war by April 5 except those who
had committed war crimes. Those who failed to comply with the
demand would be excluded from next week's donation conference in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
High Representative of the international community Carl Bildt's
office in Sarajevo said the Serb authorities had provided evidence
files for 13 war crime suspects who are on the list of prisoners
registered by the ICRC and for three who are not on the list.
While on the other hand, evidence for three more prisoners on the
ICRC list had not been provided.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear if the confusion over three prisoners of
war will be the reason for excluding the Serb side from
participating in the reconstruction' conference on reconstruction of
war-shattered Bosnia-Hezregovina which opens on April 12. Bildt
said the decision on this would be made Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Court Orders Extradition of An American Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Larnaca District Court
today ordered the extradition to the U.S. of an American citizen,
David Lee Carter, to face charges of fraud involving thousands of
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a dispatch by Cyprus News Agency from Larnaca, a
southeastern port town, the misappropriation of funds took place
between 1984-89 by U.S. financial organizations using forged
documents, signed by Kitty Wight, also from the U.S., who
cohabited with Carter.
</P>
<P>
Wight is already serving a jail sentence in the U.S. after
being extradited from Russia, where she fled with Carter to
escape justice.
</P>
<P>
Carter came to Cyprus in October last year with a Russia
woman, who was deported a month later.
</P>
<P>
District Judge Antonis Liatsos was quoted as saying that he
considered the application of Carter's extradition "justified" as
there is sufficient evidence in the application by the
U.S. federal administration, which warrants Carter's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Carter has the right to appeal to the Republic's Supreme Court
for habeas corpus, according to the court order.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Accord Not to Affect Cyprus' Ties with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A defense agreement between
Israel and Turkey does not affect Cyprus' relations with the
Jewish state, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on last week's agreement between Turkey and Israel
providing for overfly rights to both countries, the spokesman
said at his daily press briefing that "we do not believe that a
defense agreement between Israel and Turkey affects our relations
with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Noting Cyprus' excellent links with both Syria and Israel,
Cassoulides added "this does not mean that our ties with either
country have been affected."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Cyprus keeps an eye on the developments, but
does not consider the agreement affects Cyprus' relations with
Israel, boosted in the past few years with the opening of a
Cypriot embassy in Tel Aviv and a visit to Cyprus by the then
Foreign Minister of Israel and current Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
"If the defense agreement does affect our ties with Israel,
then it will be a non-friendly move towards Cyprus which will
surprise us and explanation will be sought from both sides,"
Cassoulides noted.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, Cassoulides said he did not think
the Israel-Turkey agreement would have any repercussions on a
Cyprus-Greece joint defense policy.
</P>
<P>
The joint defense policy, agreed in November 1993 between
the Cypriot and Greek governments, provides for Greek military
sea, air and land cover for Cyprus in the event of a
Turkish offensive against the government-controlled areas of the
island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> 25 Lebanese in Monrovia Captured by Johnson's Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz announced this evening that six Lebanese families
comprising 25 persons in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, had
been held captive by militia of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The purpose for the capture remained unknown until this story
was released.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said his government is making contacts to pursue a
release of these Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Lebanese embassy in Monrovia had been
attacked for three times. But he gave on details on whether there
was any casualties among the embassy staff or among some 200
Lebanese hiding in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the Immigrants Ali Al-Khalil, in addition,
announced this evening that he is in a continuous touch with the
Lebanese embassy in Monrovia to follow up the developments of
situation in that city, trying to gain a release of the Lebanese
seized by Johnson's militia.
</P>
<P>
He said he was informed that the African peacekeeping forces,
notably the Nigerian troops, had been moving toward the Liberian
capital and were massing at entrances of the city.
</P>
<P>
Khalil added that the peacekeeping forces were conducting
negotiations with rioting factions in Monrovia in order to
avert more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes erupted in Monrovia Saturday, causing
immediate concern of the Lebanese government on the security
of some 1,500 Lebanese in the Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the Western African country said
that the Lebanese in Monrovia had fled their residences since the
 fightings erupted, some of them had found a sanctuary in the
Lebanese embassy and others rushed to a hotel near the
U.S. embassy in the city.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz had conducted contacts with Washington to seek help. He
announced on Sunday night that he had required the
U.S. government whether there was an American ship near the
Liberian coast which could be used to evacuate the Lebanese from
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said he also contacted the Nigerian forces in the
African peacekeeping forces in Liberian and asked them to help
guarantee the safety of the Lebanese embassy as well as the
Lebanese interests in Monrovia.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government expects
that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis will underline the need
for effective moves on Cyprus problem during his forthcoming
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press today ahead of Tuesday's meeting in
Washington between Simitis and Clinton, Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides expressed the view that Simitis would ask to be
informed in more detail about the manner in which the U.S. intends
to push ahead with efforts to settle the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see American interest and American
initiative on Cyprus to be as substantive as possible to be
effective. We would also like to hear how this interest is going
to be transformed into action," Michaelides stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed Simitis would wish to emphasize the
importance Greece attached to the need for effective moves on
Cyprus and therefore would want to see how the U.S. intends
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told his
daily press briefing today that "the Cyprus Republic expects
the Greek premier to outline Greece' view that it is necessary
to find a just and viable solution in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Simitis' visit to the U.S. comes only a couple of weeks
after a similar visit by Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel.
Greco-Turkish relations and the Cyprus problem are expected to
be high on the agenda of talks between Simitis and Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Iran Demands Explanation from Turkey on Military Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities today broke
silence on a reported military agreement between Turkey and
Israel, demanding an official explanation from Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in a press
conference, "We are waiting for more explanations from officials
in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
While answering a question raised by Xinhua, he said that it
would be "regrettable" if a military agreement was signed between
Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He added that he learned the Turkish authorities have denied
part of the report on the military agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for more explanations and certainly in that
case we will express our positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the publication of the news report on the agreement by
Turkey and Israel, the Iranian press launched harsh attacks on the
Turkish government, warning it would provoke anger to the Turkish
people and Moslem countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian press also noted that the agreement would pose
threat to the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran
since the Israeli air force is permitted to train in Turkish
skies.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Jomhuri Islami said Sunday that the recent
military agreement made between Turkey and Israel endangers the
national security of Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Husayin Ialtut, military attache at the Turkish
Embassy in Tehran, told Xinhua that the agreement between Turkey
and Israel was the business between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"If Iranians want to conclude same kind of agreement with
another, it is their business," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is a small country and has no large
airspace, it is willing to pay and train in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted that relations between Iran and
Turkey is now at the lowest point due to a number of factors,
including the latest accord between Turkey and Israel, under which
the Israeli air force is reportedly allowed to train in Turkish
skies.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran's concern over Israel's military
reconnaissance and potential military attacks against certain
targets is understandable.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here also said although the relations
between Iran and Turkey have turned ice-cold, the two neighbors
seem to want to curb the deteriorating trend.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Toygan arrived here this
afternoon and would hold talks with Iranian authorities on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that he would
meet Ali Toygan this evening and hear his explanations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Turkey's agreement with Israel would
top the agenda during the discussions.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Likely to Contest Elections in Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's
chief negotiator with the British government, indicated today that
his party is likely to take part in the Ulster elections next
month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the BBC Radio, he said a decision by the Social
Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP), the largest Catholic party in
Northern Ireland, to contest the polls would influence Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness said that Sinn Fein would prefer a boycott of the
polls by republicans.
</P>
<P>
But if the SDLP took part in the elections, then he was certain
that Sinn Fein would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
However, SDLP chairman Jonathan Stevenson said his party wants
to see legislation on election in the troubled province before
deciding whether to take part in or not.
</P>
<P>
He said the only pressure on his party "is to get to all-party
talks and to find a formula which will turn the violence off for
good."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that his party would probably take part in the
poll "reluctantly," but he dismissed speculation of an electoral
pact with Sinn Fein.

<P>
MOGADISHU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Three international relief
agencies have evacuated their foreign staff from South Mogadishu
following the increasing tension between General Mohamed Farah
Aidid and Osman hassan Ali Atto who fought here.
</P>
<P>
The agencies, CARE International, CARITAS Germany and ACCORD
OF USA have moved their international expatriates to North
Mogadishu temporarily and later on flew them to Nairobi in the
last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The offices of these aid agencies remain open in South
Mogadishu under their Somali staff to maintain close monitoring
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the local staff said their regional offices
in Nairobi suggested they pull their staff out of Mogadishu where
another massive fighting is eminent between Osman Atto and
General Aidid who returned to the capital two days ago for a
possible reorganization of his militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu has been quiet for the third day today, but tension
remains high with sniper shots being heard around the battle
zones dividing the two opposing militiamen.
</P>
<P>
There is also a growing concern that all international aid
agencies will totally withdraw if fighting between Osman Atto and
General Aidid is renewed once again.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in South Mogadishu, the worst in three months,
has claimed the lives of more than 25 people, and the wounded are
still pouring into hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Goes Up in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation rate in March
broke the 9 percent ceiling, reaching an annualized rate of 9.1
from 8.5 percent in February, according to figures released by the
National Statistics Service of Greece (ESYE) today.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to price increases in fuels, fruit and
vegetables, and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in 1995 had been contained at 8.1 percent, but rose
to 8.25 percent in January this year and 8.5 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The cost-of-living index for the month of March rose by 3.4
percent against a 2.9 percent rise in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
But the ESYE said preliminary price checks on the market for
the April cost-of-living index give no indication that the March
price increases will continue this month.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Refutes Sinn Fein Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
has accused Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams of being "stuck in a
groove" with his repeated criticisms of the Dublin government,
according to a report in the Times newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Bruton urged Adams to stop recrimination about the past and to
spell out in detail what Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), expected the planned all-party talks
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
The Irish premier said his government had been true to the
Irish flag, unlike the IRA which had directed violence and
coercion against the Irish people.
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of the 1919 Irish unrising against British
rule in Londonderry in Ulster Sunday, Adams once again demanded an
unconditional seat at the all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland to be convened on June 10.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Dublin government for its handling of
the process for the planned all-party talks and accused Bruton of
allowing British Prime Minister John Major to set an agenda
favoring the Protestant unionists who want to remain British.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Chair Meeting on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will meet his top officials on Wednesday for talks on solving the
15-month crisis in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The planned meeting of the Security Council will focus on the
present situation in the breakaway republic and implementing
Yeltsin's peace plan announced on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes a complete halt of military operations in
Chechnya, a step by step withdrawal of Russian forces and talks
with rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev to end the bloodshed which has
cost some 30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
But Russian troops were reported to be carrying out an
intensive attack this afternoon, aiming to drive Dudayev's
supporters out of the villages of Dagro and Vedeno, the biggest
strongholds of armed Chechen rebels in the remote Vedeno district.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have surrounded Dagro and Vedeno, where Dudayev's
chief commanders Shamil Basayev and Aslan Maskhadov are holed up.
</P>
<P>
Basayev was at the head of rebels who took 3,000 people hostage
in the southern Russian city Budennovsk and Maskhadov is the
military chief of staff of the Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Grozny-based mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe Tim Guldimann said Yeltsin's
proposal for talks with rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev was positive
to settle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But, he believed, talks would take some time to start because
"statements and ordinances of Russia's top leadership on the
termination of hostilities in the (Chechen) republic are not
always translated into life in full measure by the military
there."

<HEADLINE> Telecom Transformation Projects Under Way In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Telecommunications
(NITEL) is currently executing telecommunications projects worth
25 billion Naira (294 million U.S.Dollars) throughout the
country, aiming at one telephone line per 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
The projects, according to NITEL Managing Director Buba
Bajoga, include the provision of fiber optic cable network,
digitalisation, introduction of card-phone system connection with
the world satellite communications system known as INTERNET.
</P>
<P>
When all the projects are completed, telecommunications
services will be available to millions of Nigerians and the
quality of service will improve, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 600,000 telephone lines in Nigeria
and in a few years, Bajoga said, the figure will become one
million.
</P>
<P>
According to him, efforts are being made to meet the
International Telecommunications Union standard of having one
line per 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has a population of about 100 million.
</P>
<P>
NITEL, the telecommunications tycoon of the country, became a
limited liability company in 1985 after the former post and
telegraph department of the government was divided into two. It
has now a telephone network of about 600,000 lines, half of which
as digital.

<HEADLINE> UK Post Office Targets Travel Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Post Office has set its
sights on becoming the biggest travel agent in Britain and plans
to sell cut-price scheduled airline tickets in most of its 20,000
branches.
</P>
<P>
The service is now available at the Trafalgar Square office in
London, where a six-month trial is being carried out, said local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
If the trial is successful, it will be rolled out nationally in
up to 600 of the largest high street branches.
</P>
<P>
Within a year, thousands of more branches could have computer
systems in place to enable customers to fix up their travel
documents while buying stamps and postal orders.
</P>
<P>
A Post Office spokesman said that the service, which involves
the sale of flights only, and not holiday packages, will
complement its existing foreign exchange and travel insurance
sales through its 20,000 counters.
</P>
<P>
"We are visited by 28 million people every week, so the
opportunities are enormous," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Post Office is offering seats unsold by scheduled airlines.
It said that it had no plans at present to sell surplus charter
airline tickets, although the possibility of introducing such a
service at a later date had not been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Post Office branches might also
consider selling theater tickets in the future, although such a
move was not an option at present.
</P>
<P>
The Post Office's plans are part of a deal to allow a wider
range of services after the government decided to abandon the
privatization of Royal Mail.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Denounces Israel's Confiscation of Palestinian Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today denounced
Israel's confiscation of Palestinian lands on the pretext of
building roads to link Jewish settlements in the West Bank, saying
the practice gravely harms the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based league said in a statement that Israel has
confiscated almost 20,000 donums (some 18.8 square kilometers) of
Palestinian lands since the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli
agreement on expanding Palestinian self-rule last September.
</P>
<P>
The statement, carried by Egypt's state-run Middle East News
Agency (MENA), also said that the confiscation creates a fait
accompli before the start of the final-stage talks between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to be held later this year, will discuss the future
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League urged the countries which participated in the
Summit of Peacemakers in Egypt last month to immediately intervene
to bring to a halt the Israeli policy of confiscating Palestinian
lands.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from 27 countries gathered in the Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh on March 13 for a conference on saving the Middle
East peace process from collapse and countering terrorism which
threatens the regional peace march.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the 22-member league underlined its hope for
the continuation of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Macedonia Establish Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and Macedonia Republic agreed here today to establish full diplomatic
relations at ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic and his Macedonian
counterpart, Ljubomir Frckoski, signed an "agreement on regulation
of bilateral relations and promotion of cooperation", which
normalizes diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony at the federal government building,
Milutinovic told reporters that the agreement between the two
countries was their contribution to strengthening peace in the former
Yugoslavia, the Balkans and Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that Yugoslav-Macedonian relations face a great
future because of spiritual closeness between the two peoples and a
large number of interests the two states have in common," the
Yugoslav foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We have also agreed to deal with the succession issue through
agreements, which will make it easier to find a final solution to
this complex issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
By establishing full diplomatic relations, the two countries
will create conditions for a broad communication and will set up
intensive dialogue and contacts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macedonian Foreign Minister Frckoski told reporters the
two countries had regulated basic relations in a normal and dignified
manner, and the agreement would open a new page in the history of
the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
Frckoski, who arrived here this morning for signing the
agreement, said there was yet a lot to be done, because the
agreement only provided basis for a series of bilateral agreements
on cooperation in the spheres of economy, culture and transport as
well as of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Among the four republics which seceded from the former Yugoslavia
in 1991 and 1992, -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Macedonia, the latter is the only one to gain independence peacefully
and the first one to establish relations with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Scuffles Break Out in Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Scuffles broke out today in
Belfast, capital of the conflict-torn Northern Ireland, as a tense
stand-off between British police and Protestant marchers
continues.
</P>
<P>
Police had sealed off the Catholic area of the Lower Ormeau
Road in the south of the city and tried to ban the Protestant
Apprentice Boys organization from marching through it.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off started at the Ormeau Bridge, which leads to the
Catholic area, this morning when police halted the march by about
80 members of the Apprentice Boys organization.
</P>
<P>
Then the marchers handed in a letter of protest over the ban
and claimed that they would stay there.
</P>
<P>
Riot police were also called up to the front of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary (RUC) line after these Protestant youths began
to climb over police vans.
</P>
<P>
So far a policeman and one of the marchers were hurt and
another one with his head wounded was taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police had banned the parade since last week, fearing violence
if the Protestant marchers went through this area.
</P>
<P>
Catholic republicans regard such a march, which has followed
the same route for 90 years, as a provocative display by
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
Now the crisis-laden Northern Ireland is being caught in a
tension, which is traditionally high during the "marching season"
which continues every year until the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The marching season is usually dominated by hundreds of
Protestant marches in country village and the city center from now
on.
</P>
<P>
Catholic republicans also parade on the Easter weekend and in
mid-August, but they confine themselves to the Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
Troubles occur almost every year, which are regarded as a
provocative sectarian display.
</P>
<P>
And this year, people in Northern Ireland are particularly
worried because the Irish Republican Army (IRA) has brought an end
to its 17-month truce since February 9 when they plotted a big
bomb explosion in east London.
</P>
<P>
Senior IRA strategist Gerard Kelly declared Sunday that
Northern Ireland was now in "a war situation".
</P>
<P>
He told an IRA rally that republicans were still committed to
removing Britain from Ireland.

<HEADLINE> UAE Decides to Exempt Palestinian Workers from Labor Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
government has decided to exempt Palestinian workers in the Gulf
country from the clauses of the UAE Labor Law so as to offer more
job opportunities to Palestinians, The Jerusalem Times, A
Palestinian newspaper published in east Jerusalem, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision taken during a visit by Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat will provide extra job security for those
already working in the UAE and create more job opportunities for
Palestinians from the self-rule areas in order to alleviate the
situation there. The workers are free to bring over their
families, regardless of how much they can earn.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the UAE has made an exception for Palestinians who
carry Palestinian passports or hold travel documents issued by
Arab states. Unlike other groups living and working in the UAE,
Palestinians' earnings will no longer need to conform to the
minimum on the scale of wages before their families are allowed to
join them.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Consul-General to the UAE, Abu Sultan, said
that President Yasser Arafat was informed of this decision during
his meeting with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sultan revealed that Sheikh Zayed had also assured
President Arafat that Palestinians who carry those documents can
continue living in the UAE indefinitely so that they will not
become a burden to the Palestinian Authority if they had to go
back.
</P>
<P>
Shiekh Zayed also showed an understanding for the complications
faced by the PA, should large numbers of Palestinians be forced
to return to the self-rule areas, said Abu Sultan. That was why
he decided to work out a special treatment for the Palestinians
that exempt them from the dictates of the UAE Labor Law.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Start Digital Television Broadcasting in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan will start digital
broadcasting in 2000, marking a major and controversial change in
policy away from the analogue broadcasting system it has favoured
until now.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to rouse strong protest from Japan's
electronics industry which has spent billions investing in
analogue high-definition television (HDTV), reports the Asahi
Shimbun newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The decision, says the paper, is a tacit admission by the
Japanese Post and Telecommunications Ministry that it made a
mistake when it decided to stick with analogue technology while
the rest of the world was rushing toward digital technology.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Japan was trying to make its Hi-Vision analogue
technology the de facto international standard. But with both the
United States and Europe embracing digital technology, the
Japanese lost out.
</P>
<P>
Digital broadcasting will be introduced in Japan when a new
satellite is launched in 2000. Among other advantages, digital
technology will allow the satellite to offer more than 10
channels, compared with four on the satellite to be replaced.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges Liberia to Start Disarmament Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on Liberia to approve the disarmament
and demobilization plan immediately, according to his report
available here today.
</P>
<P>
The report dated April 1 said that the commencement of
disarmament and demobilization could no longer be delayed.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Liberia is rapidly deteriorating and I fear
that, unless the peace process is put back on track in the very
near future, the consequences could be disastrous," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The civilian population and even some combatants have
demonstrated a strong desire for peace. They are frustrated,
however, by the failure of the Council of State and the faction
leaders to muster the political will and determination required to
implement the Abuja Agreement, in particular its disarmament and
demobilization aspects," he noted in his report.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic warfare broke out in Liberia in 1990 when the government
headed by President Samuel Doe was overthrown. The war claimed
about 150,000 lives, displaced over 1 million others, or more than
one third of the population, and resulted in some 700,000 refugees
in the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, 1993, the Interim Government of National Unity, The
National Patriotic Front of Liberia and the United Liberation
Movement of Liberia for Democracy signed the Contonou Agreement.
In the following month, the three parties realized cease-fire and
organized the Council of State of the Liberian National
Transitional Government.
</P>
<P>
The three parties also reached the Akosombo and Accra accords
in late 1994 and signed the Abuja Agreement in August 1995 for the
implementation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided on September 22, 1993 to establish
the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia to help implement
the peace agreement. The mandate of the mission will expire on
coming May 31, according to the Security Council resolution
adopted on January 29.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali reported that the peace progress in Liberia
continued to encounter severe difficulties with setbacks on the
military front and signs of discord between members of the Council
of State.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the Abuja Agreement is ultimately the
responsibility of the Council of State and, especially, the faction
leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to provide necessary
resources to the Economic Community of West African States
Monitoring Group, which was established in August 1990 for a
peaceful settlementtion of the conflict in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Caspian Water Level Keeps Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The water level of the Caspian
Sea has risen 2.5 meters in the past 18 years, causing great
material and ecological damage to areas in west Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The rising water has inundated seven residential areas, 200 oil
wells and more than 650,000 hectares of farmland within the
boundaries of Kazakhstan, according to the Kazakhstan Telegraph
Agency.
</P>
<P>
It also poses a serious threat to Kazakh industrial cities of
Aktau and Atyrau, both located on the east bank of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh State Committee for Emergency Situations has called
on the government to take measures to prevent the water level from
rising further. Some international organizations have also offered
to help.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the rising of the water level is probably
related to the long-time vibration of the earth's crust under the
Caspian Sea, which links the two continents of Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Regulate Baby Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government is
set to regulate the baby trade by outlawing commercial contracts
for surrogate mothers and the buying and selling of human eggs and
embryos.
</P>
<P>
The legislation on new reproductive technologies will be tabled
by the end of June, Canadian Health Minister David Dingwall was
quoted as saying by today's newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be based on the voluntary moratorium on nine
practices that the government put in place last July. The
practices include commercial agreements for surrogate mothers,
the buying and selling of eggs, sperm and embryos.
</P>
<P>
The move to turn the moratorium into a legislation ban is in
response to calls for the government to act quickly to legislate
the rapidly evolving science -- and business -- of human
reproduction in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The federal government had considered amending the Criminal
Code of Canada, but Dingwall said he believes separate legislation
on new reproductive technologies is a better way to deal with a
complex issue, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Dingwall did not reveal details about sanctions in the bill,
but he said they will include fines.

CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
expressed here today regret over suspension of the Middle East
peace process at present.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid, Chirac voiced the hope that Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations would be resumed as soon as possible, especially on
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israel suspended its talks with the Palestinians and Syria in
the wake of a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel, which
started on February 25 and killed some 60 people.
</P>
<P>
The French president, currently on a visit to Egypt, said he
holds identical views with the Arab League chief on issues raised
during their meeting at the league headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Their talks mainly dealt with France's role in the Middle East
peace process, Israel's closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the Red Sea islands of Hanish,
means of promoting Arab-French relations and other regional and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Chirac and his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
inaugurated a new Kasr al-Aini Hospital.
</P>

TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Asian women forced to act as sex
slaves for the Japanese army during World War II are to get
compensation from a fund supported by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
A report in the Yomiuri Shimbun paper said the Asia Peace
National Fund for Women, a private fund, will offer a one-off
payment of two million Japanese yen (18,000 U.S. dollars) each to
about 300 sex slaves, known as comfort women, living in South
Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the fund later denied the figures,
saying the organization was "in no condition to be able to make
such decisions."
</P>
<P>
The fund, founded last summer to mark the 50th anniversary of
the end of the war, was set up to collect contributions through
private institutions to compensate the estimated 80,000 to 200,000
comfort women. The then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama pledged
government support for the fund.

KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Ram

country's development when attending a meeting of the Nepal Aid

Before his departure, Mahat said at the airport that his

meeting beginning Tuesday.
</P>

The Nepal Aid Group, consisting of 23 countries and

formed in 1976 with the aim of assisting Nepal in its social and
economic development.
</P>

Mahat said that domestic resources alone were not adequate to
carry out all the development programs in the country, so he would
do his best to ensure the aid group's commitment to the
development of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepal needs some 1.2 billion US dollars of foreign aid for the

CHANGSHA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- More and more farmers in central
China's Hunan Province are becoming prosperous through raising
pigs.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the average per capita annual income
for farmers in the province was increased by 100 yuan, or 40
percent, by pig-raising last year.
</P>
<P>
The pig population in the province has increased annually by

slaughtered last year, showing a 1.6-fold increase over the 1990
figure. And the total output value of animal husbandry centering
on pig raising hit 35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To encourage pig-raising, the local authorities have worked out
preferential policies in terms of capital, technology and
transport, which have resulted in 230,000 specialized pig-raising
households who raise over 30 pigs each, on average.
</P>
<P>
The marketing and export of live pigs are brisk in the

<HEADLINE> Syria Expresses Deep Regret over Turco-Israeli Agreement on Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Syria today expressed its deep
regret and great concern over the agreement on the military
cooperation and training signed by Turkey and Israel in Tel Aviv
in February.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued by the Syrian Embassy in Turkey
said that as a member of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), Turkey should be aware of the firm and
consistent resolution of the OIC which condemns Israel's
occupation of Arab land and its usurpation of holy Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the OIC resolutions, adopted with
support of Turkey, demand that all OIC members abstain from any
form of political, military, economic or other cooperation with
Israel as long as the latter continues its occupation of the Arab
land and its denial of the Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
Under the reported terms of the Turco-Israeli agreement on
military cooperation, Turkish and Israeli air force planes will be
able to carry out training maneuvers in each other country's
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Israeli Defense Ministry Director
General David Ivry and Turkish Deputy Chief of Staff Cevik Bir
during the Latter's visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has also approved the Israel Aircraft
Industries plant to upgrade 54 Turkish fighter-bombers at a cost
of 650 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Syria expressed the hope that the Turkish government would
review the security and military agreements it concluded recently
with Israel, in conformity with the OIC resolutions and safeguard
the historic relations between the Turkish people and Arab states.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Defense Minister Oltan Sungurlu denied in
remarks published Sunday that an accord Turkey signed with Israel
in February involved opening Turkish airspace and military bases
to the Israeli air force.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Turkey and Israel had no accord for training
of Israeli pilots in Turkey, adding that the February deal only
proposed an exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of
military training.

weapons left by the Japanese army during World War Two, the Sangyo

</P>
<P>
The group, comprising experts from the Foreign Ministry,
Self-Defense Forces and public community, will also determine the

According to incomplete statistics, the Japanese army launched
2,000 chemical attacks in China during the war, with Chinese
victims numbering 240,000 in 480 confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
The army hid a large number of unused chemical weapons in China
before its surrender. It's been estimated that as many as 1.8
million rounds of chemical shells were buried in Dunhua in
northeast China's Jilin province alone.
</P>
<P>
Based on the group's investigation, the Chinese and Japanese
governments will then work out a plan to destroy the weapons.

<HEADLINE> Baby Chimpanzee Saved By Tianjin Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A newly-born male chimpanzee
recently left the Children's Hospital in this north China port
city, where its life was saved after 14 days of rescue work by the
staff.
</P>
<P>
The baby chimpanzee, that was born on March 16 in the Tianjin
Zoo, was admitted to the hospital because of respiratory problems
due to premature delivery and lack of mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
To show their gratitude to the hospital, the newly-born was
named Tongtong, meaning "child", by the zoo.
</P>
<P>
After six abortions, it was the first time that Tongtong's
mother had given birth. The mother would not let anyone near the
suffering baby, so she had to be tranquilized in order that the
keepers could get the baby chimpanzee to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
This special patient was taken into a special ward, and the
hospital successfully handled its first case of a prematurely
delivered chimpanzee suffering from multiple complications.
</P>
<P>
Tongtong is reported to be in good health now, and its weight
has increased to over 300 grams.

<HEADLINE> Tangshan Citizens no Longer Fear Quakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- To residents of the north
China city of Tangshan, earthquakes are no longer the nightmares
that used to be since widespread anti-quake measures have been
taken in urban construction.
</P>
<P>
The industrial city was leveled in a 7.8-magnitude quake in
July 1976, the most destructive one in 20th century China. Experts
say lack of proper precautions was the basic cause of the heavy
loss of life and property damage.
</P>
<P>
In the rebuilding, which started shortly after the quake
subsided, the establishment of overall anti-quake measures has
been central to the rebuilding project.
</P>
<P>
All the new industrial and civil buildings are designed and
constructed so as to withstand eight-magnitude earthquakes. For
private houses, the inner walls are all concrete, and large public
buildings and highrises have reinforced concrete frameworks.
</P>
<P>
The city has improved its quake disaster fighting capacity as
far as its water and power supply and telecommunications
facilities are concerned, so that they can soon resume their
functions.
</P>
<P>
For example, the city is now equipped with a multi-sourced
water supply network with four plants in the east, west, north and
the central parts of the city, respectively, and its power supply
system is also a multi-sourced one.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan has also established special disaster prevention and
fighting sections in the city, district and county governments.

ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay might meet with his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias
at a meeting on Black Sea economic cooperation scheduled to be
held at the end of this month in Bucharest, Romania, to solve the
recent crisis over the disputed Aegean islet of Kardak (Imia).
</P>
<P>
It would be very "natural" for the foreign ministers of the two
neighboring NATO allies to hold "unconditional dialogue" during an
international meeting, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer
Akbel today was quoted by the local Anatolia News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing feud between Turkey and Greece, which form
the bulwark of NATO's southern flank, was added with another round
of flare-up over the sovereignty of the Aegean islet of Kardak
(Imia).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has called for "unconditional dialogue" for the
solution to the Aegean islet dispute. However, Greece maintains
that the Turkish side should first take some "concrete steps" to
reduce the hostility.

<HEADLINE> Jilin to Improve Corn Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A project to develop new methods
to produce higher corn yields will be launched in the next five
years in northeast China's Jilin Province to satisfy the domestic
demand for grain.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a major national project to improve the yield
of five crops -- rice, wheat, corn, cotton and beans -- designated
by the state during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
One of China's biggest grain producers and its top grain
exporter, Jilin is located in the second-best corn growing area in
the world, and its corn output accounts for 70 percent of its
total grain output.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years eight to ten high-yield corn varieties
will be chosen, and the corn yield will be increased by 30 percent
compared with that of the 1991-1995 period. With the adoption of
world-advanced techniques in seed processing and sowing, Jilin
will be made the center of advanced techniques for corn growing in
China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 270 million yuan will be poured into the project to
enhance corn yields in Jilin and the whole northern China region,
and a total of 7.8 billion kg of additional corn output is
expected over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have signed agreements with 11
counties to carry out the project, and 53 agricultural research
institutions across the country have applied to help solve the
four major technical problems concerned.

SHIJIAZHUANG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A series of activities have
been scheduled for the 20th anniversary of a devastating
earthquake in Tangshan, a major city in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which occurred on July 28, 1976, leveled the
industrial city, leaving 240,000 dead and another 160,000
seriously injured. It also left more than 3,000 people crippled
and 4,000-odd children orphaned.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to assistance from across the country and the earnest
efforts of its people, Tangshan has developed into a modern city
with an industrial output value of 73.9 billion yuan (about 8.8
billion US dollars) last year, which is 10.9 times the 1975 figure.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that Tangshan now has a urban population of
1.5 million, up from 1.1 million before the quake.
</P>
<P>
Activities planned for the anniversary include a commemorative
meeting attended by people from both at home and abroad, an
investment and trade fair, and an exhibition of Tangshan's
achievements since the earthquake.

SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The total population in the
Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and trade district
separated from downtown Shanghai by the Huangpu River, has been
expanding at an annual rate of 2.1 percent over the past five
years, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
The area's population stood at 1.4863 million at the end of
last year, up from 1.3394 million in 1990, when the area was
declared an open zone, a government release said.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the increase is mainly due to migrants from the
other side of the river, as well as from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis which excludes migrants, the local
population of the area has withnessed negative growth for three
consecutive years -- negative growth rates of 0.08 per thousand in
1993, 0.85 per thousand in 1994 and 1.81 per thousand last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- This, China's biggest industrial
city, achieved an industrial output value of 111.38 billion yuan
in the first quarter of 1996, an increase of 14.7 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value of state-owned enterprises grew
five percent, that of collectively-owned ones 8.9 percent, and
that of other enterprises by 24.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year the increase of output value
for Shanghai's heavy industries has outpaced that of light
industries.
</P>
<P>
The output value for heavy industries reached 61.03 billion
yuan in the first three months of this year, up 18.9 percent over

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Air China, the country's flag
carrier, and the Jianqiao Airport in the east China city of
Hangzhou have been selected as the Chinese airline and airport
that provided the best service in 1995 by air passengers.
</P>
<P>
This was found out through the random sampling of over 130,000
questionnaires given out to both Chinese and overseas air
passengers traveling in China in that year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 air carriers and 22 airports surveyed, Xiamen
Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, and China
Northern Airlines, and the airports in Shenzhen, Guilin, Harbin
and Nanjing ranked second to fifth among their respective
categories.
</P>
<P>
The answers showed that service under the circumstances of
flight delays and on-board entertainment were among the
unsatisfactory aspects of air travel in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The survey, an annual one which started in 1993, is part of
China's civil aviation authorities' efforts to improve the
country's air transport service.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Air China and China Eastern Airlines were chosen as
the two carriers providing the best service by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, and Jianqiao Airport in Hangzhou as the

<HEADLINE> Detergents Polluting China's Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Many of China's scenic lakes,
which attract millions of tourists a year, are becoming dirty and
smelly and choked with algae due to the discharge of waste water
containing huge amounts of domestic detergent sediment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese environmental officials blame pollution on the high
phosphate content in many synthetic powder and liquid detergents
being sold in China today.
</P>
<P>
"Waste water containing high contents of phosphate flow into
rivers and lakes through the urban sewage system," explained Xie
Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environment Protection.
</P>
<P>
The phosphate has caused many of China's beautiful lakes such
as Lake Dianchi in Kunming City, Lake Chaohu in Anhui Province,
Lake Taihu in Jiangsu Province, Lake Xuanwu in Nanjing City and
Lake Liuhua in Guangzhou City to spawn enormous amounts of tiny
water plants like algae, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the lakes increasingly choked with algae and depletion of
oxygen in the water, these microscopic forms of organic life that
drift in or float on the water of the lakes die and rot in large
amounts," he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, Xie noted, Lake Dianchi is now so choked with
organic water plants that the water has become turbid and
smelly. "The inhabitants living in nearby Kunming can no longer
rely on the lake for drinking water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen an outbreak of blue algae in Lake Taihu,
which is surrounded by the cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou
and Wuxi. "The dark-green lake water emits a bad smell," he said,
adding, "It could also have a bad impact on the economic
development of this prosperous area."
</P>
<P>
Chinese local governments have shown great concern about these
pollution problems, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The Yunnan provincial government plans to spend three billion
yuan (about 360 million US dollars) in 18 years to clean Lake
Dianchi," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environment Protection has proposed
limiting the production of detergent containing phosphate.

<HEADLINE> County Official to Report Anti-Quake Achievement to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, Hebei, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A strong quake which
devastated Tangshan City in north China 20 years ago claimed more
than 240,000 lives, but no one died in the nearby county of
Qinglong.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhixin, deputy magistrate of Qinglong, is leaving for the
United Nations headquarters in New York Tuesday to spread the
county's experience in reducing losses during the disastrous quake.
</P>
<P>
Officials from 158 countries will attend the anti-quake
measures meeting.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the achievement to the combination of scientific
forecasting and administrative management.
</P>
<P>
In mid-July 1976, a dozen days before the earthquake which hit
Tangshan City on July 28, the State Seismological Bureau forecast
that there would be an earthquake of above five degrees on the
Richter scale in the near future in the area of Beijing, Tianjin,
Tangshan and Bohai Bay, and a quake of seven degrees was also
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Qinglong County government immediately spread the news
among the local residents, and helped them to put up anti-quake
shelters. Meanwhile, 11 observation stations were established in
the county to supervise the impending disaster.
</P>
<P>
In the tremors on July 28, 1978 thousands of buildings in the
county were damaged, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
During the Fourth UN World Conference on Women held in Beijing
last autumn UN officials paid a special two-day visit to Qinglong
and drew the conclusion that the county's experience was
worthwhile spreading to other countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Reform Medical Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
decided to expand the experiments with the medical insurance
system for workers to cover several dozen cities across the
country, State Councillor Peng Peiyun said today in Zhenjiang, in
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
So far, such experiments have been restricted to Zhenjiang and
Jiujiang, two medium-sized cities in Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces
respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to Peng, who was attending a national conference on
the reform of the workers' medical insurance system, the new
system will feature a combination of unified medicare funds with
individual medical accounts.
</P>
<P>
Since the new system was introduced in the two cities, Peng
said, the sources of medicare funds have become stable, the basic
medicare coverage for workers has improved and soaring medical
expenses have been put under control.
</P>
<P>
The reform is aimed at the sharing of medical expenses by the
society and individuals. In 1978 the national workers' medical
expenditure totalled 2.7 billion yuan. In 1994 this figure jumped
to 55.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many workers in township enterprises as well
as in foreign- and privately-funded enterprises are not guaranteed
medical insurance, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
here today that Europe should play a more active role in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, delivering a lecture at the Cairo University, said that
Europe should not only extend financial aid to the Palestinians,
but also should go further ahead toward reviving the regional
peace march by taking into consideration the interests of all
parties.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here Saturday on a three-day visit to
Egypt, said that 1996 should be a decisive year for the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to withdraw from the Syrian Golan Heights
and south Lebanon, adding that France is ready to contribute to
the peaceful settlements to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track of the peace process, the French
president said that a just peace would not be achieved unless the
Palestinian people's right to establish their independent state is
respected.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Israel and the Palestinians should conclude
a just agreement on the final status of the Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
"This could be done with the principle of land-for-peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The peace march is irreversible although it might slow down at
certain points," he said in the lecture, adding that it should not
stop halfway.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that the Middle East countries should work
toward economic integration, noting that Europe could help in this
respect through offering aid and modern technology.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, he called on Iraq to comply with all
resolutions related to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait so that the
U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed on the country can be
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Invest 1.1 Billion US Dollars in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The German company Siemens AG will
have injected a total of 1.1 billion US dollars in China by the
turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Hermann J. Koelle, president of Siemens
Ltd, China, during a recent four-day seminar on Siemens'
infrastructure construction in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year Siemens and its joint ventures in China made a total
of 1.3 billion US dollars-worth of sales in China. This figure is
expected to rise to as much as 1.8 billion US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s there is an enormous demand for infrastructure in
the entire Asia-Pacific region, especially in the sectors of
industry, telecommunications, energy, transportation and health
care. This has caused Siemens to shift its investment focus from
North America to Asia, the seminar was told.
</P>
<P>
Siemens' strategy for the Asia-Pacific region ultimately
depends on local commitment, that is, investing directly in joint
ventures.
</P>
<P>
The local presence has to be far more than just providing
products. It means satisfying other national expectations and
needs. Partnership is essential for sustaining a strong presence
in the region that has a truly global impact, noted Hermann
J. Koelle.
</P>
<P>
Siemens has so far set up 35 joint ventures throughout China,
11 of which are located in Shanghai, China's largest city, which
is expected to become Siemens' biggest location outside Europe.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 Siemens plans to employ 30,000 people in its
various organizations in China, about 5,000 of whom will be in
east China.
</P>
<P>
It will expand its market share in China's central and western
areas by pouring more investment into areas along the Yangtze
River valley. And it will invest another 200 billion Deutschemarks
to join the Chengdu Dongfang Group in southwest China's Sichuan
Province to set up electricity-generating plants.
</P>
<P>
It will also transfer its latest technologies to China, and
further increase co-operation with China in the fields of
industry, telecommunications, energy, information technology,
transportation, health care, engineering components and lighting.

The state-owned Tehran Radio reported that Rafsanjani stressed
during his meeting with Nzo that the two countries had to exchange
delegations to assess ways and means of cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani added that Iran was ready "with a humanitarian aim"
to cooperate with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said that South Africa could learn from Iran's "valuable
experience in fighting drug smuggling and eliminating deprivation
in the villages and deprived areas."
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, Nzo held his first round of talks with
his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed the expansion of ties in political,
economic, commercial and technical areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, Nzo stated that South Africa
will take part in the inauguration of Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan
railroad scheduled to open in mid May.

Iran reestablished ties with South Africa after the dissolution
of the Apartheid. Relations between Tehran and Pretoria have
remained friendly despite U.S. pressure on South African president
Nelson Mandela to limit or sever ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said that his government
had no wish to become involved in the USA's "infighting" with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The South African government signed an agreement with the
Iranian government at the end of last August to store Iranian oil
in the Saldanha Bay facilities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for storage of some 15 million barrels
of crude in Saldanha Bay and the establishment of a joint
marketing company to sell the crude outside Iran's traditional
markets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
South African government officials estimate that the deal could
earn their country around 14 million U.S. dollar annually.

<HEADLINE> Factional Fighting In Liberia Dies Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETWON, April 8 (Xinhua) - - Serious factional fighting in
Liberia has died down early Easter Monday after two days of
rampage, rioting and deaths, Monrovia Radio reported in a
broadcast monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The radio said up to 20 people might have died and that they
were mainly civilians caught in crossfire.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, the worst in three years after the west African
peace keeping force intervened to stop ethnic fightings, began
last Saturday after an attempt to arrest one of the factional
leaders, Roosevelt Johnson of ULIMO J failed.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was jointly signed by two members of the
Liberian Council of State, Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kroma. Both
men also are leaders of factional groups, the National Patriotic
Front of Liberia (NPFL) and ULIMO-K.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fighting, between 10,000 and 15,000 civilians
deserted their homes in the capital and sought refuge in the
residence of United States embassy staff at Greystone Compound.
</P>
<P>
According to a staff of the Liberian News Agency,
''ECOMOG (the West African Peace Keeping Force) did not
intervene to stop the fighting. This is strange because
Liberians have always looked on them for security.''
</P>
<P>
He said that (last night), Alhaji Kroma made a ''passionate
appeal '' for an end to the fighting ''but many felt it came too
late as the capital is now at the topsy turvy stage.''
</P>
<P>
About 90 members of the United Nations Peace Monitoring
Mission (UNIMIL) also took refuge at the Greystone Area when
armed gangs ransacked their residence.

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
met here this afternoon with Algerian Minister of Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises Abdelkader Hamitou, and they exchanged
views on issues of mutual concern, including bilateral economic
and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Algeria enjoy long-term friendly
relations in politics, economy and culture, Li said he believed
that Hamitou's current visit to China is bound to push forward
bilateral economic and trade co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Hamitou said that Algeria is marching toward a market economy
and is ready to strengthen co-operation with the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his visit is aimed at learning from the Chinese
experience and exploring possibilities for furthering bilateral
economic and trade co-operation, in a bid to promote the bilateral
co-operative partnership.
</P>
<P>
Minister Wu Yi of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
(MOFTEC) met with Hamitou and his party here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China and Algeria, as developing
countries, are faced with the same tasks of reform and opening up,
and their economies are complementary to a certain extent.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is rich in natural resources, and China has a fairly
complete industrial system, so the two countries can further their
co-operation, particularly between their small and medium-sized
enterprises, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, MOFTEC Vice-Minister Shi Guangsheng held talks
with Hamitou this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hamitou and his party arrived here Sunday at the invitation of
MOFTEC. They are also scheduled to visit Shanghai, Shenzhen and

<HEADLINE> Pilgrimages to Sacred Lake Leads to Wealth for Lobsang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Growing numbers of pilgrims and
tourists to Lhamlaco Lake in Tibet have brought wealth to local
residents, and villager Lobsang is among the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The lake is located in Cyaca County, in southern Tibet, where
the Second Dalai Lama used to live in the 16th century. He built
the Qunkorgai Monastery which belongs to the Gelupa Sect of
Tibetan Buddhism, and made the Lhamlaco a sacred lake.
</P>
<P>
Lobsang, who served in the army, sensed in the early 1990s that
tourism would bring about changes to his hometown. He was more
broad-minded than his hometown folks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, the lake has become more famous
for its mystical, and sacred role in helping search for the
reincarnated Child of the 10th Panchen Lama who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Lake observation has been an important ceremony in the forecast
of the reincarnation of a Dalai Lama or Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Since he left the army in 1976, Lobsang had been working at a
trading company, and then the department of commerce in the county
town of Cyaca.
</P>
<P>
During that period, he went to many of China's inland cities
and witnessed the great changes since the country's reform and
opening to the outside world, and saw a lot of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Lobsang managed to buy a truck.
</P>
<P>
"From that time I noticed that more people went for pilgrimages
to the Qunkorgai Monastery and the Lhamlaco Lake, and tourism
began booming," he said, adding, "The secluded mountain village
would be drawn closer and closer to the outside."
</P>
<P>
Lobsang resigned his governmental job at the department of
commerce, and was engaged in transporting people and goods to the
sacred lake.
</P>
<P>
"I was confident that with good policies from the government, I
could make more money through my own labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also gave up his comfortable life in the county town in
1992, and moved to a flat patch of wasteland along the road to the
sacred lake, where he built a new house, cultivated the wasteland
and planted trees. A small village with a dozen homes have already
emerged nearby.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he went to the lake for more than 80 times, and
earned more than 50,000 yuan (about 6,000 US dollars), a
considerable sum for a local resident.
</P>
<P>
With a score of domestic animals, 4,000 kg of grain production
each year, and a roadside store, Lobsang and his family are
leading a fairly wealthy life.
</P>
<P>
But Lobsang is not satisfied, he plans to buy another truck and
go in for more transportation work.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Build Steel Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia will build a big
steel plant in the Gulf port of Jubail of the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Voest Alpine Industrienlagenbau has won a 3.3
billion riyal (880 million U.S. dollars) contract to build the
steel mill for the Saudi Basic Industries Corp, or Sabic.
</P>
<P>
Sabic Managing Director Ibrahim Ibn Salamah was quoted by
today's Gulf News based here that the steel mill is scheduled
to come on stream in 1999 with a capacity of 850,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The new mill will be run by Saudi Iron and Steel Company, or
Hadded, a wholly-owned unit of Sabic.
</P>
<P>
It will produce hot and cold rolled and galvanized steel used
in manufacturing pipes, steel framing, prefabricated houses and
steel furniture.
</P>
<P>
Hadded, which is currently producing 2.4 million tons of steel
products a year, plans to increase its output to 4 million tons,
Salamah said.
</P>
<P>
Hadded exported 790,000 tons of steel in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sabic, the largest producer of petrochemicals in the Middle
East, also produces about 2.6 million tons of steel and metals
every year at its plants.
</P>
<P>
Sabic operates 16 industrial plants in saudi Arabia. Ten of
these are joint ventures with American, European, Japanese and
South Korean firms.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government owns 70 percent of Sabic and the rest is
owned by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) investors.

<HEADLINE> Some Clubs Oppose New Transfer System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Several German soccer clubs are
opposing a recent motion from the national federation Dfb on a new
transfer system and foreign player regulations, reports said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Dfb's league commission had last week set up a motion to
halve domestic transfer fees next season before doing away with
them from the 1997-98 campaign on. It also recommended allowing an
unlimited number of players in each team from the 49 Uefa members,
but only three from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The changes, which have to be passed on Tuesday's meeting of
all 36 German Professional culbs and then April 27 by the Dfb's
board, come in the wake of a European Court of Justice ruling in
December which outlawed foreign player restrictions within the Eu
and transfer fees for out of contract players who wanted to move
from one Eu country to another.
</P>
<P>
The Dfb took the ruling a step further by extending it to all
Uefa members, but some clubs, such as Karlsruhe and Duesseldorf,
said the two-step transfer change wasn't enough.

HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of mobile telephone

<HEADLINE> India's Steel Imports Go Up sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- India's steel imports touched a
record high of 2.36 million tons during 1995 due to a strong
demand for alloy, marking a 41 percent growth since the cut in
import duties began in July 1992, The Financial Express reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The imports went up sharply despite substantial increase in
steel production and supply nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to the Financial Express report, India's steel
production rose by 25 percent from 13.5 million tons in 1991 to
nearly 21 million tons last year. Exports, meanwhile, started to
drop, adding to domestic supplies.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the apparently unsatiable hunger for
steel within the country indicates a tremendous rise in the use of
alloy by the construction and manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Market observers said steel consumption or demand, in fact,
rose by 11 percent last year, close on the heels of an 11.7
percent growth in industrial production.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Act On Jobs For Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es Salaam, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Moves are taking in
Tanzania to revitalise the 1982 employment act to have more
disabled people absorbed in employment oppotunities, the
Tanzanian Minister for Labor and Youth Development has said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister for Labour and Youth Development, Sebastian
Kinyondo, said at a press conference at the weekend that steps to
implement the 14 year old piece of legislation are long overdue
and the government will initiate measures to have it translated
into action.
</P>
<P>
The 1982 employment (disabled persons) act requires that any
employer with more than 50 workers must ensure that at least two
percent of them are recruited from among the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Most employers neglect the act for reasons of lax enforcement.
Kinyondo outlined measures that the government will take to
bring greater compliance from employers.
</P>
<P>
"Disabled persons are human beings just like the rest of us.
Just being differently abled does not mean they cannot do work
which does not involve some of their weaker or impaired organs,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the act will be reviewed and if needed be
transferred to the labour division, the minister said.
" Tanzanians should be assured that we are committed to increasing
employment opportunities not only to the abled but even to the
disabled as the law provides," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Problem of Surplus Rural Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Although south China's Guangdong
Province has taken in nearly ten million workers from across the
country, it has more than four million surplus laborers in its own
rural regions.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1995, more than 12 million rural people in
Guangdong had moved to urban areas and got jobs there.
Statistics showed that the province's rural labor force
stood at 25 million last year, with 9.6 million employed in
non-farming sectors and more than four million being surplus.
</P>
<P>
The increase of farming productivity, and the loss of arable
land are blamed for the rise in the surplus labor.
</P>
<P>
Workers looking for jobs 'on spec', and an unorganized flow of
labor has also contributed a lot to the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, last year only eight percent of the
labor flow was organized by the government, and more than 90
percent of jobseekers were self-sponsored, which gave rise to the
problems of management, social security, and an unreasonable
distribution of labor resources.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the situation, the province is trying to establish
an efficient labor flow system, including establishing and
perfecting labor markets and labor information system, and
realizing rural labor inter-flow among different regions.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Improved Oil Earnings In First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria registered improved oil
earnings in the first three months this year with the federal
government's budget moving towards meeting its projected 19
billion Naira (223.5 million U.S. Dollars) surplus.
</P>
<P>
But the figure for the nation's oil earnings in the January-
March period is not yet available at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's 1996 budget, which was released on February 15, aims
at earning 214 billion Naira (2.52 billion U.S. Dollars) from
oil, the nation's major source of revenue, Daily Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 13 billion Naira higher than last year's
estimate of 201 billion Naira (2.36 billion u.s. dollars), and
the predicted oil earnings are made at the basis of oil sales at
16 U.S. Dollars per barrel, compared with the 15-dollar base last
year.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil revene, meanwhile, is projected at 126 billion Naira
(1.48 billion U.S.Dollars), according to the budget.

<P>
COLOMBO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga today declared a nationwide state of emergency
following intelligence reports of possible islandwide chaos during
the current festival Sinhala and Hindu New Year from April 12 to
14.
</P>
<P>
Earlier only the trouble-ridden North and East was under
Emergency Regulations in order to contain the Tamil rebel
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have waged a 13-year
war for a separate state, during which over 50,000 persons have
been killed.
</P>
<P>
More recently the Tamil rebels attacked strategic positions in
the country's capital, Colombo, and are reported to be targeting
key installations and VIPs here.
</P>
<P>
Several caches of arms and ammunition have been discovered in
safe houses and other places in Colombo and security forces
believe that more attacks in Colombo are inevitable, security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The emergency has been declared by President Chandrika as a
precautionary measure, said the sources, adding that more
authority is essential particularly during this period to prevent
any militant activity by the rebels.

<HEADLINE> New Breakthrough of China's Telecom Network Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A large telecommunications
network, developed by Chinese scientists, has passed its final
appraisal in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a technical advantage in the country, the network will
sharpen China's competitive edge on the domestic telecom network
marketplace, which is currently dominated by foreign products,
according to "China Electronics News".
</P>
<P>
As a breakthrough in China's development of a large
telecommunications web, the network, designed by a research
institute with the Ministry of Electronics Industry, enjoys a high
flexibility and safety, and is suited for various terrains. It is
expected that its development will kick off an ambitious march
toward overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Adopting the rubidium atomic clock, the network is noted for
its extraordinary stability, and can rectify any mistakes in data
information transmission, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> China's Old Want Simple Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of old people in a
Chinese city have joined forces to have a say about their lives in
the "next world".
</P>
<P>
They have called for a halt on feudal and superstitious
conventions surrounding funerals. Instead the elderly people, aged
between 60 and 90, want simplified cremation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Over 800 senior residents of Wenzhou, a city in east China's
Zhejiang Province, solicited the support of their contemporaries
to promote simplified funerals.
</P>
<P>
With China's rapid economic development and the improvement of
people's living standards in recent years, tomb building has again
become a fad in the country, especially in rural areas, where
traditional concepts play a bigger role in social life than in
cities.
</P>
<P>
More and more land is becoming swallowed up by cemeteries,
especially in some economically developed areas, such as Zhejiang,
where the farmland area per head was only 0.03 ha.
</P>
<P>
There are 890,000 tombs in Wenzhou alone, a city renowned for
producing shrewd and successful businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Some families have even built tombs for three generations,
although all family members, from the grandfather to the grandson,
are still alive. And the tombs are becoming larger and costlier.
</P>
<P>
The 800-plus senior citizens of Wenzhou said the tombs not only
use up the precious farmland, but undermine social morals by
wasting large amount of money, and helping spread feudal and
superstitious conventions.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has also held a special conference to
address the problem. One decision of the conference was a new
regulation that tombs within a certain distance of railways,
national and provincial highways, and those in tourist spots, and
economic development zones, should be moved in the next couple of
months.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Curb Purchase of Imported Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is working on
details of tougher restrictions on the purchase of imported cars
in a bid to ease the country's spiraling current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai News Agency today, the Finance Ministry
will consult with the Central Bank later this month on concrete
measures to raise minimum down payments for new cars purchased on
monthly installments.
</P>
<P>
The minimum down payments will be 25 percent for vehicles worth
below 400,000 baht (16,000 US dollars), 30 percent for those worth
400,000-600,000 baht (16,000-24,000 dollars), 50 percent for those
worth 600,000-1,000,000 baht (24,000-40,000 dollars), Deputy
Finance Minister Newin Chidchod said today.
</P>
<P>
But people must pay cashes if they want to buy vehicles worth
more than one million baht (40,000 dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, people usually pay a sum of deposit through
bargaining with car agents before they buy a new car worth around
400,000 baht (16,000 dollars) in Thailand. The deposit remains at
80,000 baht (3,200 dollars) and buyers may take up to 60 months to
pay off the balance.

audit program" which has been introduced since 1993 to enhance the
efficiency of air-conditioning, lighting and other electrical
installations in selected public buildings.
</P>

Saving has been achieved through resetting room temperature to
higher values in summer, switching off lights and air-conditioning
during period of non-uses and re-scheduling the operation of
chiller plants and some other methods.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the energy saving measures now in place in 21
public buildings will result in an additional saving of 1.2
million HK dollars (153,800 US dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> mee040805hke-- Peres: Iran Aims to Unseat Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said Sunday that Iran stands behind terror attacks, because
it hopes that in this way it can bring down the Israeli Labor
government and derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post published today, Peres
said Iran is trying to "unseat a government of peace because it
wants to unseat peace."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, has conducted a
series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel since February 25,
which killed at least 60 people and wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these attacks, Peres and his Labor Party lost a
20 percent lead in public polls over the opposition party, the
Likud, and its leader Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"I have 100 percent evidence that the attacks are designed to
drive the Labor Party from power," said Peres. "We have evidence
they (the Iranians) are pressing Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and
other subversive organizations to act against Israel before the
elections."
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to reveal the evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli general elections are due to take place on May
29. Israeli political parties, which will run for the 120 seats in
the Knesset (Israel's parliament), had already started their
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Sunday to the Labor Party convention, Peres also noted
the recent discovery of an Iranian ship on its way to Hamburg,
Germany, carrying explosives which he said were probably intended
for attacks on Jewish targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Menasheri of Tel Aviv University's Dayan
Center for Middle East Studies said there is no question that Iran
is seeking to undermine the peace process, but Tehran is also
aware of its limitations.
</P>
<P>
Menasheri said Iran believes its influence is marginal in
changing the direction of the peace process, but this does not
mean that it does not want to try.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he does not feel capable of judging whether
Iran thinks that if Labor loses power, this would mean the end of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Likud has accused Peres of incitement in his
contention that Iran is seeking to replace his government,
presumably by seeking to put Likud in power instead.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the Jerusalem Post, Peres did not
mention Likud in this context.
</P>
<P>
He did mention the opposition party when he charged that if
elected, the Likud would embark upon a program of expanding
settlements due to elements within the party and due to the
influence of the settlement movement.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing they will have to do is renew the settlement
policy in the West Bank, which in my judgment will mean the end
of peace and the end of the hope for peace.," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his insistence that the Labor Party would not
dismantle settlements nor increase them.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Linking Eastern and Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- It is a Chinese city where east
meets west, where ancient and modern meet side by side.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, a key hub in central China, is on the dawn of the 21st
century with a changing skyline of high-rises and skyscraper
office blocks.
</P>
<P>
The city is seen by economists as a bridge between economically
developed eastern China and the country's comparatively backward
western half.
</P>
<P>
The distance between Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, and
Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Beijing, four major Chinese
cities, is about 1,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The city is also at an intersection where the Beijing-Guangzhou
Railway, running from north to south, meets the Yangtze River
which flows from west to east.
</P>
<P>
These factors together have helped Wuhan to become one of the
10 most economically developed Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
China, shifting its priority of economic development and
opening-up from its eastern coast to the Yangtze River Valley,
named Wuhan an open city in the summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Mayor Zhao Baojiang said the city's gross domestic
product - all the goods and services produced - has scored an
average annual growth of 16 percent over the past five years,
higher than the national average in the same period.
</P>
<P>
In that period the city collected a total revenue of 22.1
billion yuan, and invested 75.7 billion yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city also exported 2.86 billion US dollars worth of goods
in the five years (1991-1995), he added.
</P>
<P>
The economic development of the city is shown through its
architecture. Ancient Wuhan, which has a history dating back
centuries, now has over 100 buildings of 30 stories or more in
height.
</P>
<P>
The Donghu New Technology Development Zone, with companies
working in fields such as telecommunications, biology engineering,
laser technology and computer science, is now the second largest
of its kind in China, following Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An automobile plant involving a total investment of over 10.3
billion yuan from France's Citroen, and the Dongfeng Automobile
Enterprise Group of China, has already started its production line.
</P>
<P>
The plant, designed to produce 600,000 automobiles annually in
five years, will be China's largest automobile producing center by
then.
</P>
<P>
Many other overseas companies have followed the road to Wuhan,
after the example set by Citroen.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one of the world's 500 largest companies so far have
invested in the city, and 85 others have explored the city's
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 Wuhan had approved 3,537 foreign funded
projects, 459 of which involve investments of over five million US
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The city, making use of 2.84 billion dollars of overseas
investment so far, attracted more foreign investment than any
other inland Chinese city during the past three years, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises, recognizing Wuhan's importance, have
opened over 1,000 agencies in the city so far.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan Economic Cooperative Zone, embracing 17 cities in
Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi provinces when first founded in the late
1980s, now involves 25 cities in the three provinces as well as
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
It has a total area of 300,000 sq km, and a combined population
of 110 million.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the zone has helped to establish 118
enterprise groups, and increased the area's output value by over
two billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Property Development to Remain Dull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for the property
development industry in Thailand will continue to be dull in 1996,
according to property analysts.
</P>
<P>
They said a number of adverse factors would persist, including
cut-throat competition and increasing construction costs,
particularly labor costs, and described the continued rein of the
Bank of Thailand on loans as the last straw.
</P>
<P>
The fierce competition and the high costs will narrow the
margin while the rein on loans will eliminate many smaller
developers as they are unable to secure funding, said the
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Even though declining interest rates have improved the mood in
the sector, canny investors realize the effect on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
The sector of the property development in Thailand was not only
shunned by local investors, but also underweighed by foreign
institutions, whose investment fell from 6.47 percent in January
to 5.83 percent in the first half of February.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese FM Leaves Nepal After Refugee Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bhutanese Foreign Minister Dawa
Tshering left here for home today after the seventh round of
Nepal-Bhutan talks failed to make any breakthrough on the issue of
Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The fruitless four-day bilateral talks made it clear that the
six-year-old controversial refugee issue between Bhutan and Nepal
could hardly be settled in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Although both sides expressed the hope for an early solution to
the problem, Tshering and his Nepali counterpart Prakash Chandra
Lohani did not hold further discussions on the repatriation of
nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Nepali side presented a document
reiterating its stance on the issue to the Bhutanese delegation.
</P>
<P>
Six earlier rounds of bilateral talks in the last three years
had made no progress in the solution of the refugee problem, which
was triggered when the Bhutanese authorities adopted a "one nation
one people" policy six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Bhutanese citizens of the Nepali
origin have flooded into Nepal via India since then and settled in
eight refugee camps in eastern Nepal, causing much headache to the
Nepali government with social and security problems.
</P>
<P>
According to a press communique jointly issued before the
departure of the Bhutanese foreign minister, the two sides agreed
to hold the next round of talks on the issue in Thimbu, capital of
Bhutan, with the date to be set later.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi said in Beijing today that China is

</P>
<P>
The minister said that China and Algeria, both as developing
countries, are faced with the same task of reforms and opening up,
and their economies are complementary to a certain extent.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is rich in natural resources, and China has a complete
industrial system, and the two countries can strengthen their
co-operation, particularly between their small and medium-sized
enterprises, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
Hamitou said that the purpose of the visit of his
delegation to China is to explore possibilities for further
co-operation to upgrade the partnership between the two countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Scientists Probe Eco-System in Three Gorges Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- After three years of research
work, 100 Chinese scientists have succeeded in providing complete
information about environmental protection in Three Gorges Dam
area.
</P>
<P>
The dam project, the largest in the world, will flood local
farming land, and lead to the relocation of more than one million
people.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 scientists from Nanjing Institute of Soil Science,
under the Chineses Academy of Sciences, have conducted several
field research projects into eco-systems related to agriculture,
forestry and animal husbandry, the reform of farming systems,
transformation of low-yield fields, and optimum distribution of
plant resources.
</P>
<P>
New techniques were tested in pilot areas in Yichang, Wanxian
and Chongqing, using the research results, and it yielded more
than 12 million yuan worth of increased economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Before the project started, the Chinese Cultural Relics
Institute conducted an overall survey of the cultural relics in
the dam area.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they found that the number of cultural relics is
12 times more than the number known before the survey was
conducted. Local authorities have accepted their suggestions about
the protection of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Recently a key state-level project for the environment and
eco-system in the dam area, chaired by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, passed appraisal. It is expected to help build the area
into a scenic, as well as economically developed area.

<HEADLINE> mee040804hke-- South African Foreign Minister Visits Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo arrived here this morning to discuss bilateral ties
with Iranian officials and to inaugurate the Pretoria's embassy
here.
</P>
<P>
Nzo was welcomed at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport by
his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's state-run
Tehran Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Nzo said that during his trip he will discuss
ways for promotion of the level of commercial and industrial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who visited Iran in November 1994, is on a second visit to
Tehran. During his current three-day visit, Nzo would inaugurate
the South African Embassy.
</P>
<P>
However, the radio did not specify when the embassy would
open, but the national papers here reported that the South African
Embassy would be inaugurated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Velayati was quoted as saying that during Nzo's trip Tehran-
Pretoria ties would be discussed and the two sides will discuss
ways for exchanging different delegations.
</P>
<P>
He said that both countries have had excellent cooperation at
the international scene, especially within the framework of Non-
Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted that after the Islamic Revolution of 1979,
Iran's foreign policy put more emphasis on relations with African
countries, including South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Iran reestablished ties with South Africa after it abolished
the apartheid system. Relations between Tehran and Pretoria have
remained friendly despite U.S. pressure on South African President
Nelson Mandela to limit or sever ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. opposition, the South African government signed an
agreement with the Iranian government at the end of last August on
storing some 15 million barrels of Iranian crude oil in the
Saldanha Bay and establishing a joint marketing company to sell
the crude outside Iran's traditional markets in Europe.
</P>
<P>
South African government officials estimate that the deal could
earn their country around 14 million U.S. dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> Robocop Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Robocop has become a reality,
after Chinese scientists developed a robot that can pursue hidden
gunmen, scientists here said today.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech policemen, developed as part of a ten-billion yuan
robot program in China is so advanced that it can perform many
dangerous fetes.
</P>
<P>
China's 'Robocop' can move or destroy dangerous explosives,
retrieve poisonous or harmful materials, and help real-life cops
pursue hidden gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese robots can climb walls, work at depths of 6,000
meters under the sea, and mini-sized micro-robots that can work in
tiny tubes.
</P>
<P>
Other robots can perform mundane duties like fruit picking, and
whitewashing walls.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Xinsong, chief scientist of automation research field
under 863 Plan, the country's hi-tech research and development
program, said China has developed underwater robots, robots for
nuclear industry, robots for danger-elimination, micro robots,
wall-climbing robots.
</P>
<P>
Robots that can move within tube, fruit-plucking robots and
whitewashing robots have also been developed.
</P>
<P>
The robot development is part of the 863 Plan , a 15 year
hi-tech research and development program launched in 1986 with a
total investment of 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the underwater robot, a product of Sino-Russian
cooperation, will be mainly used to conduct surveys of manganese
nodules in the world's deep sea ocean beds.
</P>
<P>
The robot provides an advanced instrument for China to mine the
sea in the next century, the scientist said in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At present, only the United States, Japan, Russia and China are
capable of producing robots.
</P>
<P>
An advanced robot has been developed that can move explosives,
or poisonous or harmful materials, destroy explosives or help
policemen pursue hidden gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the 863 Plan, Chinese scientists also developed two
kinds of wall-climbing robots, which could be used in many
industries, including nuclear industry, construction and
ship-building.
</P>
<P>
The robots have already been used for examination in nuclear
industry and oil tanks, and wall-washing for high-rises.
</P>
<P>
Robots have been used for car and electronics production and
precision assembly in China, involving the No. 1 Automobile Group,
Panda Electronics Group and Peony Electronics Group.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six robots are expected to be installed by the end of
year, which will push the output of the company's VCRs to 300,000
units from 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refrains from Comment on Turkey's Denial of Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Israeli
Defense Ministry have reportedly kept silent about Turkey's denial
that it had agreed to let Israel Air Force pilots train in its
airspace and use its bases.
</P>
<P>
The ministry would only confirm that both countries had agreed
in February to hold joint maneuvers and training exercises.
</P>
<P>
Officials would not elaborate, citing what they term "Turkish
sensitivities." Syria, Iran and Egypt have condemned the reported
cooperation between the Jewish state and an Islamic nation.
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to give many details or see much press about it
since it angers the Iranians and Syrians, and that embarrasses
the Turks," one defense official was quoted as saying in the
local press today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very dangerous matter which is relevant to the
security in the region," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Sunday, adding that Egypt would not "allow the balance of
security to be shifted for the sake of one party."
</P>
<P>
According to Ha'aretz, a Tel Aviv-based Hebrew daily, the
Israeli and Turkish air forces would conduct flight exercises in
each other's country eight times a year. It also quoted a top
Turkish official as saying that Turkey would give Israeli military
planes sanctuary in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will also allow Israel to gather intelligence
information on Syria and Iran from inside Turkey, Ha'aretz
said. In turn, Israel will help Turkey organize border control
along its frontiers with Turkey and Iran.
</P>
<P>
But in Ankara, Turkish Defense Minister Oltan Sungurlu said
his country had not opened its airspace and military bases to the
Israel Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Sungurlu said Turkey and Israel had no accord for training of
Israeli pilots in Turkey, adding that the February deal proposed
an exchange of knowledge and experience in the field of military
training.
</P>
<P>
However, Sungurlu told the English-language Turkish Daily News
last Thursday that Israel's airspace was too narrow for air force
training and that the Israeli Air Force planes would be allowed to
use the Turkish airspace and bases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Desert Farmers Beat Drifting Sands to Save Their Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in northwest China have
won the battle against a desert that threatened to engulf
their entire village.
</P>
<P>
The drifting sands once seemed able to swallow up Lijihaizi
Village at any minute in the early 1980s. Now the desert is kept
one kilometer away from the village.
</P>
<P>
And the success has provided a double bonus for the villagers
-- their annual incomes have also gone up.
</P>
<P>
People in the village, in Yanchi County, northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, are earning more after beating the
desert which threatened their homes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years farmers treated over 67,000 hectares
of sandy wasteland in the county, and succeeded in increasing the
county's annual grain output by 27 percent, while its acreage of
farmland was reduced by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The areas planted with trees in the county, one of the 20 in
the country which suffer most from desertification, was increased
to 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yanchi, on the edge of the Muus Desert, had 359,000 ha of sandy
waste in 1983. The wasteland, which took up 60 percent of the
county's total area, accounted for 21 percent of all the desert in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Desert treatment, financed by the central government, first
started in the county in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The treatment has raised the per-capita net income of the
farmers in Yanchi from 322 yuan in 1990, to 500 yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Lijihaizi village has planted about 267
ha of shrubs, and over 67 ha of grass for livestock.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the net income per head of villagers topped 1,000
yuan in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Potato Virus Indentified In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A disastrous virou affecting
sweet potato has been indentified in Uganda, said an announcement
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, issued by the Natural Resources Institute in
the United Kingdom based at Namulonge Research Institute, said
the white fly borne virus known as " closterovirus" destroys the
vein system of the sweet potato leaves, making them dry instantly.
</P>
<P>
The virus was first discovered in Israel in 1994. It was
identified in Uganda in February this year at Namulonge
Agricultural and Animal Production Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The researchers were quoted as saying that when the virus
attacks the sweet potato it limits its growth and does not allow
it to mature.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, however, said the virus was not related to
the cassava mosaic, adding that closterovirus group is related to
sweet potato sunken vein virus first identified in Israel.

Vladimir Senko to China would further promote the development of

</P>
<P>
Jiang met Senko here this morning. Recalling Belarussian

<HEADLINE> hke040817 --Malaysia Expects More Economic Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Malaysian official
today predicted that economic cooperation between Malaysia and
China would greatly increase after Malaysia amends its 1989
Banking and Financial Institutions Act (BAFIA).
</P>
<P>
"The new amended law will allow banks to operate in both
countries within this year," Deputy Minister of International
Trade and Industry Kerk Choo Ting said when officiating at a
three-day conference on the infrastructure development in China.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister Wong See Wah announced last week that
the government had approved the amendments to BAFIA last month and
would present them to the current parliament session.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, foreign-owned licensed banking or other
financial institutions can now operate in Malaysia after being
approved by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the BAFIA are expected to pave the way for the Bank
of China to conduct operations in Malaysia to facilitate trade
between Chinese and Malaysian investors.
</P>
<P>
The current act formalized in law the policy that all branches
of foreign banks operating in Malaysia are required to be
incorporated locally.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing act, branches of foreign banks have been
given a transitional period of five years to locally incorporate
in order to continue their banking business in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Kerk said Malaysia could assist China in the development of its
infrastructure and build-operate-transfer projects.
</P>
<P>
"With the projected eight-percent annual growth of the gross
national product (GNP) for 1996-2000 as outlined in China's Ninth
Five-Year plan, China would be a promising land for trade and
investment," Kerk said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Malaysian businessmen and investors to seize the
opportunity to move into China.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations between China and Malaysia have developed
rapidly in the past few years, with the bilateral trade volume
amounting to 8.44 billion Malaysian ringgit (about 3.4 billion US
dollars) in 1995.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that it

After visiting Fijian Deputy Prime Minister Ratu Timoci
Vesikula called on him at his office here today, the Malaysian

Ratu Timoci Vesikula, who is also Fijian agricultural and
forestry minister, arrived here Saturday on a four-day visit to

<TEXT>
<P>
And the labor service enterprises, as part of the small
enterprises set up in the late 1970s to absorb the returned youth
sent to the countryside in the "Cultural Revolution" (1968-1978),
are still able to play an important role in the next few years, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 16 years of reform and opening up to the outside
world, the small enterprises have offered jobs to 22 million
people, accounting for 20 percent of the total employed at the
same period of time, statistics show. And the medium-sized
operations have taken in an estimated 40 percent of the total
laborers.
</P>
<P>
To spur the growth of the labor-intensive medium-sized and
small enterprises, the conference decided that the country should
set up special development funds, allocate specialized loans in
policy banks for them, and adopt tax reductions or exemptions
towards them in certain periods of time.
</P>
<P>
The state also plans to set up institutions and firms to
provide technical support and social services for the healthy
development of the enterprises, such as technical development,
information consultation, and legal, accounting and credit
services.
</P>
<P>
The government will also seek to solve the unemployment problem
by fully implementing the "re-employment project", and by various
social security systems.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to face a more grave unemployment situation
as its economic development will hardly generate enough jobs for
its ever increasing population in coming years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China is to turn to its growing
number of medium-sized and small enterprises to help ease
unemployment, as forecasts reveal over 130 million surplus
laborers by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
More than 12 million more young laborers will emerge by the
year 2,000 to add an extra strain on the country's job providers.
</P>
<P>
China's large state enterprises, trying to come to terms with
their own difficulties, will find it hard to absorb the massive
army of surplus labor, a national conference on employment in
Beijing has been told today.
</P>
<P>
But the conference concluded that growing medium-sized and
small enterprises could come to the rescue, as a key new channel
to ease the rising unemployment pressure, the conference was told.
</P>
<P>
The conference called for a series of measures to spur the
growth of these former minor sectors of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In response to worsening unemployment, and the establishment of
market mechanism, the conference decided that the former
job-assigning practices of the state shall be "completely
altered". It will mean that the state will no longer be fully
responsible for offering life-time jobs, and the major state
enterprises will not be solely relied upon for taking on new
workers in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The new laborers and surplus workers will be encouraged to use
their own initiatives to find employment under preferential
policies of the state, and medium-sized and small enterprises of
various kinds of ownership, which will be given new incentives to
shoulder more of the pressures of unemployment, according to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Labor Minister Li Boyong said that by the end of 2000,
an average of 12 million new workers will emerge, and 130 million
surplus rural laborers will be added to the labor market.
</P>
<P>
And in the next few years, major state enterprises, also
China's chief employer, with their own problems to solve, will
find it difficult to take on too many laborers, he said, adding
that, "their redundant workers will have to be diverted to other
economic sectors."
</P>
<P>
However, the medium-sized and small enterprises, which have
been widely expanding both geographically and numerically, because
of their rich flexibility and vitality, will have "tremendous
potential," he said.

HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Harare's Lake Chivero spilled on
Friday for the first time in the past nine years, much to the
relief of the city's water pressed residents, the local "Herald

</P>
<P>
Lake Chivero is the major source of drinking water for
Harare's metropolitan area, the home of almost a quarter of all
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
The pleasant sight of lake spills, however, is more or less
shadowed by the recent depressing reports about the appearance
of dead fish in and around the lake.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are still trying to unlock the puzzle of the
massive fish deaths, with preliminary results secured to indicate
that the discharge of sewage may be one of the causes.
</P>
<P>
Fishing permits have been withdrawn until a definite
conclusion on the deaths is reached, sources at the lake said.

<P>
HEFEI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners are to be given a chance
of a stake in the Chinese emperors' favorite tipple.
</P>
<P>
The Gujing Group, one of China's largest distilleries, is to
issue 60 million B shares, targeted at foreign investors in the

</P>
<P>
The group, based in east China's Anhui province, is famed for

China.
</P>
<P>
The issue will take place in Shenzhen Securities Exchange in

<HEADLINE> Jansher, Martin Win Singles Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Jansher Khan of Pakistan took his
fifth successive British Open title by beating Australian second
seed Rodney Eyles 15-13, 15-8, 15-10 in Cardiff on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's top-seeded Michelle Martin won her fourth
successive women's title with a 1-9, 9-5, 9-1, 9-7 defeat of
second-seeded compatriot Sarah FitzGerald.
</P>
<P>
Jansher had his work cut out against Eyles, who opened at a
furious pace, chasing every shot and carving his own shots to all
corners of the court.
</P>
<P>
The Australian sternly demanded the referee's backing for
access to the top corners and won a series of early penalty
strokes from the appeal referee.
</P>
<P>
Eyles, 28, moved from 7-5 down to 8-7 in the first game,
fought back from 11-8 down to 11-11, 12-12 and 13-13 but lost it
to a wonderfully delayed backhand drop shot nick and then, after
three heavily debated let calls, crashed a backhand crosscourt
volley into the tin.
</P>
<P>
Jansher knew the worst of the match was over and in the second
game his confidence and speed increased as he advanced from 5-5 to
14-6 in a single hand.
</P>
<P>
In the third game Eyles recovered from 6-1 down to trail
11-8. But the champion always seemed in control and finished
imperiously with a fearsome forehand straight kill into the back
corner.
</P>
<P>
It was Jansher's 21st win over Eyles against only one defeat
and kept him on course for his ambition of challenging the record
of compatriat Jahangir Khan, who won 10 British Opens.
</P>
<P>
In the women's final, FitzGerald blitzed to the first game in
just three hands and it seemed Martin's run in the world's
premier event might be over.
</P>
<P>
But the 28-year-old Sydney-based world champion, who lost to
FitzGerald twice in the Far East late last year, showed her
steely determination to take control.
</P>
<P>
Running around the court to shake herself up, she took a 4-0
lead in the second game and soon levelled the match.
</P>
<P>
The third game was deeply competitive even though Martin won
it in just nine minutes, and when she led 8-3 in the fourth, it
seemed to be all over.
</P>
<P>
But FitzGerald raised her pace again and struck a series of
wall-hugging, deep drives to peg the champion back to 8-7.
</P>
<P>
But at the vital moment, she pulled away from a volley on the
backhand, chose instead a defensive shot and hit the tin.
</P>
<P>
The decision gave Martin her third match ball and FitzGerald
broke her racket against the floor in fury.
</P>
<P>
After a short break to sort out a new racket, she survived two
more match balls but a penalty stroke decision on the final rally
sealed Martin's victory.

HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will give priority to
indigenous people when allocating tourism licences, hunting
concessions and the distribution of fishing permits, according to
Zimbabwean Minister of Environment and Tourism Chen

The minister told the "Herald Daily" at the weekeand that the

indigenous people, who enjoy only 86 of the current 261 permits.
</P>
<P>
To redress the imbalance, the government has reduced by one
third the permits taken by non-indigenous people, with a total of
36 permits retrieved for indigenous groups, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do this every year until we reach a level where the
indigenous people become dominant in the fishing industry," he
pledged.
</P>
<P>
The minister also indicated that Zimbabwe may have to consult
with Zambia on the issue since the two neighbouring countries
share Lake Kariba.

</P>
<P>
Renzo Furlan guided Italy into the semi-finals of the Davis Cup
on Sunday when he beat world number 10 Wayne Ferreira in Rome to
secure an unassailable 3-1 lead over the South Africans. Andrea
Gaudenzi later beat Marcos Ondruska to clinch a 4-1 win.
</P>
<P>
Continuing the roll which started with a surprise first round
victory over Russia, the Italians clinched the tie when Furlan
came from a set down to win 3-6, 6-0, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira failed to come to terms either with the clay court or
the partisan crowd at the Foro Italico whose whistling and
shouting earned their side several warnings.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira had started well, breaking Furlan in the fourth game
of the opening set for 3-1 before suffering a service break of his
own in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
He then broke back for a 5-3 lead, bringing up set point with a
scorching ace and then driving in a forehand which Furlan could
only balloon out of court.
</P>
<P>
But the matched tipped Furlan's way in the second set as
Ferreira lost his earlier concentration and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
Both men held service until the seventh game -- gifted to
Ferreira when Furlan double-faulted at break point for 4-3.
</P>
<P>
Unfazed, the Italian rallied superbly from 15-40 down to level
at 4-4 and then served out for 5-4, only for Ferreira to level at
5-5.
</P>
<P>
In the tiebreak, the South African rallied from 0-5 to 4-6 but
then netted a backhand lob.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira collapsed in the fourth set as Furlan accelerated into
a 4-0 lead, bowing out to a classic serve and volley from the
Italian.
</P>
<P>
France won through after Cedric Pioline and Guy Forget wrapped
up a 5-0 whitewash of a weakened German squad by winning their
reverse singles against Hendrik Dreekman and David Prinosil.
</P>
<P>
Pioline overcame Dreekman 6-4, 6-3 and Forget beat Prinosil
6-3, 0-6, 6-4 to book the French their date with the Italians.
</P>
<P>
The last minute inclusion in the crucial doubles of world
number five Boris Becker, suffering a viral infection, was not
enough to boost the Germans, as he and Goellner lost out to Forget
and Arnaud Boetsch 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) in 2 hours and 36

The unexpected large number of tourists from Hong Kong has
kept travel agencies in Chongqing on the banks of the Yangtze
River extremely busy. The Chongqing merchant travel agency alone
received over 300 Hong Kong tourists over the past two to three
days, according to Tang Changyi, a manager of the agency.

<HEADLINE> India Out to Contain Money Power in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission
Sunday ordered monitoring of the expenditure of every political
party or candidate in the ongoing election campaign to contain
money power in the polls, the Patriot reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three-member commission, which held two rounds of meetings
here over the weekend, issued separate directives to chief
electoral officers, political parties, the revenue authorities and
expenditure observers in the light of a Supreme Court judgment
last Thursday relating to poll expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court demanded that the expenditures of all
political parties in the current general elections be accountable.
</P>
<P>
India is going to the polls in late April and May to elect 543
members of the Lok Sabha (Lower House) and more than 900 seats in
six state assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has asked all the political parties to
submit for scrutiny not later than July 31 details of their
expenditure from March 19, when the election schedules were
announced, to the end of the elections.
</P>
<P>
It also directed the revenue authorities to furnish by April 22
details of the income tax returns filed by recognized national and
state level parties.

<HEADLINE> Search Efforts Continue in Ecuador After Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quito, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorean rescuers Sunday continued
to search for victims of an avalanche that killed at least eight
people and injured nine others near the top of a volcanically
active mountain.
</P>
<P>
Several people appeared to be still buried beneath tons of snow
that crashed down on a covered tourist attraction Saturday near
the peak of the Cotopaxi volcano, some 4,800 meters above sea
level, Civil Defense officials said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Roberto Rodriguez, head of the rescue operations, said
there were reports of at least four people missing, including a
9-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were forced to halt their efforts as night fell
Saturday, but resumed early Sunday. They said eight people had
been found dead and nine were rescued with injuries.
</P>
<P>
It was not known how many people were at the refuge when the
avalanche hit, but local reports put the number at 20 to 25, most
of them Ecuadorean tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Cotopaxi Volcano, world's highest active volcano, is
located about 96 kilometers south of the capital Quito and is one
of the nation's principle tourist attractions, which are commonly
visited by foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
The volcano was struck nine days ago by a strong earthquake
that killed 27 people, injured 167 and left 15,000 others
homeless.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A new chapter has emerged in the
lives of millions of people in China's capital -- public libraries.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 there were just seven district and county public
libraries in Beijing. Now the capital's all 18 districts and
counties have libraries, in addition to 367 libraries in streets
and townships.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the number of public libraries in an area reflects
the civilization of a region. And with Beijing being the political
and cultural center of China, it seems appropriate that its people
should have access to books and literature.
</P>
<P>
The public libraries set up by districts and counties cover an
area of 71,000 square meters, six times that of 1982.
</P>
<P>
So far, 370 reading-rooms, and 59 house libraries, have been
erected in downtown areas and in the countryside, including some
with computerized systems.
</P>
<P>
All the libraries open 300 days a year, and operate during the
two-day weekends to cater to the needs of readers.
</P>
<P>
Later this year an international book fair is to be held in
the capital, marking another installment in the growth of literacy
and literary culture in China.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Hotel Business Remains Dim in 1996 (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Five-star hotels in Thailand will
still have a hard time this year owing to the oversupply of hotel
rooms and fierce competition from lower-grade hotels, despite the
booming of the tourist industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The rising number of tourist arrivals seems little helpful in
boosting occupancy rates at luxury hotels as many of them tend to
take rooms in lower-grade hotels.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Asian countries and regions,
especially those from South Korea, the Middle East and Taiwan, is
increasing recently, but many of them turn to lower-grade
accommodations to save money for shopping, said an analyst from
the Thai Farmers Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The tourists like this represent the majority of the total
foreign visitors arriving in Thailand, the analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from Europe now also tend to stay in cheaper guest
houses and inns, like those along Khao San Road in Bangkok, the
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Many Thai five-star hotels saw slimmer profits or even loss
over the past three years as they had to cut prices to remain
competitive, although their operating costs are rising in line
with other consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The Imperial Hotels Group, one of the hard-hit companies,
reported a loss of 194 million baht (7.8 million US dollars) in
1995, but less than 300 million baht (12 million dollars) it had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Orient Hotel and the Central Plaza Hotel also saw drops in
their profits in 1995 compared with the previous year, obtaining a
profit margin of 19,4 percent and 8.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some luxury hotel operators said that they cannot repeat past
glories, when the profit margin was as high as 25-30 percent. They
placed high hopes on hosting large-scale international conventions
to get rid of the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Local securities analysts also noted that the poor performance
by several listed hotel companies has lowered the credibility of
hotel stocks in the eyes of investors, and some of them will be in
danger of being delisted.
</P>
<P>
Local hoteliers said that the hotel business can survive only
by strengthening management, focusing on cutting operating costs
but retaining quality services.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tightens Control on Capital Funds Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has tightened
control on Bangkok International Banking Facilities (BIBF) by
banning licensed local commercial branches from transferring
capital funds for their BIBF operations.
</P>
<P>
The central bank imposed the regulation because it felt that
BIBF units were strong enough and had sufficient capital to run
their operations, according to a senior central bank official.
</P>
<P>
After the central bank let local and foreign banks operate BIBF
three years ago, the offices recorded a very strong performance
and gained substantial profits, the official believed.
</P>
<P>
The imposition of the rule is aimed at an accounting separation
between the BIBF office and the branches.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has told banks and branches with BIBF licenses
to transfer the capital their units have borrowed back to the
headquarters or Bangkok branches.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move is part of its plan to make BIBF
operators resort to their own capital after the relaxation of
regulations in the first three years of operation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local commercial banks and foreign branches were
allowed to transfer capital to their BIBF units so they would not
have to raise new funds.
</P>
<P>
Nongnart Songdhisuwan, deputy director of financial
institutions supervision, said the move would not affect BIBF
growth.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Families Become Smaller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A couple in Vietnam had an average
of 3.1 children in 1994 in comparison to six in 1961, since the
country introduced family planning 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Notably, farmers, due to a change in the land allocation
policy, are having fewer children, Chairman of the State Committee
of Population and Family Planning Mai Ky said.
</P>
<P>
Land is now allocated according to households instead of the
number of family members, Mai Ky added.
</P>
<P>
But many couples, sticking to old concepts, will continue
having children until they have a son to worship their ancestors
and continue their family line.

<HEADLINE> Fast Urbanization Causes Environmental Problems in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Fast urbanization over the past
decades has caused serious environmental problems in Vietnam,
according to an official report here today.
</P>
<P>
Urban centers in Vietnam have increased from several cities
with 3 million population in the 1950s to over 500 townships and
cities with a combined population of more than 15 million, out of
the nation's 72.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the failure by insufficient
infrastructure facilities to match this growth has resulted in
worsening environmental problems such as water and soil
contamination and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
With only 23 percent of the urban population served by sewage
systems, the still popular use of septic tanks or pit latrines has
given rise to the contamination of underground water.
</P>
<P>
Also waste water from hospitals is discharged freely into the
city's drains without any pretreatment. Millions of cubic meters
of inadequately treated garbage and industrial wastes are
discharged in cities including Hanoi, Hai Phong and Ho Chi Minh
City.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of urban air quality is attributed largely to
the growing motorized transport means with the nation's motor
vehicles more than tripled in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
To face such serious problems, the Vietnamese government has
taken measures recently to step up environment protection,
especially in the new industrial and export processing zones such
as Sai Dong on the outskirts of Hanoi, Tan Thuan and Long Binh in
Ho Chi Minh City.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Raises Fertilizer Prices to Ensure Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has raised
prices of chemical fertilizers to maintain the balance between
demand and supply in the country, Secretary of the Agriculture
Ministry Dan Bahadur Shahi said at a press conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the move aimed to prevent local speculators from
exporting fertilizers to neighboring countries, where prices were
much higher than in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The price of urea has gone up by 20 percent to 6,720 rupees
(116 US dollars) per ton and that of DAP by 35 percent to 16,880
rupees (291 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The price hike is also partly due to the continuous devaluation
of the Nepalese currency, which depreciated by 13 percent against
the US dollar in the past three years, Shahi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the higher prices would cut the government's
subsidy to fertilizer supply from 66 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the government, which has been providing fertilizer at
subsidized prices on the domestic market, would have to bear a
burden of 2.33 billion rupees (some 40 million US dollars) to
support the fertilizer supply in the country this year.
</P>
<P>
It will be an enormous load to the national economy, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Trader Arrested For Rebel Connections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 8 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan police have arrested
a multi-millionaire Muslim trader who is suspected to have had
close connections with the Tamil rebels, police sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim trader has helped the rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelem (LTTE) smuggle lethal bombs, arms and
ammunition into Colombo to attack vital installations and VIPs,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim trader is reported to have actively supported Tamil
rebel leader Subramaniam Sivakumar who had been entrusted the job
of transporting the bombs to Colombo from the north and to store
them in safe houses and coordinating the attacks in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Sivakumar whom the police want to arrest for a range of
criminal activities has been able to escape to Singapore. A house
he had purchased as a safe house in Colombo for 28,300 US Dollars
has been located.
</P>
<P>
The book shops of the Muslim trader and his residence have been
searched by the police, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 13-year war for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country during which over
50,000 persons have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Of late, they have been attacking several installations in
Colombo including the Central Bank on January 31 killing over 90
persons and injuring more than 1,400 others.
</P>
<P>
Police have cautioned of further possible attacks in Colombo
particularly during the festive Sinhala and Tamil new year season
from April 12 to 14.

<HEADLINE> Prison Takeover in Argentina Ends in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Inmates at a prison some 300
kilometers southwest of here ended peacefully their eight-day
takeover of the facility today.
</P>
<P>
The inmates, at the Sierra Chica prison, released 17 hostages
including a female judge, priests, legislators and prison
officials, as part of a deal with the government.
</P>
<P>
The incident began March 30 with 1,052 inmates at the
overcrowded prison demanding swifter trials, and soon developed
into the unprecedented crisis.
</P>
<P>
Inmates from 16 other prisons nationwide also rebelled,
involving 11,000 of the country's total prison population of
26,000.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the inmates in Argentine prisons reportedly
have not been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
After lengthy talks, government officials pledged to speed up
the trials and to transfer participants of the revolt elsewhere to
avoid reprisals.
</P>
<P>
Following the conclusion of the takeover, similar protests in
at least six other prisons also came to an end.
</P>
<P>
A study finds that over the past 10 years, there have been 252
prison protests in Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Takes Steps to Curb Cigarette Hoarding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has requested
the country's cigarette producers to print an expiry date on
cigarettes to prevent hoarding by some merchants for speculation.
</P>
<P>
The Price Fixing and Anti-Monopoly Committee has asked the
Thailand Tobacco Monopoly Authority, a state enterprise under the
Finance Ministry, to study the appropriate life span of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The government request came as retail prices of local
cigarettes are higher than what they should be, because of a
shortage of supplies owing to hoarding by some dealers for
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that the prices will be brought down after
the expiry date is printed to force retailers to sell the products
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today said that retail prices of Thai brand
cigarettes are 2-3 baht (8-12 US cents) higher than regular prices
per package and the acceptable life span of cigarettes in the
industry is normally about four months after being manufactured.
</P>
<P>
Seri Panswuwan, director of the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly
Authority, said that he has no objection to printing the expiry
date, but enforcement should be made over the next six months
after existing stocks are sold.
</P>
<P>
The related department will increase the punishment on those
who violate the rule, including withdrawing their licenses to sell
cigarettes.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Trade among the Southern

<HEADLINE> Hill Wins Third Formula One Race of Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- England's Damon Hill led from
start to finish here on Sunday in the Argentinian Grand Prix,
recording his third successive win of the season and his fourth
race in a row.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Williams Renault driver won the last race of
last season.
</P>
<P>
He was followed home by Canadian teammate Jacques Villeneuve
with Benetton's Jean Alesi in third.
</P>
<P>
Hill, now with his sights on beating Nigel Mansell's five wins
in a row in a season, said: "Naturally I'm delighted to have won
the first three."
</P>
<P>
The race was packed with incident and involved two narrow
escapes for the drivers.
</P>
<P>
Hill took charge from the first corner although Villeneuve
appeared to stall and fell back to 10th.
</P>
<P>
Hill, pressurised by Germany's double world champion Michael
Schumacher in a Ferrari and Jean Alesi, held his nerve and even
came out of his first pitstop in the 23rd lap still ahead.
</P>
<P>
Hill remained over nine seconds ahead until the safety car had
to be used for the first time this season, after Luca Badoer's
Forti collided with Pedro Diniz's Ligier on the 24th lap.
</P>
<P>
"It was a shame the safety car came out and closed everybody
up," said Hill, but Badoer's car was upside down and in a
dangerous sandtrap -- the driver himself walked away looking
remarkably uninjured.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Diniz, Badoer's car had been removed because on
the 29th lap his car ignited in a fireball after his pitstop and
he ended up in the same sandtrap.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably Diniz emerged unscathed and with no burns.
</P>
<P>
Hill maintained his dominance and his victory was assured when
the charging Alesi stalled after a pitstop on the 44th lap and
lost valuable time and position.
</P>
<P>
"I am lucky to be on the podium after stalling like that," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Alesi remounted a challenge by overtaking the seventh-placed
Schumacher, who had revised his three stop strategy by taking on
all his remaining fuel at the second stop.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 46th lap, Schumacher drove into the pits
missing a rear wing flap and retired.
</P>
<P>
Berger, driving in his 183rd Grand Prix, held second for a
while but then spun off and Villeneuve driving in only his third
Grand Prix settled for his second runners-up spot in the three
races.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Barrichello drove brilliantly in his Jordan Peugeot to
finish fourth after only using one pit stop, Ireland's Eddie
Irvine was fifth in the Ferrari, and Dutchman Jos Verstappen was
sixth in his Footwork-Hart, having spun off in the early stages of
the race.

PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- French police stormed into a prison
in central France late tonight and quelled a six-hour riot by
hundreds of inmates.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dijon, where the prison was located,
five people were injured in the mutiny. Among them were a guard
and a local policeman.
</P>
<P>
The incident began in the afternoon, when about 300 prisoners
refused to return to their cells following an exercise break, and
then set fire to their mattresses.
</P>
<P>
Allegedly led by inmates of North African Arab origin, they
seized control of two and half of the three buildings in the
antiquated prison compound.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Barrel, a chief regional government representative, was
quoted as saying there were no clear reasons for the prisoners,
held for common criminal offences, to revolt.
</P>
<P>
After being rounded up in the prison's courtyard, the inmates
were to be transferred to other prisons overnight.

Currently ten fires, a record in years, are reported by

China, became well-off after their hard work during the past five
years. The local people who used to be dependent on the
government for financial aid performed wonders: the average annual
income per farmer increased from 546 yuan in 1990 to 1,546 yuan in
1995.
</P>
<P>
-- An article recalled the utmost care the Party and people
extended to mathematician Chen Jingrun before he died of illness
on March 19, 1996. Chen was well-known for his achievements in
research into Goldbach's conjecture.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The government will help eight million people find work this
year, in a bid to push the urban unemployment rate to less than
3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state-sponsored "Re-employment Project" will
help one million redundant workers in debt-ridden enterprises and
1.5 million laid-off employees return to posts this year.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China has attached importance to the issue of senior
citizens in China. China National Committee on Aging will be
renamed as China Association for Aging.
</P>
<P>
China now has 120 million people who are above the age of
60. It is estimated that 10 million more people will enter their
60s by the year 2000, meaning more than 10 percent of China's
total population will be senior citizens.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Company Brings Chinese Fans More Overseas Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Sony Music, one of the world's
four leading recording companies, was caught by surprise when it
received 100,000 US dollars-worth of royalties from the Shanghai
China Record Company.
</P>
<P>
The royalties were for Michael Jackson's album "Bad", the
copyright for which the Shanghai company bought from the US-based
CBS Music in 1987. Sony purchased CBS Music in 1992, but was
unaware of the transaction on "Bad" until it received the
royalties.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai China Record Company is the country's biggest
recording business. It used to introduce overseas records by way
of program exchanges, but in 1986 it became the first company in
China to purchase the copyrights to records published overseas.
</P>
<P>
The company has since imported about 20 overseas records on
average each year, and the number exceeded 30 last year. Three of
the world's four leading record companies, namely, Sony Music, EMI
and PolyGram, and other major ones such as Warner Bros. and
Japan's JVC are the main sources of these records.
</P>
<P>
It has imported records by world-famous orchestras such as the
Philadelphia Philharmonic, and top pop singers such as Kenny
Rogers, Richard Marx and Sinead O'Connor, which were all well
received by China's music fans.
</P>
<P>
All these records sell well, and the company has never suffered
a loss in this respect, said Zhou Jianchao, its general
manager. The best of the records sold 600,000 copies, while the
lowest score was 10,000 copies.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Overseas Bank Branches -- Favorites for Yuan Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas banks with branches on
the east side of the Huangpu River, which runs through this
largest city of China, have greater chances of becoming the first
to be allowed to conduct local currency business in China,
according to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has
said that overseas banks will be allowed to handle yuan business
on a limited basis first in the Pudong New Area, an emerging
financial district of the city.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Fuji Bank established a branch in Pudong last August.
</P>
<P>
In a move to reinforce the effort to build Pudong into a
financial and trade zone, the central bank's Shanghai branch was
authorized to declare late last month that overseas bank branches
in Shanghai are allowed to set up sub-branches, and those overseas
bank branches and headquarters on the west side of the river must
move to Pudong, the east side.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the 38 operational overseas banks and 119
overseas bank offices on the west side of the river have contacted
the municipal authorities for details on the establishment of bank
subsidiaries in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the number of financial
institutions in Pudong increased by 27 last year to 90, whose
deposits outstanding added up to 67 billion yuan (over eight
billion US dollars), about 22 percent of total for the whole of
the city.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Shanghai Urban Co-operative Bank
will establish a branch in Pudong in mid-April, and the Shanghai
Stock Exchange, with 6,000 slots, will be moved to Pudong by next
February.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Barbara Paulus of Austria
defeated world number two Conchita Martinez of Spain 7-6 (7-2),
6-4 to reach the final of the WTA Family Circle Cup in Hilton
Head, South Carolina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian denied Martinez in her bid for a third consecutive
title at this event, the first clay court tournament on the path
to the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Paulus was to play Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the second
seed and world number three who ousted sixth seeded Czech Jana
Novotna 6-2, 6-2, in the other morning semi-final, for a
200,000-dollar top prize later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both semi-final matches had been washed out by rain Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Paulus earlier ousted fifth seed Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria
as well as Romania's Irina Spirlea and France's Nathalie Tauziat
in her unlikely run to the final.
</P>
<P>
Martinez had lost to Steffi Graf at Indian Wells last month in
her most recent tour appearance. She skipped singles at Key
Biscayne to begin clay training.
</P>
<P>
Martinez had won three of four prior meetings with Paulus, but
they had not played each other since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The upset prevented the first matchup between the former
Spanish doubles partners in a final since Martinez downed Sanchez
Vicario 6-3, 6-1 at the Prague Open last May.

robberies in New York City increased in the first three months of
this year, The New York Times reported today quoting police

According to new crime statistics, 575 rapes were reported
across the city, up 7 percent from first three months in 1995 and

<HEADLINE> UNDP To Publish Human Development Report For Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) is to publish the first human development report
for Nigeria over the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Babashola Chinsman, the UNDP resident representative in
Nigeria, said here today that the move is to assist Nigeria in
its development planning when a data base is needed in such a big
country as Nigeria to provide basis for decision-making and
planning.
</P>
<P>
He said the publication of the report would be one of the
outcomes of the program's support to the national statistical and
information systems project, "which is an important program as
far as the UNDP is concerned."
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the project include clearing the data
processing backlog, dating back between one and eight years when
the UNDP support program began.
