Yeltsin spelled out Russia's efforts in persuading the Iraqi
leadership to restore cooperation with the UN weapons
inspectors and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Interfax quoted the presidential press service as saying.

He expressed confidence that a worst-case scenario would be
avoided and Iraq will go back to compliance with the international

On Thursday, Yeltsin also sent a personal message to Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein, warning him that force might be used unless

BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday allowed

possibly to ward off an imminent U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow the inspectors of both U.N. Special Commission

<HEADLINE> Austrian FM Visits Lebanon on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Shuessel arrived here on Saturday as part of a
regional tour aimed at promoting the stalled peace process,
the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Shuessel, whose country currently heads the European
Union (EU)'s six-month rotating presidency, will also visit Israel,
Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan, Syria and Egypt, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit to Lebanon, the foreign minister,
accompanied by the EU mideast special envoy Miguel Angel
Moratinos, is due to hold talks with Lebanese President-elect
Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and his counterpart
Fares Boueiz on the peace process, especially the Wye
Plantation accord and its impact on the Syrian and Lebanese
track.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an interim peace
agreement in the United States, breaking a 19-month deadlock
of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered deal, Israel agreed to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank in three months in return for
Palestinian Authority's crack down on "terrorism".
</P>
<P>
Shuessel will discuss with Lebanese officials over the role
the EU will play and the possibility in reactivating
negotiations on Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and Syria, Lebanon have been
suspended since the hardline Netanyahu came to power in June,
1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel refused to withdraw its troops from Syrian Golan Heights
it conquered in the 1967 Middle East war and from south Lebanon it
occupied in 1985.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Security Officials Meet to Respond to Iraq's Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. Security officials
are having an urgent meeting at the White House to discuss how to
respond to Iraq's promise to resume cooperation with the U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume without
conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately,
U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah said Saturday. The response could
avert a U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the promise,
saying that the promise was "positive" and met all requirements of
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Shah said the Iraqi leadership sent a letter to Annan saying
that they will allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume at
suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
There are "no conditions... in this letter," Shah said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day before Iraq officially announced the
promise, White House on Saturday demanded "concrete and
demonstratable actions" that Saddam Hussein will allow the return
of U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had started a military buildup in the Gulf to prepare
for possible military strike against Iraq. But the Clinton
administration has repeatedly said Baghdad can avoid being
attacked by compliance.

<HEADLINE> Annan Terms Iraqi Letter on Inspections as "Positive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Saturday described an Iraqi letter on U.N. weapons
inspections as "positive", saying that he believed it met U.N.
requirements in resolving the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
A letter from Baghdad, handed to the U.N. chief at his
residence shortly before 10:00 a.m. EST by the Iraqi permanent
representative to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, would be
submitted to the Security Council later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the letter met U.N. requirements, he said "Yes, in my
view it does."
</P>
<P>
"The letter is a reply to the letter sent last night by the
Secretary-General to (Iraqi) President Saddam Hussein, following
the meeting of the Security Council," which ran about five hours
into late on Friday, a U.N. spokesman said on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is scheduled to convene closed-door
consultations on Iraq at 3:30 p.m. EST on Saturday, as war threat
looms in the gulf by the U.S. efforts to increase its military
buildup in the region.
</P>
<P>
The letter also came shortly after Iraq Saturday announced that
it allowed unconditional return of U.N. arms inspectors in an
attempt to defuse the current crisis which threatens an imminent
U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon told reporters that Iraq was going to cooperate fully
with arms inspection teams of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi leadership has decided to resume full and complete
cooperation with both the UNSCOM and the IAEA," the Iraqi
ambassador said, "They will be allowed in the minute they would
like to go and resume their normal work."
</P>
<P>
He said one of Iraq's goals have been met, that is, Baghdad had
made it known to the world its views and everyone was now aware of
what Iraq wants.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants movement toward the lifting of 8-year economic
sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
Disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction is one key
requirement for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq declared the suspension of all cooperation on August 5
with U.N. inspection teams, and on October 31, Baghdad stopped the
remainder of the inspections, prompting UNSCOM to pull its staff
out of Iraq on "strong recommendation" from Washington.

</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement made by the state-run

<P>
Minister of Transport Lieutenant-General Tin Ngwe is now at his

BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Saturday that it
allows an unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspectors, a move
that will possibly ward off an imminent U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow the inspectors of both U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency to return and resume
their normal missions.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan read on Iraqi TV, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz expressed the hope that the
resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors will be "a
step towards" lifting sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the
suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially
and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. It
demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old
comprehensive sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions can only be lifted after
the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came
when many security council members oppose a military solution to
the current crisis and support Iraq's view over the lifting of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz gave special credit to Russian, Chinese and French
diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources here said Saturday that, U.N. chief
Kofi Annan, in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Friday,
made a personal assurance of his efforts towards the lifting of
the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan also called on Iraq in the letter to resume cooperation
with U.N. inspectors before "it is too late."
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Iraq has agreed to resume the cooperation
not in fear of the "aggressive campaign" by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened a military attack to force an Iraqi
backdown and is busy with building up military power in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Washington is sending in B-52 and B-1 bombers along with F-117
stealth jets. This will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more
than 20,000 armymen, 300 aircraft and 20 ships, including two
aircraft carriers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will face an estimated
shortage of more than 400 million kwh (kilowatt-hours) of
electricity in the 1998-99 dry season, double the figure it
suffered during the previous dry season.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency quoted the Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) as
saying that the shortage will seriously affect the country in late
May and at the beginning of June next year.
</P>
<P>
Hydro-electricity makes up 70 percent of Vietnam's total
electricity output.
</P>
<P>
To ease the shortage, the EVN has been running all its thermal,
gas and coal-fueled plants and stations to supply more power for
the national grid and has spared no efforts to store water in
reservoirs to serve the hydro-electric plants.
</P>
<P>
EVN produced 18 billion kwh of electricity in the first 10
months of this year and expects to raise the figure to 21.32
billion kwh for the whole year.

benefit from a more favorable international environment for
economic cooperation to develop the country and will be able to
contribute to the broadening of economic and commercial relations
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam highly appreciates and honors the objectives,
principles and work pursued by APEC and we have already formulated
the individual action plan and forwarded it to APEC secretariat on
schedule," Cam stressed.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's economy is now at the early stage of development with
low efficiency and competitiveness and is undergoing a
transitional phrase, Cam noted, adding that his country "will face
tremendous difficulties on the way to development and
integration."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cam said, with a strong resolve to continue with
a speedier pace of renovation, Vietnam will strive to expand the
mutually beneficial cooperation with regional countries and
economies and actively contribute to the implementation of the
forum's objectives for Asia-Pacific development and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Top Officials Meet to Respond to Iraq's Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. Security officials
are having an urgent meeting at the White House on Saturday to
discuss how to respond to Iraq's promise to resume cooperation
with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume without
conditions and inspectors would be allowed to return immediately,
U.N. special envoy Prakash Shah said Saturday in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the promise,
saying that Iraq's decision was "positive" and met all
requirements of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Shah said the Iraqi leadership sent a letter to Annan saying
that he will allow the work of inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume at
suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
There are "no conditions... in this letter," Shah said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. responded with caution. "We have not seen the letter.
We've only seen the reports. I can't make a judgment," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day before Iraq officially announced the
promise, Lockhart demanded "concrete and demonstrable actions"
that Saddam Hussein will allow the return of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, Presidential National
Security Advisor Sandy Berger, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
Chief George Tenet and State Department officials met in the White
House to review the new development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had started a military buildup in the Gulf to prepare
for possible military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration has repeatedly said Baghdad can
avoid being attacked by unconditional and full compliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first wave of additional U.S. warplanes left for
the Gulf this morning: six B-52 heavy bombers departed Barksdale
Air Force Base, Louisiana, at 4:38 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft were to be followed shortly by F-15s, F-16s, and
other B-1 bombers from bases across the country, Air Force
spokeswoman Wendy Frable said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 31 to suspend all cooperation with
the U.N. weapons inspectors.

<HEADLINE> 18th India International Trade Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The 18th India International
Trade Fair opened here Saturday with a call by President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan to Indian companies to make their products
competitive in the international market.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read out by Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on the
inauguration of the trade fair, Narayanan said trade and industry
had to make combined efforts to improve the economic scenario in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Indian companies to establish the Indian
brand name through quality products and use of latest technology.
</P>
<P>
He regretted the presence of poverty, unemployment and income
disparities in his country, saying it was definitely needed to
develop economically sound and efficient technologies for the
benefit of masses.
</P>
<P>
The 18th India International Trade fair, which covers a gross
display area of about 140,000 square meters, have been

<HEADLINE> Iraq Allows Resumption of U.N. Weapons Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Saturday that it
allows an unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspectors, a move
that will likely ward off a close U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow the inspectors of both U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency to return and resume
their normal missions.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan read on Iraqi TV, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz expressed the hope that the
resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors will be "a
step towards" lifting sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the
suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially
and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. It
demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old
comprehensive sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions can only be lifted after
the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came
when many security council members oppose a military solution to
the current crisis and support Iraq's view over the lifting of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz gave special credit to Russian, Chinese and French
diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources here said Saturday that, U.N. chief
Kofi Annan, in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Friday,
made a personal assurance of his efforts towards the lifting of
the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan also called on Iraq in the letter to resume cooperation
with U.N. inspectors before "it is too late."
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Iraq has agreed to resume the cooperation
not in fear of the "aggressive campaign" by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened a military attack to force an Iraqi
backdown and is busy with building up military power in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Washington is sending in B-52 and B-1 bombers along with F-117
stealth jets. This will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more
than 20,000 armymen, 300 aircraft and 20 ships, including two
aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the Iraqi
promise of cooperation, saying that Iraq's decision was "positive"
and met all requirements of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. responded with caution. "We have not seen the letter.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Mark 10th Anniversary of Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians throughout the
West Bank and Gaza Strip marked on Saturday the 10th anniversary
of the Tunis declaration of the Palestinian independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mass rallies and demonstrations were held in Gaza, Ramallah,
Nablus and other cities of the territories under Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) control, to mark the anniversary,
according to the Voice of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, north of the West Bank, thousands of people marched
from the Philistine Street to the headquarters of the local
government, where ceremonies were held in the presence of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the gathering that the PNA has done everything
possible to move the Mideast peace process forward and strived
hard to bring peace to all Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
No matter what comes, Arafat proclaimed, he will declare an
independent Palestinan state with Jerusalem as its capital on the
territories next May.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accord signed in 1993, the final-status talks
between the Palestinians and Israel should be concluded as the
five-year transitional period expires next May.
</P>
<P>
But in reality, such talks, which will solve the issues as
refugees, border and the status of Jerusalem, have not started yet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat declared Palestine's independence 10 years ago in Tunis,
which has been recognized by many countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, another West Bank city, thousands of people
marched from Friends School to the downtown Manara Square. PNA
officials and local community leaders addressed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, students from the College of Education gathered at
the Palestine Club to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Marches and rallies were held peacefully and no incidents were
reported during the day.

<HEADLINE> India Terms U.S. Action "Counter-Productive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- India termed on Saturday as
"coercive and counter-productive" U.S. barring of over 200 Indian
companies from having any kind of business or trade relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We regard this as a highly unfortunate development," a
spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs said here.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration on Friday formally identified 40
Indian entities along with their 200 subsidiaries which will be
barred from having any business link with American companies.
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Power Corporation of India, Bharat Earth Movers
Limited, Indian Space Research Organization, Bhabha Atomic
Research Center and the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research,
suspected to be involved in nuclear missile and military programs,
are among the Indian companies blacklisted by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The restriction interfered with the free flow of trade,
technology and finance and would have an adverse impact on
mutually beneficial business interaction, the Indian spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's decision reflected the continuation of a coercive
approach that is entirely misplaced and counter-productive, he
said, adding that such steps were unhelpful for meaningful
discussions towards an improvement in the bilateral relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision came barely a week before the scheduled
crucial talks on nuclear issues and non-proliferation between U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Indian prime
minister's special envoy Jaswant Singh in Rome next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Attend Security Council Meeting on Iraqi Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Saturday will be present at the Security Council
consultations on the latest Iraqi letter on arms inspections,,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the 15-member Security Council to "make a ultimate
decision" on the letter, the spokesman told reporters on Saturday
morning outside Annan's residence in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, whose closed-door consultations on Iraq
ran five hours into late on Friday, is scheduled to convene a rare
weekend meeting on Iraq at 3:30 p.m. EST on Saturday, as war
threat looms in the gulf by the U.S. efforts to increase its
military buildup in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Council is expected to concentrate on how the world body
would react to the Iraqi letter on U.N. weapons inspection, which
Annan described as "positive", saying that he believed it met U.N.
requirements in resolving the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
A letter from Baghdad, handed to the U.N. chief at his
residence shortly before 10:00 a.m. EST by the Iraqi permanent
representative to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, would be
submitted to the Security Council later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the letter met U.N. requirements, he said "Yes, in my
view it does."
</P>
<P>
"The letter is a reply to the letter sent last night by the
Secretary-General to (Iraqi) President Saddam Hussein, following
the meeting of the Security Council" late on Friday, Eckhard said
on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The letter also came shortly after Iraq Saturday announced that
it allowed unconditional return of U.N. arms inspectors in an
attempt to defuse the current crisis which threatens an imminent
U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon told reporters that Iraq was going to cooperate fully
with arms inspection teams of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi leadership has decided to resume full and complete
cooperation with both the UNSCOM and the IAEA," the Iraqi
ambassador said, "They will be allowed in the minute they would
like to go and resume their normal work."
</P>
<P>
He said one of Iraq's goals have been met, that is, Baghdad had
made it known to the world its views and everyone was now aware of
what Iraq wants.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants movement toward the lifting of 8-year economic
sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
Disarmament of its weapons of mass destruction is one key
requirement for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq declared the suspension of all cooperation on August 5
with U.N. inspection teams, and on October 31, Baghdad stopped the
remainder of the inspections, prompting UNSCOM to pull its staff
out of Iraq on "strong recommendation" from Washington.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. Security officials
are having an urgent meeting at the White House on Saturday to
discuss how to respond to Iraq's promise to resume cooperation
with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Presidential National Security Council is expected to
make a statement after the meeting, which is assessing if Iraq's
promise is unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume without

being updated on developments, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Clinton's national security advisers, which was
held at the White House, included National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) Director George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott participated in the
assessment because Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
heading to Malaysia for a summit of Asia Pacific leaders.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was planning to depart for the summit on Saturday
night, although his plans could be altered if the showdown with
Iraq was not resolved.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, scheduled to depart Saturday night on a 10-day trip to
Asia, had weighed the possibility that Vice President Al Gore
might go instead to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided to suspend all cooperation with the U.N. weapons
inspectors on October 31.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Claim Water Can Be Split by Stirring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese scientists have shaken
the world of chemistry with an experiment showing water can be
split into hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature simply by
adding a catalyst and stirring.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, made by Professor Kazunari Domen and colleagues
at Tokyo Institute of Technology, seems a kind of heresy to most
chemists, the New Scientist magazine said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, their results were carefully reviewed by other
chemists before they were published in Chemical Communications, a
learned journal of the British Royal Society of Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that when they put a powdered
cuprous oxide catalyst into a beaker of water at room temperature,
and stirred it energetically, hydrogen and oxygen were given off.
</P>
<P>
Professor Domen initially thought that the energy driving the
low-temperature reaction came from light, a mechanism chemists
could just about live with.
</P>
<P>
But later he found that the reaction continues in the dark for
hundreds of hours, suggesting that it was the stirring, not any
energy from light, which helping the process.
</P>
<P>
The quicker the container is stirred, the more hydrogen and
oxygen are produced, Professor Domen reported.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believed that the mechanical energy is
converted to chemical energy without first being converted to
thermal energy.

"This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted
into chemical energy by catalysis," Professor Domen said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers admitted that they don't know how it works,
saying that less than five per cent of the energy from stirring
appears to end up splitting water, producing a small amount of
hydrogen and oxygen gas.
</P>
<P>
But Professor Domen thought that he can improve the yield by
learning more about how the reaction works.
</P>
<P>
"If we can increase the efficiency by an order of magnitude,
then it may be possible to think about practical applications," he
said.

ANKARA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
summoned Italian Ambassador in Ankara Massimiliano Bandini on
Saturday to protest the attacks against Turkish journalists in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir told
Bandini that "Turkey expects that Italy must capture the
terrorists who attacked the Turkish journalists and hand them
over to justice."
</P>
<P>
Haktanir also asked the Italian government to take necessary
measures to protect the security of Turkey's representatives and
other Turkish citizens in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported from Rome Saturday that
a group of supporters of Turkey's rebel Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) attacked the Turkish journalists near the Termini Station on

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Iraqi Cooperation with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday welcomed
Iraq's decision to allow the unconditional return of U.N. weapons
inspectors, saying that the tension around Iraq has eased.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Baghdad will allow the inspectors
of both the U.N. Special Commission and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) to return and resume their normal missions.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk said Iraq
"has taken an extremely important step which has provided an
opportunity for a speedy settlement of the crisis by political
methods, excluding the use of force."
</P>
<P>
He told the local Ekho Moskvy radio program Aziz's message was
made in response to appeals from Annan, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and in order to give
an additional chance for administering justice in lifting the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk said Russia hopes that the U.N. Security Council
will "respond adequately to this message, to this big shift in
Baghdad's position," Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, in the letter read on Iraqi television, expressed the
hope that the resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors will be "a step towards" lifting sanctions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the
suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially
and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. It
demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old
comprehensive sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions can only be lifted after
the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came
when many security council members oppose a military solution to
the current crisis and support Iraq's view over the lifting of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz gave special credit to Russian, Chinese and French
diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation.

<HEADLINE> UK Sees Dramatic Rise in Internet Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The last six months has seen an
upsurge in the amount of adults using the Internet in the UK,
especially women, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
Over a million more people have started to use the Web, jumping
from 5.9 million six months ago to 7 million now, said the survey
carried out by internetTrak.
</P>
<P>
When the survey first took place two years ago, a mere 14
percent of UK Internet users were women.
</P>
<P>
That has dramatically risen to 40 percent of first time users
now, and the figures are even higher for younger users, where 47
percent of 14 to 17 year olds are female, the survey has found.
</P>
<P>
"The large increase in the number of users in the last six
months clearly demonstrates that the Web is rapidly becoming a
day-to-day information source in the UK," said Shelaine Green,
European marketing director of Yahoo, one of the companies to
commission the survey.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the recent increase of UK Internet
users would be the drop in cost to surf the Net with Internet
service providers beginning to give free access, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Allows Resumption of U.N. Weapons Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Saturday that it
allows an unconditional return of U.N. weapons inspectors, a move
that will likely ward off a close U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow the inspectors of both U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency to return and resume
their normal missions.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan read on Iraqi TV, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz expressed the hope that the
resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors will give
"a further chance to achieve justice" by lifting sanctions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the previous Iraqi decisions to stop cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors were only aimed at seeking an end to the
suffering of the Iraqi people under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced two decisions in August and October to partially
and totally stop cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. It
demands the U.N. consider the lifting of the eight-year-old
comprehensive sanctions on it. Nearly all U.N. weapons inspectors
have left Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions can only be lifted after
the U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the decision to resume cooperation with the U.N. came
when many security council members support Iraq's view over the
lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz gave special credit to Russian, Chinese, French and
Brazilian diplomacy for the resumption of the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources here said Saturday that, U.N. chief
Kofi Annan, in a letter to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Friday,
made a personal assurance of his efforts towards the lifting of
the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan also called on Iraq in the letter to resume cooperation
with U.N. inspectors before "it is too late."
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that Iraq has agreed to resume the cooperation
not in fear of the "aggressive campaign" by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened a military attack to force an Iraqi
backdown and is busy with building up military power in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Washington is sending in B-52 and B-1 bombers along with F-117
stealth jets. This will bring U.S. forces poised near Iraq to more
than 20,000 armymen, 300 aircraft and 20 ships, including two
aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan responded to the Iraqi
promise of cooperation, saying that Iraq's decision was "positive"
and met all requirements of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. responded with caution. "We have not seen the letter.
We've only seen the reports. I can't make a judgment," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Top U.S. Security officials are having an urgent meeting at the
White House on Saturday to discuss how to respond to Iraq's
promise to resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, Presidential National
Security Advisor Sandy Berger, Central Intelligence Agency Chief
George Tenet and State Department officials met in the White House
to review the new development.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will hold consultations on the latest
Iraqi letter on arms inspections on Saturday afternoon,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the 15-member Security Council to "make a ultimate
decision" on the letter, the spokesman told reporters on Saturday
morning outside Annan's residence in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Council is expected to concentrate on how the world body
would react to the Iraqi letter on U.N. weapons inspection, which
Annan described as "positive," saying that he believed it met
U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoon said the
U.N. weapons inspectors "They will be allowed in the minute they
would like to go and resume their normal work."
</P>
<P>
He said one of Iraq's goals have been met, that is, Baghdad had
made it known to the world its views and everyone was now aware of
what Iraq wants.

TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Saturday
that it has discovered a prehistoric site dating back to the 5th
millennium before Christ.
</P>
<P>
Abolfazl Mortezaie, director general of the cultural heritage
department of Semnan province, east to the capital of Tehran,
told the official Islamic Republic News Agency that the site was
discovered in Lassejard region in the province last week.
</P>
<P>
He said evidence indicates that the region of Aspi-Tappeh
(white hill) was inhabited by people of ancient civilizations
going back to the fifth, third and first millenniums before Christ.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary studies indicate that Aspi-Tappeh was an important
cultural center in the prehistoric period, the official said, and
the passage of the ancient Silk Road in its vicinity has added to
the region's importance.
</P>
<P>
He stated that archaeological studies in the area can shed
light on the missing link in the region's civilization.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not give any details about the
discovery, nor did he say what civilization it belonged to.

Some 400 historical works, hills and sites have so far been

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Aziz on Proposed Comprehensive Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz on Saturday stated Iraq's views on the
proposed comprehensive review in a letter to U.N. chief Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
In an annex to the letter, Aziz said the comprehensive review
should be carried out within a very short time (seven days for
example) after the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
resumes its work.
</P>
<P>
The security Council should be ready to implement its
obligations termed in Resolution 687 of 1991 if Iraq has met all
requirements set out by the resolution, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister said if the Security Council sees
that more work needs to be done, a short period be set for that
and in the meantime the Council takes measures for lifting or
reducing sanctions in proportion to what has been fulfilled of the
requirements termed in resolution 687 of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Council should fix the legal interpretation of section C of
Resolution 687 of 1991, and none of its members should impose
additional conditions, Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
The annex also said "the question of Butler (Executive Chairman
of UNSCOM) and the structure of UNSCOM and its practices are
important matters. The Council is to consider them seriously in
order to ensure a good relationship in the future. We hope that it
will be done as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Iraq stressed that everything enclosed in the annex did not
constitute any conditions for it to make the decision to resume
full cooperation with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on October 31 announced to halt all its ties with UNSCOM
in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
prompting the possible military strike by the United States, which
has massed heavy forces in the Gulf. Due to shuttle diplomatic
efforts by the international community, Iraq on Saturday decided
to resume full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.

TEHRAN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces killed
five drug traffickers and confiscated 872 kilograms of narcotics
in the northeastern province of Khorasan during the past two days,
provincial security forces announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian security forces also arrested eight smugglers after
armed clashes, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
</P>
<P>
The confiscated drugs consist of 302.5 kilograms of heroin, 50
kilograms of morphine, 279.5 kilograms of opium and 240 kilograms
of hashish, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Four vehicles, a check of 2 billion rials (about 333,000
U.S. dollars) and four rifles were also seized from the smugglers,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Due to its geographical location, Iran is one of the ideal
transit countries for smugglers to transfer narcotics from the
Golden Crescent in Afghanistan to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Iran seized about 200 tonnes of
various drugs during the past one year.

Kofi Annan on Saturday confirmed that Iraq's decision to resume
full and complete cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors was
unconditional and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
could resume its normal work.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to press, Annan said Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister

UNSCOM could resume its normal work, including inspections and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also indicated that the attached list was for the

<P>
"Last night we went to bed not knowing what we'd wake up to but
this seems to be a positive development and the Council will act

Annan's confirmation is widely seen here as a move to dispel
any misunderstanding of a attached list to a letter written by

</P>
<P>
In the letter, Iraq told the U.N. chief that It had decided to
resume full and complete cooperation with the United Nations.

ADDIS ABABA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia plans to obtain
4.9 billion Birr (some 680 million U.S. Dollars) from export in
1998/99, compared to previous year's 4.1 billion Birr (some 569
Dollars), the Ethiopian trade minister said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifth "Exporters Day" celebration, Ethiopian
Minister of Trade and Industry, Kasahun Ayele, said that the
coffee export is planned to take a 63.6 percent of share of the
total export income.
</P>
<P>
Aanother 22 percent of the revenue will come from the export
of oil seeds, grains as well as hides and skins, while the
remaining will be covered by other export items, the Ethiopian
News Agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Kasahun, the country's export revenue had shown a
27 percent growth over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The share of the private sector in export trade has increased
from 19 percent in 1991/92 to 74 percent in 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasahun Ayele said that there is still a negative
trade balance between the country's import-export performance.
</P>
<P>
The exporters have a lot to do to bridge the wide
import-export gap, he added.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily On Central Bank's New Reform Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, comments in Monday's edition on the central
bank's tightening of financial controls as its latest reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary titled "A Major Reform in the Administrative
Structure of the Central Bank", it says that the decision to
replace provincial-level branches of the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) with regional ones is "an important step forward in the
current financial reform".
</P>
<P>
From 1948 to 1984, it says, the PBOC played a role of both
central administrator of the financial sector and commercial bank
doing banking with enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, it has preserved its administrative functions.But
the decades-old practice of PBOC branches with parallel
administrative functions has remained unchanged and continues to
hamper the work of the central bank as the policy-implementor and
financial administrator, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It says that increasing financial reforms, setting up a system
that adjusts and controls the financial sector that is adapted to
developing a socialist market economy, preventing financial
hazards, and pushing for sustained, rapid and healthy development
of the national economy are significant changes and that this
accords with the country's own situation and the international
practices as well.

<P>
BONN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Almost a billion U.S. dollars
worth of goods and services will be sold over the Internet in
Germany this year -- five times the volume of last year. This is
the prognosis of one German-based union of Internet businesses,
which is published on Sunday in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
The basis of the estimate is a survey of members of the "eco
Electronic Commerce Forum" (eco Forum e.V.), which conducts more
than 80 percent of data transactions in Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to eco, the German economy will invest over 300
million marks for commercial use of the Internet this year.
Private users will spend over 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Online advertising, media, tourism, banks, and insurance
companies are other major contributors to the explosion in
Internet spending in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The computer industry will benefit the most from the Internet
boom. Producers of Internet hardware and software earned almost
250 million dollars this year from customers who wanted to own the
most up-to-date equipment.

JOHANNESBURG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The 7th All Africa Games
to be staged in South Africa next year will be used by 10
sporting codes as Olympic qualification events, a senior African
sports official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA)
president Jean Claude Ganga told a press conference here this
arrangement would prevent duplication and save money for the
continent's sports bodies.
</P>
<P>
The All Africa Games, slated from September 10 to 19, 1999,
will attract some 5,000 to 6,000 athletes all around the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Dan Moyo, chairman of the All Africa Games' sports commission,

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Leader Asks for Political Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Abdullah Ocalan, chief of the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and also the most wanted man by
Turkey, filed a formal request Saturday for political asylum in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
According to Italy's Interior Ministry sources, the asylum
request has now been compiled, signed and formally submitted.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's lawyer Giuliano Pisapia said that on Thursday the
chief of the PKK, which has been outlawed by Turkey, would be soon
questioned by an Italian prosecutor on whether to accept any
extradition request that may have arrived in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish leader was sought under arrest warrants from both
Germany and Turkey when he was detained by Italian frontier police
Thursday evening after flying from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
An Italian appeals court judge confirmed his arrest on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PKK, which began an armed struggle for
Kurdish independence from Turkey under Ocalan's leadership in
1984, said the Italian authorities "knew" he was arriving in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Akif Hassan, the European spokesman of the Ernk, the Kurdish
liberation front, said negotiations had been held between Ocalan
himself and the Italian government through unidentified Italian
"mediators" before he left Russia.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said he was surprised that Ocalan was said to be under
arrest since there were assurances that this would not happen.
According to Hassan, the PKK leader is in hospital due to "health
problems."
</P>
<P>
The PKK's top official in Europe, Kani Yilmaz, said Ocalan had
decided to come to Italy to "open the path to peace" in his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the Kurds are looking for a solution which "can be
sought from here." The PKK is also asking the Italian government
to grant the political asylum, he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with an imminent American military attack, President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq made a show of backing down Saturday,
saying in a letter to the United Nations that his government would
resume full cooperation with arms inspectors. But the U.S.
rejected the offer as inadequate and unacceptable, and said
American forces remained poised to strike.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States had prepared to begin a huge campaign of
air strikes on Iraq Saturday, but called off the attack after a
last-minute flurry of diplomatic activity brought an Iraq
announcement that it would allow United Nations weapons inspectors
to resume their work, Clinton Administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The House Judiciary Committee this week takes up the solemn
task of weighing whether to impeach a president while faced with a
ticking clock, an unhappy public, and a growing desire by members
on both sides of the aisle to craft a way out. But members of
Congress seeking to punish President Clinton without removing him
from office may find some vexing legal obstacles in their path.
</P>
<P>
-- Metal grates were ripped from store-fronts, cars set ablaze
and plumes of thick black smoke again could be seen over Jakarta
Saturday as a massive student-led "people power" movement at the
gates of parliament gave way to scattered rioting and looting in
other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Security Council members were divided late last night
over Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, a decision rejected by the United States but welcomed
by France, Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
-- Whether the latest on-again, off-again gallop toward
military strikes against Iraq ever concludes with steel raining
upon Baghdad, critics of the Clinton administrations's policy are
asking "What is the endgame?"

<HEADLINE> Major Reform In China's Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBOC), the country's central bank, will replace its
provincial-level branches with regional branches to tighten
central control over finances.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the reform is to protect the banking system from
interference by local governments, to penalize people who have
violated financial laws and regulations, and to improve the
efficiency of banks.
</P>
<P>
This restructuring is the latest move by the Central Government
to intensify reforms, improve order, and prevent hazards in the
financial sector, according to Vice-premier Wen Jiabao.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the announcement at a recent national conference in
Beijing, attended by the heads of provincial-level branches.
</P>
<P>
He told them that the decision was made by the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council after considerable study and
careful planning, and is significant for the introduction of a
modern financial system.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of nominating capable officials
who have followed the Party's line and are familiar with
the banking business.
</P>
<P>
PBOC Governor Dai Xianglong explained the new structure in
detail. He said that 9 regional branches of the PBOC will be
formed to govern local banking as follows: Tianjin, covering the
city of Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi provinces, and Inner Mongolia;
Shenyang, covering Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces;
Shanghai, covering the city of Shanghai, and Zhejiang and Fujian
provinces; Nanjing, covering Jiangsu and Anhui provinces; Jinan,
covering Shandong and Henan provinces; Wuhan, covering Jiangxi,
Hubei and Hunan provinces; Guangzhou, covering Guangdong and
Hainan provinces, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region;
Chengdu, covering Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, and
Tibet; and Xi'an, covering Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces,
and Ningxia and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing and Chongqing branches have been abolished and
their businesss will be put under the direct control of the
Business Department of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, banks had reported 9.3 trillion
yuan in deposits, 8.3 trillion yuan in outstanding loans, 143.7
billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange reserves. These are 83
times, 46 times, and 846 times of the 1978 figures, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Individual bank deposits stood at 5.2 trillion yuan, or 250
times the 1978 figure.

LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Sunday that the crisis over the U.N. weapons
inspectors in Iraq is not yet over.
</P>
<P>
"This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance is
guaranteed and delivered," he told reporters outside his Downing
Street office.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Saddam Hussein would in the future be
given no notice of plans by the West to launch military attacks.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further warning whatsoever," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair confirmed that he had on Saturday authorized the use of
British forces against Baghdad before Iraq sent messages to the
U.N. Security Council. The British forces would remain "ready,
willing and able" to strike against Baghdad if necessary, he added.
</P>
<P>
But he welcomed the promises from Baghdad to allow the weapons
inspectors to resume their work in Iraq unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
"All this has to be not just accepted without negotiation or
amendment...More important, it must be acted upon," he said.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 65 Angolan refugees have
arrived recently in Mwinilunga, Zambia's Northwestern province,
Home Affairs Minister Katele Kalumba said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees arrived at a time when the Zambian
government is making final preparations to repatriate Angolan
refugees who came to the country in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Though his country has a liberal asylum policy toward asylum
seekers, the situation is a matter of grave concern to the
government because it is entrapped in a cycle of upheavals and
attempted negotiations without an end in sight, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba urged the Angolan government and the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to seek a
negotiated settlement to the prolonged war in the country by
abiding by the Lusaka Protocol signed by the two sides in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic
of Congo to take steps to encourage the voluntary return of their
nationals from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambia has about 130,000 refugees from Angola,
Rwanda and Congo (K).

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to preserve its
time-honoured culture with CD-ROMs in a program that started here
recently.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 classic works out of a group of about 130,000

A group of famous Chinese scholars headed by Ji Xielin, a
professor at Beijing University, will compile the works, and Luo
Peilin, another academic, will be in charge of the technical
committee.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Exporting Chinese Cabbage To Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese cabbage, which
used to be the staple food of northern Chinese, is becoming more
popular on foreign dinning tables.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's suburban county of Changping plans to export 9,600
tons of Chinese cabbage, with the first batch of 40 tons going to
South Korea and Japan over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The end of autumn is when northerners start stocking up on
cabbages to face the winter. These always accompanied white
radishes and potato as the most common food in winter, and the
mountains of cabbage were a staple feature of Western news
coverage of China.
</P>
<P>
The government even fixed the price of Chinese cabbage to make
certain that every family could afford enough of the vegetables to
get it through the winter.
</P>
<P>
But, thanks to a decade of changes across the country, both
quality and quantity of vegetables have improved and people can
now get plenty of alternative vegetables fresh from greenhouses
even in the coldest months of the year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the demand for the three vegetables declined in
recent years and Beijing took the lid off Chinese cabbage prices
last year. Chinese cabbages weren't moving quickly in Beijing this
year and farmers, worried by dropping prices, turned to overseas
markets for a solution.
</P>
<P>
One company was informed that this ordinary vegetable would do
well in Japan, the ROK, Singapore, and Hong Kong, so, more than
1,700 farmers in Changping signed contracts for exported Chinese
cabbage and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Early reports are that it is doing well in Yugoslavia where it
can bring just over 3 U.S. dollars per kilogram. The price in
Beijing is still less than three cents.
</P>
<P>
Changping plans to increase its vegetable farms by 50 percent
to about 800 hectares next year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Studying Possible Legal Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's State Police
Sunday admitted they are studying for possible legal violations in
the case of student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
But the police refused to confirm a probe into Hariyadi
Dharmawan, a signatory to a joint communique offering formation of
a government presidium.
</P>
<P>
A group of 17 people Thursday issued a joint communique calling
for the establishment of a Provisional People's Consultative
Assembly and eventually a presidium which would serve as a
provisional government.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique signed by among others Kemal Idris, leader
of National Front opposition group, and Sukmawati Sukarnoputri,
the youngest daughter of founding president Soekarno.
</P>
<P>
"I won't comment on individuals, but in general the police are
studying the problem by collecting information to reach a
conclusion on what had really happened," Chief of the State
Police's Information Service Brig. Gen. Togar M. Sianipar said.
</P>
<P>
If the study shows that certain parties are found guilty in the
case, the police would take further measures against them,
Sianipar told Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Students have been at the forefront of protests the whole week,
demanding that the People's Consultative Assembly, the highest
legislative body, institute deeper political reform.
</P>
<P>
A number of recent incidents occurring in different places have
led to anarchic actions, Sianipar said, citing looting and
destruction at the Senen shopping center in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen shops and banks were looted, torched or pelted
with stones in various parts of the city Saturday. It was reported
that the Jakarta Police now seized 40 persons suspected of looting
and setting fire for questioning.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on certain parties masterminding
various actions, Sianipar said his side has in general identified
them but it remained upholding the principle of the presumption of
innocence.

<HEADLINE> Five Nigerian Hospitals Capable for Test Tube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Five private hospitals in
Nigeria have acquired the capability of external fertilization to
alleviate the sorrows of infertile women seeking babies through
assisted reproduction.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper said Sunday that with the acquisition
of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) capability at the cost of 50
million Naira (about six million U.S. Dollars), scores of
Nigerian women with tubal damage could seek babies within the
country instead of going abroad.
</P>
<P>
Professor Giwa Osagie of the Advanced Fertility Center
explained that the result of IVF treatment undertaken in Nigeria
are comparable with those obtained at the IVF centers in Europe
and America with egg recoveries rate of 85 percent and
fertilization rate of 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, clinical pregnancy rate of 20 percent and
delivery rate of six percent being recorded by Nigerian centers
are worse than the 30 percent and 10 percent from Europe, America
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Osagie blamed this on late attendance at clinics and advanced
age of Nigerian women who seek IVF treatment at the age of over
35.
</P>
<P>
Growing rate of infertility problem is driving many women to
seek IVF service, the paper said, adding that 10-14 percent of
couples have infertility problem in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
According to Richard Ajayi, managing director of Bridge Clinic
in Lagos, his clinic which started IVF service three months ago
has recruited 50 patients for the treatment, but treatment is yet
to commence until November 28 when the British experts will
arrive in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria achieved a breakthrough in test tube baby in 1989 at
the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, the first of its kind in
west and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 breakthrough could not be sustained due to lack of
government's interest in the IVF project.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has pledged to the National Commission on Human Rights
(Komnas HAM) to give explanation about the riots that have
occurred recently after collecting inputs from various sides.
</P>
<P>
"The government will seek inputs, both from the security forces
and the people," State Secretary Akbar Tanjung told reporters
after accompanying Habibie in receiving Komnas HAM members here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the commission urged the government to make
an immediate explanation to the public regarding the November 13
incident in which 11 people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
"The government has yet to decide whether or not it will form a
fact finding team to investigate the incident," Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment whether or not the government would set
a deadline for the team to work because usually the government
would first collect as many inputs as possible from various
sources.
</P>
<P>
The government gave wide opportunities to the people to send
inputs including through mass media both print or electronic, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the commission's demand for a follow-up of the
outcomes of the just-ended People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)
special session on the probe into former president Soeharto's
alleged wealth, Tanjung disclosed that the Attorney General Office
had already inquired some 70 banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney General (Andi Mohammad Ghalib) has received an
official report saying that former president Soeharto has 21
billion rupiah (2.6 million U.S. dollars), not trillions as
reported by the media in his accounts," he said.

NEW DELHI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- An Indian minister vowed
Sunday to lodge a protest at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against the United States for its decision to blacklist 40 Indian
entities from having any business and trade link with American
companies.
</P>
<P>
"We will lodge a strong protest against the U.S. action since
it is particularly not consistent with the WTO policies and
regulations," Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde said on the
sidelines of the inaugural session of the Group-77 Trade
Conference which opened here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration decided Friday to bar 40 Indian
entities and their over 200 subsidiaries from having any business
and trade ties with companies of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the latest U.S. action would hurt India's
exports, the Indian minister said India would find other markets
than the U.S. to export its goods.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times reported Sunday that Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee has written to United States President Bill
Clinton, expressing his unhappiness over a shift in Washington's
stand in its dialogue with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
On remarks by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott at
the Brookings Institute earlier this week which revealed the
contents of the negotiations between the two countries, Vajpayee
complained that Washington breached an understanding reached
earlier on the mode of the talks.

the ban by the U.S. as "coercive and counter-productive".

<HEADLINE> Russia Starts Evacuation of Citizens From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Saturday,
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Baghdad would allow
the inspectors of both the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to return and resume
their normal missions.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council reviewed Aziz's
letter. Among the 15 members of Security Council, the United
States was the only one that called Iraq's offer unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Washington said Iraq set conditions for its resumption of
cooperation in an annex to the letter and that its threat of
military strikes against Baghdad remained in place.
</P>
<P>
In the annex, Iraq stated its views on the proposed
comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N relevant
resolutions by the Security Council and the restructure of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Russia said Iraq, both in Baghdad and in New York, had mad it
clear that the annex was not listing conditions but stating
Baghdad's view. China and France shared the same view with
Russia. Britain said it was skeptical about Iraq's decision.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, attending the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, warned that any unilateral
actions against Iraq would aggravate the situation.

TOKYO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The 1993 world champion Junko
Asari held off the strong challenge from fellow Japanese Ari
Ichihashi to win the Tokyo international women's marathon in a
thrilling finish here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a shoulder-to-shoulder battle against fellow Ichihashi in
the last five kilometers, Asari lost her lead briefly in the last
100 meters but surged ahead again to cross the finishing line in
two hours 28 minutes 29 seconds, only a half a step faster than
Ichihara, who also clocked the same time.
</P>
<P>
Asari won the 1995 Tokyo marathon to be nominated for the

developing a blister. But she showed she had recovered from the
slow finish by coming into second at the Rotterdam marathon.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Azumi Miyazaki took third place in her debut marathon
in 2:30:06, while Katrin Dorre-Heining of Germany, three-time

<HEADLINE> UN International Staff Not Yet Return to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
international staff have not yet returned to Afghanistan due to
the Taliban militia's failure to fully implement the agreement
reached last month.
</P>
<P>
The News Network International quoted a U.N. official as saying
Sunday, "We have not yet sent international staff to Afghanistan
and are still waiting for progress on the security agreement by
the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the U.N. signed a "security agreement" in
Islamabad on October 23 which had made the militia responsible for
the security of U.N. personnel and U.N. premises in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N pulled about 50 foreign workers out of Afghanistan on
August 21 after the killing of an Italian U.N. worker who was shot
dead during an angry demonstration against the U.S. cruise missile
attack on Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden in the eastern province
of Khost.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a small team of the U.N. staff would have
to return to Afghanistan to assess the situation after progress on
the agreement by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. official said the accord has not been fully
implemented. The return of international U.N. staff depends on
implementation of the agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are bound, under the accord, to give a detailed
report about the killing of three staff members in the
Taliban-controlled areas this year. However, the Taliban are
reported to have failed to present a satisfactory report.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Taliban would have to provide
protection to the U.N. premises. It also guaranteed that if any
U.N. staff member is detained they should be released within 72
hours in the absence of formal charges against them.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and other international relief agencies have other
outstanding issues with the Taliban including equal access to
women and girls, adequate health care for women and restrictions
on working women.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement did not mention the women issue.

<HEADLINE> Donors Likely to Mediate Government-Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of different
donor countries and agencies in Dhaka are likely to mediate a
dialog between the Bangladeshi government and the major opposition
aimed at reaching an agreement to shun "hartal" as a political
weapon, a newspaper reported here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The donors' representatives will meet Leader of the opposition
and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson Begum Khaleda
Zia soon to discuss the political situation in the country and
work out a consensus to avoid hartal, The Bangladesh Observer
quoted sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The representatives had a schedule to meet Khaleda Zia on
November 8, but their meeting was not held as BNP was preparing to
observe hartals in the following three days, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They recently conveyed their concern on the deteriorating
political situation to both the government and the major
opposition, urging them to avoid political confrontation to face
the challenges generated due to the recent deluge and the regional
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The donors' representatives held a meeting last week with
Finance Minister S.A.M.S Kibria, at which the latest political
situation was discussed with a view to shunning hartal and street
agitation, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Following the discussions, the finance minister announced that
if opposition refrained from hartal during the tenure of the
present government, the ruling party Awami League would not call
hartal in the future when it would be in opposition.
</P>
<P>
But, The BNP turned down the finance minister' proposal saying
that the proposal did not come from the highest level of the
government, and BNP leader Ashraf Hossain told newsmen at a recent
press conference that if the proposal would have come from the
highest level of the government, his party would consider holding
discussion on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister told newsmen on another
occasion that he made the proposal after having consultation with
Prime Minister and chairperson of the Awami League Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister further stated that if the BNP agreed to
shun "hartal politics," the prime minister could make formal
proposal to hold discussions on this issue.
</P>
<P>
However, when contacted, BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan refrained from making any comment on the latest proposal
of the finance minister, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether there are 15 donor countries and 12 international
agencies, which donate about 2 billion U.S. dollars every year to
help the country in economic and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries include Australia, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States, while agencies
include the Asian Development Bank, the Council of Europe, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Capital is Quiet on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Indonesian
Capital is quiet on Sunday, and the security is under control
after the local security forces took preventive measures in
different trade and shopping centers prone to disturbances.
</P>
<P>
"As the security is recovered, the people can resume
activities, particularly after the main streets, shopping and
trade centers are reopened," a press release from the Jakarta
Information task force said.
</P>
<P>
The security forces will continue to maintain the security and
stability in the city, the press release signed by the task
force's chief Lt. Col. D.J. Nachrowi said.
</P>
<P>
The task force called on the people to avoid crowds and be
aware of harmful provocation.
</P>
<P>
Following a sporadic riot in some parts of the capital city on
Saturday, most of the shops, supermarkets and entertainment
centers across the city are closed on Sunday, but traditional
markets are opened as usual, although the number of sellers and
buyers are relatively less than in the normal days.
</P>
<P>
Several main streets in the capital city were still deserted,
particularly after Governor Sutiyoso advised the people to stay
indoors after 10 p.m. following Saturday's looting, demolition and
incinerations.
</P>
<P>
The streets were also cleared from the military blockade except
a number of marine troops who were still staying on guard. There
was no other military unit seen on the scene following fierce
attacks against several police officers by overwhelming numbers of
mass.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students, who stayed in front of the Parliament
building on Saturday, eventually dispersed and left the building
peacefully after security forces persuaded them to leave.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Police now seized 40 persons suspected
of looting and setting fire for questioning.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen shops and banks were looted, torched or pelted
with stones in various parts of the city on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Of the suspects, none is university student. It indicates that
certain parties have taken advantage of the student rallies to
create riots," Nachrowi said as quoted by the press release.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Regrets Over Clinton's Absence at APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday expressed regret over the news that U.S.
President Bill Clinton will not be able to attend the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' informal meeting on November
17-18.
</P>
<P>
"If U.S. President Bill Clinton had come here for the APEC
leaders' summit, he would have known that contrary to press
reports, Malaysia is a peaceful country," he told reporters during
a dialogue session after opening the APEC Business Summit here.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton had never been to Malaysia although many
Americans have been here.
</P>
<P>
"Some have never been here but talk about the deteriorating
situation in Malaysia," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
On the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq, Mahathir said he had
always hoped that "we can settle the Iraq problem through
negotiation. I do not think that bombing Iraq would do anything
better to solve the problem."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest reports that Clinton would not be
coming to the APEC leaders' informal meeting due to the problems
with Iraq, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
Sunday Malaysia feels that it is better for U.S. President Bill
Clinton to attend the APEC summit here despite being bogged down
by the problems.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "if Clinton has problems at home and cannot
attend, it does not matter." "Even without the presence of
Clinton, the APEC summit will go ahead as scheduled," he said
after bilateral talks with Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs
Masahiko Komura.

<HEADLINE> Russia Evacuates Embassy Staff From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday morning
evacuated some 80 of its non-essential embassy staff and family
members from Iraq for fear that the U.S. could launch military
strikes against Iraq, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that the
embassy staff and their family members left Baghdad at 10 a.m.
local time, and that they would go back to Moscow via Iran,
instead of Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This came as the United States National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said on Saturday that Iraq's offer to allow the United
Nations inspections to resume was "unacceptable," and the
U.S. remained poised for military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday sent a
letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying Iraq would
allow an unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections, a
move many observers believe that will possibly ward off an
imminent U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Annan termed the Iraqi decision as "positive", saying that he
believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Berger said the Iraqi offer was "neither unequivocal
nor uncondtional," referring to the two-page annex attached to
the letter to Annan.
</P>
<P>
In response, Iraqi envoy to the U.N. Nazar Hamdoun said in New
York Saturday the annex was not linked with the letter, and it was
just what Iraq hoped to see after it resumed cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors. He reiterated that the Iraqi decision was
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on October 31 decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) until the U.N. Security Council moves toward lifting the
trade sanctions imposed on it after its 1990 invation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council in an announcement on November 5 condemned
the Iraqi move and urged it to rescind the decision immediately
and unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been stepping up its military presence in the
Gulf in preparation for an attack to force Iraq to reverse
course.

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
extended welcome to Iraq's decision to unconditionally resume
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Upon reporters' request to comment on Iraq's decision to
unconditionally resume cooperation with the two organizations,
which was announced in a letter sent by Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Saturday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said
China hopes that Iraq will honor its commitment and earnestly
implement relevant resolutions of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that concerned parties will continue to make
political and diplomatic efforts to seek an early solution to the
weapons inspection crisis in Iraq," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China has all along stood for a peaceful
solution to the crisis and has maintained close contacts with
relevant parties to seek a settlement of the crisis through
political and diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, together with some other permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council and relevant parties, has supported
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to mediate the matter, and has
played a constructive role in helping Annan to send a letter to
Iraqi leaders.

<HEADLINE> Defense Exposition to Be Held in S. Africa </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Defense Exposition
of South Africa (DEXSA) '98 is due to be held between November 17
and 21 at an airforce base outside Pretoria, a news release said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
DEXSA '98, different from its previous ones which focused
closely on presenting South African defense equipment to
potential buyers, will become an international defense
exposition, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 companies from 21 countries have taken space at
DEXSA'98 to showcase themselves to the South African and other
African armed forces.
</P>
<P>
National pavilions have been set up for companies from
Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
There will also be 131 South African companies displaying a
range of defense and related products.
</P>
<P>
DEXSA '98 is the fourth "Dexsa", and will probably be the last
in the present form. The current thinking is that from 2000,
DEXSA will be combined with Aerospace Africa to develop a larger,
more efficient vehicle for demonstrating defense and related
equipment and systems, the organizers said.

Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said in his statement that
he strongly condemned the attacks against the Turkish journalists
in Rome by a group of supporters of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) and was very worried about this situation in the
capital of Italy.
</P>
<P>
The PKK supporters held demonstrations in Rome Saturday in

upon his arrival in the capital by a Russian airlines passenger
plane.

<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz also a statement,
strongly denouncing the attacks at the Turkish reporters in
Rome.

Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported from Rome Saturday that
a group of supporters of Turkey's rebel Kurdish Workers' Party

Turkish Ambassador to Rome Inal Batu sent a note to the
Italian Foreign Ministry to condemn the attacks.

<HEADLINE> ABAC Commits to Liberalizing Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) Sunday reaffirms its commitment to
liberalizing goods and services markets through the elimination of
tariff and non-tariff measures.
</P>
<P>
This liberalization is the most effective path to sustained
growth and economic recovery in the region, ABAC said in a
statement to APEC trade ministers who are at a two-day meeting
here from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There is unanimous consensus among ABAC members in support of
EVSL (Early voluntary Sectoral Liberalization), a vital part of
this process," ABAC EVSL task force co-chairs, John F. Smith and
T.K. Mcdonald said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
ABAC also believes that, where concessions and flexibility are
needed, then the principle of tariff staging should be considered
rather than opting out of sectors or product coverage, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
ABAC welcomed the leaders' decision in Vancouver to initiate
the EVSL process, it said.
</P>
<P>
ABAC was appointed by APEC leaders to advise them on APEC
policy initiatives from a business perspective.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders will begin their 6th informal meeting here on
November 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Criticizing Cheating Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Youth Daily carried
a commentary Saturday criticizing cheating activities in the
presence of Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quoted a report by the "Focus Report" of the
China Central Television (CCTV) on November 12, which said that a
grain distribution station in Nanling County of east China's Anhui
Province borrowed large quantities of grain from other grain
stations and grain processing factories to cheat Premier Zhu
Rongji that the station has plenty of grain in its grain depots
early this year.
</P>
<P>
The county also refused to implement the central government's
policy on buying farmers' extra grain at protective prices, and
only purchased 50 percent of the set quotas. The county covered up
all these in its report to Zhu during his inspection.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that some places often fabricate
fake statistics, examples and evidence to cheat leaders at higher
levels, and the masses of people have been very angry with such
activities.
</P>
<P>
The commentary cited several facts and praised the Chinese
government as a government which seeks truth from facts and is not
easy to be cheated.
</P>
<P>
The commentary also warned that any cheating activity, just as
that of the grain station, is doomed to get nowhere.

CAIRO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley, who arrived in
Egypt Friday night, met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Daley said that he imparted to
Mubarak the U.S. administration desire to boost and develop
economic ties with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the U.S. is keen to boost regional
cooperation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday that he
hoped that chances for resolving the Iraq crisis peacefully will
increase by Baghdad's backdown from its October 31 ban on the
U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Saturday in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan that it rescinded its October 31 decision and
unconditionally allowed the return of the inspectors of the
U.N. Special Commission, which oversees Iraq's dismantling of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev is due in

Russian President Boris Yeltsin is expected to visit Egypt
early next year at the invitation of Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Israel Closes Down Al-Hakawati Theater in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua)-- Israeli authority issued an
order Sunday morning, closing down the Palestinian Al-Hakawati
Theater in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued after receiving the news that the Fatah
Movement of Palestine was scheduled to convene a conference at the
theater Sunday morning to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the
Tunis declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
After the theater's closing down, members of the Fatah, the
main stream of Palestinian political faction set up by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, and other Palestinians were forced to move to
the Orient House in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have surrounded the theater and the
Orient House, which is in fact a representative office of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians started the tenth anniversary celebrations in
various cities of Gaza and the West Bank on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally attended by thousands on Saturday in
Nablus, Arafat reaffirmed that he will declare an independent
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital next May,
when the five-year transitional period of the Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cautioned that if
the Palestinians declare statehood, Israel reserves the right to
stop the process and annex those parts of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip still under its control.
</P>
<P>
In response to Arafat's Saturday speech, Netanyahu's
communication advisor David Bar-Illan reiterated that Israel's
position that such a unilateral declaration would be not just a
violation of the Oslo Accord, but its cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accord signed in 1993, the final-status talks
between the Palestinians and Israel should be concluded as the
five-year transitional period expires next May.
</P>
<P>
But in reality, such talks, which will solve the issues as
refugees, border and the status of Jerusalem, have not started yet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat declared Palestine's independence 10 years ago in Tunis,
which has been recognized by many countries of the world.

Kuala Lumpur, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from the APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) member economies want the
Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL) issue to be settled
here at the ministerial level, Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministers at the tenth APEC ministerial
meeting are expected to make a final decision on the EVSL issue
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian deputy Prime minister Tim Fischer said
some progress has been made on the EVSL scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers are working to solve the sticky points in
implementing landmark tariff cuts under the EVSL, following
Japan's insistence that it would not reduce tariffs on fishery and
forestry products due to domestic political sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
The EVSL scheme which was agreed upon in the last APEC meeting
in Vancouver seeks to cut tariffs in nine sectors -- fishery
products, forestry products, gems and jewelry, toys, chemical
products, energy, electronics, medical equipment and
telecommunication.

resume economic growth and strengthen international financial
system.

<P>
In addition, Jiang will also have a wide-ranging exchange of
opinions and views with leaders of other APEC members on bilateral
ties, relevant questions of the APEC and the international and
regional situation.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Another earthquake measuring
4.8 magnitude on the open-ended Richter scale jolted the town of
Khonj in Iran's southern province of Fars Saturday evening, the
official news agency IRNA reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 1926 hours local time (1556 hours GMT)
Saturday and the seismological base of the provincial capital of
Shiraz, affiliated to geophysics center of Tehran University,
registered the epicenter of the quake at 230 kilometers south of
the base.
</P>
<P>
The quake caused no damage or injury, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a strong quake with a magnitude of 5.7 on the
open-ended Richter scale rocked 3,000-people Khonj, killing five
and inured 105 others.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that 10 aftershocks with the intensity of less than

stay outdoors overnight in fear of fresh quakes.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 tents have been distributed in the past two days and
relief operations continue in the region, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Tries to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
fully committed to tackling the long vexing poverty facing the
country and has lined up a five-point strategy to deal with
problem, according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted acting Community and Social
Development Minister Newstead Zimba as saying Saturday in Ndola,
northern Zambia, that the five-point plan is aimed at reducing
poverty by at least 20 percent by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Opening a one-day national consensus building workshop on the
poverty reduction draft plan, he said the plan is geared toward
achieving broad based socio-economic growth through agricultural
and rural development, the provision of the requisite public
physical infrastructure as well as increasing the productivity of
urban micro-enterprises and informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis is to be placed on human resources development as
well as the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the
various poverty reduction programs and activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimba, who is also Information Minister, said the plan is a
crucial component of the government moves to help lift the people
out of their poverty-stricken levels and instead participate
fully in the process of national development.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said his country has now been listed among the least
developed countries in the world with at least 70 percent of its
population living in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
"This means that 70 percent of the population live in a
situation of inadequate basic needs like food, clothing, housing,
education and health. With this level of poverty, it is
difficult to attain acceptable socio-economic development," Zimba
said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time since last month's Wye agreement,
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat publicly
revived the idea Saturday of unilaterally declaring an independent
state on May 4, 1999, prompting an angry reaction from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan
reiterated Israel's position that such an act would be "not just
a violation of the accord - but its cancellation."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Inflation figures for October will show a record consumer
price index (CPI) rise of 3 to 4 percent, the highest monthly rise
in 13 years, experts predict.
</P>

NEW DELHI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee has written to U.S. President Bill Clinton
expressing his unhappiness over a shift in Washington's stand in
its dialogue with New Delhi, the Hindustan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, in his widely
publicized address to the Brookings Institute earlier this week,
revealed for the first time the contents of the negotiations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Clinton, Vajpayee complained that Washington
breached an understanding reached earlier on the mode of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hindustan Times did not say when the letter was
written.
</P>
<P>
There are misgivings in New Delhi over the timing of Talbott's
revelation since the seventh round of his negotiations with Indian
Prime Minister's special envoy Jaseant Singh is scheduled for next
Thursday in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Indian termed on Saturday as "coercive and counter-productive"
the action of the United State on Friday barring 40 Indian
entities along with their more than 200 subsidiaries from having
any kind of business or trade relations with U.S. companies.

UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations Security Council suspended
its meeting on Iraq's letter late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Council was expected to take actions after reviewing the
letter, but it failed to reach consensus. Iraq sent a letter to
U.N. chief Kofi Annan Saturday morning, saying that it had decided
to rescind its decisions of August 5 and October 31 and resume
full and complete cooperation with the United Nations arms
inspectors. (UN-Iraq-Suspension)

UNITED NATIONS -- Iraq assured its unconditional cooperation
with the U.N. weapons inspection mission on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It said that a previous letter allowing the return of the
U.N. arms inspection teams, sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Saturday morning from Baghdad, was "unconditional and
unequivocal" and quite separate from an accompanying annex voicing
Iraqi wishes.
</P>
<P>
The annex was said to have become the focus of the on-going
discussion here by the 15-member Security Council, and one U.N.
official said that "this could be a long night" for the Council.
Earlier, the United States said the annex set unacceptable
conditions for the return of U.N. arms inspectors.

BELGRADE -- U.S. envoy Christopher Hill said Saturday that the

peace process in Kosovo, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are coming to the point where we start thinking
about what this agreement is going to look like, get all the
details down," he said in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, after a
meeting with Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority. Describing the discussion as "very good," Hill said
they agreed in general on a timetable for a proposed new peace
accord to solve the Kosovo crisis. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo-US Envoy)

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Check Importation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government is
concerned about the amount of imported finished goods in the
country and is working out measures to arrest the situation.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Saturday by Jazzman Chikwakwa, Deputy
Minister of Commerce and Industry, when he was speaking at the
commissioning of a tyre retreading plant in Ndola, capital of
Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Sunday quoted the deputy minister as saying
the government is worried that subsidize finished goods from
abroad are putting the local manufacturers at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government is acting to give the Zambian
manufacturing sector a fair production deal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has been urged to either ban "dumped
goods" to come from abroad or give the local industries the short
term protective support required.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from Amanita Premier Oils Limited, a local edible
oil producer, expressed his concern over the importation of cheap
Zimbabwean goods.
</P>
<P>
He told the paper Saturday that Zambia's edible oil and feed
cake industries are now struggling to compete against Zimbabwean
goods which he said are arriving in the country at price levels
that do not make economic sense.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman complained that the low priced goods are causing
serious problems for local manufacturers with large quantities of
Zambian produced raw materials such as cotton seed, sunflower and
soybeans.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Thai black tiger
prawn farmers threatened to travel to the capital and rally
outside the Government House if the government continues to ignore
their plight, the Bangkok Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are from the southern provinces of Nakhon Si
Thammarat, Songkhla, Surat Thani and Pattani.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp farmers' groups said that since the beginning of this
year, the price of Thailand's famous black tiger prawns has
dropped by as much as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The situation has affected over a million shrimp farmers in 35
of Thailand's 76 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The groups said the government has refused to respond to calls
for help despite the fact that the black tiger prawns were a major
export item, bringing into the country some 50 billion baht (1.35
billion U.S. dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
The farmers want a welfare fund of at least 3 billion baht
(81.1 million dollars) to be set up to subsidize shrimp prices,
the same way the government has done to help sugarcane farmers and
rubber planters.
</P>
<P>
The groups said 100 representatives of shrimp farmers in the
four southern provinces will submit proposals to the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
If the government takes no action, about 10,000 shrimp farmers
will rally outside the Government House, they said.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has reiterated that her government was prepared for
talks with the Tamil rebels, the Sunday Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were
within a stipulated time-frame and irrespective of a cease-fire,
Kumaratunga told senior members of the Tamil United Liberation
Front (TULF) during a meeting here Friday, a TULF spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The government believes in a negotiated political settlement
for the ethnic crisis. But we cannot rush to talks with the LTTE.
We are prepared to talk to them within a stipulated time-frame
and then decide on the cease-fire depending on the progress of the
talks," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming to power in 1994, the government opened
talks with the LTTE, but in April 1995 the LTTE abruptly pulled
out to resume their protracted campaign for an independent
homeland in the island country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a war against the Sri Lankan
government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and
east of the country.

He said mothers at the same time will be provided with iron
supplements to ward off anemia, which afflicts 43 percent of the

</P>
<P>
The program was in line with his commitment to taking care of
poor Filipinos, many of whom cannot afford to buy vitamins for
their children, he added.
</P>
<P>
Almost 5 million pre-school children in the country suffer from
Vitamin A deficiency, while 17 children go blind daily, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua)-- Several Sri Lankan Tamil
political parties have condemned the appointment of Asoka
Jayawardane, a just-retired army officer, as the new governor of
the North-East Provincial Council.
</P>
<P>
A Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization spokesman said
Jayawardane's appointment showed that the government was tilting
towards military rule in the east, informed sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Congress leader Kumar Ponnambalam said it showed the
government wanted a military and not a political solution.
</P>
<P>
The Eelam People's revolution liberation Front's sources also
said that the appointment suggests that the government prefers a
military administration rather than a civil administration in the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
A Ceylon Worker's Congress spokesman said the appointment was a
continuation of the militarization of the northeast, the sources
added.
Major General Asoka Jayawardane, who retired last week as deputy
chief of staff of the Sri Lankan Army, was Friday named Governor
of the North-East by President Chandrika Kumaratunga.

<HEADLINE> Study: Traffic Congestion Not Just Big-City Problem in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The amount of time
commuters spent in traffic jams in small and medium-sized
U.S. cities has more than quadrupled since 1982, growing at a far
faster rate than it has in larger cities, according to a study
released this week.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, drivers in medium-sized and small cities like
Indianapolis, Kansas City, Rochester, Colorado Springs and Salt
Lake City have endured the biggest jump in traffic delays, an
increase ranging from 440 percent to 700 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study defines a medium-sized urban area as having a
population of over half a million and less than one million. A
small city is defined as having less than half a million residents.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Texas Transportation Institute, the
largest university-based transportation research organization in
the United States, analyzed traffic in 70 cities across the
country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The organization has measured an area's population density,
traffic volumes and the numbers of freeway and major street lanes
over the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that congestion levels since 1982 have risen
in all cities except two -- Phoenix and Houston. Los Angeles has
been having the worse traffic for 16 straight years, followed by
Washington D.C., Miami, Chicago and San Francisco-Oakland.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, drivers stuck in traffic wasted more
than 6.7 billion gallons of fuel in 1996, enough to fill 670,000
gasoline tank trucks.
</P>
<P>
In the country's most congested cities, the waste amounts to
more than 100 gallons per driver every year. The total cost of
traffic congestion in the cities studied amounted to almost 74
billion U.S. dollars. Delay costs account for 88 percent of that
total, with the remainder due to wasted fuel.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, researchers said a range of strategies
are required, including projects such as bus/carpool lanes,
transit operating and capital improvements, coordinating traffic
signals to speed traffic and removing crashes and vehicle
breakdowns from the traffic stream.
</P>
<P>
The possible solutions also include managing demand through
variable work hours or telecommuting, and rearranging the land use
patterns to decrease the reliance on motor vehicle travel, said
the study.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Take Part in 27 Int'l Trade Fairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will participate in
27 international trade fairs in the current fiscal year (July
1998-June 1999) to explore its export market, the Financial
Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997-98 fiscal year, the country participated in 16
international trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
Participation in trade fair is an important way of promoting
trade, Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) Director Faridul Hasan said
at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
As a least developed country, Bangladesh is on the verge of
marginalization in the free trade environment under the
globalization process, said vice-president Zafar Osman of the
Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).
</P>
<P>
"Our imports have been increasing by leaps and bounds but
exports have remained concentrated on a few items and in two
markets -- the United States and the European Union -- only,"
Osman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to diversify the country's exports and markets,
he emphasized, saying "participation in the international trade
fairs is one of the effective ways to popularize export products."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's exports sector has expanded rapidly in recent
years, with the ready-made garment export sector, the country's
biggest foreign exchange earner, growing at a rate of over 20
percent every year. The country exported 3.43 billion U.S.
dollars' worth of ready-made garment in 1997, and the export is
expected to exceed 4 billion dollars this year.

YANGON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- One more major bridge across
the Ayeyawaddy River in Myitkyina, Kachin state of Myanmar was

<HEADLINE> Getting world Back on Economic Feet Difficult: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday that with the financial crisis taking
on global proportions, getting the world back on its economic feet
is going to be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader was of the view that it would take a long
time for the world economy to be back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
With unscrupulous speculators causing untold damage
particularly to developing economies, currency traders freely
condemned governments for not being transparent while they
themselves were not, he said when opening the APEC Business Summit
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We should always be on the lookout for adverse consequences
and be prepared to take corrective actions or even to reverse
certain globalization trends," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir lamented over the present lack of a financial
architecture as manifested by the anarchical and regulated capital
flows in the international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
He said that owing to the currency crisis, the once prosperous
East Asian region which was a huge market for European and
American products has lost much of its purchasing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir cautioned against rushing towards globalization for it
can be abused in such a way that instead of worldwide prosperity,
there will be world poverty and disparities between rich and poor,
international and civil disorders and all kinds of crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization can bring about a better world if we are not
fanatical about it. Not everything that is done in the name of
globalization will give good results," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also slammed calls by some quarters that finance and
trade should be left to market forces, saying it was contradictory
to what was really happening because true free marketeers were
being penalized.

UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Saturday night reviewed a letter from Iraq
that promised to resume full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister sent a letter to U.N. chief Kofi
Annan, promising to allow U.N. arms inspectors to return
immediately to Baghdad and resume their regular work.
</P>
<P>
The Council's review was focused on an annex to the letter, in
which Iraq stated its views on the proposed comprehensive review
of its compliance with U.N relevant resolutions by the Security
Council and the restructure of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 members of Security Council, the United States was
the only one that called Iraq's offer unacceptable. The U.S. said
Iraq set conditions for its resumption of cooperation in the annex.
</P>

clear that the annex was not listing conditions but stating
Baghdad's view. China and France shared the same view with Russia.
</P>

QUITO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's banana exports in the
first 10 months this year dropped 20 percent from the same period
of last year, according to data released Saturday by an exporting
company, Rey Banano del Pacifico.

Banana exports between January and October dropped to 2.81
million tons from 3.47 million tons in the same period of 1997,
and 3.04 million tons in 1996.
</P>

The data show that after the good spell of the 1996-1997
period, when sales grew by 14 percent, the 1998 figures were the
lowest of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The plunge was caused not only by the slack demand of the Asian
and Russian markets, but also because of lower banana production
due to the "El Nino" weather phenomenon.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's gold production is
expected to grow rapidly in the next few years thanks to massive

</P>
<P>
Venezuela is expected to attract between 1999 and 2003 4.4

investment, 2.04 billion dollars, which will mainly take the form
of strategic associations with foreign companies, will be used to
raise the country's annual gold output to more than 33 tons after
the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's gold output varies between 1.0 and 1.2 tons a
year. Its gold ore reserves are estimated at 10,000 to 12,000

<HEADLINE> Iraq Assures Security Council of Unconditional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq assured its
unconditional cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspection mission
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It said that a previous letter allowing the return of the
U.N. arms inspection teams, sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Saturday morning from Baghdad, was "unconditional and
unequivocal" and quite separate from an accompanying annex voicing
Iraqi wishes.
</P>
<P>
The annex was said to have become the focus of the on-going
discussion here by the 15-member Security Council, and one U.N.
official said that "this could be a long night" for the Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the United States said the annex set unacceptable
conditions for the return of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Nizar Hamdoon, Iraqi permanent representative to the United
Nations, said he first informed the council president, Peter
Burleigh of the United States, orally and later in a letter, that
the annex "contains the views and preferences of the government of
Iraq" on a comprehensive review that the council had previously
agreed to carry out on how far Baghdad had complied with relevant
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"These views are not linked to the clear and unconditional
decision of the Iraqi Government to resume dealing with UNSCOM
(the U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction) and the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy
Agency)," said the letter, which was translated from the original
Arabic and could be circulated as a formal document of the council.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy told reporters here that the council president
promised to inform members about the explanatory letter, which
Burleigh, also charge d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, had requested.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said he sent the letter "so that no further confusion
should be acceptable."

"The issue right now is to resume the cooperation between Iraq
and UNSCOM. Our view on the comprehensive review could be
different than the views of the council," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Annan described the Iraqi letter as
"positive," saying that he believed Iraq's offer met demands of
solving the crisis, but later Washington termed it as
unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Makes Third Cabinet Reshuffle in a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar carried out a major
reshuffle of its 39-member cabinet Saturday for the third time in
a single year since the formation of the 19-member State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC) a year ago to replace the State Law and
Order Restoration Council (SLORC).
</P>
<P>
One more deputy prime minister, Lt. Gen. Tin Hla, was
appointed, while retaining his current post of Minister of
Military Affairs, thus bringing the number of deputy prime
ministers to three after Lt. Gen. Tin Tun and Vice-Admiral Maung
Maung Khin.
</P>
<P>
Of the four cabinet ministers changed, Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw, who served for more than 10 years in his post since the
SLORC took over the power of state on September 18, 1988, was
allowed to retire from duties and was replaced by U Win Aung, now
the ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Transport Lt. Gen. Tin Ngwe, who was
transferred to the Prime Minister's Office as Minister, was
replaced by former Minister of Industry-2 Maj. Gen. Hla Myint Swe.
</P>
<P>
The post of Minister of Industry-2 was taken by former Minister
of Hotels and Tourism Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin, who is concurrently
holding the chairmanship of the National Convention Convening
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Of the 33 deputy ministers, two were to retire from duties,
five newly appointed and one, who was deputy foreign minister U
Nyunt Swe, reassigned as member of the Civil Service Selection and
Training Board.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the reshuffle, The SPDC appointed four new
supreme court justices and allowed five former justices to retire,
with the job of Chief Justice U Aung Toe remaining unchanged who
still holds the chairmanship of the National Convention Convening
Work Committee.
</P>
<P>
On November 15, 1997, Myanmar carried out the first major
reshuffle of its cabinet as soon as the SPDC was formed, while the
SLORC was dissolved.
</P>
<P>
The government said in its latest report on the political
situation of Myanmar that the changes indicate the military
government regards itself as a transitional or a caretaker
government exacting a step-by-step transformation to democracy.
</P>
<P>
It argued that if the military government intends to hold on to
power as it has been accused of by the Western governments,
changes to the name of the government or members of its
administration are not necessary, stressing that it is a change of
substance, entity and identity.
</P>
<P>
The SPDC, formed then, retained four leaders of the SLORC with
Senior-Gen. Than Shwe as chairman, who also holds the post of
Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Gen. Maung Aye as
Vice-Chairman, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt as First Secretary and Lt. Gen.
Tin Oo as Second Secretary. Third Secretary Lt. Gen. Win Myint was
added to the SPDC.
</P>
<P>
Both Lt. Gen. Tin Tun and Vice-Admiral Maung Maung Khin were
also retained as Deputy Prime Ministers up to now.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the SPDC included those promoted from
commanders of all military regions.
</P>
<P>
Of the 39-member cabinet, 16 were then newly appointed. Some of
them were promoted from regional commanders or deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
Former senior cabinet ministers and a few former SLORC members
were then placed in a 14-member Advisory Body to the SPDC. The
body, however, was abolished in less than a month. Some of the 14
members were said to have been under investigation.
</P>
<P>
A major shift of military personnel was also carried out then
from high-level leaders to regional commanders.
</P>
<P>
In the second reshuffle of the cabinet in December 1997, eight
ministers had their ministerial posts exchanged and a new Minister
of Energy was appointed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the latest reshuffle comes in connection
with the development of Myanmar's political situation.
</P>
<P>
Whether these reshuffles could bring about some changes in the
government's policy remains to be seen, they said.

<HEADLINE> Graf to Challenge Davenport in Advanta Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Steffi Graf of
Germany beat sixth seed Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-4, 6-1
Saturday to enter the final of the Advanta Tennis Championships
in Pennsylvania, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Graf will face top seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States
tomorrow. Graf beat second seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland in
the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Davenport beat fifth seed Monica Seles of the United States
6-3, 6-3 in another semifinal today.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who beat Tauziat to win her homeland tournament last
week in Leipzig, needed just over an hour to dispose of her
rival. With the victory, Graf improved to 21-0 lifetime without
losing a set against Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
Graf will be gunning for her 106th singles title -- tops among
active players -- and third in only her 12th tournament of an
injury-filled season.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Davenport has reached the final of three of
her last four tournaments, including a victory at the European
Championships in Zurich in her most recent event.

<HEADLINE> Low Expectations for Indonesian Athletic Success in Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- With 125 Indonesian athletes
taking part in the upcoming Asian Games in Bangkok next month,
sports authorities have voiced their satisfaction with a haul of
only six gold medals, the Indonesian Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the national sports development organization has
maintained a badminton team with the same high standards that won
three golds in the Hiroshima Asian Games four years ago, these
medals should remain safely in Indonesian hands in December.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated golds are expected to include two in the
badminton events and another four, each from the karate,
taekwondo, weightlifting and tennis competitions.
</P>
<P>
Given Indonesia's past record at the Hiroshima Asian Games,
where the nation's athletes took three gold, 12 silver and 11
bronze medals, the new target of six golds is predicted to be a
reasonably realistic task.
</P>
<P>
However, considering the high level of competition the
sportsmen and women will be facing at the games, the anticipated
results are not a forgone conclusion. Indonesia will certainly
have to struggle to meet its target of six golds, let alone
bidding for nine, and a number of the country's athletes have
even predicted a figure far lower than that announced officially.
</P>
<P>
M.F. Siregar, a former official on Indonesia's sport governing
body (KONI), said it would be "good" if Indonesia could manage
three golds, and "excellent" if it could get four.
</P>
<P>
Such lowly predictions follow from the ongoing monetary crisis
which has adversely intervened during the team preparations. The
soaring U.S. dollar has prompted KONI to tighten its budget,
effecting the training programs of most of the country's sports
federations.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia may be the dominant nation at the Southeast Asian
Games, the paper said, but it has yet to seriously challenge top
athletes from other Asian nations and since its best ever
performance in the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta, it has
consistently struggled.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian Games in Seoul, the Indonesian contingent could
only carry one tennis gold, four silver and 11 bronze medals.
Four years later in Beijing, Indonesian athletes improved their
haul to three golds in tennis and boxing, with six silvers and 22
bronzes.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming Asian Games, Indonesia will be fighting to
maintain its three gold medals, won at the Hiroshima Games.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Urges New Steps to Carry Forward Kosovo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Christopher Hill
said Saturday that the time has arrived to work out a new formula
to carry forward the peace process in Kosovo, the Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are coming to the point where we start thinking
about what this agreement is going to look like, get all the
details down," he said in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, after a
meeting with Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority.
</P>
<P>
Describing the discussion as "very good", Hill said they agreed
in general on a timetable for a proposed new peace accord to solve
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hill also briefed Rugova on his talks held here Friday with
Milan Milutinovic, president of Republic of Serbia, who received a
copy of the draft new accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. envoy, Milutinovic said he would leave
for Pristina next week to invite ethnic Albanian leaders to peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Hill expressed the hope that the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) verification mission would help
implement the agreement reached between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.

<HEADLINE> Denmark to Hold Plebiscite in 2001 on If Joining EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Denmark will hold a
nationwide plebiscite in 2001 on whether to join the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), according to press reports here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the first ever revealment of the government's intentions
over the matter, Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen said Friday that
the government is going to publicize the matter late this month
and parliament will begin to debate the issue before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The EMU will enter operation in early 1999 when the euro is
introduced into some European Union (EU) members. The time would
be ripe for the Danish to consider whether to join the EMU after
seeing the progress in other countries, Rasmussen noted.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the belief that the EMU will help stabilize the
Danish economy and currency, Rasmussen said he hoped the public
would say "yes" to Denmark's participation.
</P>
<P>
"I see this as one of the most important diplomatic missions in
my term as prime minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has conducted five polls in the past few years on its
relations with the EU because the Danish have had different views
on the development of the European Community and the EU. Denmark
joined the European Community in 1973.
</P>
<P>
More and more Danish people are showing positive attitudes
towards their country's participation into the EMU, according to
media reports.

<HEADLINE> China Diamond Market Continues to Flourish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Consumption of diamond jewelry
in China has bucked the declining trend in much of the rest of Asia,
according to today's China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes De Beers, whose sales of rough diamonds
account for 75 percent of the world's total, as saying that the
growth of diamond jewelry sales in China continues to be well
above average for Asia, reaching 8.5 percent in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
"China has a growing consumer market for diamond jewelry,
which reflects the great growth of the economy," said Philip
Dobbs, China operations representative of De Beers, the largest
diamond mining company in the world.
</P>
<P>
Dobbs said China had a flourishing cutting and polishing
industry and an expanding diamond jewelry manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
The continuing recession in Japan and the Southeast Asian
economic and currency turmoil have presented the diamond industry
with considerable difficulties.
</P>
<P>
However, the retail value in China of diamond jewelry has been
on the rise. Sales by the De Beers Central Selling Organization
stood at 451 million US dollars in the first half of this year,
increasing by a wide margin from 1996. The average price per piece
has also risen -- to 565 U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic about the long-term prospects of the
emerging market in China," said Joan Braune, regional director of
the corporate communications department of De Beers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia National Front Said to Support Demonstrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian National Front
opposition group leader Lt. Gen. (ret) Kemal Idris admitted that
he had been behind the anti-government demonstrators, the
Indonesian Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the privately owned television network on
Saturday, Kemal Idris, a former chief of Army Paratroops, said he
was ready to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
The National Front, launched on August 6 to provide opposition
to the government, placed the blame for the present condition of
the country squarely at the feet of the current administration
under President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The National Front wanted the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) to hold a plenary meeting no later than November this year
to oust the present government and form a national presidium to
run the nation until next year's general election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mobs rioted in Jakarta as anger against the
military's treatment of student protesters in the past week boiled
over into riots in which shops were looted and buildings were
torched.
</P>
<P>
A mob of thousands rioted in the Central Jakarta district of
Senen, looting shops and shattering shop-front windows along a
crowded main street.
</P>
<P>
At least two vehicles were set alight.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Chinatown district, which bore the brunt of
savage riots in May, a car dealership was set on fire and two
trucks inside were wrecked. On the street outside, two overturned
cars were torched and two nearby buildings were also gutted by
fire.
</P>
<P>
In East Jakarta, police fired teargas and rubber bullets at a
mob which attacked a police station.
</P>
<P>
Cosmas Batubara, a former minister, quoted the Armed Forces
Chief as saying there were two groups within the protesters, one
of students, the other is an unknown third force wearing student
jackets.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta Military Commander Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman has urged
the city's 11 million residents to stay in their homes after 10
p.m. for the next few nights.
</P>
<P>
There have also been reports of student-led protests in cities
of Surabaya (East Java province) and Bandung (West Java province).
</P>
<P>
In the north Sumatran city of Medan, about 5,000 students
occupied the airport and demanded they be taken to Jakarta to join
anti-government protests. Security forces persuaded them to leave
without violence.
</P>
<P>
Students have been at the forefront of protests the whole week,
demanding that the MPR, the highest legislative body, institute
deeper political reform.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, which ended a special four-day session on Friday
night, went some way to meeting student demands though it
maintained its commitment to a military role in politics.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Indonesian capital remains unclear though
the military now seems to be in control of most areas of the city,
the Indonesian Observer said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to simplify,
as of today, protocol arrangements for seeing off and greeting the
country's Communist Party and state leaders on their visits
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made by the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and the State Council, said the send-off
and welcoming ceremonies for China's top Party and state leaders
will be held at the Great Hall of the People, and the number of
senior officials attending these ceremonies will be reduced

</P>
<P>
When lower-ranking Party and state leaders go abroad on visits
or return home from visits, they will be seen off or greeted by
officials from relevant departments only, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
The send-off or welcoming ceremonies were once held at the
airport. And in recent years, such ceremonies were held at the
Great Hall of the People, but with many leaders and officials
present on the occasion.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy could see
growth of 5.2 percent next year, buoyed by a stable baht, lower
inflation and greater stimulus measures from the government, a
report issued by the Siam Commercial Bank says.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecasts that the economy will continue to contract
by 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 1999 before turning
positive with 1.2 percent growth in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
After that, it is expected to rebound sharply, with 9.6 percent
growth in the third quarter and 14.6 percent growth in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The economy this year was expected to show a total contraction
of 7.4 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts are among the most optimistic to date. While many
analysts expect Thailand to begin recovery by mid-1999, growth
forecasts have mostly ranged in the order of 0-2 percent for the
year.

<HEADLINE> Action Urged to Protect Leasing Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Legislation is urgently needed
to guarantee the healthy development of leasing businesses in
China, according to today's China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The leasing sector has boomed over the past few years, covering
housing, household electronic appliances and computers,
automobiles, aircraft, and machinery and equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of problems have arisen, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Some leasing companies use fake and shoddy products, and some
lease holders defraud rental firms by taking advantage of their
opaque and backward management and supervision systems.
</P>
<P>
Other drawbacks include rental companies' failure to check the
credit records of customers, defaults on rental fees, violation of
contracts, and loss and damage to the items hired.
</P>
<P>
An incoherent government administrative system has also
hampered the growth of the industry.
</P>
<P>
China's first law pertaining to leasing contracts are still
under discussion at meetings of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, which is expected to come up with a
result by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Meeting on Climate Change Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Conference on Climate Change closed here Saturday without signing
any important document.
</P>
<P>
The conference decided to postpone until the year 2000 the
application of three mechanisms contained in the Kyoto protocol to
reduce the emission of greenhouse effect gases that cause the
climate change on the planet.
</P>
<P>
The conference, scheduled to complete its discussions on
Friday, continued until Saturday morning because of profound
disagreements between developed and developing countries over the
reduction of the emissions.
</P>
<P>
The conference called on governments to speed up the
implementation of the Kyoto protocol urging the developed
countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse effect gases

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Three goals from Dion Dublin
helped Aston Villa beat Southampton 4-1 in the English Premier
League on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, leaders Villa had three points clear of
Manchester United at the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
The result also gave Villa, unbeaten in 12 league matches,
their best ever start to a league season.
</P>
<P>
Paul Scholes scored twice as Manchester United leapfrogged
Arsenal into second place with a 3-2 win at home to a fighting
Blackburn Rovers side which was reduced to 10 men when captain
Tim Sherwood was sent off in the 47th minute.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn scored both their goals after Sherwood had gone off,
coming back from 3-0 down.
</P>
<P>
Champions Arsenal, hammered 5-0 by Chelsea in their midweek
League Cup clash, rang the changes for the visit of their former
manager George Graham with north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur,
but the match ended goalless.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, whose fans jeered Graham as a "Judas" before the
kickoff, dropped to third and a point behind United.
</P>
<P>
Former France coach Gerard Houllier, who took sole charge as
manager of Liverpool on Friday after the departure of co-manager
Roy Evans, watched his side take the lead on his full debut and
then slump 3-1 at Anfield to Graham's former club Leeds.

<HEADLINE> Johansson Beats Rusedski in Stockholm Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Todd Martin and
Thomas Johansson eliminated Britain's best to reach the singles
final of the Stockholm Open on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Martin rallied from a set down to beat third-seeded Tim Henman
4-6, 6-1, 6-2 in the first semifinal, while Johansson, the
highest 18th-ranked Swede, edged fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski 7-5,
7-6 (9-7) before a sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall.
</P>
<P>
Henman had clinched the seventh berth to the ATP Tour World
Championship in Hanover, Germany, later this month by winning
Friday's quarterfinals. Rusedski needed a victory to clinch the
eighth and last spot.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing, but at least I gave it a shot," Rusedski
said. "It will not be fun sitting as an alternate in Hanover. I
don't see (Yevgeny) Kafelnikov losing in Moscow."
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov needs to beat Goran Ivanisevic in front of his
Russian fans in Moscow's ATP Tour event Sunday to secure the eight
h berth in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski is the world's leading indoor player this year with
32 victories and he beat top-ranked Pete Sampras to win the Paris
Open last week.
</P>
<P>
But Rusedski, one of the biggest servers in the game, faced a
Swede playing perhaps the best tennis of his life in his favorite
indoor tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Swede, also a big server, broke Rusedski twice in the
first set, the last time for 6-5, and then held to love to close
out the set.
</P>
<P>
In the tiebreak, Johansson committed a rare double-fault to
give Rusedski a set point at 6-5. The Swede saved it with a
forehand passing shot into the corner. Another forehand winner
gave him the tiebreak 9-7 and the match.
</P>
<P>
Martin, ranked 21st on the ATP Tour, played near flawless
tennis after losing the first set to Henman.
</P>
<P>
Martin won one ATP Tour event this year in Barcelona on clay.
He also reached the semis in Indianapolis, Vienna and the Paris
Open.
</P>
<P>
After dropping the opening set, Martin broke Henman twice to
level the match at one set apiece.
</P>
<P>
Martin got off to a perfect start in the decider, breaking
Henman's serve after two straight unforced errors by the Briton,
and broke Henman again to lead 4-1, the fourth time the Briton
dropped his serve in his last five service games.
</P>
<P>
It was Martin's third victory in four matches against Henman.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Reiterate Unconditional Cooperation with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq would reiterate
late Saturday night that its decision to resume full and complete
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors was unconditional, a U.N.
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Iraq was ready to make the point in written
form to the United Nations Security Council on Saturday night,
clarifying that its decision to resume full cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) was unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would state in a letter that the annex to the letter that
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz sent to U.N. chief Kofi
Annan on Saturday morning was a "wish list", not a list of
conditions for Iraq to resume cooperation with the U.N., the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The nine-point annex deals mainly with a proposal for a
comprehensive review by the Security Council of how far Iraq has
progressed in carrying out U.N. disarmament requirements, which
Iraq says should lead to the lifting of sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The annex also says that the Council should seriously consider
"the question of Richard Butler and the structure of UNSCOM,"
referring to the UNSCOM chief whom Baghdad wants fired.
</P>
<P>
The United States said on Saturday that Iraq's promise to
resume full cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors was
unacceptable because it was conditional.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. chief on Saturday morning that
it had decided to rescind its decisions of August 5 and October 31
and to resume full cooperation with the U.N. arms inspectors.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has agreed to help
stop illegal Myanmar Immigrants coming to Thailand and to work on
joint tourism initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The 16th Local Thai-Myanmar Border Committee meeting, held in
northern Thailand on Friday, thrashed out the issue, the Bangkok
post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Col. Chayutti Boonparn urged Myanmar to stop
illegal immigration, saying it caused Thailand social problems.
</P>
<P>
Col. Chayutti's Myanmar counterpart Maj. Tin Ngwe promised to
toughen up cross-border procedures and stop people crossing at
non-authorized border points.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Tin Ngwe said he was concerned about the Karen National
Union allegedly using Thailand as a base for attacks on Myanmar
troops.
</P>
<P>
Col. Chayutti replied that Thai security forces had done their
best to prevent such attacks. He said the situation would be
improved when the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees started to
help monitor refugee camps in Thailand.

Habibie has entrusted the restoration of the security situation to
Security and Defense Minister/Armed Forces Commander General
Wiranto so that the president could leave the country for the APEC

</P>
<P>
"The president fully entrusted to Minister Wiranto the
restoration of security, including the need to see whether it is
necessary to detain certain people," Akbar said at the

At least 12 people have died in clashes between student

<HEADLINE> Jayasinghe Doping Affair not Ends, Top IAAF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Top Sri Lankan athlete
Susanthika Jayasinghe was still banned from competition by the
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) after she failed
a random drug test in April, a top official said in a letter
released by the Chinese Athletic Association here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Istvan Gyulai, gerneral secretary of IAAF, said: "I confirm
that the IAAF Doping Commission considered the question of the
athlete's reinstatement by the Athletic Federation of Sri Lanka.
The Commission does not agree to the reinstatement and will
recommend to the IAAF Council to refer the case to arbitration."
</P>
<P>
Gyulai added in the letter: "I will be able to provide more
information on this matter after the Coucil meeting which will
take place on 19-20 November 1998."
</P>
<P>
The letter was written by Gyulai on November 5 to Maurice
Nicholas, Honorary Secretary-Treasurer of Asian Amateur Athletic
Association (AAAA).
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, general secretary of the Chinese Athletic
Assocition (CAA), said on Sunday that CAA also received a copy of
the letter from AAAA.
</P>
<P>
Shang claimed last Friday that Jayasinghe has little hope to
run in the Asian Games to be held on December 6-20 in Bangkok,
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
However, Jayasinghe, who shot to fame last year by winning the
women's 200m silver medal at the World Athletic Championships in
Athens, said earlier in Colombo she knew nothing of the latest
threat to her career.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what this Chinese official is talking about. I
am fully cleared of any wrong doing and if the ban on me has not
been lifted, then I should be the first to know," the 23-year-old
told world wire service Agency France Press (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka Athletics authorities said in August the
suspension had been lifted by the IAAF, adding Jayasinghe had to
undergo tests for banned steroids every three months.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe has made the Sri Lankan Asian Games squad after
winning the 100m and 200m at the national athletic championships
on November 1.

<P>
PARIS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Fabrice Tiozzo of France
floored Brazilian Ezequiel Paixao in the second round to retain
his WBA cruiserweight title in Mont-De-Marsan on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Paixao hit the canvas towards the end of the first round after
Tiozzo had connected with a series of punches.
</P>
<P>
With two minutes of the second round gone, Tiozzo hit Paixao
plum on the chin with a right hand for a clear knockout. Paixao
tottered back on to the ropes and fell on to the floor as Tiozzo
raised his arms in victory.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Tiozzo now has a record of 40 wins and one
defeat. Since winning the title on points against American Nate
Miller on November 8 last year, he has defended his title twice.
</P>
<P>
His first was a knockout against American Terry Ray on May 2

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Decision to Allow Arms Inspection Unconditional: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz stressed on Sunday that the Iraqi decision to allow the
resumption of U.N. weapons inspections was unconditional.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the annex attached to the letter on the
Iraqi decision he sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Saturday "does not mount to conditions."
</P>
<P>
Aziz's remarks came after U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger alleged that the two-page annex contains conditions, saying
the letter "is neither unequivocal nor unconditional."
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known what the annex is about, but Iraqi
representative to the U.N. Nazar Hamdoon said in New York that it
was not linked with the letter and it was just what Iraq hoped to
see after resuming cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Iraq's offer was "unacceptable" and the U.S.
remained poised for military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Annan described Aziz's letter as "positive,"
saying that he believed it met U.N. requirements in resolving the
latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on October 31 decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq
(UNSCOM) until the U.N. Security Council moves toward lifting the
U.N. trade sanctions imposed on it for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been stepping up its military presence in the Gulf
in preparation for an attack to force Iraq to withdraw its
decision.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said on Saturday it would allow an unconditional
resumption of U.N. weapons inspections, a move many observers
believe that will possibly ward off an imminent U.S. military
strike.

<HEADLINE> Manila, IMF Agree on Philippines' 1999 Deficit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have agreed to set a 67
billion peso (1.67 billion U.S. dollar) budget deficit target for
the Philippines next year to enable the country's economy to grow
by 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Making the announcement here over the weekend, Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the deficit spending would be
financed primarily by foreign borrowings, and from the
international capital market, multilateral financial institutions
and bilateral sources of funding.
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to avoiding any pressure on
Treasury bills so that if there is any need to borrow
domestically, it can do away with the additional 22 billion peso
(550 million dollars) expenditures for next year, Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government had initially fought against a higher
budget deficit. If a higher deficit means domestic borrowing, it
said, that would result in higher lending rates based on higher
T-bill rates as the government's financial sources come primarily
from the issuance of T-bills.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, the IMF has agreed that the government
would maintain its policy of keeping lending rates down, and
source its financing externally and through multilaterals and
bilaterals.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the government may be ready to tap the
international capital market early next year through the issuance
of 1 billion dollars of global bonds.

<HEADLINE> Progressing Urbanization in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Urbanization has progressed
rapidly in china in the past two decades as a result of the reform
and opening-up policy since 1978, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's urbanization level grew form 19.4 percent in 1978 to
29.9 percent at the end of 1997, according to Liu Jinsheng, a
division chief of the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The official number of Chinese cities had reached 668 by last
year, and registered towns totalled 18,984.
</P>
<P>
A number of metropolitan areas have formed around major cities,
including the Bohai Bay area centered on Beijing, Tianjin,
Qingdao, Shenyang and Dalian. Another such metropolitan area has
emerged in the Yangtze River Delta around shanghai, Nanjing,
Hangzhou and Ningbo, and still another in the Pearl River Delta
around Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, more than 290 cities, or 43 percent of
China's total, are scattered through the eastern coastal areas,
while only 126 are located in the inland west.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the state allocated about 77 billion yuan (9.3 billion
U.S. dollars) for city construction. Only 10.9 percent went to the
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the gap between eastern and western areas is mainly
a result of different population densities and socioeconomic
development.
</P>
<P>
They say care must be taken when accelerating city construction
in China. Construction should be carried out in accordance with the
state's policy of giving priority to small and medium-sized towns
and cities.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that chaotic expansion of some existing large
cities and towns should be curbed, protection of farm land and
development of agriculture and animal husbandry should be taken
into consideration when planning city construction.
</P>
<P>
City construction should be aimed at enhancing the reform of
local economic structures and making full use of local resources.

six month of 1998 compared with the same period of 1997, reaching
617 million dollars.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian figure skaters won the
first three titles to dominate the Nations Cup figure skating
tournament in Gelsenkirchen, Germany on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World champion Alexei Yagudin outscored teammate Alexander Abt
to take the men's event while world champions Angelika Krylova
and Oleg Ovsiannikov finished first in the ice dance with a
routine entirely to drums and percussions, after Maria Petrova
and Alexei Tikhonov won the pairs event early of the day.
</P>
<P>
The Russians were on the verge of a sweep of all the events.
</P>
<P>
They ranked 1-2 after the women's short program with Yelena
Sokolova ahead of European champion Maria Butyrskaya with the
long program slated for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yagudin landed six triples and a quadruple toe loop to score
all 5.8s and 5.9s in another impressive routine to the music from
"Lawrence of Arabia".
</P>
<P>
"In four weeks I have won four competetions but it was really
hard to skate," Yagudin said. "At this moment I can say I am
ready for the rest of the season."
</P>
<P>
German Andreas Vlascenko finished third in the men's event.
</P>
<P>
In the ice dance, Krylova and Ovsiannikov performed an
untraditional program with no music, just different rhythms of

presentaion marks were mostly 5.8s and 5.9s.
</P>
<P>
German veterans Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Mueller were second,
with the third went to the American team of John and Tiffany
Stiegler, trained by Russian pair legend Irina Rodnina.

barely held another jump.
</P>
<P>
Butyrskaya won the Skate American two weeks ago and was
expected to take advantage of the absence of Olympic champion
Tara Lipinksi and world champion Michelle Kwan this season.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Strongmen On Top Again after Nine-year Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian weightlifting team
ranked first at the World Championships in Lahti after a break of
nine years.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Abadjiev who stepped down in 1989 and a futile period
followed, resumed the position in mid 1997 to justify his
reputation as one of the most eminent representatives of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
Till December of the year, Abadjiev had trained a team to rank
second in the world, with three of his disciples winning gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
This year was even more successful for the Bulgarian
weightlifters by winning eight of all 15 titles at the European
events and finishing first at the World Championships in Lahti.
</P>
<P>
Zlatko Vanev, who suffered a severe injury at the European
championship, recovered to win a gold medal to become the only
athlete repeating his success of last year's world events.
</P>
<P>
Plamen Zhelyazkov also became world champion by setting a
world record in the snatch event. Both Peter Tanev and Izabela
Rifatova bagged home the silvers while Ivan Ivanov and Neli
Yankova got their bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased with the team's performance but they have bigger
potentials," coach Ivan Abadjiev said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before the World Championship, all Bulgarian
weightlifters competed in France and Germany which hindered their
preparation for the Lahti World Championship, the coach said,
adding he did not blame the athletes because they are underpaid
in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"However, things cannot go on like this," he stated, "If
adequate incentives are not provided for the athletes I cannot
guarantee their good performance at the world meets and the
Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has the potential to compete in the 2000 Olympic
Games in Sydney with athletes of all categories, said Abadjiev.
</P>
<P>
He praised the women for their performance as Izabela
Rifatova, Neli Yankova and Siika Stoeva did not won gold medals
but set up a string of European records to rank just behind the
Asian athletes.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic statement of Abadjiev, a traditional pessimist,
gives hopes for the future performance of the Bulgarian
weightlifters.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian athletes regained their position in the world elite
and proved that the success they scored ten years ago was not
accidental.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Saturday that Iraq's offer to allow the U.N. inspections to resume
is "unacceptable" and it remained poised for military action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will consult with its allies to consider next steps,
said National Security Council advisor Sandy Berger at a news
conference at the White House after a more than five-hour session
of President Bill Clinton's national security advisers.
</P>
<P>
"There certainly is not unlimited time" for Iraq to comply,
Berger said. It needed to give a "clear statement that they will
fully comply" with U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has had "plenty of
opportunity to demonstrate that he's prepared to come back in
compliance" with U.N. demands that he has disposed of his weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. remains poised to take military action against Iraq,
he said. Military action still remained an option for Clinton and
it could be taken at any time.
</P>
<P>
Berger said, "We have said all along that we are ready to
proceed, but we will proceed on the basis of our timetable."
Military planners have developed a range of strike options for
Clinton, Berger added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to stay home to
deal with the Iraqi crisis instead of going to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting even after Iraq
had announced its offer.

Vice President Al Gore will attend the APEC meeting, which is

"hopes" to complete the remainder of the trip which includes stops
in Japan, South Korea and the U.S. territory of Guam, Lockhart
said.

The U.S. reaction means that the crisis is still not over.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon sources said that actually the Pentagon has already
issued the order to attack Iraq with cruise missiles. But it was
delayed after Iraq made the promise to comply.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Iraqi authorities announced that it will accept
U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and
inspectors would be allowed to return immediately.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Iraq Takes Step in Right Direction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Saturday that Iraq has taken "a step in the
right direction," but he thought the Security Council may ask the
Iraqi Government for further clarification.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who headed off a major Iraqi crisis in February this
year by a visit to Baghdad, made the statement in response to a
press question as he was stepping into the U.N. building to attend
the Security Council consultations, which is to kick off at 5:00
p.m. EST on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began another round of closed-door
consultations as war threats looms large in the Gulf by
Washington's efforts to increase the military buildup in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is likely to focus on the Iraqi letter on
arms inspections, handed to Annan on Saturday morning by Nizar
Hamdoon, Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The letter, a response by the Iraqi Government to a letter
delivered from Annan to Baghdad on Friday night, said that Iraq
allows U.N. arms inspectors to resume their work. In return, Annan
has described the letter as "positive."
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said that "conditions that are attached to our
statement which has been clear-cut, obligating Iraq to resume
cooperation with the UNSCOM," which is the short form the U.N.
Special Commission in charge of the elimination of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
As the Security Council is about to begin the rare weekend
consultations, Hamdoon is waiting outside the Council chamber to
be available for the 15-member Security Council to pass its
decision made at the Saturday meeting, if any, to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi leadership has decided to resume full and complete
cooperation with both the UNSCOM and the IAEA (the International
Atomic Energy Agency)," said the Iraqi ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of Iraq's goals had been met -- Iraq has made
it clear to the world its views and everyone was now aware of what
Baghdad wants.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants movement toward the lifting of 8-year economic
sanctions against the Mideast country, imposed following it
invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sharply against the mounting military threats from Washington,
China, France and Russia, three permanent members of the Security
Council, have been reinforcing their efforts at the United Nations
to seek a peaceful solution to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad suspended field inspections by the arms experts on
August 5 and October 31, it stopped the remainder of the
inspections, later the UNSCOM, without consulting Security Council
members, decided to evacuate its staff from Iraq on "strong
recommendation" from Washington.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Demands Immediate Iraqi Compliance on Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Saturday urged Iraq to make "immediate and unconditional"
compliance to the demands made by the United Nations if it really
wants to resume cooperation with weapon inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing less than unconditional compliance will do," Blair
said outside his Downing Street office.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the remark after Iraq sent a letter to the U.N.
promising to comply with its demand to allow a resumption of its
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Any conditions of this nature are unacceptable. There can be
no negotiations, no further deals," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that British troops on standby in Kuwait
would remain on alert to the possibility of military action at any
time.
</P>
<P>
British high-ranking officials said earlier that Blair and U.S.
president Bill Clinton had spoken by telephone on four occasions
in the last 24 hours to discuss the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Evaluation Team Sent to Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A high-level team of the west
African peacekeeping force ECOMOG has left Nigerian capital Abuja
for Guinea Bissau to evaluate the logistic requirements for
deploying interposition force in that country.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation is to be carried out under an agreement signed
in Abuja on November 1 by Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo
Vieira and rebel leader Ansumane Mane, said Information Director
of the Economic Community of West Africa states (ECOWAS),
Adrianne Diop.
</P>
<P>
Diop said that the team led by ECOMOG commander Timothy
Skelpidi will determine the size of the peacekeeping force,
equipment and communication facilities to enable the troops to
perform their role of providing security along the country's
border with Senegal, the Nigeria News Agency Saturday quoted Diop
as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Diop disclosed that Gambia has indicated its interest in
contributing to the interposition force, adding that Senegal and
Guinea are excluded from contributing to the force in accordance
with the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a government of national unity will be
formed soon in Guinea Bissau and presidential elections will be
held not later than March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for the deployment of ECOMOG troops in
Guinea Bissau to take over from Guinean and Senegalese troops who
have been in that country at the invitation of President Vieira
since the June 7 rebellion by sacked Army Chief of Staff
Brigadier General Mane.

<HEADLINE> U.S. NASA Refuses Russian Proposal on Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. NASA refused Russian
Space Agency's Proposal to launch the international space station
closer to Russia's Mir, the New York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held Friday at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program
manager, said that while putting the new station closer to Mir
station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies
from the old outpost to the new one, but the request came too late
to be acted on.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side proposed last week to change the position of
the space station just two-and-half weeks before launch of the
first part of the new station.
</P>
<P>
Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits
would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly
flights, and would result in potentially unfavorable sun angles
on the solar-powered station.
</P>
<P>
However NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research
equipment to use on the international space station, said
Brinkley, but only if it does not interfere with assembling the
new station.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member nations plan to begin assembly the long-awaited
international space station next week when the Russians launch a
module that will supply power and propulsion during the early
stages of the five-year construction period. U.S. space shuttle
Endeavor is to follow on Dec. 3 with the second station part,an
American-built connecting passageway that attaches to the first
module.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Apologizes for Shooting at U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Liberia formally apologized
to Washington for the shooting by its security forces at the U.S.
embassy in Liberian capital Monrovia, Panafrican News Agency
(PANA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan said in a statement
Saturday that the government of President Charles Taylor extended
the apology Friday in a diplomatic note to the U.S. State
Department.
</P>
<P>
The shooting on September 19 killed two Liberians and wounded
two Americans.
</P>
<P>
Captan said that the Liberian government "acknowledges with
regrets the wounding of two American citizens in the incident and
accepts responsibility for not preventing the armed rebels from
approaching the U.S. embassy."
</P>
<P>
He added that "Liberia cherishes the cordial relations between
it and the United States and would do everything to maintain
these ties."
</P>
<P>
The apology followed nearly eight weeks of denial by the
Liberian government that its security forces shot at the U.S.
embassy, and hence refused to apologize as requested by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Washington and Monrovia have remained cool
since the U.S. accused Liberian security forces of the shooting
inside the embassy compound in violation of the Vienna Convention
which provides for the protection of foreign embassies.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian security forces shot in the embassy while
pursuing former faction leader Roosevelt Johnson, who sought
refuge within the premises of the mission following two days of
bloody street gunbattle between the forces loyal to Johnson and
the government troops.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people, most of them Johnson's men, were killed,
and 49 others wounded in the gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
Johnson and 31 others were later charged with treason for
plotting to topple Taylor.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday decided to stay home to deal with the Iraqi crisis
instead of going to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart made the statement after an
emergency meeting of the U.S. Presidential National Security
Council at the White House over an earlier Iraqi decision to
resume cooperation with United Nations weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore will attend the APEC meeting, which is
to be convened in Malaysia. Clinton might take rest of his trip to
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. reaction means that the crisis is still not over.
Pentagon sources said that actually the Pentagon has already
issued the order to attack Iraq with cruise missiles. But it was
delayed after Iraq made the promise to comply.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Iraqi authorities announced that it will except
U.N. weapons inspections to resume without conditions and
inspectors would be allowed to return immediately.

<HEADLINE> UAE Welcomes Iraq's Resumption of Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
welcomed Iraq's decision to resume cooperation with United Nations
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
UAE Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi also told
reporters Saturday that the foreign ministers of Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) members, who are holding a close-door meeting here,
are watching closely the Iraqi situation.
</P>
<P>
He added that the group has always held that Iraq should
cooperate with the U.N. to ease the sufferings of its people under
the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
GCC is a political and economic alliance grouping Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Iraq's decision will lead to the end
of the current Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that Iraq's cooperation with the United
Nations will eventually prevent more crisis of the kind and will
be conducive to the region's security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The return of the U.N. weapons inspectors will surely be
helpful to the consideration of lifting of U.N. sanctions upon
Iraq as demanded by Baghdad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Saturday that it will allow the U.N. weapons
inspectors to return and resume their normal duties.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all weapons inspectors have withdrawn from Iraq since
Baghdad announced to stop cooperation with them on October 31 and
the U.S. threatened a military strike against Iraq.
