NATO's decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, would
meet on Friday to approve the air-borne surveillance mission.

possible, but sufficient measures have to be in place to protect
the NATO surveillance planes that are unarmed," said the official.

Yugoslavia after the country met the troop withdrawal deadline by
pulling out another 4,000 soldiers and policemen from Kosovo.

relevant to the northern Kurdish autonomous region, the Iraqi News
Agency INA reported on Wednesday.

MOSCOW -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Wednesday
listed the creation of favorable external environment for
resolution of the country's domestic problems and the defense of
Russia's international status as the priorities in its foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Moscow-based daily Izvestia, Ivanov

want to fuel international conflicts or strive for local interests
out of those conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov added, Moscow would not allow it to be excluded
from settling problems involving Russian strategic interests.
</P>

"The Balkans have always been a zone of special strategic
interests for Russia," Ivanov said. "It is stability and a
peaceful solution to the problem that meet our interests."
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A flight that left Shanghai's
Hongqiao International Airport this afternoon marked the beginning
of a joint transpacific flight of Air China and Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that this shows Air China's increasing involvement
in the international airline business.
</P>
<P>
Code-sharing began back in the early 1990s and it quickly
evolved into a popular way to cooperate in international air
transportation and it allows two airlines to extend their reach
for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
People will now find it easier to get to many destinations in
China and the States reached by either one of the two airlines,
and much simpler procedures.
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines is a major American airline in the world,
and Air China is the largest airline in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- With Typhoon Babs moving
away from the waters of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong-Sanya
International Yachting Race was finally fixed as 12 boats took
the calm waters west of Hong Kong Island on Wednesday to sail
southwestward to Sanya, a port city in eastern coast of Hainan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The flat seas and five-knots south westerlies made the race
organizers confident that the yachts could reach their
destination between Friday to the weekend as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Tacticians will be studying weather conditions and badly
needed will be northeasterlies. Sailing into light headwinds for
as long as 350 nautical miles is not something the crews of the
bigger yachts will relish.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan race has been incorporated as the offshore for the
China Race Week starting last Friday. The yachting extravaganza
this year includes short, tight inshore courses within SAR
waters, which closed on Saturday, and the Hong Kong-Sanya Race.
</P>
<P>
China Race Week is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Yacht Clu

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Ready to Help Bring Peace to Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said on Wednesday that Tehran is ready to help bring peace
in the Balkan region, at a meeting with Croatian parliament
speaker Vlatko Pavletic.
</P>
<P>
Iran "is willing to render any kind of help for prevalence of
peace and tranquility in the Balkan region," Khatami told Pavletic.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that ethnic conflicts in the Balkan
peninsula were abused politically by certain powers and
politicians, and have become a major obstacle to the development
of these countries and a cause of huge human and financial losses.
</P>
<P>
The bitter experiences of the 20th century due to wars should
help human beings reach a degree of maturity to know how to
peacefully coexist while preserving their ethnicity, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the future of the Balkan region largely
depends on the peaceful coexistence among Croats, Muslims and
Serbs, saying that no people should seek to dominate the others.
</P>
<P>
He said he feared that Balkan countries might fail to solve
their own problems themselves and wait for outside parties "to
force tranquility in the region."
</P>
<P>
But he said he was pleased at the signing of the agreement
between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two republics of
former Yugoslav Federation that gained independence in 1991 after
the eruption of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
On Iran-Croatia relations, Khatami said the outstanding
status of the two countries in their respective regions prepares
the grounds for expansion of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said bonds between Iranian and Croatian legislative bodies
can greatly help the expansion of economic, political and
cultural ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian speaker, who arrived here on Monday for a
five-day official visit, praised Iran for seeking to develop
relations with Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran was among the first countries in the world that recognized
Croatia's independence.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, South Africa Urge Private Sectors to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and South Africa Wednesday

</P>
<P>
This came in a joint communique issued after the third session

"exploit business opportunities" on the two sides, including in
the privatization process and in increasing joint ventures and
partnership among the private sectors, it added.

<HEADLINE> ECA Forecasts 3 Percent GDP Growth for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has forecast that Africa's
gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by three percent this
year, barely above the 2.9 percent of population growth rate of
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Professor Befekadu Degefe and Dr. J.N. Ngu from the ECA said
in their joint report entitled "Economic and Social Conditions in
Africa in 1998" which is presented to the on-going three-day
seminar on environment and natural resource, that the real GDP
growth rate of three percent in 1998 is lower than that of 4.0
percent growth rate of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from the ECA Secretariat, the report indicates
that GDP growth in African oil exporting countries declines by a
third to 2.4 percent in 1998 compared with 3.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it said, growth in non-oil exporting
countries increases to four percent in 1998, compared with the
low level of 2.3 percent in 1997 benefiting from the lower oil
prices as well as a more auspicious weather out-turn that boosted
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Africa's least developed countries is also buoyant
at 3.8 percent in 1998 compared with 2.4 percent in 1997, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that despite the capricious weather,
agricultural output rebounds from the 1.7 percent growth in 1997
to 4.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In sub-regions, according to the report, North Africa is the
greater beneficiary where output is estimated to have increased
by seven percent compared with 1997; in East and South Africa as
well as West Africa, output recovers substantially in spite of
the better than average weather conditions; Central Africa
continues to post lower growth in agriculture because of the
ubiquitous civil unrest and political instability.
</P>
<P>
On the mining sub-sector, the report said the mining industry
is depressed by a drastic fall in prices and the growth in the
sector declines from 3.8 percent in 1997 to 2.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, growth in manufacturing sector declines to 1.7
percent from 2.5 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, although Africa has, by and large,
been spared the agony of financial instability, the consequences
of the recession in emerging markets induced by the financial
crisis in Asia was transmitted to the region through depressed
commodity prices and lower demand for African exports.
</P>
<P>
While the entire range of Africa's exportables experienced
falling prices, it was most significant for oil, a product that
accounts for no less than 60 percent of the foreign exchange
earnings of the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the decade, the overall trade balance
for African countries as a group turned negative, increasing the
current account deficit to a high of 11 billion US Dollars which
was financed through non-debt creating external resource inflows
(grants and foreign direct investment) of 7.9 billion US Dollars,
net borrowing amountin 0.5 billion US Dollars and reserve
depletion.
</P>
<P>
On poverty in Africa, the report said, about 44 percent of
Africa's population were living below the poverty line of 39 US
Dollars per person per month in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa records a much higher incidence of poverty
where 50 percent of the population lived below a poverty line of
24 US Dollars per person per month, it added.

LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of supporters of
Zambia's ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) marched
to the State House Wednesday to mark the first anniversary of the
short-lived coup attempt and show their solidarity with President
Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
At a rally here in the capital, MMD supporters sang and danced
praising Chiluba for his hard work and achievements for his
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
At the rally Chiluba told his supporters that his government
will never resort to tribal politics which will only divide the
nation.
</P>
<P>
He called on Zambians to be united to achieve meaningful
development.
</P>
<P>
Zambian people are peace-loving people, he said, urging them
to respect elected leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also urged Zambians to identify politicians aspiring
for leadership on the basis of their qualities and not tribes.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economy, he urged his countrymen to be
patient and allow the government to reverse the unfavorable
trends in the economy.
</P>
<P>
"Resources are meager and the economy will not be transformed
overnight," he said, adding that his government is determined to
eradicate poverty and that this will only become a reality with
the support of the people.
</P>
<P>
On October 28 last year, a number of solders seized state
radio and announced the overthrow of the government but it was
foiled hours later by troops loyal to the government.

LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean president Augusto
Pinochet Wednesday won his British High Court battle against his

Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice, ruled that Pinochet as a

However, the court also ruled that Pinochet, who was arrested
in London early this month by British police, should stay in
detention pending an appeal of the judgment.

<P>
"My intention is that the applicant (Pinochet) remain under
arrest until the end of appeal process," Bingham said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable Goods Orders Pick Up 0.9 Pct in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nationwide orders
for big-ticket durable goods climbed up 0.9 percent in September,
thanks mainly to demand for automobiles, communications equipment
and military goods, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth monthly consecutive growth brought orders to a
seasonally adjusted 192.1 billion U.S. dollars, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. economists had expected a 1 percent dip, in view of
the world financial chaos cutting in demand for U.S. products.
Instead, not only were last month's orders estimated to be rising,
the August increase of 2 percent, was revised up from a previous
estimate of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The September report was buffeted by crosswinds from two highly
volatile categories. Orders for defense goods, from ships to
tanks, soared 44.9 percent, the largest rise in 10 months.
Excluding that large jump, orders for everything else edged down
0.2 percent, the worst performance in four months.
</P>
<P>
This came largely because orders for aircraft plummeted 45.5
percent following a 50 percent increase a month earlier. Excluding
transportation, orders rose 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment overall fell 4.4 percent.
Drops in aircraft and railroad equipment more than offset gains in
autos, ships and tanks.
</P>
<P>
Demand for electronic equipment also rose a robust 5.4 percent,
the third increase in four months, due mostly to communications
equipment. Orders for industrial machinery jumped 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for primary metals such as steel fell 2.3
percent, the fourth drop in five months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production,
rose 1.5 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 191.7
billion dollars. It was the fourth consecutive increase.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda (BOU) has been
blamed by members of parliament here as being responsible for the
current crisis in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
MPs who sit on the Committee for National Economy, Finance and
Economic Planning said Tuesday they will soon summon the
management of the central bank to explain the crisis, whose
biting effects they can no longer ignore, the local daily Monitor
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They said the bank failed the public by failing in its
statutory role to supervise the three affected commercial banks,
the International Credit Bank, Trust Bank and Trans-African Bank.
</P>
<P>
The present management at BOU doesn't measure to the task
under the autonomous status, the MPs were quoted as complaining.

The bank should be sued for negligence of duty because a lot
of public funds are likely to be lost and a lot more tax payers'
money held up.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the three banks calls for urgent attention from
legislators to ensure that measures are enacted to guard against
a re-occurrence of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
MP Banedict Mutyaba, said the central bank was not telling all
when saying the three commercial banks were experiencing a
temporary problem. He called BOU the biggest culprit in the
crisis which must have known whatever was happening in the banks
in good time.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the commercial banks and continued depreciation
of Ugandan Shilling against the U.S. Dollar have been worrying
the general public and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The BOU has injected more than 40 million U.S. Dollars into
market to rescue the falling currency but to no avail.

<HEADLINE> Sacked Workers In Britain To Retrain As Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Redundant workers from Britain's
industrial firms are to be targeted for retraining as teachers
under a 130 million pounds (208 million U.S. dollars) scheme.
</P>
<P>
Graduates who lost their jobs owing to plant closures could be
directed into teaching maths, science and technology by "rapid
response" teams of education experts.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the scheme Wednesday, School Standards Minister
Estelle Morris said the profession needed to soak up skills and
talents which could be used just as effectively in schools.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was one of a lot of measures announced by the
Government to lure more quality graduates into teaching.
</P>
<P>
Other ideas are a 5000 pounds "golden hello" to post-graduates
who choose to train as maths or science teachers, and greater
encouragement for retired teachers to return to the job.
</P>
<P>
The initiative comes after a black year for manufacturing
industry which has seen thousands of workers made redundant.

<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos Menem
Wednesday laid a wreath to memorial of the 252 British soldiers
who died in the Falklands (Malvinas) War in an effort to seek
overall reconciliation between Britain and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Menem, the first Argentine president to visit Britain since the
1982 Falklands (Malvinas) War, placed a wreath of blue and white
flowers -- the Argentine national colors -- at the foot of the
black marble memorial in St Paul's Cathedral to Britain's
Falklands dead.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, Menem told a meeting of British business
leaders that today's Argentina was very different from the one
that fought Britain in 1982.
</P>
<P>
"If we see our relations with a wide scope, we can continue to
strengthen them and start a constructive and imaginative search
for a way to solve creatively the problems in the Malvinas
(Falklands) Islands," Menem said.
</P>
<P>
The British and Argentine governments have both made it clear
that that would not be substantial discussion on the sovereignty
of the Falklands (Malvinas) Islands during President Menem's
current visit to Britain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Work for Peace in Angola: Susan Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- United States Vice Secretary of
State for African Affairs Susan Rice said here Wednesday her
government will "do its best to seek for a lasting peace in
Angola."
</P>
<P>
Rice, who arrived here Wednesday from South Africa for a
three-day visit in Angola, said the United States is trying to
play a constructive role in the work for peace and prosperity in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is Rice's fifth visit to Angola. She was accompanied by
Gayle Smith, President Bill Clinton's special assistant on
African affairs, and Howard Wolpe, U.S. special envoy to the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in the southern African country, Rice will
meet Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, Prime Minister Franca
Van-Dunem and United Nations special envoy to Angola Issa Diallo
as well as representatives from the troika observer countries on
the Angolan peace process, namely Portugal, Russia and the United

"We will discuss a wide range of issues. I believe the visit
will play an important role in pushing forward the Angolan peace
process and enhancing bilateral relations," said Rice.
</P>
<P>
She added that the situation in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) will also be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The United States wishes to promote cooperation with countries

<HEADLINE> French, German FMs Find Wide Common Views in First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- French foreign minister Hubert
Vedrine and his new German counterpart Joschka Fischer have found
a wide range of common stands during their first meeting here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said at a press conference at the end
of their one-hour meeting that they had already established true
relationship and liaison between them.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is head of the German Green Party, chose France as
the first stop of his three-nation trip one day after the new
German leftwing government was formally established.
</P>
<P>
"We have found many common points of view between us. The
different evaluations have also been registered, but there has not
been in-depth talks yet," he said, adding that the two countries
have "good perspectives of arriving at a common solution."
</P>
<P>
Among the differences between Paris and Bonn are German demand
for more French contribution to the financing of European Union
institutions, and the new German government's plan to close all
nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
France intends to maintain its nuclear power stations which
provide most of the country's electricity supplies.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also reassured his French hosts of Bonn's intention to
maintain a pro-European foreign policy and a privileged
relationship with France.
</P>
<P>
He left Paris for London Wednesday evening and will end his
first trip abroad as foreign minister in Warsaw.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes U.S. over Oil-Gas Piping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Wednesday criticized the United State for its efforts
to block the laying of pipelines across Iran to transfer oil and
gas from the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission of
Japanese parliament, Koki Chuma, Kharrazi said the U.S. policy to
dissuade Iran's neighbors from piping their oil and gas to Europe
via Iran is illogical and in contradiction with expert studies.
</P>
<P>
He said expert studies have so far proved the Iranian route is
very economical, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has an important strategic situation for transit
of goods, oil and gas from Central Asia to world markets and is
ready to cooperate with Japan to help Central Asian nations carry
out development plans.
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials recently reiterated that Washington is
against adopting the Iran option. Among other options, piping oil
and gas to Turkey's Mediterranean port, is said to be much favored.
</P>
<P>
Although options are largely economic and technical, their
selection is bound to be highly political. The host country of the
pipeline from Central Asia would be able to bob its clout there.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also said Iran feels duty-bound to help reinforce
stability in the region and makes every endeavor to ease regional
tensions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope the development of Tehran-Tokyo relations
would lead to enhanced cooperation in economic and diplomatic
fields.
</P>
<P>
Chuma, who arrived here on Tuesday at the head of a Japanese
parliament delegation, said Tokyo-Tehran relations have been
satisfactory over the past two years and the exchange of visits by
the two countries officials helped bolster relations.
</P>
<P>
Japan is willing to cooperate with Iran to help protect
security in the region, he said, adding that there exist wide
range capacities for economic cooperation between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (Parliament)
Wednesday decided to study a bill on guarantee of foreign
investments in the country's free trade zones, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisages that government should compensate for the
losses of foreign investors if their investments made in Iran's
free trade zones either become nationalized or subject to certain
laws in the future.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that the bill will be studied at relevant Majlis
commissions.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the High Council of Free Industrial and Trade
Zones Morteza Alviri said that the Free Trade Zone Organization
guarantees foreign investments to a certain ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The bill offer government's guarantee for huge foreign
investments, Alviri said.
</P>
<P>
There are investors who are ready to make investments over 1
billion U.S. dollars in Iran's free trade zones, he said, but
they want to seek legal guarantees to their capital first.
</P>
<P>
In order to boost the country's non-oil exports, Iran has set
up five free trade zones and a dozen of special industrial zones
around the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the zones have attracted few foreign investments since
foreign investors see no guarantee for their capital.

<HEADLINE> UK Sets up International CJD Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An international center for
research into the CJD disease, the human form of mad cow disease,
is being set up in London, the BBC reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The center will be led by Professor John Collinge of St Mary's
Hospital in London, a leading expert in the field. Top
international researcher Professor Charles Weissman from Zurich
will join the team in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The British Medical Research Council (MRC) is pouring 1.5
million pounds (2.5 million U.S. dollars) a year into the center,
which the council said will provide a stable research environment
as well as guaranteed long-term funding.
</P>
<P>
The MRC said that the new research center, which will have
around 60 staff, aims to develop long-term approach to
understanding CJD as well as coming up with prompt research on
areas of public concern.
</P>
<P>
One of the center's first tasks will be to develop tests on
blood and tonsils which may act as an early warning of how many
humans have been affected by new variant CJD.
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that the tonsils of those affected by CJD
show signs of the disease before they die. Researchers have found
that 20 patients with CJD have shown signs of the disease in their
tonsils.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe this could act as an early warning system
for the disease as current tests rely on brain biopsies after
patients have died.
</P>
<P>
They have begun collecting removed tonsils from the general
population in the UK to begin tests which could give the first
picture of the extent of CJD.

<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government Wednesday
welcomed a British High Court ruling that former Chilean president
Augusto Pinochet was immune from arrest and detention.
</P>
<P>
Chilean deputy Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez told
reporters at the Chilean embassy in London: "The Chilean
government is very happy and satisfied that the British High Court
has recognized Senator Pinochet's immunity."

Pinochet would be staying at the clinic or would move elsewhere.

The British High Court ruled that Pinochet as a former head of
state was entitled to immunity from prosecution and could not be
arrested.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Seek Peaceful Solution to Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will seek a peaceful
solution to the worsening crisis in Guinea Bissau in concert with
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the
U.N., Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Foreign Minister of Guinea Bissau Joao
Cardoso in capital Abuja Tuesday, Abubakar said he had initiated
discussions with the European Union and the United Nations aimed
at ending the crisis in Guinea Bissau, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, current ECOWAS Chairman, reaffirmed Nigeria's
support for the government of President Bernado Vierra, but said
the grievances of the opposition in Guinea Bissau should be
properly addressed to ensure lasting peace and stability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
On October 20, Abubakar said consultations with ECOWAS leaders
had commenced to find a solution to the problem when he received
Guinean Foreign Minister Lamine Camara, special envoy of
President Lansana Conte. Guinea sent troops to Bissau to help
Vierra together with Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government forces insist that peace-keeping troops from
Portuguese-speaking countries should be sent to replace those
from Senegal and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader disclosed that the deteriorating situation
in Guinea Bissau would be discussed fully at the forthcoming
ECOWAS summit to be held in Abuja on October 30 to 31.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said the United Nations needs the support from the
United States to address the pressing issues of the world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the annual dinner of the U.N.
Association of the United States in New York Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"The American people want their leaders to give the United
Nations that support -- on time and without conditions," he said,
quoting a speaker at the dinner as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I trust that one day this message will be heard in
Washington," he added.
</P>
<P>
The world body has been concerned about its straining financial
situation in which the United States has played a big part.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the U.N. 1.6 billion U.S. dollars for past and
current assessments, two-thirds of the total dues owed by member
states as of September 30 this year, according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has set up preconditions for the payment of
the dues by saying that the money should not be used to finance
pro-abortion international agencies.
</P>
<P>
Annan once complained that the U.N. was held hostage by the
U.S. domestic dispute over abortion.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, a guest at the dinner, urged American people to
follow his lead in contributing to the U.N..

<HEADLINE> Hill Says Crucial Negotiations on Kosovo to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador
Christopher Hill said on Wednesday it was now coming to a crucial
stage to start the negotiation process on Kosovo crisis after
situation in the province is getting stable.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting a rather crucial phase in this process. We are
now beginning to get the conditions on the ground that we've
needed for some time to have a successful negotiation," said Hill,
the ambassador to Macedonia, at a press briefing in Pristina after
meeting leaders of both Albanian and Serb sides.
</P>
<P>
He said he talked to local leaders and they had made some
progress on the agreement but there was still a long way to go
before a settlement was achieved.
</P>
<P>
"Things are stabilizing on the ground and this is very helpful
to the negotiation and we very much want to move ahead in the days
ahead," said the ambassador who is shuttling between Belgrade and
Pristina to initiate the negotiations after the withdrawal of Serb
troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the difference between Serbs and Albanians in the
upcoming talks, Hill acknowledged that there were still some areas
where the Albanians would like some important changes in the
political agreement, areas especially relating to the overall
question of Kosovo status.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians want to enhance their current provincial status
to that of a republic, with the same footing of Yugoslavia's two
republics -- Serbia and Montenegro. But the Serbian government
insists that Kosovo is a province of Serbia and the crisis must be
solved within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Hill said the agreement proposed by the United States was
designed to work on creating democratic institutions in Kosovo, to
restore Kosovo self-government which was taken away some 10 years
ago, and to ensure the development of democratic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that "It's the position of the United States
that we don't support Kosovo's independence."
</P>
<P>
Some radical ethnic Albanians took up arms in March to fight
for the independence of Kosovo in which 90 percent are Albanians,
thus causing the crisis of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government pulled its forces out of Kosovo or
returned to their barracks on Monday, one day before the NATO
deadline of military attack expired. NATO has demanded the
withdrawal of Serb forces to ensure the safe return of thousands
of refugees and displaced persons, or otherwise face air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Politician: Primakov Government Endangered by Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A Russian leading politician
said Wednesday that the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
endangered by corruption, an assertion drawing fire from many
officials.
</P>
<P>
Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko party, said he wanted
to draw Primakov's attention to the problem "publically and
openly," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Primakov would take steps "to halt this
process."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the the British newspaper Daily Telegraph
Wednesday, he claimed that top posts in the Russian government had
been bought and some of the most influential ministers were linked
"with extremely corrupt circles."
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky said he had reasons to speak of the danger of
corruption in the Primakov government, saying that he was
constantly meeting with people working for the government and he
was "getting this impression."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, for his part, demanded that Yavlinsky name officials
linked with the alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
"I must say absolutely firmly and definitely: Mr. Yavlinsky
must name these people. If not in public, then let him write to
the prosecutor. Otherwise he is either a harborer or a slanderer,"
Interfax quoted Primakov as saying at a news conference in
Saransk, on the Volga.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Putin, head of the Federal Security Service (FSB),
said the FSB had no information on the alleged corruption in the
government.
</P>
<P>
"While forming the government, Yevgeny Primakov brought up the
issue of integrity among the incoming personnel. We have no
information that the people working in the government pay money
for this," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said Yavlinsky might
face criminal charges if he did not present proof of his
allegations.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A former official at the
Bulgarian embassy in Tanzania, Lutchezar Miloykov, 52, was
arraigned in Dar Wednesday charged with forging entry visa and
obtaining money by false pretences.
</P>

Assistant Inspector of Police, Renatha Mzinga, alleged before
the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court that the suspect made a
visa bearing number 1057 dated September 11, 1996, at Oysterbay
Kimweri Road Block Number 52 in Kinondoni District.
</P>

She alleged that on the same day at the same place, by false
pretences and with intent to defraud, the suspect obtained 65,000
Shillings from Chande saying he would offer a visa.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-seven percent of
the world population increase numbering 78 million in 1998 has
taken place in the less developed countries, according to the U.N.
Population Division.
</P>
<P>
The fastest population growth will be in Africa with its
population expected to more than double during the first half of
the 21st century, said the World Population Estimates and Projects
released here on Wednesday by the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, Europe's population was 2.5 times larger than
Africa's, but in 1998 Africa's population at 749 million is larger
than Europe's at 729 million, and by 2050 it is estimated to be
three times larger, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the mid-1998 world population stood at 5.9
billion, with 4.7 billion or 80 percent in the less developed
regions and 1.2 billion or 20 percent in the more developed
regions.
</P>
<P>
Currently Asia's population is growing by 50 million annually,
Africa's by 17 million and Latin America's by nearly 8 million,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Division has projected that the annual population growth
rate will continue declining from 1.33 percent in 1995-2000 to
0.34 percent in 2045-2050.
</P>
<P>
Total world population is estimated to grow to 6 billion in
1998, 7 billion in 2013, 8 billion in 2028 and 9 billion in 2054.

summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
scheduled for October 30-31 in the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the ECOWAS secretariat said Wednesday that
specimens of the checks will be presented to the Assembly of
Heads of State by General Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigerian Head of
State and current chairman of the ECOWAS.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 5 billion Ugandan
shillings (4 million U.S. Dollars) meant for alleviation of
hunger and construction of valley dams has been misused by
Ugandan officials in the Agricultural Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some of the money was unaccounted for, misused and diverted, a
Radio Uganda report said Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
One of the officials in the ministry was quoted as telling
parliament Wednesday that political interference should be held
responsible for the diversion of the fund.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry
and Fisheries was shocked to learn that some of the fund was used
for a trip to Arusha, Tanzania, buying of mango and orange seeds
and construction of a silk project.
</P>
<P>
The MPs also expressed concerns over the decision by the
ministry to open an account in the dubious Trans-Africa Bank,
which has been temporarily closed by the Bank of Uganda for
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
All people who volunteer information concerning the diversion
of the fund will be protected against any acts of victimization,

BEIRUT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Israeli
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded during Lebanese
guerrillas' attacks in south Lebanon Wednesday evening, the Voice
of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two militiamen were injured when their Ghantara post in
the western sector of the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon was hit
by guerrillas' grenades and shells.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim group Amal Movement led by the country's
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri claimed responsibility for the
attack, which brought to 40 the number of SLA members wounded in
south Lebanon since the start of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some 28 others were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the country's resistance movement, including the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the pro-Syria
Amal, has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its proxy SLA.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Puts Off Day of Six Billion by 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) announced here on Wednesday that it has
revised the day to mark the world population of 6 billion from
June 16 to October 12 next year due to a fertility fall.
</P>
<P>
The new date is based on revised population estimates released
on Wednesday by the Population Division of the United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-2000 period, the total fertility rate is
estimated to be at or below the level of 2.1 children per woman in
61 countries or areas of the world, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In nearly all of the more developed nations, fertility is
significantly below the level necessary for the replacement of
generations, it added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s and 1990s fertility has decreased to levels below
replacement in several countries from less developed regions.
</P>
<P>
Declines in fertility levels have pushed back the date the
world population reaches 6 billion, said UNFPA Executive
Director Nafis Sadik.
</P>
<P>
The trend that fertility levels in developing nations are
continuing to fall is in part the result of better reproductive
health and family planning services and improved education of
women, Sadik said.
</P>
<P>
However, she cautioned that world population is still growing
by 78 million a year. "We have come half way towards the goal of
slowing overall population growth but there are no guarantees that
this success will continue," she said.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Integration Top ECOWAS Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sub-regional peace and
economic integration will be on top of the Agenda for the coming
summit of the Econic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
scheduled for October 30-31 in Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press on the agenda of the summit, Nigerian
Minister of National Planning Rasheed Gbadamosi said here
Wednesday that the leaders from the 16 ECOWAS member states will
discuss the situation in Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
They will consider and approve the establishment of a
permanent mechanism for conflict prevention, management and
resolution, peace-keeping and security in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
There has been a call for the transformation of the current
ECOWAS intervention force ECOMOG into a permanent sub-regional
peace-keeping force, considering its success in restoring peace
and democracy in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG, formed in 1990 after the outbreak of the Liberian
civil war, has been depending heavily on Nigeria for personnel
and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the permanent conflict resolution will
give more resources as well as moral justice to the operation of
the ECOMOG or anything transformed to it.
</P>
<P>
According to Gbadamosi, who is also the chairman of the ECOWAS
Council of Ministers, the summit will also discuss conflicts in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Horn of Africa and the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The summit will discuss the fund strains currently faced by
the ECOWAS, as member countries are reportedly owing as much as
40 million U.S. Dollars in arrears of contributions.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, ECOWAS had decided to impose a levy of
0,05 percent on all imports from non-member countries. But
according to the minister, only seven countries have ratified the
protocol establishing the levy.
</P>
<P>
The much-expected ECOWAS travelers' checks will be finally
launched during the summit, a move that is regarded as a major
step attaining ECOWAS's target of establishing a single monetary
zone by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Other issues on the agenda include the establishment of an
ECOWAS drug fund and the election of a new chairman to replace
Abubakar, the current chairman.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Sugar
Development Corporation (SUDECO) expects to export 12,300 tons of
plantation cane sugar valued at about 4.4 million Sterling Pounds
to the European Union market during the 1998/99 season.
</P>
<P>
SUDECO general manager Frank Kibonde told reporters in Dar es
Salaam Wednesday that the sugar will be shipped in January next
year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kibonde said, sugar is being hauled from factories
to godowns in the city and that a substantial amount has already
arrived.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said this season's sugar output is more
than 2,000 tons higher than that of the last season.
</P>
<P>
He said that during 1997/98 the country earned 3.6 million
Sterling Pounds from exporting 102,00 tons of cane sugar to the
same market.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996/97 season, he said, SUDECO exported 13,000
tons to the EU market where it earned five million Sterling
Pounds compared to exports of 13,250 tons worth 5.5 million
Sterling Pounds in the previous season.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Tanzania's sugar exports to the EU market
are regulated by the the African Caribbean Pacific (ACP)
Countries Lome Convention under which Tanzania has an export
quota between 12,000 and 14,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the general manager said that during the 1998/99
season, SUDECO's target for local industries was set at 118,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
By October 13 this year, stocks of the Kilombero Sugar Company
were 42,000 tons, Mtibwa were 325,000 tons, Tanganyika planting
company (TPC) 4,000 tons and Kagera Sugar Company 3,750 tons
respectively.

The TRC report is due to be handed over to South African

ANC Secretary-General Kgalema Motlhanthe said his party

detrimental findings against the ANC was not considered because
the submission was too late.

Motlhanthe said a court interdict was the party's last resort
at this late hour. He also accused the TRC of "bad faith" in

<HEADLINE> Vaccine May Protect Pregnant Women Against Malaria: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An anti-adhesion vaccine may be
effective to protect pregnant women against malaria, a new study
suggested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been puzzled by the finding that women are at
increased risk from malaria during pregnancy, and the risk is
greatest during first pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the scientific journal Nature, Michal Fried and
his colleagues from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in
Washington, the United States, claimed that they've now found the
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The malarial parasite adheres to a molecule called chondroitin
sulphate A that accumulates in the human placenta.
</P>
<P>
After conducting research on pregnant women from Africa and
Asia, Fried found that women who have been pregnant before can
produce anti-adhesion antibodies that interfere with parasite
adhesion.
</P>
<P>
However, women in first pregnancies are lacking these
anti-adhesion antibodies, which the researchers believed is
related to their susceptibility to malaria.
</P>
<P>
This finding, together with the global effectiveness of
anti-adhesion antibodies, suggests that "an anti-adhesion vaccine
for maternal malaria may be globally effective," the researchers
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Cuts Cash Ratio for Commercial Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) announced Wednesday it will reduce cash ratio for
commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions to 12
percent from 13 percent effective on December 1.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued to banks and non-bank financial
institutions, and signed by CBK's deputy director for banking and
currency, Eunice Kagane, said the daily minimum cash ratio has
also been reduced from 10 to nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Cash ratio refers to the mandatory percentage of total
deposits that banks must deposit with the central bank. The
amount, which has been a subject of controversy in the banking
sector, does not earn any interest.
</P>
<P>
The cash ratio rule is one of the monetary policy tools
employed by the CBK to guard against excess liquidity in the
market and inflationary pressures, while at the same time
protecting the interests of depositors.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said it hopes that the new cash ratio requirements
will assist banks to further reduce interest rates. This is the
third time this year that the CBK has adjusted the cash ratio
requirement downwards.
</P>
<P>
The last reduction was in August when it was lowered from 14
to 13 percent. Finance minister Simeon Nyachae had announced an
earlier unit reduction in his June Budget speech.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of the business community that the lower cash
ratio requirement and the falling yields on Treasury bills will
cause interest rates to drop.
</P>
<P>
Base lending rates have been going down in the past three
weeks, as banks take advantage of reduced yields on the popular
91-day Treasury bill.
</P>
<P>
In the last auction, the instrument registered an average
interest rate of 19.82 percent, down from 20.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average base rate for banks is currently at 27.14 percent,
with Barclays Bank having the lowest rate at 22 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Argentine President
Carlos Menem Wednesday reaffirmed his country's sovereignty over
the Malvinas (Falklands) Islands.
</P>
<P>
Menem, the first Argentine president to visit Britain after the
Malvinas (Falklands) War in 1982, said in a keynote speech in
London that the war should never have happened and he had come to
Britain in a spirit of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
However, he restated long-standing Argentine policy on the
Malvinas (Falklands) by saying, "As president of Argentina, I
repeat we are fully convinced of the legitimacy of our historical
rights."
</P>
<P>
"I reaffirm solemnly that my country rejects the use of or the
threat of use of armed force to solve this question," Menem said.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, both governments will continue to work
together in a spirit of cooperation, trying to attain practical
agreements in all topics of mutual interest in the context of the
South Atlantic," he said. "Once again I tend my open hand in
friendship so we may rebuild our friendship and live together."
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, Menem laid a wreath of blue and white flowers
-- the Argentine national colors -- at the foot of the memorial in
London's St. Paul Cathedral to 252 British soldiers killed during
the Malvinas (Falklands) War.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Threatens Population of Africa: U.N. Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- AIDS is slashing the
life expectancy in many African countries and will effectively
reduce their populations within the next 10 to 15 years, the U.N.
Population Division said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disease has reached pandemic proportions in 29 sub-Saharan
countries most affected with H.I.V., the virus which causes AIDS,
the Division said in a report released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Botswana, the hardest-hit country, life expectancy is
projected to fall to 41 years by 2005, 29 years less than expected
in the absence of AIDS. The expectancy which stood at 61 years
only five years ago, has dropped to 47 now.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, where one of every five adults is infected with
the virus, the high mortality rate is significantly reducing the
country's population and its growth from 3.3 percent a year
between 1980 and 1985 to 1.4 percent now and an estimated minus 1
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 million persons in the world currently infected by
H.I.V., 26 million or 86 percent reside in 34 countries, the said
sub-Saharan countries included, the Division said in its 1998
Revision of World Population Estimates and Projections.
</P>
<P>
It said by 2010-2015, the average life expectancy at birth in
these countries could be only 47 years, representing a loss of 16
years to AIDS.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member Chinese
delegation currently studying the operations of the Ghana Police
Service Wednesday visited selected police stations in the Tema
police district in south Ghana, Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Lu Bin, deputy director-general of
police in China, visited Harbor, Afienya and Dodowa police
stations and later met the chiefs of Dodowa.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the delegation, Mohammed Alhassan, Assistant
Commissioner of Police in charge of Tema, a port bordering the
Gulf of Guinea, said Tema, as an industrial city, records about
300 to 400 stealing cases monthly.
</P>
<P>
As crime preventive measures, the police carry out patrol
duties in the industrial areas and in the communities.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas, Alhassan said the police depend on chiefs
to get their suspects since they are directly involved with the
people. "We encourage the formation of neighborhood watch-dog
committees in the communities to help crime prevention," he said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with chiefs, Kofi K. Manfo, Assistant
Commissioner of Police who accompanied the delegation, said
although the police have inadequate logistics, they manage to
control the situation.
</P>
<P>
He asked the public to cooperate with the police to provide
security.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, which leaves Ghana today, has also
visited the Cape Coast Castle on the coast line and the Akosombo
dam.

LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Malawi government said
Wednesday that it has finally normalized its relations with Libya
despite the concerns of the U.S. and British governments.
</P>
<P>
The Malawi government said in a statement that under an
agreement signed recently the two countries will cooperate in the
fields of economy, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also set up a joint permanent cooperation
commission and sign a protocol on tourism cooperation, according

Malawi tourism minister Patrick Mbewe who signed the accord,
was quoted as saying that from now on, the visions of the two
countries shall be put into practice with a view to enhancing
intra-Africa and south-south cooperation for the interests of the
people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malawi will benefit in areas like infrastructure
development, tourism, agriculture and health from its improved
relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, the normalization of the relations triggered concerns
of the U.S. and British governments.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Calls Election for November 30 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
announced Wednesday that a general election will be held in
Canada's French-speaking province on November 30.
</P>
<P>
"The November 30 election will have a special character,"
Bouchard said while announcing the date of the election, which
will last 33 days.
</P>
<P>
"Quebecers will choose the ideas, the team and the premier who
will bring Quebec into the third millennium," Bouchard said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Bouchard met his cabinet and had it adopt a
decree that is required to dissolve Quebec's legislature, the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Then, he signed the election decree along with
Lieutenant-Governor Lise Thibault to complete the process of
calling the election, which could determine the future of Quebec
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
If Bouchard's Parti Quebecois (PQ) is re-elected, Canada will
probably have to witness another referendum on Quebec independence
in a few years.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Bouchard, who has been PQ leader and premier of
the province since early 1996, has said that he will work toward
holding another referendum if elected.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that the independence-oriented Parti
Quebecois is in a virtual tie in popular support with the
pro-Canadian unity Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
Liberal leader Jean Charest said a vote for the Liberals would
be a vote for change. "It's very much a campaign that will be in
the context of what kind of future do we want for Quebec," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from independence, the campaign is also expected to
feature debates over budget cuts and economic priorities.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Butler of Distorting Test Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday accused chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler of attempting to distort the
results of laboratory tests on Iraqi shells.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi presidential adviser Amir Saadi told reporters Wednesday
evening that the results of American, French and Swiss labs have
undoubtly shown the non-existence of VX, a lethal nerve gas, on
Iraqi warhead fragments.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), headed
by Richard Butler, on Monday submitted a report to the Security
Council saying that French test had found possible traces of nerve
gas VX on Iraqi warhead fragments.
</P>
<P>
The report said France found a "degradation product" of a
nerve agent, which could be VX or other nerve agents such as Sarin
or Soman, in one of the 40 examples of Iraqi warhead fragments.
</P>
<P>
However, the report admitted that Swiss tests have proved
negative, as did a second round of United States tests on other
samples.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. army laboratory announced in June that it found traces
of VX agent on samples of Iraqi warhead fragments.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the United States of faking the results and
insisted that French re-test them.
</P>
<P>
Eighty samples from different areas of a warhead dump in Iraq
were then given to Swiss and French government laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Iraq admitted in the past that it had experimented with VX
agent, but said it never succeeded in weaponizing it.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM and Butler of serving U.S.
interests and trying to create pretexts to prolong sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed crippling sanctions on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be
lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that Iraq is free of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Should Be Respected: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said here Wednesday that former President Kenneth Kaunda
should be respected although he made some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
He urged Zambian people and government officials to respect
the former president, who ruled the country ever since its
independence in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by Chiluba
in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said Kaunda and his former ministers must be respected
as people who laid the foundation for Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Though Kaunda and the his former government made some mistakes
there are a lot of things for which Zambians need to thank them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also stressed the need for leaders to be responsible
for maintaining peace in Zambia, saying that peace will only be
maintained in the country to the extent that leaders allow it to
be.
</P>
<P>
After losing to Chiluba, Kaunda had been struggling to win
back his power but was barred from running for presidency in the
last elections in 1996 because his parents are Malawians.
</P>
<P>
Under a constitutional amendment adopted before the 1996 poll
anybody whose parents are foreigners are not eligible for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
But Kaunda announced last June that he will quit active party
politics only days after his release from under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested last December 25 for alleged involvement
in the October 28 coup attempt in 1997. Later Kaunda was put
under house arrest and charged with misprison of treason.

<HEADLINE> Report: Head of Nixon Impeachment Panel Says Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Representative Peter
Rodino, who presided over the impeachment hearings that led to
President Richard Nixon's resignation, says there isn't enough
evidence so far to warrant removing President Bill Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
The allegations stemming from Clinton's relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky do not constitute "high
crimes and misdemeanors," Rodino said Tuesday, The Star-Ledger of
Newark reported.
</P>
<P>
Rodino said that if no other evidence is released, "I would say
that this does not rise to that level where we have to consider it
to be a ground to remove from office the president of the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Rodino, a Democrat, was chairman of the Judiciary Committee of
the House of Representatives in 1974 when it approved three
articles of impeachment against Nixon and is credited with
crafting a bipartisan consensus for the procedure. Nixon resigned
before the full House voted whether to approve the articles for a
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
Rodino's committee concluded that "in an impeachment
proceeding, a president is called to account for abusing powers
that only a president possesses."
</P>
<P>
Now, Rodino questions whether Clinton had done anything that
satisfies that definition.
</P>
<P>
The 89-year-old former congressman, who served in the House for
40 years before retiring in 1988, also criticized independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's decision to include "tawdry" sexual
material in his report to Congress, and the decision by Republican
leaders to release it, along with Clinton's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-month Nixon hearings, Rodino's committee worked
mainly behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
"There were many things that we could have released -- I won't
talk about them now -- but we didn't," Rodino said. "We didn't
want to inflame passions. We didn't consider them relevant to
whether or not there were grounds for impeachment."
</P>
<P>
Two members of the House Judiciary Committee -- Representative
James Rogan, a Republican, and Representative Steve Rothman, a
Democrat -- met with Rodino in recent months to discuss the
Clinton inquiry.

MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- About 43 percent of Russians
back neither the Serbs nor the ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav
republic of Kosovo, a latest opinion poll showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll of 1,608 Russians, only 15 percent of the
respondents support the Serbs and a merely 4 percent support the
Albanians, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The poll was taken by the Public Opinion Fund on October 23-26.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 percent were undecided and 13 percent said they knew
nothing about the conflict.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming 63 percent of the respondents oppose Russia
providing military assistance to Yugoslavia if NATO bombs it.
Military aid was advocated by 20 percent of respondents. The
remaining 17 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday that Russia hoped that the situation in Kosovo had
entered the channel of political settlement, which was
consistently supported by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the Tuesday decision by the NATO
Council to suspend the automatic implementation of plans to carry

"cannot be fulfilled without a new political decision of the NATO
Council."

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Spokesman: Yeltsin Still in Full Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is still in full control of the country and his "functions have
virtually not changed," his spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Yakushkin told the Ekho Moskvy radio that the functions
of the apparatus and administration remain the same, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who canceled a trip to Austria earlier this week for
"serious fatigue," is recuperating in the Barvikha sanitarium near
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin will stay there until the end of the
week and then take a vacation.
</P>
<P>
He disagreed with the statement that the presidential
administration "is losing the levers of control."
</P>
<P>
"The president has one good trait -- he listens to what others
say, but makes decisions himself," Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to influence Boris Yeltsin, even for those
who have been working with him for many years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, suffered from a cold and bronchitis earlier this
month, which forced him to cut short a visit to Kazakhstan by one
day.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled Tuesday trip to Austria was canceled at the last

<HEADLINE> UK Launches DNA Bank to Tackle Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain has launched a project
to collect 100,000 samples of human DNA so that people at risk of
serious illness can be identified.
</P>
<P>
The DNA bank project, which costs 12 million pounds (20 million
U.S. dollars), will also allow drugs to be customized, the Daily
Telegraph newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first step of the project will be to collate information on
60,000 blood samples that have already collected and then extend
the database to people who have taken part in long-term health
studies, some dating back to more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
The news of the British project comes only days after American
scientists announced that the genome, the three-billion "letter"
human genetic code, will be deciphered by 2003, two years earlier
than thought.
</P>
<P>
By launching the DNA database, Britain is preparing to rise to
this "post-genome challenge" by studying how this code varies
across the British population, the Daily Telegraph said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Colombia to Cooperate on Fight Against Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Colombian President Andres Pastrana Wednesday signed a joint
agreement committing their nations to cooperate in combating drug
trafficking and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against drugs is our joint responsibility," Clinton
said at a Rose Garden news conference. "It must unite us, not
divide us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana hailed the renewed cooperation between the United
States and Colombia, not only on anti-drug trafficking efforts,
but also on the environment, education and economics.
</P>
<P>
During a joint news conference, Clinton said they also agreed
to use proceeds from assets forfeited by drug traffickers to
bolster Colombia counter-narcotics enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the United States will provide 280 million
U.S. dollars in new assistance to Colombia for the fight against
drugs as well as for economic development.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pastrana opened his state visit here by promising to
seek a "renewed partnership" with the United States and to work
toward creation of a drug-free hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Colombian relations were strained during the four-year
tenure of Pastrana's predecessor, President Ernesto Samper, who
was suspected of ties to Colombian narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Alluding indirectly to that trying period, Pastrana said, "I
come here to inaugurate a new era of relations between Colombia
and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We will work together to combat illegal drugs.
We have worked together, but we must do more _ for both our
peoples have suffered greatly from the drug trade and its
brutality."
</P>
<P>
"The battle against drugs is a common battle. It must unite our
people, not divide them," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana, who arrived here Tuesday, met with Clinton a few days
before his inauguration two months ago.

<HEADLINE> Historians Deplore Impeachment Inquiry of Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 historians in
the United States issued a statement Wednesday deploring the
decision of the House of Representatives to conduct an impeachment
inquiry, saying it could leave the presidency "permanently
disfigured and diminished."
</P>
<P>
"Although we do not condone President Clinton's private
behavior or his subsequent attempts to deceive, the current
charges against him depart from what the (Constitution's) framers
saw as grounds for impeachment," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 258-176 on October 8 for an open-ended
investigation of Clinton's conduct toward former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
charges that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
A president's lying about his sex life -- even under oath --
does not constitute grounds for impeachment, the historians said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think the founders would have regarded this as a high
crime or misdemeanor," Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a historian who
served in John F. Kennedy's White House, said at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Lying about illicit relations is commonplace, even among
presidents, said Southern historian C. Vann Woodward, one of the
organizers of the historians' petition.
</P>
<P>
Woodward said that an action must be "an offense against the
state" to be impeachable.
</P>
<P>
The House action "creates a novel, all-purpose search for any
offense by which to remove a president from office," the
historians' statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sean Wilentz of Princeton said the petition grew out of a
conversation he had with Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
Wilentz said he sent e-mails to 30 to 40 historians who would
share his view of the impeachment proceedings as contrary to the
intentions of the Constitution's authors.
</P>
<P>
"Within three days 300 people had contacted me," Wilentz said.
</P>
<P>
The statement called the impeachment proceedings "extremely
ominous for the future of our political institutions."
</P>
<P>
"If carried forward, they will leave the presidency permanently
disfigured and diminished, at the mercy as never before of the
caprices of any Congress. The presidency... will be crippled," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The drive drew signatories from more than 130 colleges,
including some of the country's best-known historians.
</P>
<P>
Wilentz said only one historian who was asked to sign declined.
</P>
<P>
But he said he suspected "plenty" of Republicans were among the
signers and a few of those who signed have called for Clinton's
resignation.

<HEADLINE> U.S., European Home Office Market Fuel HK's Stationery Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly expanding home
office market in the United States and the growing market in
Europe have fueled growth in Hong Kong's stationary exports, a
senior official of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of an international trade fair
for stationery, office supplies and educational systems (Pen &AMP;
Paper '98) Benjamin Chau, TDC's senior manager of exhibitions,
said the market potential for stationery products in China's
mainland is also promising with rising income level and
educational demand in the country.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, jointly organized by the TDC and Messe Frankfurt (HK) Ltd.
for the third time, features 109 exhibitors from 10 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
"As a meeting point for traders from the international paper,
office supplies and stationery industries, Pen &AMP; Paper '98 can
strengthen Hong Kong's position as the trading hub for stationery
items in the Asia-Pacific region," Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for the stationery business remain promising
instead of the economic slowdown in Asia, and people's confidence
was demonstrated in the fact that the number of exhibitors at this
year's fair maintained at the same level as in 1997, said Michael
Peters, managing director of Messe Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
"The rapidly expanding home office market in the U.S. and
Europe, and the rising demand for sophisticated stationery
products in China's mainland, all point to more business
opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, which is Hong Kong's largest stationery
buyer, it is estimated that the number of Americans working at
home was close to 45 million in 1996, and it expected to increase
by seven percent annually until 2005.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong exported 16.4 billion HK dollars (2.1
billion U.S. dollars) of stationery supplies. For the first half
of this year, the value grew by four percent over the same period
last year to register at 7.7 billion HK dollars (0.98 billion U.S.
dollars). Total exports to the U.S. and Europe rose by 15 and 13
percent respectively during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Europe accounted for 31 percent and 21 percent
respectively as they are the largest buyers of Hong Kong's
stationery products.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Assembly President Meets Hyundai Founder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kim Yong Nam, President of
the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), on Wednesday held talks with
visiting South Korean Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung.
</P>
<P>
The talks at the Mansuade Assembly Hall was held "in a cordial
atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings," the KCNA,
DPRK's state news agency, reported.
</P>
<P>
"Non-governmental cooperation between the North and the South
in various fields under the ideal of reunification and great unity
of the nation is good," Kim told Chung.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Mount Kumgang tourism program Chung intend to
secure through his visit, Kim said he wished the program would
become not merely a tourism project, but "a noble work conducive
to national reconciliation, unity and reunification."
</P>
<P>
"Tourism at Mount Kumgang proceeds from our warm compatriotic
feelings. We have taken into account the South Korean people's
desire to see the world famous mountain," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government, Kim said, would pay great attention to
non-governmental economic cooperation between the Korean
Asia-Pacific Peace Committee of the DPRK, and the Hyundai Business
Group from South Korea so that it can proceed well.
</P>
<P>
Chung Ju-yung crossed the inter-Korean border on Tuesday via
the truce village of Panmunjom to begin his second trip to
Pyongyang with a donation of 501 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
He visited the DPRK in June with a donation of 500 head of
cattle, 50 trucks and food. During that visit, Hyundai reached an
agreement with the DPRK to jointly develop the tourism resources
of Mount Kumgang in the North.
</P>
<P>
Chung was the first guest Kim had met from the south since
taking office.

<HEADLINE> China: World's Fastest Growing Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The world's leading mobile
telecommunications company Nokia said it regards China as the
fastest growing market for international telecommunications
companies and its most important market.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the company had 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in sales in
China, more than double the 1996 figure, and expected its business
in China to increase faster in other part of the world this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Juergen Lagleder, vice-president of Siemens
Ltd. China, the country has become one of the company's two
fastest growing markets, after the United States.
</P>
<P>
With eight joint ventures in China, Siemens said that China is
expected to become its second largest mobile communications market
this year.
</P>
<P>
China has had an annual growth rate of over 30 percentage
points in telecommunications for several consecutive
years. According to the Ministry of Information Industry (MII),
growth in the industry will remain at a rate of above 28 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users in the country is increasing 200
percent a year, four times the world-wide growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ricks, executive vice-president of Ericsson China, said
that China is an ideal market to introduce the most advanced
telecommunication technology and his company is negotiating with
a research institute to develop wide band mobile communications
technology for the China market.
</P>
<P>
The company also set up a research and development center in
Hong Kong earlier this year. Its sales in China were 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars last year, accounting for ten percent of the
company's global sales.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson now have the lion's share of
China's mobile communications market, while Alcatel, China Giant
Dragon, and Siemens have most of the telephone switch market. The
U.S. Lucent and Nortel of Canada are the biggest in China's
optical fiber cable business.
</P>
<P>
An Ericsson executive said that China has placed more
importance on hardware than on software and service in developing
its telecommunications industry, but software and service will
account for at least 80 percent of the global telecommunications
market in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has many unique features that the European
and American markets do not have. For example, Ericsson is
developing a series of low-cost mobile phones for the China
market, each priced at around 300 U.S. dollars that he expects to
be popular here.

<HEADLINE> China Asking For International Cooperation In Piracy Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Shen Rengan, Deputy
Commissioner of China's State Copyright Office, says that China
will crack down on piracy even though pirated audiovisual products
smuggled from the outside have been distributed.
</P>
<P>
His office will cooperate with governmental and non-governmental
copyright protection offices in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say that piracy is a global problem. A report
from the International Intellectual Property Alliance shows that
the U.S. copyright industry suffered an estimated 10.8 billion
U.S. dollars in losses because of piracy in 55 countries.
</P>
<P>
The International Publishing Association regards reproducing of
copyrighted works of others without the authorization of the owner
of copyright, without making remuneration and in most cases,
without indicating the sources, piracy. This mainly involves the
reproduction and distribution of books, periodicals, CDs, VCDs,
multimedia products, motion pictures and computer software.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, Chinese copyright authorities have
campaigned against piracy frequently, seizing millions of pirated
products and putting smugglers in prison, Shen says.
</P>
<P>
The revised Criminal Law states that these offenders may be
sentenced to three to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
People who help to seize illegal disk production lines can be
paid up to 350,000 yuan (42,000 U.S. dollars) in reward money..
</P>
<P>
Copyright pirates are a destructive force that disrupts the
market economy and damages civilization, he says, but these
offenders are becoming bolder and more sophisticated in
reproducing and distributing pirated products.
</P>
<P>
The governments of various countries need a cooperative attitude
and need to come together to crack down on illegal activities to
strengthen the international protection of intellectual property,
he concludes.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Still on Rise, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade, though
 negatively affected by the regional financial crisis, still
recorded moderate increases in the first nine months of the year,
a Chinese trade official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, made the point when addressing some 100 leaders of
the world's highest profile corporations and policy-makers who
were here attending a Fortune CEO Roundtable.
</P>
<P>
He cited customs figures as saying that China's trade amounted
to 233 billion U.S. dollars between January and September this
year, a 2.4 percent increase from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Exports grew by 3.9 percent to 134 billion U.S. dollars while
imports nudged up 0.4 percent to 99 billion U.S. dollars, leading
to 35 billion U.S. dollars in trade surplus, Shi told the first
CEO roundtable organized by Fortune Magazine in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The achievement was especially noticeable given the 6.3 percent
fall of China's exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Shi added, new foreign investment contracts
went up 2.5 percent to 36 billion U.S. dollars, while actually
utilized foreign capital totaling 31 billion U.S. dollars, the
same as last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official pledged to "keep foreign trade growing for
the rest of the year", by effectively implementing market
diversification, adjusting and optimizing export mix and
encouraging enterprises to tap their own potentials.
</P>
<P>
On top of the current state of the nation's foreign trade, Shi
went further to say that "two fundamental transformations in the
foreign economic and trade area will be accelerated."
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand we will build up a new foreign economic and
trade system compatible with the socialist market economy and
international rules and practices; on the other hand, we will
transform the mode of economic and trade growth," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
This means that "China's trade will eventually adopt the
intensive growth mode based on quality, efficiency and reputation,
leaving behind the quantitative or extensive growth model mainly
based on scale expansion."
</P>
<P>
One hundred and five participants from the United States,
Europe, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Singapore, the Republic of
Korea, Hong Kong and Japan were present at the two-day roundtable,
held in association with Time Magazine and hosted by the Better
Hong Kong Foundation which groups leading Hong Kong business
people.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "China, How Hong Kong Stays One Step Ahead," the
roundtable will discuss Hong Kong's future through plenary
sessions and panels. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang have been invited to give
speeches Friday.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Verifiers to Start Mission in Kosovo Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The first group of
the OSCE verification mission force will arrive here next week and
start their work, an OSCE spokesman said in Pristina on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mans Nyberg, the spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission force, told Xinhua that
only headquarters staff were in Pristina to set up the
headquarters, but more will arrive next week to start the
verification mission.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke two weeks ago, a
2,000-strong OSCE mission force will be deployed in Kosovo to
verify the compliance by the conflicting sides with
U.N. resolutions, which include the withdrawal of Serb troops and
the return of refugees and displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said this is the largest mission OSCE has ever had in
its history. About 250 staff members will work in the
headquarters and nearly 2,000 in the field.
</P>
<P>
The major task of the mission, according to Nyberg, is to
verify the compliance of U.N. resolution in Kosovo, to verify the
ceasefire and ensure a free movement without any unnecessary
police checks. And when the political process starts, it will
organize elections.
</P>
<P>
In a word, "we are trying to create a general atmosphere of
confidence that a peaceful solution can be possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it will take quite some time before the
2,000 verifiers are all deployed in Kosovo, but 200 to 300 will be
seen in Kosovo in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE mission plans to set up five regional centers in
different towns, and some small offices all over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Talking about safety of these unarmed civilian observers, he
said there are of course dangers for them, as for all the other
members of international organizations in Kosovo, including the
UNHCR, ICRC and NGOs (non-governmental organizations).
</P>
<P>
"But since the Serb troops are pulled out, there seems to be
less chances of renewed fighting in Kosovo, so we don't foresee
that much dangerous situation here now for our teams."
</P>
<P>
However, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on Tuesday
it would be unwise to send 2,000 unarmed international observers
into Kosovo until NATO established an "extraction force,"
commanded from neighboring Macedonia, to rescue them in emergency
case.
</P>
<P>
What concerns the verifiers most at the present stage, the
spokesman said, is the mines and booby traps scattered in the
field in Kosovo, which is not easy to detect and avoid.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite concerned about that and are waiting for the UN
office to start work here, then we will ask them for mine-clearing
help," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said before the OSCE verifiers arrive, the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observation Mission (KDOM) was doing the job of observation.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an agreement between President Milosevic and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in June, the KDOM, divided into
American, EU and Russian groups, were in Kosovo for the
verification job. Once the OSCE mission starts operation, the
70-member KDOM will dissolve.
</P>
<P>
When asked what equipment these unarmed officers will have in
doing their jobs, Nyberg said they will have pens and papers, and
binoculars and radios, just for them to write reports to higher
level authorities.
</P>
<P>
The mission is set to stay in Kosovo for a year. But as the
term is subject to extension if requested by either the OSCE or by
Yugoslavia, he believed at least two years were needed before the
mission can pull out of the troubled province.

energy efficiency measures will help reduce electricity costs,
which in turn will improve business competitiveness and increase
Hong Kong's attractiveness to overseas investors, an official of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands Kim
Salkeld on Thursday elaborated on Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's
policy objectives on energy efficiency and conservation outlined
in his second Policy Address issued earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
To encourage developers and architects to adopt energy
efficient design in new buildings, Salkeld announced the launching
of a voluntary Energy Efficiency Registration Scheme on both
public and private buildings. He said the SAR government was
determined to improve its own efficiency in using energy and to
encourage business and the community to benefit from so doing.
</P>
<P>
While no major achievements would result from any single
measure, a series of small improvements would however add up to a
significant result in energy saving, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the Electrical and Mechanical Services
Department (EMSD) will maintain a register on buildings or parts
of buildings that comply with the Codes of Practice for Energy
Efficiency Lighting Installations and Energy Efficiency
Air-Conditioning Installations published by the department in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers, property owners, architects, building
services consultants and property management agencies are invited
to join in the scheme. After successful registration, participants
are allowed to include this registration in the commercial
publicity materials of their buildings.
</P>
<P>
Salkeld noted that certified energy efficient buildings should
attract tenants who could expect a saving in electricity cost and
an increase their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
By introducing the Scheme, recognition will be given to those
who achieved high energy efficiency by complying with the Codes of
Practice for energy efficiency in building services installations.
The scheme will be extended to cover electrical installations in
early 1999 and lifts and escalator installations in early 2000
when the relevant Codes are published.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the scheme will be reviewed after 18
months.
</P>
<P>
On other energy efficiency measures that could help improve
business competitiveness, Salkeld said the government would
disseminate information to the private sector on retrofitting
existing buildings with energy efficient equipment.
</P>
<P>
And, a consultancy study has been commissioned for the
feasibility of wider adoption of water-cooled air-conditioning
systems and to identify the associated technical, financial and
institutional constraints. If it has been proven to be practical,
it could lower business costs and provide opportunities for
private sector participation in infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
To promote greater awareness of energy efficiency, an Energy
Efficiency Labeling Scheme for household electrical appliances
will be in place to provide energy efficiency information on
selected household appliances to consumers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- One seat vacated in the first
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) has been filled by Regional Council member Tang Siu-tong.
</P>
<P>
The result was revealed after a nine-hour long by-election from
9 AM to 6 PM here Thursday during which 50 Regional Council
members cast their votes, choosing one Legislative Council member
for the Regional Council functional constituency from three
candidates Ngan Kam-chuen, Tang Siu-tong and Chiang Lai-wan.
</P>
<P>
Tang won 28 votes as against 0 and 22 votes that Ngan and
Chiang got respectively during the by-election.
</P>
<P>
The by-election was conducted due to Tang Siu-tong of the
Regional Council constituency who was declared last month not duly
 elected following a court ruling that he had tied with another
rival candidate after some of his votes were declared.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the Electoral Affairs
Commission, was present at the final count.
</P>
<P>
The other seat vacated in the Legislative Council due to Chim
Pui-chung from the functional constituency, who was expelled from
the legislature after being sentenced to a three-year imprisonment
for fraud, was already filled by Fung Chi Kin.
</P>
<P>
He automatically becomes member of the Legislative Council
because he was the only one nominated for a by-election for the
Financial Services functional constituency.
</P>
<P>
The first SAR Legislative Council election was held on May 24
this year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Central Bank Revokes License of Inkombank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Russia on
Thursday revoked the license of Inkombank, once the country's
third largest bank, for violating banking laws and regulations and
its inability to pay mandatory deductions.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said the move was taken as the ruble's
slipping exchange rate and massive withdrawal of deposits by
Inkombak's clients over the past three months since the August 17
ruble devaluation and domestic debt default left it actually
insolvent, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, there were suggestions that the bank be
restructured, but the central bank said Thursday that any
alternatives of Inkombank's restructuring without stopping its
operations were impossible so far.
</P>
<P>
According to Vladimir Groshev, chairman of Inkombank's
supervisory board, some of the bank's assets were now "beyond
reach."
</P>
<P>
He said Inkombank would need a loan of 4 billion to 5 billion
rubles (250 million to 312.5 million dollars) to restart
operations.

<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Society for Human
Rights Studies today denounced a recent attack by a computer
hacker on its newly opened web page.
</P>
<P>
The website, www.humanrights-china.org, was defaced by a
computer hacker the evening of October 27th. Another website on
Tibet was also attacked at that time.
</P>
<P>
The Society said that it is a non-governmental organization
tied to the UN Economic and Social Council and that the website,
which was opened on October 19, provides information on China's
human rights condition. The attack was obviously meant to prevent
the world from learning more about China's human rights record and
stopping dialogues with the international community, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to Reuters, Anti-Online, a website which monitors
hackers' activities, says that the hacker, identified as "Bronc
Buster", was a member of a group known as "Legions of the
Underground" that has been responsible for several other
high-profile attacks, including one against the Time Warner cable
system.

<HEADLINE> French SP Wants Pinochet Be Brought Before Jurisdiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- France's ruling Socialist Party
said on Thursday that former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet
should be brought before a jurisdiction to answer questions about
the crimes he allegedly committed during his dictatorship in Chile
from 1973 until the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Guidoni, the national secretary for international
relations of the Socialist Party, said that the party wishes "with
 much conviction" that Pinochet "should be asked to respond to
questions about his crimes before a jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing would be more serious on the political side than
having launched a judicial procedure and having failed," he said,
in reference to a British court ruling on Wednesday that the
arrest warrant against Pinochet issued by the Spanish authorities
was invalid.
</P>
<P>
Guidoni said that the French Socialist Party has not forgotten
the 1973 coup d'etat in Chile and what happened around it.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party has "extremely close" relations with the
Chilean Socialist Party, which was the victim of the coup d'etat
staged by Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several French-Chilean families whose members were
killed or arrested and then disappeared during the Chilean
military dictatorship have raised pressure on the French
government to ask for the extradition of Pinochet from Britain
following the British court ruling.
</P>
<P>
"The risks to see General Pinochet return to his home country
are very great and it is up to the French authorities to fulfil
the historic mission to ask for his immediate arrest (by British
government)," said William Bourdon, one of the lawyers
representing the families.

PARIS -- France's ruling Socialist Party said on Thursday that
former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet should be brought before
a jurisdiction to answer questions about the crimes he allegedly
committed during his dictatorship in Chile from 1973 until the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Guidoni, the national secretary for international
relations of the Socialist Party, said that the party wishes "with
 much conviction" that Pinochet "should be asked to respond to
questions about his crimes before a jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
"Nothing would be more serious on the political side than
having launched a judicial procedure and having failed," he said,
in reference to a British court ruling on Wednesday that the
arrest warrant against Pinochet issued by the Spanish authorities
was invalid. (France-Chile-Pinochet)

afternoon called the car bombing in Gaza earlier in the morning a
"serious" incident.
</P>

The radio said that Netanyahu expressed his concern over the
incident in a telephone conversation with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Urges Stronger State Regulation of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Thursday that his government has "resolutely opted"
for strengthening state regulation of the economy in dealing with
its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The state must determine the parameters and trends in
industrial restructuring," Primakov said in Vladikavkaz, a city in
the Russian republic of North Ossetia, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said "order and discipline" must be ensured in implementing
contracts and "defending all forms of property."
</P>
<P>
Primakov, in Vladikavkaz to meet leaders of Russia's Caucasian
republics, turned 69 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin, recuperating at a sanatorium outside
Moscow following a bout of bronchitis, congratulated Primakov on
his birthday, commending his "colossal experience and exceptional
professionalism."
</P>
<P>
"You are a man, who never shuns difficulties and is able to
find optimal decisions in any situation," Itar-Tass quoted the
message as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to your colossal experience and exceptional
professionalism, many steps, which brook no delay, have already
been taken and are winning understanding in our society. You were
always able to rally the efforts of different political forces in
order to cope with nationwide tasks," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov took over as prime minister six weeks ago after the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, twice rejected Yeltsin's
nominee, former prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was called
back following the ouster of the Sergei Kiriyenko cabinet on
August 23.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, just two days after Yeltsin pledged that there
would be no ruble depreciation, Kiriyenko announced an effective
devaluation and default on its domestic bonds. The national
currency nosedived to over 20 rubles to the dollar from 6.2 and
prices skyrocketed in the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
In the birthday congratulation message, Yeltsin praised
Primakov for his courage and political will to assume
responsibility for the solution to the problems facing Russia.
</P>
<P>
As winter approaches, many in Russia's arctic regions are
facing shortages of food and fuel, and negotiations are already on
for the provision of emergency food aid.
</P>
<P>
The daily Izvestia newspaper reported Thursday that Russia
would need 4.5 million to 10 million tons of foreign grain
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chronic non-payment of pensions, salaries and
children's allowances persisted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko, who was responsible
for social affairs, said Wednesday that the government owes 70.5
billion rubles (4.41 billion U.S. dollars) to its citizens.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Continues to Decline in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports all declined
significantly further in September 1998 over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed in the external trade figures for September
1998 released Thursday by the Census and Statistics Department of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) decreased by 10.0 percent in September 1998 over a year
earlier to 114.2 billion HK dollars (14.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports decreased by 9.0
percent to 98.1 billion HK dollars (12.6 billion U.S. dollars) and
that of domestic exports by 15.5 percent to 16.1 billion HK
dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the value of imports decreased by 13.2
percent in September 1998 over a year earlier to 115.7 billion HK
dollars (14.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 1.5 billion HK dollars (0.2 billion
U.S. dollars), equivalent to 1.3 percent of the value of imports,
was recorded in September 1998. This was considerably smaller than
the corresponding deficit recorded in the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1998 as a whole, the value of
total exports was lower by 5.2 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that export
performance remained weak in September 1998, overshadowed by the
continued plunge in import demand in Japan and in other East Asian
economies hardest hit by the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Added to this was a recent slow-down in exports to the Chinese
mainland amidst a setback in the mainland's own exports, and in
exports to the United States in line with a moderation in import
demand in the U.S. economy.

<HEADLINE> Parenting Style Matters More than Income, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Good parents -- not family
income -- appear to make the biggest difference in the health and
welfare of Canadian children, says a new study in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Although children who live in poorer families are still more
likely to suffer health or behavior problems, a survey of more
than 20,000 families shows that attentive, patient parents can
overcome some disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
The study, which tracked about 23,000 children from infancy to
age 11 across the country, suggests that children growing up with
a single parent are more prone to behavior problems. They are 50
percent more likely to suffer from problems like aggression,
hyperactivity, or depression than those in two-parent families,
said the study.
</P>
<P>
But a startling discovery of the study is that children in
two-parent households which are considered ineffective or hostile
are five times more likely to have persistent behavioral problems
than those with a single but effective parent.
</P>
<P>
The study finds that children exposed to poor parenting are
nine times more prone to suffer from various behavioral problems
than other children.
</P>
<P>
Parents are categorized as ineffective or hostile in the study
based on how often they tell their children they aren't as good as
other kids, and become angry and punish their children.
Consistent or positive parents are defined as those who usually
carry out punishments fairly and laugh and play games regularly
with their children.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scholar Says IPR Protection Stimulates Growth of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Pamela Samuelson, a professor
</P>
<P>
ZW_Nnd information management at the University of California
at Berkeley, says that the intellectual property law will promote
growth of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that many factors contributed to the rapid
development of the Chinese economy, but favorable legal protection
for intellectual propertcreasingly important in
stimulating economic development," he says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made substantial progress by
adopting internationally recognized intellectual property laws,
committing itself to strengthening the enforcement of rights under
these laws, and establishing programs for traininal and
administrative officials, he told a symposium organized by the
China Intellectual Property Society and American Intellectual
Property Law Association.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reforms have mainly been in the agricultural
and manufacturing sectors, he said, but the information sector has
grown in recent nd has greater growth potential, and
markets for information products and services can only thrive when
intellectual property rights are secure.
</P>
<P>
China has tens of thousands of kilometers of optical fiber, 170
million telephones, 99.7 percent computerized, 20 million cellular
phones, and three million personal computers, 1.2 million of them
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
China has already developed a substantial body of intellectual
property laws and now faces the challenge of applying and refining
its laws so that they promote innovation and economic development,
he said.

<HEADLINE> IPR Protection Important for Global Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign Scholars
agree that intellectual property rights and effective IPR
protection will help economic development in the world in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
In spite of recent economic setbacks in parts of the world, new
and improved intellectual property systems continue to contribute
to the economic growth and well-being of the countries involved,
Todd Dickinson, a U.S. deputy commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks, told an international symposium of IPR protection
today.
</P>
<P>
"In today's global marketplace, he said, no single issue is
more important to shaping the future growth and development of the
world economy than intellectual property, and intellectual property
is finally getting the visibility and respect it deserves," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhigang, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Planning Department, said that the 21st century is the century in
which the knowledge-based economy plays a leading role on a global
scale and knowledge-based innovation has a natural connection with
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Tao Xinliang, an assistant dean at Shanghai University's
Intellectual Property School, said that, if there were no
international protection for the copyright of computer software,
there might be no Bill Gates and his software giant.
</P>
<P>
International protection of intellectual property in the times
of knowledge-based economy requires the expansion of scope of
protection according to high standards, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 experts and scholars from around the world were
present at the ongoing symposium jointly organized by the China
Intellectual Property Society and the American Intellectual

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Goes Up in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister of
Manpower Lee Boon Yang said Thursday that preliminary data show
unemployment rate in his country went up from 2.3 percent in June
to 4.5 percent in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ordinary Delegates' Conference of the National
Trades Union Congress, the minister told more than 1,000 delegates
that 5,500 more workers were retrenched in the 3rd quarter of
1998, augmenting to 20,000 the total number of retrenched workers
for the first nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure is more than double of the 9,847 retrenchments for
the whole of last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lee also drew attention to the fact that the job
vacancy-unemployed person ratio, which measures the number of jobs
available to job seekers, fell below 1 for the first time in more
than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"The ratio was 0.8 in June 1998, compared to an average of 2.5
over the previous few years," he said, adding "in other words,
there are only 8 job openings for every 10 persons seeking work."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the number of job vacancies fell to 19,000 in
June this year, which is 57 percent below the 45,000 vacancies in
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that a higher relative cost of doing
business in Singapore has been cited by most companies as a major
concern and the government has to address this concern.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the labor cost is the largest component of business
costs, he said the National Wages Council was reconvened in
September to revise salary guidelines and will determine if a
severe wage restraint, or even a wage cut, would be necessary for
Singapore to regain international competitiveness and encourage
companies to retain instead of retrenching workers.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed his hope that a strong tripartite relationship
between workers, employers and the government will be established
and concrete steps taken to evolve a globally competitive
workforce so as to tide out the current economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. Newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Although there is a cease-fire in Kosovo, both the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians who live there have continued some killing and
seem to be looking for ways to poke around the edges of the truce
and keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has agreed to
allow a U.S. delegation to visit there next month to discuss
American concerns about the construction of a vast underground
complex that is feared to house a nuclear weapons program, the
U.S. State Department said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's High Court ruled Wednesday that Augusto Pinochet
cannot be tried in court in London for anything he did while he
was president of Chile, citing an ancient rule of British common
law that says a sovereign is immune from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
-- Some 400 of leading U.S. historians and presidential
scholars came to President Bill Clinton's defense Wednesday with
an open letter complaining that if the impeachment proceedings
against him are successful it would leave the presidency
permanently disfigured and hold the most serious implications for
U.S. constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found 46 percent of
those most likely to go to the polls Thursday plan to support
Democratic House candidates, while 43 percent back Republicans.
That reverses a four-point lead the Republican Party had a month
ago. The poll also found no single issue dominating tight races,
underscoring predictions that outcomes may depend on late ads.
The Republican Party has a big edge in paying for them.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has given up day-to-day
control of the government, a top aide said, and the Russian
president's doctors say he will go on vacation after spending a
few more days in a sanitarium. Separately, foreign investors are
stepping up efforts to recover money frozen by Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Official Praises Sino-Bangladeshi Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Affairs State
Minister Abul Hassan Chowdhury Thursday said that the friendship
between Bangladesh and China is not expedient but built on the
basis of mutual understanding and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while meeting visiting Chinese Assistant
Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi here.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government attaches great importance to
developing its relations with China and firmly supports China's
stand on such issues as human rights, Taiwan and Tibet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Sino-Bangladeshi friendship has taken root
in the hearts of the two peoples, and so it has strong vitality.
The friendly relations of cooperation between the two countries
have entered into a new era, he observed.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Chinese government always sees Bangladesh as
a reliable friend. "We will never forget the support rendered by
the Bangladeshi government to China," he stated. "We will, as
always, spare no effort in furthering the existing good
relations."

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pledges to Punish Bombing Attack Planners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat condemned the car bombing
attack in Gaza Thursday, vowing to bring those responsible to
justice, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
After covening an emergency meeting with top Palestinian
intelligence and security officials soon after the attack, Arafat
issued a statement saying that the PNA will "do all in its power"
to track down those behind the terror act.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at about 7:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) at an
intersection of the major Jewish settlement bloc of Gush
Katif. Three people were killed and three others injured when a
car loaded with explosive blew up after colliding with a military
jeep.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the car was apparently trying to run into a
school bus carrying about 40 children of the settlers. One of the
two military jeeps escorting the bus moved in to intercept the
car, in which the suicide driver managed to detonate dozens of
kilograms of explosive inside.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian attacker and one Israeli soldier were among
the dead.
</P>
<P>
Top Palestinian security officials said they would respond
harshly to the attack and would track down the people or any
organization planning the attack as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller to Israel Radio claimed responsibility for
the suicide attack on behalf of Islamic militant group Hamas,
saying that was an operation against Israeli military occupation
of Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police have cooperated with Israeli soldiers after
the incident, helping to seal off the scene and search around the
areas. Israeli troops closed the Gaza Strip, barring hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
The bombing attack, the latest of a series of terror acts in
the last few days in Gaza and the West Bank, has put the recent
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal under serious tests.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials blamed the PNA for failing to prevent the
attack, demanding that the PNA wage an all-out war against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The explosion again raised concern over the implementation of
the just-concluded peace agreement which stipulates Israeli troops
redeployment from 13 percent of the West Bank starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side's agreement to the withdrawal hinges on
Palestinians' pledge of tougher crackdown on Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Jewish settler was shot dead by suspected
Palestinian militants in the divided West Bank city of
Hebron. Several hours later, a Palestinian man was found murdered
outside a Jewish settlement near Nablus in what seemed to be a
revenge killing.

<HEADLINE> Philippines President to Limit Speaking Engagements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced here Thursday that he will limit his speaking
engagements in order to be able to devote his time to his work as
the head of the state.
</P>
<P>
The president made the announcement after he was criticized for
his failure to attend the 16th anniversary celebration of the Last
Watering Hole Association Inc., a group of retired officers of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"A president has a lot of things to do. I cannot attend to all
the speaking engagements where I'm invited," Estrada said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
He announced that he will no longer be accepting similar
invitations, except to conferences that are critical to the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the media should not
make a big deal out of the situation, as Estrada can only attend
to one speaking engagement a day, forcing him to turn down a lot
of other invitations sent to him by various organizations.
</P>
<P>
Barican denied reports that Estrada snubbed the affair of the
retired armed forces officers, saying the event was not even in
the his schedule since he had other engagements to attend to.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Trade Surplus to Hit 40 Billion Dollars in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is expected to
achieve its target trade surplus of 40 billion U.S. dollars this
year, the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on trade prospects, KITA said South Korean exports
would decline by 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, because of
corporate insolvencies and the decreasing demand from Japan and
southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the result is still better than the previous quarter's
9.7 percent drop, because of successful settlement of labor
disputes and recovery of international semiconductor prices.
</P>
<P>
Overseas shipments of steel, textiles and tires are expected to
keep rising in the last quarter of 1998, while petrochemical
products and general machinery would slow down, the report said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is expected to register 34.5 billion dollars in
exports and 23.1 billion dollars in imports in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The nation's exports and imports for the whole year are likely
to reach 132.5 billion and 92.2 billion dollars respectively,
resulting in a trade surplus of 40.3 billion dollars, KITA said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Hardware Industry Takes Challenges by Quick Response: FHKI Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An efficient management lies
behind the success of Hong Kong's building materials and hardware
industry, Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong
Industries, said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Against fast changing markets, Hong Kong companies emphasize
quick response to ensure effective marketing services to their
customers, and to monitor changing product trends," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the comments when speaking at the opening ceremony of
the Hong Kong International Hardware Show, organized for a second
year by Hong Kong's Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event has attracted 155 exhibitors from Canada,
China's mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Germany, Italy, India,
Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Among the items on display are innovative and useful new
products including do-it-yourself (DIY) products, home improvement
supplies, tools and equipment, outdoor fixtures and auto
accessories. Products and services in the field of building
supplies are included for the first time to meet the increasing
demand.
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing demand for DIY products for interior
decoration worldwide. Building hardware is increasingly designed
with emphasis on easiness of installation and maintenance," said
Tang.
</P>
<P>
Hardware products including building materials are some of Hong
Kong's major trading items. Last year, Hong Kong exported 57.14
billion HK dollars (7.33 billion U.S. dollars) worth of such
products, seven percent up from 1996. China's mainland, the U.S.,
Europe and Japan remain major markets for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, imports were up 10 percent to 87.84
billion HK dollars (11.26 billion U.S. dollars), with major
suppliers from China's mainland, Japan, Taiwan, U.S. and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Involved in Environmental Protection More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
women in many cities are giving up housework and shopping on the
weekend and joining family members in making people more aware of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Female volunteers have got a new understanding of the special
part they can play in environmental protection, according to Wang
Naikun, an All-China Women's Federation official.
</P>
<P>
She said that about 120 million women take part in tree
planting activities each year and have planted five billion trees
on more than 400,000 hectares of ground since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Niu Yuqin, a farmer in Shaanxi Province, has been planting
trees in desert areas in northwestern China for 13 years and has
helped turn a number of desert areas into oases. She has even been
given a United Nations award for her effort.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation also established an award in
1990 for women who make an outstanding contribution to
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Some women in Beijing have established a non-governmental
organization called Global Village to increase awareness of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Liao Xiaoyi, a Global Village official, said that women's
environmental awareness is important for establishing production
methods and improving lifestyles in line with the country's
efforts for sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
Because women are responsible for educating their children, an
enthusiastic mother can certainly pass on a love of the
environment to her children, she added.

<HEADLINE> Car Bombing Attack in Gaza, Arafat Condemns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An Islamic militant launched
a car bombing attack near a Jewish settlement in Gaza on Thursday
morning, killing himself and an Israeli soldier, injuring three
others.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
condemned the attack, vowing to bring those responsible to
justice, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
After covening an emergency meeting with top Palestinian
intelligence and security officials soon after the attack, Arafat
issued a statement saying that the PNA will "do all in its power"
to find those who were behind the terror act.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that a caller to the radio claimed
responsibility for the suicide attack on behalf of the islamic
militant group Hamas, saying the aim was to expel all Jewish
settlers out of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred about 7:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) in an
intersection of the major settlement of Gush Katif in southwestern
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the car was apparently trying to run into a
bus carrying about 40 children of settlers. One of the two
military jeeps escorting the bus moved in to intercept the car and
the suicide driver in the car managed to detonate dozens of
kilograms of explosive inside.
</P>
<P>
The children in the bus were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Top Palestinian security officials said they would respond
harshly to the attack and would trace down the people or any
organization planning the attack as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police have cooperated with Israeli soldiers after
the incident, helping seal off the scene and search around the
areas. Israeli troops closed the Palestinian self-ruled Gaza
Strip, barring hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from entering
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The explosion has raised concern over the implementation of the
just-reached Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement which stipulates
Israeli troops redeployment from 13 percent of the West Bank
scheduled to start Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side's agreement to the withdrawal is on
Palestinians' pledge of tougher crackdown on extremists.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said on TV that the PNA must wage an all-out
war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security cooperation on particular cases was not
enought, he said, adding the Israeli side is closely watching
PNA's reaction to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these remarks, Palestinian security chief
Mohammed Dahlan said if the Israelis want to find excuses to
blame the Palestinians, "they can always find them."
</P>
<P>
Dahlan said the PNA will fulfill its commitment concerning
security issues made in the Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement
signed last week.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials blamed the PNA for failing to prevent
such attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Jewish settler was shot dead by suspected
Palestinian militants in the divided West Bank city of
Hebron. Several hours later, a Palestinian man was found murdered
outside a Jewish settlement near Nablus in what might be a
revenge killing.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim to Find Sex-Determination Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists claimed
here Thursday that they have identified a new gene which appears
to be involved in sex determination.
</P>
<P>
The gene, named P. PHI 2, is present on X sex chromosome in
both sexes but is expressed only in males, said Lalji Singh,
director of the Center for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics
based in Hyderabad, 1,500 kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
Scientists abroad have so far identified four genes that have a
role in the complex pathway of determining whether an
undifferentiated embryo will ultimately develop into a male or
female.
</P>
<P>
These include SRY which is involved in the formation of testes
and ZFY which has been shown to be involved in sperm formation.
Two more, SOX 9 and SOX 3, have been classified under the SRY
group.
</P>
<P>
Singh told the on-going Seventh International Congress of
Reproductive Immunology here that the Indian scientists came
across their new gene while working on the genetic material of
snakes that was considered a unique material for studying the
evolution and function of sex chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
The new gene was subsequently isolated from mouse and human
genetic material too.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Southern Africa Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
into southern Africa has dropped to disappointing levels during
the year, although offshore investment has taken off, according
to a Johannesburg-based consultancy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community (SADC) in the first three quarters of the
year totale less than eight billion Rand (1.4 billion U.S.
Dollars), 42 percent down from 13.7 billion Rand (2.4 billion
Dollars) in the same period in 1997, BusinessMap said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure was more than matched by offshore investment by
financial institutions alone at nine billion Rand (1.58 billion
Dollars), BusinessMap said at the launch of a SADC investment
trends survey.
</P>
<P>
With growing offshore investment and foreign listings by South
African corporations, the drop in foreign direct investment was
disappointing, Thursday's Business Day newspaper quoted the
organization as saying.
 said the

It added that South African companies had begun channeling

Along with mining, financial institutions had emerged as major
offshore investors, both within Africa and in other parts of the

for Standard Bank, one of the biggest banks in South Africa, said
although the bank was successful in some of SADC countries, best

<HEADLINE> Iraq Lashes out at U.N. Chief Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi leading newspaper
Thursday lashed out at chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler, saying the U.N. should not keep silent "on his games
which have reached an absurd limit."
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra, organ of the ruling Arab Socialist Baath Party,
said in a front page article that "it has become crystal-clear
that the UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq) does
not want to end its work."
</P>
<P>
This article echoed the accusation made by a senior Iraqi
official to the effect that Butler is attempting to distort facts
concerning the results of French and Swiss laboratories which had
found no traces of nerve gas VX on Iraqi warheads fragments.
</P>
<P>
Amir Saadi, adviser at the presidency office, told reporters
on Wednesday evening that the results of American, French and
Swiss labs, contrary to Butler's statement, have undoubtly shown
the non-existence of the degradation VX agent on Iraqi warhead
fragments.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM on Monday submitted a report to the Security Council
saying that French tests found a "degradation product" of a nerve
agent in one sample out of 40 of the Iraqi warhead fragments,
which could be VX, or other nerve agents called Sarin and Soman.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. army laboratory announced in June that it found traces
of VX agent on samples of Iraqi warheads fragments it
analyzed. Iraq accused the United States of faking the results
and insisted that French and Swiss laboratories re-test them.
</P>
<P>
In July, 80 Samples from different areas of a warhead dump
in Iraq were then given to Swiss and French government
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper pointed out that the purpose behind transferring
the samples to neutral labs was to settle the difference between
the Iraqi statement that Iraq had not weaponized VX agent on its
missiles and UNSCOM allegations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq did admit in the past that it had experimented with VX
agent, but said it never succeeded in weaponizing it.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the UNSCOM and Butler of serving
U.S. interests and trying to create pretext to prolong the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed crippling sanctions on Iraq in
August 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions can
not be lifted unless UNSCOM verifies that Iraq is free from
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> More Typhoons to Hit Philippines This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Four to six tropical cyclones
are expected to hit the Philippines within the next two months, a
weather expert said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the weekly Roundtable Forum here, Leoncio Amadore,
director of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and
Astronomical Services Administration, said that weathermen are
closely watching, using satellite photos, any typhoon approaching
the country.
</P>
<P>
Two powerful typhoons, Babs and Zeb, blazed into the country
earlier this month, killing close to 200 people and destroying
crops and property worth billions of pesos.
</P>
<P>
Amadore expressed the hope that the four to six typhoons that
are expected to hit the country during the rest of the year would
not be as destructive as Babs and Zeb.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has an average of 27 typhoons a year.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said this week that the Philippine economy
could enter into recession if more typhoons hit the country this
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican announced
Thursday that President Joseph Estrada will donate his one-year
salary of 600,000 pesos (15,000 U.S. dollars) to victims of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Opposes Forced Abortion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
resolutely opposes forced abortion and the sterilization of women
for the purpose of population control, reiterated an official with
the State Family Planning Committee (SFPC) today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Sino-European Seminar on Women's Issues, Cong
Jun, director of the Department of International Relations under
the SFPC said that the Chinese government has issued regulations
to prevent the occurrence of forced measures of birth control.
</P>
<P>
She said that China advocates the principles of "late marriage,
later births" and "healthier births and better child-rearing".
Urban residents are encouraged to accept the "one-child policy",
while more flexible family planning policies are implemented in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The local governments of provinces and regions where minority
nationalities live in compact communities are allowed to make
their own family planning policies according to the local
situation. In some areas, people of minority ethnic groups can
have three or more children.
</P>
<P>
The SFPC has issued circulars throughout the country to
prohibit its branch organizations at all levels from forcing women
to undergo induced abortions or sterilization, Cong said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the state committee and provincial departments of
family planning have opened special offices to answer people's
appeals concerning forced birth control, and help relevant
departments investigate and punish people who are responsible
for such cases.

The SFPC presents training classes each year to improve family
planning cadres' awareness of law and state policies as well as to
upgrade the technical skills of medical workers to guarantee safer
birth control services, Cong said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid unwanted pregnancy and reduce induced abortion, the
committee has been promoting information on reproductive health
among women, especially rural women, and providing them with free
contraceptive devices.
</P>
<P>
"We are also trying to involve men in the birth control
efforts," Cong pointed out, adding that better and safer methods
of male sterilization have been used in Sichuan, Shanxi and other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some cases of forced birth control in the huge
grass-roots family planning network, but we will try our best to
prevent more from happening," she said, "and we will keep a close
eye on the protection of women's rights in this issue."
</P>
<P>
The number of one-child families is now one-fourth of all
families in China as a result of two decades of the implementation
of family planning, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
About 83.8 percent of Chinese married women of childbearing age
utilize contraceptive measures, but one-fourth of them still have

YANGON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Alvaro de Soto, visiting special
 envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations (U.N.), met
here Thursday afternoon with Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary
of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) on his
third day visit to Myanmar, according to an official Information
Sheet issued on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy also met some central executive members of
the NLD, it said, however, no details about the meetings were
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro, Assistant U.N. Secretary-General, arrived in Yangon on
Tuesday on his second four-day trip to Myanmar this year to look
into the current political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Alvaro called on Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC), on Wednesday who briefed him on the current
political, social and economic situation in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro conveyed to Khin Nyunt the wishes and position of the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan regarding Myanmar and then
exchanged views with him, the Information Sheet said, describing
the meeting as "constructive and fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Alvaro met with Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw and Minister at the Office of the SPDC Chairman
Brigadier-General Abel.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro's visit came over a month after the NLD formed on
September 16 a 10-member Committee Representing the Parliament
Elected in the 1990 Multi-Party General Election and unilaterally
set up a People's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government ignored a deadline set by the NLD for the
convening of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In August, Kofi Annan proposed to Myanmar leader Senior-General
Than Shwe that a special emissary be sent then to Yangon for the
discussions, but was rejected by the latter, according to an
earlier official report.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has maintained since 1994 dialogue with
the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
In January, Alvaro visited Yangon for the first time in this
year and met with Than Shwe and Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 88 members of the NLD were allowed to return home
since September 14 after being "housed" for several weeks by the
authorities. Of them, 64 were permitted to go home during the
four-day visit of the U.N. special envoy in Yangon.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Producer Inflation Dips Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's producer
inflation came in lower than expected last month, dipping to 4.3
percent from 4.5 percent in August, latest statistics available
here Thursday showed.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by Statistics South Africa Wednesday
showed that the producer price index (PPI) rose 0.4 percent month
on month in September, largely due to the sharp rise in the
imported prices.
</P>
<P>
The imported PPI rose 1.6 percent month on month, mainly
reflecting higher prices of imported chemicals and chemical
products, computers and machinery, the Business Day news paper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local component of the PPI remained subdued, rising only
0.1 percent between August and September, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The welcome surprise on the inflation front fueled
expectations of another cut in prime overdraft and mortgage rates
within weeks. However, conditions on international markets
remain the main determining factor.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank, one of the leading banks in the country, said
that the relatively low peaks expected for consumer and producer
inflation meant the Reserve Bank, central bank of South Africa,
could allow the repo rate - at which the bank lends money to
commercial banks - to decline.
</P>
<P>
The bank expected producer inflation to be 4.6 percent by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that producer inflation should remain in
single digits and is expected to record a monthly average of less
than four percent.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Selling First Batch of Low-Cost Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Beijing today put on the market the first batch of low-cost
housing aimed at a large number of low- and medium-income families
as well as some Beijing-based factories and institutions.
</P>
<P>
With a total construction area of five million square meters,
the housing sells at a ceiling price of 4,500 yuan (540
U.S. dollars) per square meter. The average price is around
2,000-4,000 yuan per square meter, about 600 yuan less than the
market price.
</P>
<P>
Most of the low-price housing that went on the market today is
located near the outlying Fourth Ring Road in the city and is
serviced by convenient transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce housing prices, the municipal government
offered a 50 percent reduction in 21 administrative charges, and
profit on this housing is limited to within three percent,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of low-cost housing is built for permanent
Beijing residents with low and medium incomes, especially civil
servants, teachers, scientific research personnel and the staff of
state-owned enterprises and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yansheng, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal
Construction Commission, said Beijing will start housing
construction of 2.3 million square meters this year, and some 1.6
million square meters of housing is expected to be completed next
year.

"I think ASEAN as a grouping is still intact. The problems

told a news conference in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's capital,
after a meeting with Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the Malaysian

</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the remarks when asked if his visit to Brunei has

of a member state.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has some problems with certain ASEAN member countries
whose leaders have commented against the way the Malaysian
authorities dealt with the sacked deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim, which Malaysia said was its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the ASEAN solidarity is still intact. "Basically,
it is still there," said Mahathir, who arrived in Bandar Seri
Begawan earlier Thursday for a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether there was some kind of foreign
elements trying to shake the spirit of solidarity and cooperation
among ASEAN countries, Mahathir said he did not know if there was
any such plan.
</P>
<P>
"But certainly the way they are going about indicated that they
would like to see ASEAN break-up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia and a number of other ASEAN countries do
not agree that one member state should comment on the internal
affairs of another member state.
</P>
<P>
"I think if we start doing that, then that will be very bad for
you because we all have got a lot of things to criticize about
each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what approach ASEAN members should adopt to ensure that
they do not interfere in the internal affairs of member states,
Mahathir said that up to now ASEAN members have never agreed to
interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On how he foresees ASEAN unity in the informal meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders in Kuala Lumpur
next month, Mahathir said the unity is still there.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN countries would reach consensus in dealing with
certain issues such as the financial crisis at the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that during his discussions with Hassanal
Bolkiah, they had among others touched on the situation in
Cambodia and they hoped that Cambodia would form a government soon
for the country to be admitted into ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the matter would be discussed at the ASEAN summit
in Hanoi, Vietnam, in December this year.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Caspian Countries Sign Oil Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and four Caspian
countries signed Ankara Declaration on the transportation of
Caspian and Central Asian petroleum to the Western markets
through Eastern-Western corridor.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was made vis-a-vis plans by world oil companies
to use the Bosporus strait as oil routes. Turkey argued that the
narrow Bosporus routes have led to hundreds of accidents.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara Declaration was signed in Parliament here on the
occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey by
presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan
and U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson as observer.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said at the signing ceremony
that the signature of the declaration was declared to the whole
world in a determination to materialize the 1,730-kilometer
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline as the main pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president pointed out that the declaration was a
historical one, claiming a triumph for Turkey, which got all the
countries involved in the project -- apart from Russia -- to
declare their support for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ankara Declaration clarifies their mutual
resolution and will to transport energy resources to the world
market by more than one pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The energy resources were very important for the strengthening
of independence of the countries in the Caspian Basin,
strengthening of their efforts for economic development and for
increasing welfare level of its people, added Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that "this great
declaration forms the political framework of the economic
development which closely interests our country for the future."
</P>
<P>
"The concerned countries made a moral commitment here. The
country who fails to abide by this commitment will be under a
serious responsibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been lobbying energy companies to choose the
Caspian route. The companies are expected to announce their
decision on November 12.

<HEADLINE> 24 Detainees at UN Rwanda Court End Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- All but one of the 25
detainees at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda (ICTR) have concluded their three-day hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
The detainees Wednesday ate their dinner at the United Nations
Detention Facilities (UNDF) on the outskirts of Arusha, northern
Tanzania, an ICTR press release said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the hunger strike by a former Rwandan mayor,
Jean-Paul Akayesu who was sentenced to a life imprisonment by the
tribunal earlier this month for his role in Rwanda's 1994
massacre, has entered its seventh day.
</P>
<P>
The detainees also wrote a letter to the tribunal authorities
in which they affirmed their decision to terminate their hunger
strike and addressed various other issues of concern to them in
relation to the tribunal's judicial process.
</P>
<P>
Registrar of the ICTR Agwu Ukiwe Okali confirmed this
development.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the hunger strike has been called off,"
he said. "It is a victory for truth and common sense. As we have
maintained, our program on the assignment of defense counsel is
very fair and indeed generous."
</P>
<P>
Okali also expressed hope that Akayesu will call off his
protest as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that Akayesu drank a significant
quantity of milk Tuesday and remains under close medical
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five detainees went on hunger strike, protesting the
alleged denial of their human rights in the assignment of the
lawyers by the ICTR Registry.
</P>
<P>
However, the registrar fired back Tuesday by saying that the
assignment of counsel is his responsibility under the Tribunal's
rules.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 individuals are detained in the UNDF, awaiting
for their trial or appeal for their roles in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
So far, the ICTR has indicted a total of 35 suspects since its
establishment by the United Nations following the Rwanda massacre
in April 1994 soon after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu,
died when his plane was shot down over capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were
reportedly killed in the three-month slaughter.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Namibia Agree on DRC Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Namibia
have agreed to ensure that a ceasefire is signed and peace is
restored in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), local press
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a four-hour talks between
South African President Nelson Mandela and his Namibian
counterpart Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is crucial to the start of a democratic process
in that country to ensure that everyone is protected by the laws
of the land, whether Tutsis and Hutus, and everybody else,"
Nujoma told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the question about the withdrwal of Nambian
troops from the DRC, Nujoma said his government is in favor of
the withdrawal, but only the request of DRC President Laurent
Kabila, and once a ceasefire is in full swing and peace
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said the allied governments, which support the DRC
government, will pursue a policy of peace to ensure that all
other govenrment in volved followed them in signing a ceasefire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The allied governments consist of Angola, Chad, Zimbabwe and
Namibai who all have troops in the DRC backed by tanks and
planes.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters that both South Africa and Namibia were
committed to the resolutions on the DRC adopted at Victoria Falls
in Zimbabwe and at the Pretoria summit a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
These included an immediate ceasefire, a standstill by troops,
and withdrawal of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
Mandela lambasted the prolonged DRC war, saying it is a waste
of scarce resources and is negatively affecting infrastructure
in the DRC and costing the lives of woman and children.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that everybody will withdraw and we get peace going,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's visit to Nujoma is part of his renewed efforts for
peace and is aimed at convincing Nujoma to withdraw his troops.
</P>
<P>
He had also spoken to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and
Angolan Persident Jose Educardo dos Santos, before travelling to
Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had earlier held talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan minitary strongman Vice-President Paul
Kagame. Uganda and Rwanda have been alleged to be supporting DRC
rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
He was scheduled to meet the leader of the rebel Congolese
Democratic Coalition, Wamba dia Wamba Thursday, South African
presidential office said.

<HEADLINE> China Will Further Open Its Market to Enter WTO: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- It is wrong for the United
States to criticize China for not taking measures to reduce its
trade surplus with the U.S., Chinese foreign ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang said here today at his regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the most effective means for increasing exports
during the global economic crisis is to devaluate currency.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China has decided not to increase exports
through currency devaluation, which actually has a positive
influence on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries use different methods for calculating transit
trade, thereby resulting in differing sums for the trade deficit
between them, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It will require measures from both sides to reduce the trade
deficit, he said, adding that the U.S. should ease its restriction
on high-tech exports to China.
</P>
<P>
The fact that U.S. investors have earned rich returns in China
demonstrates that the trade deficit is not the only indicator to
look at bilateral trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is opening its market step by step in order to create
conditions for entering the World Trade Organization (WTO),
because China needs to develop its economy in an open environment,
he said, stressing that the country is willing to reach a package
of market-access agreements with the United States and other WTO
members.

BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Medicines donated by two
multinational pharmaceutical firms today will be allocated to
China's flood-stricken areas, according to the Ministry of Health
and the China Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
Novartis Corporation, with its headquarters in Switzerland,
pledged a donation of antibiotics worth six million yuan (about
750,000 U.S. dollars) and an additional six million yuan in cash
for disease control and the training of Chinese health
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceuticals and health products weighing about 16 tons will
be flown free of charge to China by SwissAir, Novartis President
Dan Vasella told today's presentation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Novartis has also made a donation to China's Ministry of Civil
Affairs consisting of agrochemicals, public health products and
vegetable seeds worth six million yuan.
</P>
<P>
India-based Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. has donated 2.5 million
yuan worth of medicines to the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
Novartis has invested 136 million U.S. dollars to launch six
joint ventures in China in the areas of health care, agrobusiness
and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Ranbaxy Guangzhou Ltd, a joint venture established by Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd., entered China in 1993 to sell antibiotics

<P>
NANJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of an
international seminar on Asia-Europe economic relations in the
21st century and the second Eurasian continental bridge was held
today in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign experts discussed ways of making use of the
second Eurasian continental bridge for promoting economic
exchanges between Asia and Europe and accelerating the economic
growth of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
They considered topics related to methods of forging a new
economic and trade partnership between Asia and Europe in the next
century and furthering cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xingde, executive vice-governor of Jiangsu Province, said
the Jiangsu provincial government has in recent years spared no
effort in transportation and other infrastructure construction in
the eastern part of the province, the starting point of the Eurasian
continental bridge.
</P>
<P>
This has played a positive role in boosting Asia-Europe
economic exchanges, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The second Eurasian continental bridge runs from the city of
Lianyungang in east China to Rotterdam in Holland. Germany and
Holland along the continental bridge have now become the sixth and
eighth largest trading partners of Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Execute Verdicts with Help of Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Gelin Clothes Ltd. in Guangdong
has amassed 2.5 million yuan and paid off its entire debt plus
interest three days after its illegal debt repudiation was
publicized by the court last month in local newspapers, on TV and
over the radio.
</P>
<P>
But the garment company had formerly refused to pay its debts
despite a court order to do so. In fact, the company felt it had
its reason not to pay, and was not alone in repudiating debts.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court,
admitted today that Chinese courts are facing "a severe situation"
in having its verdicts carried out, especially those related to
property and other economic disputes.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, only 75 percent of all court orders that should have
been compulsorily carried out by courts at the request of
creditors were actually executed. In 1997, this number dropped to
68 percent.
</P>
<P>
The case of the Guangdong garment company is part of an ongoing
nationwide effort by the law courts to reinforce the back-logged,
sometimes years old, unobeyed court orders.
</P>
<P>
The four-month clean-up drive which began on September 1
cleared a total of 250,000 old cases involving 24.14 billion yuan
in the first month, the vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
"Initial results have been achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to legal experts, the widespread irregularities in
obeying the court verdicts is the result of poor performances by
many companies, lax legal awareness on the part of the public, and
regional protectionism.
</P>
<P>
"Regional protectionism is one of the key reasons court orders
are disobeyed," a legal professor said.
</P>
<P>
And for this reason, Chinese courts have been campaigning to
win support from local governments, especially the Party Committees
in localities.
</P>
<P>
Besides seeking help from the media, courts also resort to
their own legal means to deal with dishonest debtors such as
tracking their properties, encouraging public reports against
them, and searching, detaining or fining them according to law, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, Chinese courts forced the execution of
4.69 million debt-related court orders in three years since 1995,
at the request of one of the parties concerned. These cases
involved more than 208.17 billion yuan, or 1.04 percent of the GDP
value of the country.

<HEADLINE> Six Envoys Visit Refugee Camps in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Six foreign ambassadors
to Tanzania paid a visit to the western Region of Kigoma to see
the situation of refugees there, United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We want the donors themselves to see the problems of the
affected areas and the development of the refugee situation,"
Tonga Magaret George, a UNHCR external relations assistant, told
Xinhua by telephone in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
She added the trip will enable the envoys to decide what kind
of assistance they can extend to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of the United States, Japan, Denmark, Britain,
Germany and France, as well as U.N. representatives and Tanzanian
government officials have joined the trip, jointly organized by
UNHCR and the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to visit refugee camps Thursday before
going back to Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kigoma said that they have held talks with the
Regional Commissioner Ukiwaona Ditopile Mzuzuri, who appealed for
assistance in buying boats to arrest armed banditry in Lake
Tanganyika and improving local transport infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR normally organized two trips annually for the ambassadors
and the first one this year was arranged in March, George said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania presently hosts more than 300,000 refugees, mostly
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi, Rwanda and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete urged the
international community to help his country solve the problem of
refugees, who caused economic burden on the east African country
and worsened its social security and environmental situation.

<HEADLINE> 13,000 DRC Refugees Flee into Tanzania: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Refugees fleeing the
war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) into neighboring
Tanzania have surpassed 13,000, United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By October 27, DRC refugees in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region
on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika had reached 13,398, Tonga
Margaret George, a UNHCR external relations assistant, said in a
telephone interview with Xinhua in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in the DRC took arms against President Laurent Kabila
on August 2 and have seized a large swath of land in the east of
the country, where refugees have attempted to cross the lake by
boat into Tanzania to escape the war.
</P>
<P>
At present, the refugees are accommodated at the Nyarugusu
camp some 160 kilometers northwest of the Kigoma Town.
</P>
<P>
The eruption of war has also forced the UNHCR to suspend the
exercise of repatriating refugees who fled the country during the
time when Kabila was fighting against late dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
By July 30 this year, refugees from the vast central African
country who remained in Tanzania stood at 74,857, although a lot
have been repatriated.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the assistant said 3,383 Burundian
refugees have arrived in the Kigoma Region since August 1. Before
that, there were 160,571 Burundian refugees in Kigoma and 112,379
in the Kagera Region in northwest Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania currently hosts more than 300,000 refugees, mostly
from the DRC, Burundi, Rwanda and Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Produce 10 Tons of Gold in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is expected to
produce over 10 tons of gold this year, two years ahead to fulfill
the government's exploitation target, a news report said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under a government plan, gold production is scheduled to reach
10 tons in the year 2000, a senior official of the Agriculture,
Livestock Breeding and Industry Ministry was quoted by the
newspaper Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, in light of the current exploiting speed, the
production will be more than 10 tons this year, 17 tons in 2000
and 20 tons in 2001, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the reserves of the discovered gold mines in
Mongolia would be over 1,300 tons. The country produced 8.9 tons
of gold last year, or 48 percent more than that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government has also planned to be among the 20 top gold
producers in the world in the 21st century, said the report.

SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 construction workers
were killed and three others seriously wounded by a fire in a
building under construction in Pusan, South Korea, Thursday
morning, according to police authorities.

</P>
<P>
It took fire fighters more than four hours to put out the blaze
amid poisonous gas and heat.

The 18 victims, found on the staircases between the fifth and
seventh floors, were believed to have died of smoke inhalation.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Bombing Attack Puts Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The recent Israel-
Palestinian peace deal was put under further test Thursday
morning after a car bombing attack killed three in Gaza,
three days after a Jewish settler and a Palestinian were murdered
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when Israel and the Palestinians were
bickering over a timetable on a Palestinian security plan, which
Israel said should be submitted to Washington within a week after
the signing of the interim deal last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has postponed indefinitely a
cabinet decision on the agreement over the issue. But U.S. and
Palestinian officials said they never heard of such a timetable.
</P>
<P>
The series of terror attacks will also add pressure on
Netanyahu, who has been under heavy fire from hardliners in his
government and Jewish settlers. He was accused of making too much
concession to the Palestinians by agreeing to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to them.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and three others injured in the
latest attack, which occurred about 7:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) in an
intersection of the Jewish settlement of Gush Katif, a major
settlement block in southwestern Gaza where about 5,000 settlers
live.
</P>
<P>
A car loaded with explosives apparently trying to run into a
bus carrying about 40 children from the settlement blew up after
being intercepted by an army jeep, which escorted the bus.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller to Israel Radio claimed responsibility for
the suicide attack on behalf of Hamas, saying the aim was to
expel all Jewish settlers out of Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops closed the Gaza Strip after the incident,
barring hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from entering
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Jewish settler was shot dead by suspected
Palestinian militants in the West Bank city of Hebron. Several
hours later, a Palestinian man was found murdered outside a
Jewish settlement near Nablus in what might be a revenge killing.
</P>
<P>
Concerns have been raised that extremists on both sides might
attempt to derail the peace process again by carrying out such
terror attacks. Atmosphere in Gaza and the West Bank was
described as tense in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Some are also worried that the attacks would force Netanyahu
to give in to right-wingers by delaying the implementation of the
land-for-peace deal, which was due to begin next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal signed by Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat last Friday at the White House, Israel will hand
over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
exchange for specific Palestinian measures on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has repeated his position in the last few days that
Israel will not give lands to the Palestinians until the
Palestinians fulfill their commitments on security.
</P>
<P>
Some people, including Labor Party leader Ehud Barak,
expressed their worries that Netanyahu's insistence on specific
Palestinian measures might plant landmines on the road of
implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
They said it will be much easier for Israel to find faults
with the Palestinians when the plan was too concrete.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli and Palestinian officials have begun a war of
words soon after Thursday's terror attack.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said on TV that
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) must wage an all-out war
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Security cooperation on particular incidents is not
enough. What we need here is an all-out war against
terrorism...otherwise, there will be no peace, no stability and
no prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security chief Mohammed Dahlan reiterated that the
PNA will live up to its commitments made in the interim agreement,
saying it will carry out its obligations on security.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Bar-Illan's remarks, Dahlan said if the Israelis
want to find excuses to delay the implementation of the
agreement, "they can always find them."

<HEADLINE> EC President Stresses Full-Fledged Partnership With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Commission Jacques Santer said here today that it is the
aspiration of the EU to develop a full-fledged partnership with
China.
</P>
<P>
The president made these remarks in a speech on China-EU
relations at the State Administrative College, after its arrival
in Beijing Thursday morning for a six-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Santer is the first EC president to visit China in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The EU regards those nations that will help shape a balanced
world mechanism as top priority in its foreign relations, said the
president. China, with a civilization dating back thousands of
years, is one such nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, China's determined reform, great
efforts to enter the world trade system, vigorous economic growth,
and achievements in the construction of a legal system have all
drawn great attention from Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he added, China has made a most responsible
choice in the face of negative effects from the Asian financial
crisis. Its "cool and reasonable choice" to keep its currency
steady is "the only choice beneficial to China."
</P>
<P>
"That choice has made China an important stabilizing force in
the world system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the president called for further dialog between the
EU and China to foster closer bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"There are many topics we can discuss," he said. "We can
exchange ideas on science, technology, trade, economy,
environmental protection, health work and culture."
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that he and his deputy Leon Brittan
have jointly proposed an exchange program between middle school
students in China and the EU. This program would make it possible
for thousands of Chinese students and young researchers to study
at European colleges and universities beginning in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> FUNCINPEC Seeks Free, Safety Before Coalition Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's opposition party
FUNCINPEC Thursday demanded the Phnom Penh authorities give a
written guarantee for their free and safety before they move
forward with the discussion of substantive issues for the next
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
It is a response to the ruling Cambodian People's Party's (CPP)
statement released Wednesday by its President Chea Sim, urging
FUNCINPEC to sit down at the negotiation table without delay.
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamental that the Phnom Penh authorities give a
written guarantee that all opposition MPs and party officials will
be free to undertake their legitimate political activities and
able to move in and out the country without any hindrance,"
FUNCINPEC's statement said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, FUNCINPEC insisted the written guarantee must
be endorsed by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition leaders, FUNCINPEC's Prince Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, head of the self-named third party elected to
parliament, have been outside the country since September 25. They
said they feel no safety at home.
</P>
<P>
But before the discussion makes progress in the allocation of
portfolios, the statement said, FUNCINPEC will introduce for
discussion a document which details some of the issues of
concerning FUNCINPEC and the people of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The issues they put forward include trust and confidence
building measures; Battle against corruption and government
transparency; Deforestation; Administrative reform; Judiciary
reforms; Establishment of a state of rule of Law and safety;
Security of opposition Parliamentarians and party officials.
</P>
<P>
"Any coalition government that has not reached agreement on
these substantive issues prior to its formation is bound to be
Unrepresentative of the Cambodian people's will and, thus, short
lived," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling CPP won the elections, but lacks the two-thirds
majority needed to form a new government alone. The two opposition
 parties have maintained that the CPP won through intimidation and
fraud. They demanded that CPP make concessions, including changing
seat-allocation formula and giving up the Assembly presidency,
which refused by the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TRC Report to Be Released as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) won its battle to release its report
as scheduled Thursday after a judge dismissed the ruling African
National Congress (ANC)'s application for an interdict against
publication of the report.
</P>
<P>
A short while ago, Cape High Court Judge, Wilfred Thring, ruled in
favor of the truth body and gave the green light for the handover of
the TRC preliminary report to President Nelson Mandela at noon
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The judge did not give his reasons for the judgement, saying it was
an urgent matter and he would give due explanation later.
</P>
<P>
The ANC made a last-minute effort Wednesday evening to halt the
release of the whole report by applying in court for an urgent
interdict. The ANC said it was not given sufficient time to respond to
the TRC's detrimental findings against the party.
</P>
<P>
TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu said earlier this morning that he was
"devastated" by the ANC's 11th-hour move. But he said if he detects an
abuse of power, he would "fight with every fibre" in him.
</P>
<P>
Tutu was due to present Mandela with the 3,000-page, five-volume
document at a midday ceremony in Pretoria. The report is the result
of a two-and-a-half-year investigation by the TRC.

dollars) nationwide, representing a rise of 41.8 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China expects to build 300 million square
meters of urban housing and 650 million sq m of rural housing by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, China has maintained rational
and stable real estate development growth pace and investment this
year.
</P>
<P>
As the real estate market picks up nationwide, housing
construction continues to expand and sales continue to grow. Most
significantly, top priority has been given to ordinary housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ye said, the improved macroeconomic environment has
created better conditions for real estate development this year.
</P>
<P>
Ye held the view that the deepening and popularization of
housing reform, which means selling houses to citizens instead of
allocating houses to them as material benefits, will play a decisive
role in developing real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
With changing spending habits, more and more people will
choose to buy housing for themselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate individual housing spending, the commercial banks
have launched mortgage-loan services for homebuyers. Meanwhile, a
housing fund-raising system targeted at helping buyers has been
instituted nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The official expects the real estate markets in big cities and
coastal and developed areas to have strong performances this year,
and sees these markets more active in the smaller cities as well.

JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian security officials said on Thursday that the
Palestinian working plan to fight terrorism is near completion
and will be presented soon to the Americans in accordance with
the timetable agreed in the peace deal. In response, Israeli
prime minister's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said that "as soon as
the plan is presented to the Americans, we will convene the
cabinet for ratification of the deal."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli security sources have denied that any major changes
had been made to the security arrangements around Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu because of concerns that right-wing extremists

a land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians last Friday.

Yediot Aharonot:

CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed firmer for the ninth consecutive day Thursday but off its
intra-day high.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries lost its momentum over the day,
closing 2.1 points up at 2617.3, after reaching an intra-day high

</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed that average
weekly ordinary time earnings increased by a seasonally adjusted
1.7 percent in the three months to August, while the market had
expected a 1.1 percent rise.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended a
little higher Thursday after stronger-than-expected wages data
appeared to take some of the gloss off persistent rate cut
speculation.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed in Sydney at 61.83 U.S. cents, from
61.70 U.S. cents previously, after trading in a tight range during
the session.
</P>
<P>
But the average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) figures
posted Thursday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics did not
erase the chances of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA), according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Australia's wages growth in the year to August remained in the
4.0 to 4.5 percent comfort zone that the RBA had indicated would
be consistent with its low inflation target.
</P>
<P>
And Wednesday those low inflation ambitions were underpinned by
official quarterly figures putting the inflation rate at 1.3
percent in the 12 months to September.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 72.20 Japanese yen, from 72.87
yen, and 1.0226 German marks, from 1.0194 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Thursday, ending a four-day stretch of decline, but the gains were
kept in check by fears over declining corporate earnings and
darkening forecasts for the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stcok Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged 152.65 points, or 1.13
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 13,668.72.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 8.49 points or 0.33 percent to
1,037.10.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section shrank to an estimated 295
million shares, its lowest level this month and less than half
last week's daily average.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Metal Ind. was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
"There's no big reason for the market's gains. After a
four-day adjustment in prices, the market is tired of selling," a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index briefly jumped 210 points but failed to gain
further ground as the market was handcuffed by reminders that
chances of an immediate upturn in Japan's economy are poor.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) predicted Wednesday Japan's economy would contract 2.6
percent in 1998, a sharp drop from its earlier forecast of minus
0.3 percent growth made last April.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers narrowly
surpassed losers 556 to 507, with 193 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Limits Individual Forex Transactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia (BOZ),
central bank of the country, has directed with immediate effect
that forex transactions with an individual shall be limited
within 5,000 U.S. Dollars, or 10 million Kwacha, per day.
</P>
<P>
All transactions above 5,000 Dollars are supposed to be done
through commercial banks registered under the banking and
financial services act, BOZ head of public relations Kabinga
Pande said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted Pande as saying
that the transacting of large value purchases and sales of
foreign currency through bureaux de change has made them easy
targets of the armed robbers, thereby endangering the lives of
the public.
</P>
<P>
Bureaux de change operations are normally meant for very small
individual transactions for the convenience of individual
travelers or tourists and not corporations, said the central bank
official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the restriction is also meant to curb money
laundering through bureaux de change which has become a possible
avenue where illicit trades could pass without detection.
</P>
<P>
The decision to limit the amounts on individual transactions
in bureaux de change is consistent with the international
practices followed in banking circles world-wide, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Whereas commercial banks has certain ground rules concerning
knowing their customers, bureaux de change do not. And there
have been an increase in money laundering activities through the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, gunmen stormed a bureau de change in
capital Lusaka, robbing 200 million Kwacha (about 100,000
Dollars) and shooting dead the managing director of the bureau de
change in day light.
</P>
<P>
Before this incident, gangsters had raided another bureau de
change here, seizing 100 million Kwacha (some 50,000 Dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Opposed Anti-China Contents of US Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China expressed here today its
strong resentment and firm opposition to the anti-China contents
enshrined in two US acts passed recently by United States Congress.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made by Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang
in a regular press conference this afternoon, Tang said that these
contents serve to interfere in China's internal affairs, support
the Tibetan separatist elements, obstruct the normal cooperation
between China and the United States in economic, trade and other
fields, include Taiwan into the TMD system and continue to sell
arms to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
These contents were contained in the Omnibus Appropriation Act
and the 1999 Fiscal Year Department of Defense Authorization Act,
which were passed recently by the US Congress.
</P>
<P>
"By passing these acts, the US Congress has gravely violated
the basic norms of international relations and the principles
enshrined in the three Sino-US Joint Communiques, interfered in
China's internal affairs, seriously hurt the feelings of the
Chinese people, placed obstacles to the Chinese people's great
cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland and normal
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that to develop China-US relations is the shared wish
of both Chinese and American peoples and serves their long-term
interests.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that their development would be impossible if the
principles of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and
territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs are not observed.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs is
absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the US government will, proceeding from the overall
interests of the bilateral relations, strictly observe the
principles set forth in the three Joint Communiques between China
and the United States, explicitly oppose the anti-China contents
of the Acts adopted by the US Congress, do nothing to violate
China's sovereignty and interfere in its internal affairs in any
form, refrain from transferring TMD system and its related
technology and equipment to Taiwan in any manner, effectively cut
down and finally stop its arms sales to Taiwan, so as not to
hinder the improvement of Sino-American relations," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Car Bombing Attack In Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
three others injured in a car bombing attack alleged by Islamic
militant group Hamas near a Jewish settlement in Gaza, Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that a caller to the radio claimed
responsibility for the suicide attack on behalf of Hamas, saying
the aim was to expel all Jewish settlers out of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred about 7:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) in an
intersection of the settlement of Gush Katif in southwestern Gaza.
</P>
<P>
A car loaded with explosive apparently trying to run into a bus
carrying children from the settlement blew up after being
intercepted by an army jeep, which escorted the bus, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian attacker and one Israeli were among the
killed. The about 40 children riding in the bus were unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers joined by Palestinian police sealed off the
scene.
</P>
<P>
The Gush Katif is a major Jewish settlement bloc in Gaza where
about 5,000 Jewish settlers live.
</P>
<P>
The explosion has raised concern over the implementation of the
just-reached Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement which stipulates
Israeli troops redeployment from 13 percent of the West Bank
starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side's agreement to the withdrawal is on
Palestinians' pledge of tougher crackdown on extremists.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Xiaolangdi Multi-Purpose Dam Proceeds Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the World
Bank financed Xiaolangdi Project has been proceeding well
since it cut the water flow in the main stream of the Yellow
River, China's second longest river, on October 28 last year.
</P>
<P>
According to chief engineer Cao Zhengqi, the pace of
construction at the four sites is strictly following the schedule
established by the project contracts.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 17 billion yuan (2.05 billion US dollars),
half the total investment for the entire construction of the
Xiaolangdi Dam, has been spent on the project, the largest of its
kind ever built on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Workers have finished 82.5 million cubic meters of earth and
stone work, and poured 2.85 million cubic meters of concrete. The
prime dam, which will have a height of 281 meters when completed,
has risen to 261 meters at the southern bank of the river and 210
meters at the northern bank. The upstream cofferdam has risen to a
height of 185 meters.
</P>
<P>
It is certain that by next year's flood season, the flood
control capacity at Xiaolangdi will be five times greater than at
the present time, and that the first generator will be generating
electricity by late 1999, said Cao.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Dam Project is meant to control the Yellow River
at a place in the riverbed on the lower reaches where the water
has been rising at a rate of ten centimeters a year.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi is situated in a prime position for flood and
sediment control of the Yellow River. Upon completion in 2001, the
Xiaolangdi Dam and Reservoir Project will effectively mitigate
catastrophic floods, as well as control silting, ice jams,
irrigation, water supply and hydroelectric power generation.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, one billion U.S. dollars in loans
from the World Bank has been granted for the Xiaolangdi water
control project, and all loans will be paid off 17 years after
the Xiaolangdi reservoir becomes operational.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Car Bombing Attack In Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
three others injured in a car bombing attack near a Jewish
settlement in Gaza, Thursday morning, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred about 7:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) in an
intersection of the settlement of Gush Katif in southwestern Gaza.
</P>
<P>
A car loaded with explosive apparently trying to run into a bus
carrying children from the settlement blew up after being
intercepted by an army jeep, which escorted the bus, the radio
said.
</P>
<P>
At least one Israeli was among the killed. But the radio said
the identity of the other two were not known yet, adding one of
them might be the attacker.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers joined by Palestinian police sealed off the
scene.
</P>
<P>
The Gush Katif is a major Jewish settlement bloc in Gaza where
about 5,000 Jewish settlers live.
</P>
<P>
The explosion has raised concern over the implementation of the
just-reached Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement which stipulates
Israeli troops redeployment from 13 percent of the West Bank
starting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side's agreement to the withdrawal is on
Palestinians' pledge of tougher crackdown on extremists.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior aid David
Bar-Illan said on TV that the Israeli side is closely watching the
Palestinian authority's reaction to the incident.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Children Spend 168 Million U.S. Dollars Monthly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Children under the age of 12 in
this Chinese capital spend some 1.4 billion yuan (168 million
U.S. dollars) monthly, topping all other Chinese cities, according
to a survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Chengdu, Guangzhou and Xi'an by an information department under
the State Statistics Bureau, shows that the monthly spending by
children under the age of 12 in China now exceeds 3.5 billion yuan
(421 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried in today's Beijing Morning Post, says that
each family in the five cities spends an average of 672 yuan (80.9
U.S. dollars) on their children every month, while each family in
Beijing spends at least 764 yuan (90.04 U.S. dollars) on just one
child each month.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai follows Beijing, with each family spending 736 yuan
(88.67 U.S. dollars) on children a month.
</P>
<P>
The survey adds that 60 percent of this money is used to buying
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
A survey of four Beijing primary schools reveals that more than
50 percent of the respondents have at least name brand suit of
clothes, and 10 percent have more than four such suits.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that Beijing's children are more
interested in imported clothes and food, spending 500 million
yuan (60.2 million U.S. dollars) each month on these items, first
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In big cities like Beijing, one child usually spends some 50
percent of his or her family's total income, the survey shows.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Dips 1.5 Pct Growth in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
Thursday announced that Singapore's economy shrank 1.5 percent in
the third quarter of 1998 compared with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
And the decline based on a preliminary data was the first
quarterly contraction since the country's last recession in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Ordinary Delegates' Conference of the National
Trades Union Congress (NTUC), the prime minister attributed the
economic slump to fall in the regional demand for Singapore's
goods and services and the coupling sharp decline in prices as
well as a global downturn in the industry of electronics which
account for 77 percent of the country's domestic exports of
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Singapore's economic growth will remain weak
for a couple of years and called upon the nation "to prepare for a
second typhoon," as the Asian financial typhoon that started last
year and swept through the region has left behind a trail of
destruction far greater than any one had imagined.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to restore his country's competitiveness
urgently and to give top priority to helping companies survive the
harsh market conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will take a three-pronged approaches,
namely to try to increase demand for Singapore's goods and
services, to enhance national capabilities and upgrade individual
skills.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out cost-cutting through depreciation of the Singapore
dollar, he said the way out lies in substantial reduction of labor
costs that are the largest component of business costs.
</P>
<P>
He listed the wage restraint for annual increments, a
flexi-wage system to trim variable component of wages, and an 8-10
percent cut in employers' contribution to the Central Provident
Fund (CPF) as combined ways to substantially reduce labor costs.
</P>
<P>
CPF is a comprehensive social security savings scheme that
takes care of members' retirement, healthcare, home-ownership and
family protection needs, and enhances their assets. Both the
employer and employee contribute to the employee's CPF account.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also promised that the public sector will
take the lead in the implementation of these measures and
households are ensured to continue to receive help to service
their housing loans.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Handheld Device Sales to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide smart
handheld devices market will be up 45 percent in 1999 with unit
shipments reaching 10.7 million, said a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
said in the report that the growing abundance of products and
anticipation of new smart phone devices offer a major challenge
for vendors.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1998, 3Com, U.S. maker of the popular
PalmPilot device, retained its worldwide lead of the handheld
companion market with a 41.4 percent market share. Palm-sized
personal computers did not decrease the company's market share in
the first half of the year, the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
The smart phone market continues to perform under expectations
due to high device costs, continuing product delays and wireless
infrastructure issues affecting the United States.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the IDC also analyzed the market for
handheld computers or palmtops which are small enough to hold in
one hand and operate with the other.
</P>
<P>
They may have specialized keyboards or keypads for data entry
applications or have small qwerty keyboards.
</P>
<P>
These products, which are designed to be desktop companions, do
not serve well as desktop or notebook replacements, but rather
fill a need among desktop users wishing to gain mobility without
the added cost of a notebook, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"They will eventually offer corporate information technology a
lower cost of ownership, and will become the secondary device of
choice for many desktop users," the IDC said.
</P>
<P>
However, the IDC said that in order for these products to be
successful, vendors must pass several hurdles including educating
the market and managing user expectations.
</P>
<P>
Vendors also need to provide PC-style service and support
programs, and align device price points so that they do not
collide with low-cost notebooks. It will take several generations
of the devices to be released before these issues become
alleviated, the IDC added.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Tightens Security Before Verdict on Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
tightened security measures around the capital city and
particularly in the Dhaka central jail ahead of the scheduled
announcement on November 8 of the verdict of the killing case of
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Rahman, sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five out of the 19 persons accused in the murder case of Mujib
Rahman, the first prime minister of independent Bangladesh and
father of incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, have faced trial
and have been imprisoned in the central jail.
</P>
<P>
Mujib Rahman, along with most of his family members, was killed
on August 15, 1975 in a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hasina accused the main opposition the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party and its allies of attempting to "unseat" the
government before November 8, said the sources, hinting that the
government would pursue a tough policy from November 3, the day in
1975 on which a counter coup was staged but failed, to foil any
opposition "attempts."
</P>
<P>
And the opposition has threatened non-stop agitation movement
after the ongoing nine-nation Wills International Cup Cricket
tournament starting last Saturday ends on November 2, to press for
mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of secretaries of different ministries Tuesday,
Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman apprised them of the present
situation in the country centering on the delivery of the verdict
of the murder case, and the stand of the government.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that there might be some shift in the country's
foreign policy after the delivery of the verdict, which would
follow the behavior of those foreign governments related to the
matter, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen people were accused in the murder case of Mujib
Rahman, and the trial began with the submission of charge sheet on
January 5, 1997, half a year after the Awami League, led by
Hasina, came to power following its victory in the country's 1996
general elections.
</P>
<P>
All the 19 accused, except one, were former army personnel, and
14 of them have remained fugitives abroad. They were charged with
murder, conspiracy and concealing evidences under the country's
Penal Code. The maximum punishment for these charges is death.
</P>
<P>
Of the absconding accused, one is now in a jail in Bangkok,
Thailand, for shoplifting, while a few others are reportedly to
have taken shelter in Canada, the United States, Germany and other
countries, the sources said.

</P>
<P>
An advisory committee headed by the commerce and industries

the country, had earned 160 billion taka (3.3 billion U.S.
dollars) in terms of foreign exchange from 1972-1997, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
At present, this South Asian country produces about 150 million

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Long Way to Go on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Tuesday decision to
indefinitely postpone air strikes against Yugoslavia has minimized
the possibility of war for the time being, but the Kosovo crisis
is far from being over, analysts here have pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the decision, the organization had twice extended its
deadline for military attack after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke reached an
agreement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO's shelving of its military action was attributed, among
other things, to Yugoslavia's sincerity in carrying out the
agreement and the related UN Security Council resolutions on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Even NATO Secretary General Javier Solana acknowledged that the
Yugoslav government had made big strides in restoring normal life
in Kosovo by pulling out more than 4,000 troops from the region
and facilitating the return of more than 50,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, the root cause of the turbulences in Kosovo still
exists. The Kosovo crisis erupted after the independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo clashed, even militarily, with the
Yugoslav and Serbian governments which are determined to preserve
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Looking for nothing other than independence, leaders of ethnic
Albanians spurned and boycotted government-sponsored talks on
Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
Upset by the prospect of the Kosovo crisis spilling over to
other Balkan countries and distablizing even a larger part of
Europe, the United States and other western powers have
volunteered as an active meditator and tried to settle the crisis
under the principle of granting ethnic Albanians greater autonomy,
but no independence.
</P>
<P>
The latest so conceived plan was proposed by U.S. special envoy
Christopher Hill.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, the still veiled Hill
proposal would maintain Kosovo as part of the Serbian republic,
but grant it wide-ranging authority over civilian matters.
</P>
<P>
The proposal sounds acceptable to the Yugoslav government,
though not without reservation, but was flatly rejected by the
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Hill is currently shuttling between Belgrade and the provincial
capital of Pristina in an attempt to narrow their differences and
launch a formal negotiation early next month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here fear that if negotiations fail to yield any
results soon, the relatively calm situation in Kosovo might
deteriorate again.
</P>
<P>
First, the large swath of land left by the evacuated Yugoslav
troops would be quite tempting to KLA, the armed groups of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, whose retaking of villages and towns would
certainly trigger fresh clashes with Serbian and Federal Yugoslav
governments.
</P>
<P>
There were already incidents of Serbian police being shot at
and killed in Kosovo, which were most likely done by KLA members.
</P>
<P>
Second, as thousands of foreign observers gather in Kosovo to
monitor the situation, they are likely to become targets for
nationalist extremists who might not balk at making such grave
incidents as kidnaping or assaulting OSCE observers.
</P>
<P>
Finally, NATO has not lifted its threat of punitive military
actions. This itself represents a potential source of future
crisis.
</P>
<P>
As Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic pointed out,
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia could only "help those who
are against a peaceful solution" to the Kosovo issue. The military
threat, if carried out, could only bring about a disaster for the
whole people of Yugoslavia, distablize the Balkan region and
inflict a lasting damage upon the world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Visits Brunei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad arrived in Bandar Seri Begawan Thursday for a
two-day working visit to neighboring Brunei to discuss with his
Brunei counterpart Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah bilateral issues,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's trip to Brunei marks the inaugural consultation
arrangement between Mahathir and Sultan Hassanal who agreed in
Kuala Lumpur last year to meet annually to exchange ideas and
discuss regional and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mahathir and Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah are
expected to hold discussions focusing on joint efforts by Malaysia
and Brunei in dealing with the region's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
This is Mahathir's second working visit to Brunei this year. He
went to Brunei on February 18 for an overnight stay for talks with
Sultan Hassanal on the economic crisis affecting the region.
</P>
<P>
The Brunei Sultan also made an overnight working visit to
Malaysia last February 28 when they discussed, among others, the
use of a common currency for intra-ASEAN trade as part of efforts
to overcome the regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both Malaysia and Brunei are members of ASEAN which also groups
Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Malaysia and Brunei for the first eight
months of this year amounted to 595.7 million ringgit (156.763
million U.S. dollars) with the trade balance in favor of Malaysia,
compared to 830.8 million ringgit (218.631 million U.S. dollars)
for the whole of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's main export items to Brunei in 1997 included cork
and wood products, textile yarn and fabrics, iron and steel, and
petroleum and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Its major import items from Brunei in 1997 were petroleum and
petroleum products, non-metallic mineral items, machinery for
specialized industries, metalliferous ores, and paper and paper
board.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Questions Supreme Court's Jones' Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for U.S. President
Bill Clinton have questioned the Supreme Court's decision to allow
the Paula Jones case to proceed, saying "the time is ripe" to
reconsider the matter of presidents and civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
In a court proceeding on Tuesday before U.S. District Judge
William Bryant, Clinton's lawyer David Kendall asked that a
defamation case brought against the president by a former Arkansas
woman, Dolly Kyle Browning, be postponed until the president
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
In allowing Jones' sexual harassment suit against Clinton to
proceed, the Supreme Court said the case is not likely to occupy
any substantial amount of the president's time.
</P>
<P>
It was a deposition in the Jones case that lead to Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Subsequent experience has proven the court's confidence is
unfounded, and we respectfully suggest the time is ripe for a
reconsideration of the court's decision," said Kendall's court
filing.
</P>
<P>
Kendall referred to a ruling in another case that allows a
court precedent to be set aside when the facts in a case have
changed.
</P>
<P>
"It is now apparent that the Supreme Court drastically
underestimated the burden that civil litigation can place on a
president and on the smooth operation of the executive branch,"
Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
"The civil discovery process can unleash events occupying
substantial amounts of executive branch time and energy," Kendall
added.
</P>
<P>
Browning filed suit alleging that she is entitled to civil
damages because Clinton defamed her by denying that the two had a
sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
She has been trying unsuccessfully to sell a manuscript telling
of the relationship in what she says is semi-fictional form. She
claims that Clinton and others managed to persuade publishers to
stay away from the book.
</P>
<P>
Browning's lawyer is Larry Klayman of the conservative group
Judicial Watch, which has filed lawsuits against the Clinton
administration on issues such as commerce department trade
missions and the FBI files controversy.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists Discover World's Oldest Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A team of Australian
scientists announced Thursday they have discovered the world's
oldest oil in rocks which they said are 3 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, which doubled the age at which rocks were
thought to contain oil, previously put at 1.7 billion years, is
also good news for oil companies, opening the way for oil
exploration in much older rocks than previously thought possible.
</P>
<P>
"From an exploration point of view, it has expanded the areas
that companies can go looking for oil in," said Adriana Dutkiewicz
of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific, Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO).
</P>
<P>
"They were only looking at rocks 400 million years or younger
so far and that's a fairly small part of the geological history of
the earth," she added. "What they can do now is look at older
rocks."
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking discovery suggests that oil-forming
microbes were both active and plentiful at a time not long after
the origin of life itself.
</P>
<P>
The oil-forming bacteria, found in the mineral resource-rich
Pilbara region of the state of Western Australia as well as in
South Africa and Canada, may be among the most primitive and
earliest inhabitants of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The team, including Adriana Dutkiewicz, Dr. Birger Rasmussen
from the University of Western Australia and Dr. Roger Buick from
the University of Sydney, published their findings Thursday in the
international scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
"By slicing up the rocks and making thin sections of them and
putting them under microscopes and shining ultra violet light on
them, these tiny blobs lit up just like a Christmas tree,"
Dutkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
It was also important for looking at early life on earth, she
said.
"It means life was more abundant than previously thought because
you need a fair amount of living organisms to form oil."

<HEADLINE> Italy to Send More Police to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Albania Wednesday agreed on
Italy's proposal to increase the size of its police force there in
an attempt to help curb illegal entry and smuggling from Albania
to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Minister of the Interior Rosa Jervolino Wednesday made
a one-day visit to Albania and met separately with Albanian Prime
Minister Pandell Majko and Minister of Public Security Petro Koci.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following the meeting, Jervolino announced
that both sides had reached an agreement that would allow Italy to
send additional police to Albania to help combat rampant smuggling
and illegal border crossing.
</P>
<P>
Last year Italy sent a police force to the Albanian city of
Durres to help prevent illegal crossings occurring by sea into
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Jervolino said experts from the two countries will discuss on
Thursday the size of the police force to be sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she also called on Albania to combat illegal border
crossings both by sea and land.
</P>
<P>
Koci also voiced the determination of Albania to fight against
illegal boarder crossings, and asked Italy to continue supporting
Albanian police in their anti-smuggling efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to Jervolino, Majko accepted an invitation from
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'alema to visit Italy in early
November. The two premiers are expected to sign an accord
authorizing Italy to increase its police force in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, illegal entrance from Albania
into Italy by sea has been on the rise. Hundreds of people slip
through sea blockades into Italy each month.

ROME, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Concrete signs of economic
recovery are emerging in Hong Kong, visiting Hong Kong
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly attributed to the economic stability of the
Chinese mainland, Chan said when she briefed Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema on the economic situation of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the Italian prime
minister's office, D'Alema told the Chinese guest that the Italian
government is closely following the financial crisis in various
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema exchanged views with the Hong Kong deputy chief on
economic, cultural and commercial relations between both
sides. They agreed to intensify cooperation in cultural and social
affairs, emigration and air traffic.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema confirmed strong Italian interest in developing
economic relations with Hong Kong through industrial cooperation
in the most advanced sectors, including the telecommunications
sector.
</P>
<P>
He agreed to check out readiness of the EU to make it easier
for Hong Kong-passport holders to enter the EU's Schengen area.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan also met Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
Wednesday, and signed with him an agreement for judicial
assistance in penal cases which will contribute to closer

<HEADLINE> Direct Foreign Investments In L. America Break Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investments in
Latin American countries totaled 44 billion U.S. dollars in 1997,
the highest level ever registered.
</P>
<P>
A report released Wednesday here by the Latin American
Integration Association showed that Brazil and Mexico registered
the most significant increases, with 60 percent of total direct
investments. Argentina and Venezuela together totaled 20 percent
of the funds.
</P>
<P>
The annual report on the finances and the foreign debts of 28
member countries showed that at the end of 1997, the flow of
investments in the region totaled more than 73 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the funds were withdrawn by nervous investors in July this
year, following the start of the Asian crisis 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The investments expanded in the first nine months of last year,
and contracted in the last trimester of 1997 due to the world
financial crisis, whose consequences are "unpredictable", the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the increase of investments from 11.3 billion dollars
in 1993 to 44 billion dollars in 1997 was due to high growth rates
of the region's gross domestic product (GDP) and to the
modernization of communications and transportations.
</P>
<P>
The report said more funds flowed in due to the privatization
of state-run companies and the sale of private businesses.
</P>
<P>
It said that the region's foreign debt had grown to 664 billion
dollars in 1997, adding that 90 percent of the debt was
concentrated in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia,
Peru and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Interest payments which had remained stable around 25 billion
dollars from 1980 to 1994 registered a sharp increase in 1997,
reaching 42.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> 77 Involved in Vietnam's Largest Fraud Case to Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City police have
decided to bring to court 77 among the 81 held for inquiries
involving in Vietnam's largest fraud case, according to newspaper
reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Minh Phung-EPCO economic case involving trade fraud and
embezzlement of state assets with a total loss of 3,800 billion VN
dong (13,908 VN dong to one U.S. dollar) has been investigated for
years.
</P>
<P>
This was a systematic large-scale trade fraud case with the
conspiracies between the two key leaders Tang Minh Phung and Lien
Khui This, bankers and administrative officials.
</P>
<P>
Phung, who set up Minh Phung Co. producing garments in 1993 as
a screen for other activities, established 12 more limited
companies afterwards to obtain bank loans.

<HEADLINE> China to Upgrade Weather Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China will further improve the
accuracy of forecasting weather-related disasters by accelerating
the acquisition of more high-tech equipment, according to today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Winding up a conference on services offered last summer by the
China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and its local agencies
in flood-control activities, Wen Kegang, director of the CMA said
China has to speed up its modernization of meteorological services
in order to help reduce the impact of natural disasters and to
contribute to the sustainable development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important ways of realizing this modernization
is to quicken China's step in the field of advanced meteorological
satellites and to adopt a new generation of weather-monitoring
radar systems, such as the latest type of Doppler radars, which
have been widely used for watching medium-range weather changes in
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
This, Wen said, will straighten China's efforts to accelerate
the construction of a medium-range disaster forecasting system and
an early-warning system of weather-related disasters. This should
minimize damages such as this summer's devastating floods caused
by torrential rains along the Yangtze River in the South, and
along the Songhua River in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged his local agencies to be active and to adjust to
high-tech methods in their forecasting, including the use of
super-computers based on numeral weather prediction models and
remote-sensing technologies, in order to raise the accuracy of
their forecasting.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Prepares to Replace Forint With Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is gearing up efforts
to forge a closer link between its currency, the forint, and the
euro, in the eventual hope of replacing the forint with the euro,
monetary authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Gyorgy Suranyi, president of the National Bank of Hungary,
announced recently that from January 1, 2000, the exchange rate of
the forint will be pegged to the euro, the common currency of the
European Union, which will become effective January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the change, the central bank has decided to
adjust the basket of currencies the forint is pegged to now,
Suranyi said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning January 1, 1999, the German mark, which accounts for
70 percent of Hungary's foreign reserve of some 8 billion US
dollars, will be sold for the euro, while the US dollar will
continue to provide 30 percent of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
Economists here note that because of the strong position of the
German mark among European currencies, Hungary is not likely to
incur any loss to its foreign reserve from selling marks for euros.
</P>
<P>
Hungary wants to join the European Union by 2002. And that,
economists say, make it inevitable for Hungary to replace its
forint with the euro, which will happen by 2005 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Although the use of the euro might lower the competitiveness of
certain Hungarian products in overseas markets, generally speaking
it would benefit the country's economic development because the
euro would reduce greatly the exchange risk in exports, they said,
adding that exports are a major source of revenue for the
Hungarian economy.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled Spices Seized in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Customs has
seized four container loads of spices and arecanuts being smuggled
to India from Malaysia and Indonesia through Sri Lanka, according
to a report of Daily News Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials told the paper Wednesday this was being done
in contravention of the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement
signed among the seven member countries of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The total value of the four container loads of spices and
arecanuts was estimated at 6.5 million rupees (98,000 U.S.
dollars) and had been shipped first to Colombo before being
re-shipped to India with fresh invoices and Bills of Lading to
give credence to the fact that the goods were of Sri Lankan
origin, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
They said that a reputed firm is involved in the racket and had
obtained certificates from Trade Chambers and other government
institutions to prove that the spices comprising mace and cloves
and the arecanuts were from Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
While the goods will be seized by the Customs it will also
question the local parties and shipping agents involved in the
smuggling, they added.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 64 members of an
anti-government drug trafficking armed group laid down their arms
to the government last week, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The armed group members, who are remnants of the Mong Tai Army
(MTA) drug trafficking armed group operating on the Myanmar-Thai
border, "exchanged arms for peace" with the government at the
Triangle Region Command area on October 24.

<HEADLINE> Chileans React to Pinochet Victory with Cheers, Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A ruling in London Wednesday
that says Gen. Augusto Pinochet -- as a former head of state -- is
immune from prosecution prompted celebrations as well as protests
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Residents here, mostly rightists, celebrated the ruling by
waving their national flags and blowing their car horns.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government, which has asked for Pinochet's release,
said it expects the ruling to be upheld.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that the arrest was arbitrary and illegal," said
congressman Alberto Espina of the right-wing National Renewal
Party.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from three right-wing opposition parties said they were
satisfied with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
However, Communist Party president Gladys Marin said, "Our
great triumph is the arrest of Pinochet. One fact nobody will be
able to erase from Chilean history is that he was accused in
Europe of crimes against humanity."
</P>
<P>
Christian Democrat Party President Enrique Krauss said the
arrest warrants from Spain against Pinochet aimed to seek justice.
</P>
<P>
Chileans ``have not been able to achieve this due to the rule
of law we all accepted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
An amnesty law issued by Pinochet before he left power in 1990
prevents Chilean courts from dealing with crimes committed between
1973 and 1978, during which over 2,000 people were reportedly
killed for political reasons while another 1,100 disappeared and
remained missing.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists rejected the ruling of the British
court; they are insisting that Chilean courts bring Pinochet to
trial.

<HEADLINE> Poland Cuts Basic Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Poland will
lower basic interest rates starting Wednesday with a cut in
interest rates for mortgage loans from 24 to 22 percent, and a
discount rate cut from 21.5 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cut, the third of its type this year, was decided by the
Monetary Policies Commission on Tuesday. The commission also
extended the fluctuation range of the zloty interest rate from 10
percent to 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it had made the above decision to serve the
five-year, mid-term strategy for the country's monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Poland's inflation is expected to drop to 9.5 percent by the
end of the year. The monetary commission said a low-speed price
rise suited the plan for a 8.5 percent inflation rate next year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the central bank made two cuts on May 21 and July 17
by one and two points respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank's interest rates remained high, which
turned businesses to foreign financial institutions for
loans. Foreign borrowing amounted to 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Polish economic experts hold that the fresh cut in interest
rates by the central bank will check the influx of short-term
foreign capital and lower the foreign debts of domestic businesses.
</P>
<P>
A devalued zloty, they say, will boost exports and benefit the
country's economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to extricate itself
from an economic crisis, Brazil declared Wednesday an
unprecedented plan to cut spending and raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan disclosed by the Finance Ministry, the
country should save 25.4 billion U.S. dollars next year, or 3.08
percent of the gross domestic product, by cutting spending by 7.9
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The action is also to meet conditions of the International
Monetary Fund to pass a rescue plan worth 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government will also collect an additional nine percent
social security tax from civil servants and pensioners earning
over 1,000 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Another 11.5 billion dollars will come from tax increases
including a raise to 0.38 percent from 0.2 percent on the tax on
financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
Another tax on corporate billings will increase to three
percent from two percent to fund social security.
</P>
<P>
The state will also reduce federal funds transferred to the
states by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made a TV
speech justifying the austerity program.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said tough measures were needed to "cut out the evil by
the roots." He added that a harsh cut now will allow Brazil to
lower interest rates which had been raised to some 50 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said the package aims not only to attack an
enormous budget deficit of 65 billion dollars, but also shore up
an economy reeling from the fallout of the economic crisis in Asia
and Russia.

<P>
LANZHOU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to China's historic
site of Dunhuang now have a chance to add agricultural development
to a visit to the Mogao Grottoes and Crescent Lake.
</P>
<P>
One of the spots already opened to tourists is in Nanhu
Township where visitors can see how farmers grow grapes with
modern technology in a climate similar to that in Turpan in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China's leading grape grower.
</P>
<P>
The best season for seeing the grapes is August and September
when they are ripe, explains Xue Shenghua, a farmer who has about
a third of a hectare of vineyards.
</P>
<P>
He says that in the peak season he can earn 6,000 to 7,000 yuan
from tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Daisun, a local government official, it has
about 500,000 tourists every year, and this helps local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Nanhu Township and a local forest farm are planning to build
two sightseeing areas near major tourist attractions.

LHASA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The scientific team preparing to
explore a little known canyon in the Tibet Autonomous Region
arrived in Paixiang Township on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The township is the starting point of the Yalu Zangbu Canyon
which Chinese scientists claim is the largest in the world.

The 64 scientists, explorers and journalists left Lhasa, the

<P>
Three groups will follow different routes and meet at the
opposite end of the canyon.

<P>
Yang Yishou, a geologist with Chinese Academy of Sciences, has
visited the canyon several times and notes that no one has hiked
central 100 km of the canyon due to the rugged terrain.

<P>
The Sky Blues said on Wednesday that Rovers are the only club
in with a chance of signing their highly-rated England marksman.
</P>
<P>
Dublin looked well on his way to Blackburn on Tuesday when
Coventry agreed to a 6.75 million pound (about 11.2 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
But Villa manager John Gregory then contacted City with a bid
to match Blackburn's offer.

<P>
And Newcastle boss Ruud Gullit is also interested in making
Dublin his first major signing at St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said: "Yes, we have contacted Coventry City with an
inquiry about Dion Dublin and we will be formally faxing our bid.
</P>
<P>
"We are now awaiting permission to speak to the player and
hopefully persuade him to join us."
</P>
<P>
But Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson confirmed Wednesday
that Ewood Park remains the most likely destination for Dublin.
He said: "We have a closed bid with Blackburn and no-one else can

Local press on Wednesday quoted Euro 2000 organizers as making
the promise.
</P>
<P>
The 31-match tournament will be jointly hosted by Belgium and
the Netherlands and the matches will be held in eight cities in
the two countries. Each city will host three first-round matches.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that they would try to make it easier for
soccer fans to buy the tickets unlike the ticket sales prior to
this year's World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the first round of the Euro 2000 will be put on
sale in April next year before the qualifying tournament finishes.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and the Netherlands will be the first joint hosts to
any major soccer tournament. Japan and South Korea were awarded
the right to jointly host the 2002 World Cup soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
Belgium will host 15 of the matches while the Netherlands the
remainder. The curtain-raiser between Belgium and a qualifier
will be held in Brussels while the grand finale will be held in a
Dutch city yet to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
The Euro 2000 matches will be held in Belgian cities of
Brussels, Bruges, Charleroi and Liege and in Dutch cities of

<HEADLINE> NBA Cancels Rest of November Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement was made by NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik.
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to be possible games in November," Granik
said at a press conference today. "We don't see any points in
making further announcements until we either make a deal or
cancel the season entirely."
</P>
<P>
Granik went on to say that as each week without a resolution
passes, it should be assumed another week of play will be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
A total of 194 regular-season games have been eliminated due
to stalled labor talks. If play were to start December 1, then
each team would have roughly 69 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
NBA commissioner David Stern has said in the past that rather
than play a season of 40 or 50 games long, he would cancel the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
"Using our existing format, we would be down to 69 games,"
Stern said. "As we compounded that from the owner's numbers, it's
200 million U.S. dollars of revenue that the players will not see.
</P>
<P>
"We want to emphasize to the players that we should sit down
and talk about what is what without labels. If we ever reached an
agreement, how we could bring our fans as much of an NBA season
as possible."
</P>
<P>
The cancellations came after a meeting of the league's Board
of Governors at which some owners asked when the "drop dead" date
would be for cutting off the entire season.
</P>
<P>
Stern said: "One we want to be ready to be imaginative. Two,
we don't want to make threats, we ant to make a deal."
</P>
<P>
He also added: "I feel neither optimism nor pessimism. I just
think that we've got to talk."
</P>
<P>
About 100 players including Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen,
David Robinson and Reggie Miller attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Stern hoped the league and union would discuss recapturing
games. But Jeffrey Kessler, the lead outside counsel for the
union, said: "You can add games on later, or put more into the s
chedule."
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting discussed about a luxury tax on the highest
contracts. If that system did not reduce the amount of revenues
being devoted to salaries, a modified hard cap would be
implemented under which players would put 10 percent of their s
ala ries into an escrow fund.
</P>
<P>
"All we have to do now is agree on the numbers," union
president Patrick Ewing said. "We've been trying to take steps to
bridge the gap. Now the shoe is on the other foot."
</P>
<P>
The sides need to find a middle ground on the luxury tax. Even
if the sides make little progress on the numbers, union director
Billy Hunter said NBC and TNT, because of their recent sinking
ratings of TV viewers, would not allow the cancellation of the
entire season.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Ready to Ask For Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Honduras remained in a
state of alert on Wednesday and was ready to request international
aid after the country was devastated by one of the century's worst
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is critical and the government is doing its best
to evaluate the disaster," Foreign Minister Fernando Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch remained 50 kilometers off the Honduran coast
Wednesday, as torrential rains caused rivers to flood in Honduras
and other Central American countries up to the Yucatan Peninsula
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mitch forced thousands to flee, killing 14 people. Over 45,000
people were evacuated from coastal regions in Honduras, while many
towns were cut off by about 50 flooded rivers.
</P>
<P>
In the city of La Ceiba, two highways were cut and two bridges
were washed away while electricity was out and waves moved into
parts of the town.
</P>
<P>
Mexico declared an alert throughout the Yucatan Peninsula,
evacuating thousands of residents and tourists from beach resorts
like Cancun and Cozumel. The state-run oil company Petroleos
Mexicanos also cut back pumping oil from wells in the Gulf of
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Teach Irish in Schools from 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced on Wednesday
that Irish would be taught in its schools from next year.
</P>
<P>
British Education Secretary David Blunkett, in Dublin for talks
with Irish counterpart Micheal Martin, said he understood the
importance of the language both to Irish people living in Britain
and to inter-community relations "in these islands".
</P>
<P>
"Minister Martin has discussed this issue with me since (the
Labour government) took office (in 1997) and...I feel it perfectly
reasonable and fair to ask our curriculum authority to include
Irish on the same basis as other European languages and not just
as an added extra," Reuters quoted Blunkett as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told state broadcaster RTE that Irish would be included
among Britain's national curriculum languages in the 1999-2000
academic year.
</P>
<P>
In Ireland, the language is a key part of the educational
curriculum, although only a tiny fraction of the population are
fluent and use it regularly. Though not compulsory, it is required
knowledge for anyone joining the civil service and a definite
advantage in many walks of life, especially politics and state
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
In Northern Ireland, learning Irish is seen as a statement of
political affinity with the republican fight for Irish unity and
Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, uses it
regularly in Belfast's new assembly.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was seen as part of a raft of initiatives
aimed at strengthening links between Northern Ireland, the Irish
Republic and Britain in the wake of April's peace agreement,
according to Reuters.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Comprehensive Review of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday met on the comprehensive review of
Iraq, but no results yielded.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent a letter to the Security Council last Friday, asking
how and when the Council would conduct the comprehensive review on
its compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the Council ended its formal
consultation, Council President Jeremy Greenstock said the members
of the Council had a very good discussion of the comprehensive
review proposed by the U.N. secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Greenstock said the process should move forward so that a
conclusion could be reached over the next 24 hours or so.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed the comprehensive
review on October 5, but said it could only be conducted once Iraq
reversed its decision and resumed cooperation with the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency(IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Under the review, UNSCOM should substantiate precisely what
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are still unaccounted for and
set a tentative timeframe for their work to be completed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA on
August 5 after the talks between Iraq and UNSCOM collapsed. The
United Nations Security Council responded on September 9 by
freezing its regular review of the U.N. sanctions against the
country, which has been in the place since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Asks MQM to Hand Over Killers of Hakim Said </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said Wednesday the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) was involved in
the murder of Hakim Said and asked the MQM leadership to hand over
its workers involved in the killing in the next two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Hakim Said, former governor of Sindh, was killed in Karachi on
October 17. The killing of Hakim Said, a prominent figure in
Pakistan, caused shock among the general public.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Karachi Wednesday, Sharif said
that the government has complete evidence that MQM activists were
behind the murder, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
"If the MQM did not cooperate with us in the killer's arrest,
we will part our ways with the MQM," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif asked the MQM leadership to hand over the killers in the
next two or three days. The murder of Hakim Said was not an
ordinary incident, said Sharif, adding that "there will be no
compromise on this."
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that when he visited Karachi on October 19, he
asked the Sindh government to nab the killers at every cost.
</P>
<P>
"Aamirullah (an MQM activist) is under custody and after his
interrogation I can say today that the MQM is involved in the
murder of Hakim Said," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the MQM should cooperate with the government which
is establishing peace in Karachi. "They are part of the
government...they should help us and hand over the killers,"
Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he met with the MQM leaders and
asked them to cooperate with the government in arresting the
accused. "I have asked them to give us the accused within three
days," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was his national duty to bring the killers of Hakim Said to
book, said Sharif, adding that "law and order and politics are two
different things. When I try to do something for law and order in
Karachi, there is some conspiracy to spoil the good work."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the MQM leaders would cooperate with the
government in arresting the killers of Hakim Said and clear its
name.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Announces $70 Bln Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. President Bill
Clinton Wednesday announced that the government managed to gain a
surplus of 70 billion U.S. dollars in the 1998 budget year, ended
September 30.
</P>
<P>
The surplus is the first since 1969 and matches an estimate
Clinton announced later last month, before the government had made
its final accounting of revenue and spending.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks at a Rose Garden news conference with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, Clinton noted:"I'm very
pleased that attempts to spend that surplus rather than preserve
it until we reform the Social Security system to meet the needs of
the 21st century were not successful in the last Congress."
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we maintain this position until we have
saved Social Security. Hopefully, that will occur next year," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also charged that Republicans are against school
renovations, Social Security reform, tobacco restrictions, minimum
wage increases and campaign finance reform. And he cast next
Tuesday's balloting as a clear choice between the Democrats'
and Republicans' starkly different agendas.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke: Situation in Kosovo Is Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- "The situation in Kosovo
is obviously developing in a positive direction," U.S. special
envoy Richard Holbrooke Wednesday told the press here.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke made the statement after he had what he described as
"a wonderful meeting" with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
during which he briefed the U.N. chief on what is going on in
Serbia's province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"What has been accomplished up to now will either succeed or
fail based on how implementation proceeds. So I want to stress
that everything depends on the implementation and compliances," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Holbrooke briefed the U.S. State Department
in Washington on the situation in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians,
who make up a majority of the province's population of 2 million,
have been battling with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was explaining plans to implement an agreement to
force Belgrade's withdrawal of Serb military and police units from
Kosovo and the start of negotiations on a political settlement
with ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been rattling the threat of air strikes to press
Yugoslavia for full compliance of relevant U.N. resolutions and
the implementation of accords signed by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic complied with U.N. resolutions and relevant
agreements by pulling the military forces and police units from
Kosovo back into their barracks.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February this year after Kosovo
Albanians began to fight for independence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials to Visit DPRK for Site Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. diplomatic team will
visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea next month to talk
on access to underground facilities which the U.S. claimed could
be used to develop nuclear weapons, the State Department said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by envoy Charles Kartman, will seek access
to a "suspect underground construction" site but does not expect
immediate permission to carry out inspections, spokesman James
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Kartman, U.S. special envoy for Korea peace talks, will be in
Pyongyang November 16-18. It will be the highest level U.S.
officials to hold talks in Pyongyang since December 1994, when
deputy assistant secretary of state Thomas Hubbard went to
negotiate the release of Bobby Hall, a U.S. helicopter pilot shot
down when he strayed over the border with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We've made clear to the North Koreans that any attempt by
North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would
be unacceptable," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States has specific concerns about the
construction activities and will demand assurances that DPRK abide
by nuclear-related commitments it agreed to four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has repeatedly denied that the building work is part
of a nuclear weapons program and stated that Americans need not
worry about the site.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency said the building work was on
civilian underground structures. "If the U.S. side persists in
inspecting our underground structures, we can show them to it.
However, if they prove to be civilian structures, the U.S. side
must compensate for its aspersions on the DPRK," it added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Confident Israel-Palestine Deal to Be Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that the land-for-peace agreement between Israelis
and Palestinians would be approved by the Israeli parliament if
the Palestinians took action against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a difficult business in the Middle East," Clinton
said during a Rose Garden news conference with visiting Colombian
President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if we complete the security arrangements that
were agreed to at Wye, the Israeli government will approve this
and honor their commitment and will go forward," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged no overreaction "to every little hump
and turn in the road."
</P>
<P>
He said mistrust was not expected to completely evaporate
during the nine days of summitry at Wye, Maryland, and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat were both "quite brave" to reach the agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton said Netanyahu wanted to be
"absolutely assured" the Palestinian Authority would follow
through on countering terrorism before moving ahead with a
withdrawal on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the U.S. State Department said that the
Palestinians would submit an action plan to counter terrorism by
Friday, which is required in a recent Palestine-Israel
land-for-peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has threatened to delay submitting the agreement he
reached with Arafat to his cabinet until the Palestinians submit
the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, cooperation is occurring, and I am not aware of
problems that are occurring on the practical side," U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not behind schedule," he said, although he acknowledged
there were "bumps in the road" to carrying out the agreement. "It
is very easy to find problems," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat signed the agreement Friday at the White
House after nine days of negotiations in Wye River, Maryland,
supervised by Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Many of Netanyahu's usual supporters are furious over an
agreement they saw as advancing the prospects of a Palestinian
state and surrendering claims to land many Jews consider to be
their promised homeland.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, Netanyahu said it had become
clear the Palestinians would not meet the schedule for a plan to
counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Albright spoke by telephone to Netanyahu Monday and Arafat
Tuesday. She also launched a high-profile campaign urging Saudi
Arabia and other Arab countries to normalize their relations with
Israel and assist the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this agreement will go forward," Rubin said. The
work plan on security would be completed by Friday even though it
is not due under the Wye agreement until Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a manageable problem we think we will be able to work
out in the next few days," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement, Israel will pull out troops from 13
percent of the West Bank and in return, the Palestinians should
implement a specific plan to guarantee the security of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Denis Ross is expected to travel to the
Middle East very soon for the implementation of the accords.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Counter Republicans' Attack Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Democrats lashed out
Wednesday against a 10 million-dollar Republican ad campaign that
makes an issue out of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
Republicans planned to add another TV spot to their arsenal,
accusing President Bill Clinton of hiding behind "legal mumbo
jumbo" in the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said at a news conference that Democrats are "being
very badly outspent" by the Republicans. Republicans can "make the
election about whatever they want to make the election about," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said, "Attacking the president and
investigating the president has apparently become an obsession
with the Republicans."
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt in a conference call with
reporters called it "a sign of what they intend to do if we leave
them in charge of the Congress, and that is continue an
open-ended, non-ending impeachment investigation."
</P>
<P>
But Republican Party spokeswoman Mary Crawford said, "The
president is the head of their party. We strongly disagree with
his ideas and their party's ideas. This election is about their
ideas versus our ideas, and that's what these ads are about."
</P>
<P>
House Democrats reportedly began production on an ad to counter
the Republican blitz, although it was expected to run in far fewer
markets than Republican commercials.
</P>
<P>
Democratic sources said the ad would accuse Republicans of
focusing on investigations instead of issues popular with
Americans, such as health care and education.
</P>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee launched 29 ads
tailored for specific congressional districts plus three
multi-district ads. Those three ads blend talk of Republican
achievements with subtle but clear references to the Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
A top Republican pollster, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Republican party's leaders risk firing up Democratic core
voters or sparking a broader backlash.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press poll of 1,010 people from October 21-25
showed, more than 60 percent of likely voters said Clinton would
not be a factor in their voting. More than half of Republicans
registered to vote said Clinton is not a factor.
</P>
<P>
At a Democratic news conference, party general chairman Roy
Romer asked Republicans, "Is that all you've got to say? 'Send us
back and we'll investigate the president more?' "

<P>
BONN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's new Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer Wednesday warned against what he described as
"illusory" timetables for the European Union enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to set illusory timetables that cannot be
met and will only lead to disappointment," said Fischer, who just
took office Wednesday as Germany's first foreign minister from the
ecologist Greens party.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the call for more realism did not
mean that Germany would not support the EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's deputy, Guenter Verheugen, Wednesday also said the
new government in Bonn had brought in a new realism in Germany's
view over the speed of the EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German radio Deutschlandfunk,
Verheugen said that the social and economic consequences of the
planned enlargement had not been sufficiently considered so far.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It Continues to be Vigilant on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it will continue to be vigilant on Serb actions in
Kosovo to make sure Yugoslavia's troops and special police units
will not return.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke said that the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) have all the means to act quickly against the
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Besides the NATO overflights and radar, at least 2,000 people
drawn from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) countries, will be on the ground, on the lookout for
violations of the agreement, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
Still, fighting can break out again at any time, added
Holbrooke, who negotiated terms of the pullback with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
NATO had threatened to bomb Serb targets if Milosevic did not
order the pullout, and "it was no bluff," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
"All of us thought that bombing almost certainly was going to
happen," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The chances of an air war being fought was over 60 percent,"
Holbrooke said. "The president, the secretary of state, the
secretary of defense and NATO all were ready to move."
</P>
<P>
And as refugees return to their homes from the forests,
"fighting could break out at any time," Holbrooke said. "It is one
of our main concerns."
</P>
<P>
NATO will deploy a rapid-reaction force in the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia if the country agrees.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said the force will include no U.S. troops, but a
small American liaison unit will be set up. About 350 U.S.
soldiers already are in Macedonia under the United Nations flag to
guard against spillover of regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo's population is almost 90 percent ethnic Albanian, many
of whom want independence or at least union with next-door
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke reiterated that the United States supports self-rule
for the Albanians but not a separate state.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War, Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina announced one by one their independence from
Yugoslavia. The country now consists only of Serbia and
Montenegro, with Kosovo a major province of Serbia.

is not due under the Wye agreement until Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a manageable problem we think we will be able to work
out in the next few days," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement, Israel will pull out troops from 13
percent of the West Bank and in return, the Palestinians should
implement a specific plan to guarantee the security of Israelis.

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Macroeconomic Stability Efforts in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Wednesday announced the approval of a 400
million U.S. dollar, fast-disbursing loan to Venezuela to back
government's efforts to enhance sustainable macroeconomic
stability.
</P>
<P>
The resources will also be used to help maintain social
investments that benefits low-income groups while it undertakes
reforms that will lay the groundwork for a stronger economy.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures the Venezuelan government is taking is the
creation of a Macroeconomic Stabilization Fund, which will offset
fluctuations in oil revenues, and the promulgation of a new fiscal
legal framework.
</P>
<P>
The loan will also counteract the efforts of low international
prices for petroleum and hydrocarbon products, the mainstays of
the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is expected to provide parallel financing for
the program.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Slide on Weak Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets slid
Wednesday on a weak dollar and disappointing corporate news.
</P>
<P>
It was a red-figure day for the London market, but trading was
thin and a weakish Wall Street rally failed to lift the mood.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 fell 37.3 to 5293.9, but clearly recovered from
the day's low of 5,238.7. Market volume amounted to 670 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers, said
London had been pulled away from lows as the U.S. equity market
recovered on news of a tough austerity package in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"It appears the authorities in Brazil are doing their level
best to avoid devaluation," he said. "The imminence of the crisis
has perhaps dissipated a bit."
</P>
<P>
Investors in New York speculated that the budget package could
help see-off the threat of a U.S. recession, pulling Wall Street
out of an early dive, and this in turn lifted the mood in the
City.
</P>
<P>
But a fragile retailing sector kept the London market under
pressure. As Batstone put it, the domestic environment remained
extremely uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"News from the corporate sector is unashamedly bleak right
now." Sainsbury, Kingfisher and Whitbread had been "stock market
darlings" for a long time, "but now profit expectations are going
to have to come down," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, a mix of dollar weakness and negative corporate
news from banks and telecoms knocked shares back sharply, although
stocks came off their lows as Wall Street began positively.
</P>
<P>
The late-trading Xetra dax index finished down 118 points, or
2.5 percent, at 4,564 points. The main Dax index earlier closed
down 3.12 percent or 146 at 4,536.
</P>
<P>
The retreat brings to a halt a three-day recovery, which some
market observers thought had strengthened the likelihood of a
continued upward trend.
</P>
<P>
Traders were surprised at the extent of the pessimism clouding
the market Wednesday. "I didn't expect such weakness," said Ralf
Zienert, trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar was lower against the Deutsche mark. At
1330 GMT, it was at DM1.6528, down from DM1.6534 late Tuesday in
New York.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks also ended off session lows, after Wall
Street rediscovered the way forward, but the dollar's drift and
the urge to bank profits dominated trade Wednesday. The leading
Cac 40 index closed down 57 points at 3,493.
</P>
<P>
"Although Italy's rate cut Monday buoyed investor sentiment,
the Paris stock market is now affected by a gloomy world economic
forecast," said Christian Royer, a trader at IFF Bourse brokerage
house.
</P>
<P>
Traders said uncertainties over the Brazilian plan to back up
its currency, and the real and disappointing results released
Wednesday by Japanese companies, cut short the forward momentum.
