WUHAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The rising water level of the
Yangtze River measured at Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, has exceeded the danger line of 28.28 meters,
approaching 28.30 meters at 8:00 p.m. this evening.
</P>
<P>
The water flow of the Yangtze River at Wuhan Pass Measuring
Station has also reached 65,300 cubic meters per second today.

<P>
More than 60,000 people are keeping watch on the river
embarkments, preparing for another possible flood peak to come.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's anti-flood headquarters held an emergency
meeting of flood control commanders this evening and ordered that
no effort be spared to guarantee the safety of the river
embarkerments, Wuhan city, and the locals' lives and property.

<HEADLINE> Navigation on Yangtze River to Be Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Navigation on the Yangtze River
from Shishou city to Wuhan city, both in central China's Hubei
Province, will be suspended at midnight tonight in order to
safeguard the embarkments against the rising river waters.
</P>
<P>
According to the lastest information from the State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the water levels
measured at Shishou and Wuhan have exceeded or approached
record highs.
</P>
<P>
Rising water levels have been endangering the security of river
embankments on both sides, and waves created by passing ships
remain a serious threat to the embankments.
</P>
<P>
Both the Hubei and Hunan provincial governments have suggested
suspending navigation on the Yangtze before the flood waters
recede.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that navigation will soon be resumed after the
flood peak of the river has passed through, and the pressures on
the embarkments on both sides are alleviated.

<HEADLINE> Indian Defense Minister Sees Encouraging Signs For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes said Saturday there were encouraging signs for relations
between India and the United States after India's nuclear tests in
May.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted Fernandes as saying that
the fourth round of talks between New Delhi and Washington next
month should lead to a thaw to the extent of accepting India as a
nuclear weapon state and easing of sanctions imposed by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
On his way to New Delhi after reviewing security arrangements
in Jammu and Kashmir, Fernandes told reporters that the ongoing
dialogue between Indian Prime Minister's special envoy Jaswant
Singh and Deputy Secretary of State Strob Talbott was moving in
the right direction and there is softening of attitudes.
</P>
<P>
He said on board a special plane of the India Air Force that
the next round of talks between Talbott and Singh in the second
half of August in Washington should see a forward movement.
</P>
<P>
Talbott and Singh held two-day talks earlier without tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he meant by forward movement, Fernandes said this
included acceptance of India's status of a nuclear weapon state
and removal of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want anybody's confirmation about India's status. It
is a question of acceptance of the reality," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the
Defense Minister said complexities are on the U.S. side which has
lot to do with the weaponization program.
</P>
<P>
He said there are certain ideas on the U.S. side which are not
acceptance to India. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India would go ahead with test firing of a new version
of intermediate range Agni ballistic missile with an extended
strike of over 2,500 kilometers, Fernandes said Parliament's
Standing Committee on Defense had urged the government to go ahead
with the program.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Calls for Formation of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Zimbabwe
African National Union (NDONGA) Saturday said the country needs a
transparent and a representative professional national land
redistribution authority for the country's second resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
The party's Secretary General Edwin Nguwa told a press
conference at the opening of its national executive council
meeting in Harare that the authority should be established and
governed by an act of parliament to ensure all Zimbabweans,
living under squalid conditions, are given a chance to be
resettled despite their political or religious affiliation, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the current forcible settlements by villagers around
the country on some commercial and state farms was a sign of
desperation hence the need for the government to speed up the
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The government needs about 2.2 billion U.S. Dollars to
implement the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
A land conference to drum up donor support for the program is
expected to be held in Harare in September.
</P>
<P>
But according to Nguwa, "the proposed donor conference shows
how the present government is helpless and ill-determined to
resolve the plight of the people of Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
He said Zanu (NDONGA) welcomed President Robert Mugabe's idea
to have the country's Lancaster house-brokered constitution
overhauled but said there was need for national convention which
will lead to the formation of a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"The government, composed of a cross section of our society,
would be tasked with writing a new national constitution and
organize a referendum to seek the approval of the new
constitution by the people," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Bin
Mohamed Saturday officially launched the Southern Bank of Africa
(SBA) in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The bank, capitalized at 100 million Rand (16 million U.S.
Dollars), is co-owned by Killinghall (Malaysia) Berhard -- the
primary shareholders of Southern Bank Berhard-- and local black
empowerment group, National Empowerment Trust Investment Fund
(NETIF), South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at providing funding for black business and offering
advisory and support services to the government, the bank would
engage in corporate finance, structured and project finance and
facilitate trade in South Africa, southeast Asia and other
African markets.
</P>
<P>
"A core management team of experienced South African and
Malaysian bankers had been employed by the SBA," said NETIF
Chairman Don Mkhwanazi, who is also the chairman of the SBA board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
Because of its inter-continental shareholding, he said, SBA
would be able to offer private and institutional investors access
to potential buying power of one billion people.

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Saturday

carrier Harry Truman at the port of Norfolk, Virginia.
</P>

Clinton addressed an estimated crowd of 20,000 people from a

It took nine years to build the massive vessel, which can carry

The new 4.5 billion dollar ship was named for the late

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Yemeni FMs Hold Talks on Island Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia and Yemen held talks in Saudi port city of Jeddah on ways
to resolve the crisis resulting from clashes last week on a Red
Sea island claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said the Saudi minister, Saud
Al-Faisal, and his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal
focused on approaches to prevent further clashes on the island and
other areas along their 2,000-kilometer common border.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni and Saudi coastal guards exchanged fire last Sunday on
Duwaima island off the Yemeni coast. Three Yemeni soldiers were
killed and an officer captured in the armed clashes.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts lasted for five hours before a ceasefire is
agreed on. The two countries have decide to maintain the ceasefire
and instruct border committees to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, the sources said the two
foreign ministers' talks covered a proposal for both sides to
evacuate the disputed islands until the completion of land and
border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors on the Arabian peninsula have a decades-old
dispute over three red sea islands and part of the desert region
along their border, where huge oil reserves are expected.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not disclose what the two sides have agreed on
but underlined that there was a joint keenness to prevent new
clashes.
</P>
<P>
They said both the Yemeni and Saudi officials stressed that
their leaders are keen on promoting bilateral relations and
overcoming obstacles, as well as speeding up border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
They said the two officials also stressed the island clashes
would neither affect the course of the border demarcation
negotiations nor the level of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni foreign minister arrived in Jeddah earlier
Saturday. He had been expected in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday or
Wednesday, but the visit was postponed because of domestic events.
</P>
<P>
The top Yemeni diplomat is scheduled to meet Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz later.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world while
Saudi Arabia is one of the richest. Their border dispute has led
to clashes in the past, but both seemed reluctant to raise the
skirmishes openly.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Cancels Scheduled Meeting With U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos Saturday decided to cancel his scheduled meeting with
U.S. State Department coordinator for the Cyprus issue Thomas
Miller who will visit Athens next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision during his visit to the northeastern
border region of Thrace, Pangalos said that the new U.S.
initiative on the divided island, under U.S. envoy Miller, would
not have the "desirable outcome," the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister once again reiterated his criticism of the U.S.
presidents and especially of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
History proved that all U.S. presidents had failed to keep
their promises in resolving the Cyprus issue in accordance with
U.N. resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos also urged Greek Americans not to back any of the U.S.
presidential candidates in the next elections but to offer their
money to Greece's defense needs.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pangalos angrily expressed his dissatisfaction
over Washington's positions towards the settlement of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
He described pre-election promises made by Clinton to help
solve the 24-year division of Cyprus as "gross lies."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Athens Nicholas Burns had reportedly issued
a protest verbally to Pangalos about his remarks. In Washington,
the White House also criticized Pangalos' remarks Friday with
spokesman Mike Mccurry saying that those were remarks unbecoming
for a senior official and close ally of the United States and
inconsistent with what are otherwise close and warm bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> New Daily Appears in Iran to Replace Banned Jameah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A new moderate evening newspaper
Tous appeared on news stands Saturday to replace the banned daily
Jameah (society), pledging to defend human rights and public
freedom in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tous, named after the appellation of ancient city Mashhad in
northeast Iran, comes out after Iran's appeal court confirmed
Thursday the decision of a press court to close down Jameah, a
liberal newspaper which supports President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"Following the ban on Jameah newspaper, from today Tous will be
at the service of the society," reads a headline in the front page
of Tous.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial on "10 principles of Tous," the paper said it
would carefully follow works of the state institutions and
criticize social disorders in order to defend human rights and
public freedom.
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the banned Jameah joined Tous, originally a
provincial weekly published in Mashhad, capital of Khorasan
province, to bring it to national level with a circulation of
100,000.
</P>
<P>
On June 10, the Tehran press court ruled to close down Jameah
and and to ban its managing director Hamidreza Jalaipour from
running publications for one year on charges of "printing
defamatory and untruthful articles."
</P>
<P>
The popular Jameah appeared last February, but came under fire
of the conservatives and hard-liners who accused the paper of
publishing anti-Islamic articles.
</P>
<P>
The paper announced to stop publication as of Saturday after
releasing 120 issues.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani here Saturday confirmed that Iran has "successfully"
tested a missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, Shamkhani said the test was
conducted on Wednesday by experts of Iranian defense industries
"without any assistance from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
The United States on Thursday expressed concern over Iran's
medium-range missile test, which meant that Iran is capable of
hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia and the U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani did not give any details about the testfire. But
U.S. intelligence said the missile flew about 1,300 kilometers and
blew up at the last stage of its flight Wednesday morning.
</P>

Shamkhani said that Iran's defense police was and is to promote

<HEADLINE> Turkey's First Water Supply Reaches Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- With the first shipment of Turkish
drinking water arriving in drought-hit northern Cyprus Saturday, a
water project between Turkey and Turkish Cypriots was activated.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, scores of Turkish Cypriots crowded beneath a pipe
gushing water imported from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who came to inaugurate the
water project, said the project has been "just a start and Turkey
has much water to give the Turkish Cypriots," Turkey's Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a cost of 160 million U.S. dollars, includes
shipment of fresh water from Turkey's Soguksu river to northern
Cyprus, construction of dams and irrigation installations in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has signed a deal with the self-declared "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" to ship in 7 million cubic meters of
drinkable water each year to compensate for the water shortage
there.
</P>
<P>
The water is expected to answer the need of more than half of
Northern Cyprus' estimated 200,000 residents, who currently can
only get drinking water twice a week.
</P>
<P>
The fresh water will be initially carried to northern Cyprus in
10,000-cubic meter water bags, which are also called "balloons,"
dragged by a ship.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have said water tankers can be used if the
"balloon" method is found to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway state in the
north in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> WB Encourages Development in Tunisia With Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has provided
Tunisia with 222 million U.S. dollars in loans from July 1997 to
June 1998 for development projects in the country, the
Arabic-language daily Al-Sabah reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loans, whose interest rate was determined in terms of
French franc to be below 4 percent, have a maturity of 15-17 years
with a grace period between three and five years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According the paper, a 42-million-dollar loan was used to raise
farmers' income through optimizing the exploitation of water
resources and enhancing scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 million dollars was earmarked for a three-year
health sector reform program from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
The WB also allocated 80 million dollars to improve the
enrolling and graduation process in Tunisia's higher education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tunisian transport sector received 50 million
dollars to improve its maritime and railway transport services,
and encourage the involvement of private sector in this field.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Remind Foreigners of Tax Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners entering Russia will
soon get an advisory reminding them of tax legislations of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Starting August 1, incoming aliens clearing the customs will
have the advisory inserted in their passports, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as another attempt by Russia to fill up its gaping
hole in the budget, which is to a large extent the result of tax
evasion by individuals. Of the 250,000 tax dodgers found in the
first half of this year, 170,000 were foreigners, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the advisory, foreigners are to report to the taxation
agencies in the areas where they live of all their incomes in
Russia, the incomes and taxes paid abroad and the hiring of real
estate or other assets, Interfax quoted Anna Komardina, deputy
head of the Income Taxation Department of the State Taxation
Service, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are warned of administrative, financial and criminal
liabilities for tax dodging, Komardina said.
</P>
<P>
Administrative liability refers to a fine of two to 10 times of
minimum wages; financial liability implies a fine equal to the
concealed income, in addition to the amount of tax that should be
paid and a fine equal to 10 percent of the tax collected.
</P>
<P>
Concealment of large incomes in Russia may entail a fine
ranging from 200 to 700 times the minimum wages, or two to five
years in prison, Komardina said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's minimum wage, which changes from time to time, now
stands at 83.49 rubles (about 13.5 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Import Maize from Zimbabwe, South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will import a large amount
of maize from Zimbabwe and South Africa to meet the country's
shortfall in maize supply, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ZANA Saturday in Monze, 120 kilometers
south of Lusaka, Geofrey Godson, national chairman of the
National Food Reserve, said the contracts have already been
signed for the importation of maize from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Zambians that they should not panic over maize
shortage since his agency has finalized all the arrangements to
import enough maize.
</P>
<P>
However, Godson lamented inadequate funding from the
government, saying that his agency has been given only one
billion Kwacha (about 500,000 U.S. Dollars) out of the budget
requirement of 11 billion Kwacha (5.5 million Dollars) to bring
in maize to meet the shortfall in feeding the people.
</P>
<P>
He added that his agency has borrowed money from various
commercial banks within Zambia to meet the shortfall in financial
requirements, but he did not disclose how much has been so far
sourced from the banks.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is facing a serious maize shortage this year but the
National Reserve Agency has taken measures to counter this
deficit, said Godson.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his agency is storing maize in silos and sheds
all over the country, especially in areas it considers to have
great need for extra maize stocks.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Buys 33 Pct of Malaysian Telecom Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom (BT) has made its
biggest investment in Asia by spending 400 million U.S. dollars
for a 33 percent stake in the Malaysian telecoms company
Binariang, according to British media reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Binariang, launched three years ago, has 22 percent of
Malaysia's mobile phone market, with 450,000 customers. Its fixed
wire network now covers 70 percent of the country's corporate
customers and multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
Experts in telecommunication markets said the move gives BT a
major stake in Malaysia's fast-growing mobile phone industry. It
will also enable Concert, BT's global corporate telecoms business,
to win new deals in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, said, "We have
established partnerships and alliances in our key target markets
with companies which have a strong local base and which share our
vision of the future."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian mobile penetration was only 9 to 11 percent, with
vast growth prospects, Bonfield added.
</P>
<P>
The deal is part of a larger plan by Binariang to raise about
960 million U.S. dollars through links with overseas groups and
debt securities.
</P>
<P>
Apart from BT, Binariang had been recently linked to companies
including Singapore Telecommunications, Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, and Cable and Wireless.

MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Saturday fired head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Nikolai
Kovalyov and named a deputy head of the presidential
administration to replace him.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for Kovalyov's removal, but the Itar-Tass

</P>

Kovalyov's replacement is Vladimir Putin, first deputy head of

<HEADLINE> Jordan Lauds PNA for Resuming Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian cabinet minister here
Saturday welcomed the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
decision to resume peace negotiations with Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"It is a wise decision reflecting the Palestinian leadership's
keenness to give peace a good opportunity to be fulfilled," said
Foreign Minister Jawad Anani in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has to respond to the Palestinians'
"constructive stand" and offer a positive stand to show its
desire for peace, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
Anani remarks came one day after PNA President Yasser Arafat
said the Palestinian-Israeli meetings "will resume on a systematic
basis next week."
</P>
<P>
Arafat reversed his earlier decision of suspending the talks
after meeting Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians resumed direct talks with Israel on Sunday,
but broke them off again on Wednesday after three meetings in
which they said no progress on the issue of Israeli redeployment
was made.
</P>
<P>
At stake is the U.S. proposal for Israeli withdrawal from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal, but Israel resisted it.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Reopens to Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourists returned Saturday to
the Capitol, which reopened less than 24 hours after a gunman
fatally shot two policemen and sent a wave of fear through the
building.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, hospitalized under heavy guard, was charged with
murder, but his motives remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
Russell E. Weston Jr., a 41-year-old loner from Rimini,
Montana, was listed in critical condition after undergoing a
second round of surgery for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with murdering a federal officer. An affidavit
filed in U.S. District Court said that when Weston was approached
just inside an entrance to the Capitol by officer Jacob J.
Chestnut, "Weston took out a handgun he had in his possession,
pointed it at Officer Chestnut's head and then fired it."
</P>
<P>
Moments later a second officer was fatally wounded in an
exchange of gunfire. Weston was downed and subdued.
</P>
<P>
Additional charges are pending.
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI affidavit, Weston had "additional
ammunition in his pockets."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Oriaifo at D.C. General Hospital said Weston suffered
multiple gunshot wounds and his chances of survival were "about
50-50."
</P>
<P>
Sergeant Dan Nichols, spokesman for the Capitol Police,
appealed for witnesses to the shooting to call and give their
accounts of what happened.
</P>
<P>
"We're still early into this investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the Secret Service investigated Weston, a former
mental patient, as "a low-level threat" to President Bill Clinton.
Investigators looked for clues to his motives at his cabin in
rural Montana.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Clinton described the Friday afternoon
shooting as "a moment of savagery at the front door of American
civilization."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich delivered the Republican weekly
radio address and asked Americans to join him in prayer.
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, people left flowers, and many approached police
officers to offer their sympathy.
</P>
<P>
Flags flew at half-staff, and police wore strips of black cloth
across their badges, in tribute to the slain officers.
</P>
<P>
The wounded tourist was released midday Saturday from George
Washington University Hospital, spokeswoman Lisa Saisselin said.
</P>
<P>
Plans already were under way to add the slain officers' names
to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial not far from the
Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Leaves for Meetings on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf left here Sunday for Rabat, capital of Morocco, to
attend meetings of al-Quds (Jerusalem), the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) said.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meetings of the al-Quds Committee of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) is slated for
Wednesday to discuss Israel's decision to expand the
administrative boundaries of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved in June 21 a plan to put a number
of Jewish settlements around Jerusalem under its jurisdiction,
seen by the Palestinians and Arabs as an attempt to annex parts of
the West Bank and judaizing the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is the most sensitive sticking point in the
Middle East peace process. Israel claims it as "undivided and
eternal capital" while the Palestinians want it as the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords singed by Israel and the Palestinians,
the fate of Jerusalem can only be determined in their final status
talks, and neither side should take unilateral action to prejudice
a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry source as saying that
ministerial meetings of the 55-member OIC were called for by King
Hassan II of Morocco, who is also chairman of the al-Quds
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will discuss Israel's illegal measures aimed at
judaizing the city and obliterating its Arab and Islamic identity,
according to INA.
</P>
<P>
The source said that on the sidelines of the meetings,
al-Sahhaf will meet with his counterparts from OIC member states
on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of
common concern.

JIUJIANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- There was large-scale crumbling
of dikes on Saicheng Lake on the western outskirts of the city of
Jiujiang in east China's Jiangxi Province today.
</P>
<P>
The crumbling of 100 meters of dikes directly threaten areas
around the lake and dikes on the Yangtze itself, half a km away,
according to the city's flood control headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At 8:00 pm today, the water level of the lake was 22.2 m,
compared with a record high of 21.7 m in 1995. Water levels on the
river have also broken records.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 citizens and armed police officers have been
sent to repair the dikes, but a local official says that the
safety of the lake can hardly be guaranteed if water levels
continue to rise.

<HEADLINE> Israel Said to Present "New Ideas" to Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said Sunday that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai had presented "new ideas" to advance the direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Palestinian leaders will meet later Sunday to
discuss these ideas, which he said the two sides had agreed to
keep secret for now, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat did not say when and how Mordechai presented the ideas,
but his remarks coincided with information from Mordechai's
office that the defense minister met Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Deputy Chairman Abu Mazen Saturday night and
agreed to resume direct talks.
</P>
<P>
The office said the two officials, who respectively led the
Israeli and the Palestinian teams in the negotiations, held
"personal meeting" in Jerusalem in a "good" atmosphere and
decided that they will personally monitor the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly agreed the negotiations between their
delegations will be held non-stop.
</P>
<P>
The high-level negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians, the first in months and held last Sunday, wounded up
Wednesday without any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians complained that the Israelis had not bring
any new proposals to the talks concerning the American initiative
calling on Israel to withdraw from an additional 13.1 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal, but Israel
has been resisting it.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed on Friday to resume the talks
with Israel this week.

<HEADLINE> Nemtsov Says He Knows Nothing About Government Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov said Sunday that he "knows nothing of the details" of a
possible cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"I was told nothing about it during the trip to Kaliningrad:
either they do not want to make me sad or they do not want to make
me glad," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying at a
press conference in Kaliningrad.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov's remarks came one day after President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko discussed "personnel matters"
in Shuiskaya Chupa, northwestern Russia, where the president is
recessing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident one should not fuss on the edge of a precipice,"
Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
"To change anyone in the government 100 days after its
formation means either the lack of knowledge of the country's
standing or bowing to the political situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Probably, it is somebody's wish to get rid of some people on
the quiet. Those wishing to start a leap-frog by changing one
minister with another simply do not want the governmental
anti-crisis program to be fulfilled," Nemtsov said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: SAARC Summit Crucial to S. Asia Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The three days starting from
next Wednesday are crucial for South Asia as the SAARC leaders
converge in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka to review the past and
look into the future and meet bilaterally to iron out, among
others, the problems arising from the nuclear explosions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This will make the 10th summit of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in the limelight in other parts
of the world as well, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The past 13 years have made Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka become an organic whole,
although not without spots.
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting in December 1985 in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
leaders of the seven countries noted that bound as their countries
were by many common values rooted in their social, ethnic,
cultural and historical traditions, regional cooperation provided
a logical response to problems such as poverty, underdevelopment,
low levels of production, unemployment and pressure of population.
</P>
<P>
Since then, cooperation has been extended to a number of areas
including agriculture, poverty alleviation, economic development
and trade, communications, education, culture and sports,
environment and meteorology, health, population activities and
child welfare, prevention of drug trafficking and abuse, rural
development, science and technology, tourism, transport and women
in development.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) went into operation, under which two rounds of trade
negotiations offered over 2,000 items of products for preferential
treatment in the member states.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is now under way toward the removal of
non-tariff barriers and structural impediments, wider and deeper
tariff cuts and the expansion of the lists of products for
intra-region preferential trade so as to realize a South Asian
Free Trade Area (SAFTA) preferably by the 2001 as envisaged by the
leaders in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, progress has been made in other areas such as
agriculture, health, telecommunications and rural development.
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted that 13 years of cooperation has not
brought about the expected changes in the region which houses
one-fifth of the humanity.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, underdevelopment, low levels of production,
unemployment and population pressure are still plaguing the
region.
</P>
<P>
It shares a meager one percent in the global trade and the
intra-regional trade accounts for only about 3 percent of the
region's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
But on the pace of cooperation, particularly in the area of
trade and economic development, member countries have different
ideas.
</P>
<P>
The main concern of India, the region's giant, is to further
trade and business links within SAARC, while Pakistan, the
region's another power, wants the cooperation to move in a
measured and deliberate way.
</P>
<P>
For Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal, the region's
four least developed countries, faster and better cooperation is
their choice. Under SAPTA, they enjoy exclusively special and more
favorable treatment and additional measures.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, which proposed to establish SAPTA and has one of the
lowest non-tariff barriers in the region, has been pushing for a
progressive reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers in the
run-up to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
How to evaluate the past achievements and chart the future
course for SAARC is a concern of the leaders as well. At their
last summit in May 1997, they directed that a Group of Eminent
Persons be set up to do the job.
</P>
<P>
At the Colombo summit, they are expected to focus their
attention on the report submitted by the group and make their own
decisions on how to best take the grouping into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The summit comes after India and Pakistan conducted rival
nuclear explosions in May, which raised fear of a nuclear arms
race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif are scheduled to discuss the nuclear
tests and the long-standing issue of Kashmir on the sidelines of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAARC Charter rules out deliberations on
contentious bilateral issues at any grouping meetings.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that their first face-to-face contact after the
nuclear tests would help assuage the concerns of their partners in
the region and revive bilateral talks that deadlocked since last
September.
</P>
<P>
Though South Asia is faced with disputes and mutual distrust
between other countries, those between India and Pakistan, the
region's two powers, are the main obstacles to more substantial
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But regional cooperation is a rising trend in the world today.
And for South Asia, one of the poorest regions in the world, its
future all the more lies with the collective efforts as stressed
by its leaders.
</P>
<P>
In consequence, the 10th summit will decide SAARC's performance
in the new millennium and whether it can catch up with its
counterparts in other parts of the world as the meeting serves as
a link between the past and the future.

NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Guinea Bissau's Government and
rebels have agreed on a cease-fire and talks for a last peace,
reports reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The accord would be signed by representatives of the
government of President Joao "Nino" Vieira and the rebels aboard
the Portuguese naval frigate Corte-Real later Sunday, Portuguese
News Agency was quoted as saying in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Tsf radio said the accord called for formal negotiations on a
permanent peace to be opened within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The reported deal followed the intervention of a mediation

the former colonial power Portugal, which has been in Bissau
since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny against Vieira, whose government is being backed by
troops from neighboring Senegal and Guinea, broke out on June 7,
one day after former armed forces' commander Ansumane Mane was
sacked for being involved in smuggling arms to Senegalese rebels.

<P>
URUMQI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and one
person was reported missing when a boat overturned on Bosten Lake
in the central part of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region on July 19, according to a report that only reached here
today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy winds caused the boat to capsize, according to the
report, but it goes on to say that there seem to have been some
irregularities. The boat belonged to the local government
department that handles navigation on the lake, but the passengers
were a group of visitors from the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous
Prefecture in the western part of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The group was accompanied by a government employee in charge of
toll collections on Kizilsu's highways.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, a boat of this kind was not to be
used for leisure activities like sightseer cruises. And, what is
more, it was overloaded at the time of the mishap, something that
may have been a major cause of the accident.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Worsens in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation has worsened in
Bangladesh as the water levels of most rivers are kept rising
above the danger levels, officials in the Flood Information Center
said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to aggravate further in the northern
districts and in the central part of the country, but will improve
in the southeastern hill basin in the next 24 hours, they said.
</P>
<P>
Official death toll from flood was 73, but press reports here
put the number at more than 140, with over 10 million people
affected in 35 out of the country's 64 districts since the monsoon
season began early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Management and Relief Ministry on Sunday allocated
600 tons of rice and about 1 million taka (about 21,277 U.S.
dollars) in cash for distribution among the flood victims,
ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has so far granted more than 6.4 million taka
(about 136,170 U.S. dollars) in cash and 4,100 tons of foodgrains
for the flood-hit people.
</P>
<P>
As 70-80 percent of the country's annual rainfall concentrates
in the monsoon season between July and October, flood is very
common in Bangladesh, considering its particular geographical
features, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Presidents End Lengthy Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad entered a
four-hour lengthy discussion over lunch at this Mediterranean port
city Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents dwelted upon a wide range of topics from the
stalled Middle East peace process, to the American role of
sponsorship and initiative for further Israeli withdrawal, and to
the European effort to push the peace wheel forward.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks at Mubarak's Ras-El-Teen Palace, Assad's
spokesman Nabil Osman told Xinhua that they would focus on the
idea to hold an international conference on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents gave a brief, three-minute press conference
after their talks, whose details were not available.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said "We can not assume the American-sponsored peace
process has been neglected or canceled, neither can we assume the
U.S. initiative (on Israeli redeployment) has failed."
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is to activate the European role, along with
the American role," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between Assad and Mubarak in four
months, and Mubarak said they meet on regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Assad told reporters that the Egyptian-French overture for an
international conference on the peace process "is still on the
table under examination." He showed no sign of endorsing it or
rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
The overture was jointly put forward by Mubarak and French
President Jacques Chirac in May, in order to give all parties
concerned an opportunity to discuss relaunching the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Assad, accompanied by Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, arrived here earlier Sunday. He
has left for home after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Syria has refused to resume talks with Israel unless Israel
agrees to return the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast
War, a term reportedly promised by Israel's late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.

<HEADLINE> High Turn-out in Cambodia's Trouble-Free Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodians defied fears of
violence and turned out to vote in large numbers Sunday in a
largely trouble-free general election.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) said the
election proceeded "in a peaceful and smooth way" except for some
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
A large turnout had been seen in the polling which started at
7:00 a.m. (local time), and by 16:00 p.m. most stations had been
closed, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The NEC estimated that by 11:00 a.m., most of the 5.4 million
registered voters had cast their ballots with high turn-out rates
between 80 to 90 percent in different areas.
</P>
<P>
A final estimation will be given later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a NEC spokesman said a government position was
attacked by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Anlong Veng Province near
the border with Thailand shortly before the polling.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing fighting left 10 people dead, including one
guerrilla, two government soldiers and seven civilians. Two other
guerrillas were captured, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said there was no clear evidence that the
attack was intended to hamper the election, and polling went on
undisturbed in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, the second prime minister, said after casting his
ballot that the peaceful election was a victory for the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful election was "a victory for the Cambodian people,
the royal government and the international community which has
offered moral and material support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, also the vice-president of the ruling Cambodian
People's Party, was locked in a fierce competition with Prince
Norodom Nanariddh of the Funcinpec party and Sam Rainsy of the Sam
Rainsy Party for seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A new government will be formed according to the seats obtained
by the parties.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian people expect a government that will lead to
lasting peace and economic development in the war-ridden country.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will seek India's help for
repatriating Bhutanese refugees who came to Nepal eight years ago,
Sri Lankan official radio reported Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will raise the
issue to Bhutan during the South Asian association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) summit scheduled to be held on July 29-31 in
Colombo, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Koirala will ask for help repatriating 100,000 Bhutanese
refugees who fled their Homeland in 1990 to escape harsh cultural
reforms, it said.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan on the issue
have failed to agree on the repatriation terms.
</P>
<P>
With increased strain on its economy, Nepal wants all the
Bhutanese refugees to go home. But Bhutan insists that those who
left "voluntarily" cannot return, saying it will only take back
those who were forcefully evicted, the radio added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Turns Down Reports on Compromise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel has not given up its
demand that the Palestinian National Council (PNC) revise the
Palestinian Charter before an Israeli redeployment in the West
Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks, which Israel Radio said was made by Netanyahu
during a weekly cabinet meeting, contradicted reports that in the
newly-resumed talks with the Palestinians Israel would make a key
compromise concerning the revision of the Palestinian Charter.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Israel, which has demanded
the 460-member NPC to convene and reaffirm the deletion of
sections in the Charter that call for the destruction of Israel,
would now agree to a ratification of the revision by the smaller
100-member Palestinian Liberation Organization's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Israel is prepared to back down from
its position in a hope that the Palestinians would agree to its
proposals that some part of the 13.1 percent of the West Bank due
to be handed over to the Palestinians under an American initiative
be designated as a "nature reserve," over which the Palestinians
will have limited jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the so-called "nature reserve" was said to be one
of the major disputes between the two sides which stalled their
talks just resumed last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting Netanyahu also called on his ministers
to refrain from meeting with the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) without coordinating him or Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who led the Israeli delegation in the talks.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a series of visits by several
senior Israeli officials, including Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani, to the PNA in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held a 90-minute meeting with Kahalani in Ramallah last
Friday, during which he agreed to hold another round of direct
negotiations with Israel and decided that Kahalani will hold
several meetings with his deputy, Abu Mazen, this week.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani has said that his meetings with Abu Mazen will focus
on daily affairs, not the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the PNA gave a warm welcome Thursday to Netanyahu's
coalition chairman, Meir Sheetrit, who said he had proposed some
"new ideas" during his talks with Arafat. The Palestinian leader
promised that he would consider them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Sheetrit said Netanyahu was well aware of his ideas, which
called for a summit between the Israeli prime minister and
Arafat, but Netanyahu said at Sunday's cabinet meeting that he
was "not happy" about Sheetrit's visit but he had not wanted to
cancel it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu said at the meeting he expected the
high-level Israeli-Palestinian talks, which ended last Wednesday
with no breakthrough, to be renewed "in the coming days."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Strike Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The ground crew union of the
Philippine Airlines (PAL) ended its five-day strike after signing
an agreement with the management on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was reached after nearly 15 hours of non-stop, all
night negotiations between the airlines' management and the
striking PAL Employees Association and a series of marathon talks
since the airlines' ground crew struck on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the pact, which was reached in the interest
of industrial peace and harmony, both parties recognized the need
to pursue measures to "rightsize" PAL's workforce.
</P>
<P>
Both parties agreed to reduce the airline's workforce by 1,800
employees, all the association members, who will be encouraged to
voluntarily avail of the rightsizing program.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada Sunday welcomed the speedy resolution
of the work stoppage in PAL and expressed the hope that the
management and labor would join hands in putting PAL's economic
house back in order.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came after Estrada himself had been actively
involved in the settlement of the PAL dispute by holding separate
meetings with both the management and the labor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the resolution of the labor dispute was good news
not only to the management and employees but more so to the
economy and he expected PAL operations which have been scaled down
due to the strike to be back to normal.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven Sri Lankan refugees,
including 15 women and 5 children, were feared drowned early
Sunday when their boat capsized along the Rameswaram coast in
south India, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The boat carrying 52 people from Pudukudiyiruppu in Northern
Sri Lanka had sunk at the confluence of Bay of Bengal and Indian
Ocean, about 10 nautical miles from Tamil Nadu coast of India, PTI
said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, which had avoided the normal route to escape
detection by Sri Lanka Navy and India Coast Guard, had gone
further off course and got trapped in a swirl in the rough sea
amid gusty wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
Five people swam to safety and reached Rameswaram, a coastal
city in Tamil Nadu, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Coast Guard and Sri Lanka Navy personnel have launched
search operations for the missing refugees, but chances of finding
survivors were bleak due to rough sea conditions, PTI quoted
officials sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survivors stated that the boatmen had entered into the sea
despite warning by local fishermen against it in view of
unfavorable weather.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened two hours after the refugees had left on
their clandestine voyage from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of any immediate help was also ruled out in
view of the unusual route taken by the boat, said the officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Cambodian opposition leader
noted with relief on Sunday that the parliamentary elections
proceeded smoothly without "political violence."
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly relieved that as of the closing of the polls at
4:00 p.m. (local time), we have received no reports of political
violence during the polling," said Sam Rainsy, the leader of the
opposition Khmer Nation Party.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, turnout appears to have been very high, at least in
Phnom Penh," he continued in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the Joint International Observer Group
and other nations should not leap to any quick conclusions and
should not certify the election in any way until they have
completed a comprehensive evaluation of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) said
the elections were conducted "in a peaceful and smooth way" except
for some technical problems.
</P>
<P>
The NEC reported a large turnout for the polling that started
at 7:00 a.m. and ended at 16:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the elections, there had been reports about
intimidation, violence and killings designed to frighten away
voters, giving rise to speculation that the elections would be
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Cambodian People's Party led by incumbent
co-premier Hun Sen and the FUNCINPEC party under Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy's party is a major contender for seats of
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A new government will be formed according to the seats obtained
by the parties in the elections.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Rebel Leader Sent Home for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebel leader Foday
Sankoh, detained in Nigeria for more than one year, was flown
back Saturday to his home country to face treason charges, the
Post Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who led the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel
movement in Sierra Leone, was flown back to the capital Freetown
alongside three Russian pilots arrested with him.
</P>
<P>
The RUF leader was arrested and put into house arrest in March
1996 when he arrived in Nigeria ostensibly on a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Following his arrest, a division arose within the RUF ranks on
whether to continue or abandon the rebellion the armed group
launched since early 1990s against successive governments.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was appointed the second person of Sierra Leone by
Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who led the May 25, 1997 military coup
to overthrow the legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 RUF combatants became allied to the junta forces
following the second day of the coup.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Sankoh, some 40 soldiers of the former Sierra
Leonean armed forces are already on trial for treason in
connection with their role in the coup last year.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta and allied RUF rebels are still
holding parts of minerals-rich areas in the east and north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led west African peace-keeping force, which
restored Kabbah's government in March this year, is stepping up
its mopping-up exercise for an early removal of the forces.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Earns More from Coffee Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A sum of 410.8 million U.S.
Dollars has been earned from coffee export during the just-ended
1997/98 fiscal year, according to the Coffee and Tea Authority of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The earnings in the fiscal year from July 8, 1997 to July 7,
1998 had risen by 15 percent and 47 percent against the fiscal
years of 1996/97 and 1995/96 respectively, Tsegaye Berhane,
General Manager of the authority, said recently.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald newspaper Sunday quoted Berhane as saying
that the authority had an initial plan of earning 436.6 million
U.S. Dollars by exporting 160,000 tons of coffee during the
fiscal year, but it only achieved 94 percent of the target.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of major coffee producers and exporters in
Africa. It produces about 300,000 tons of coffee yearly and
coffee generates 60 percent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings every year. The private sector now exports 84 percent of
coffee annually.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the Ethio-Eritrean border dispute on May
6 this year, the authority has opened a branch office in Djibouti
to treat the export of coffee.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Missile Deterrent Is Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani stated on Sunday that Iran's newly acquired missile
capability is not against the regional countries, but a
deterrent against Israel's expansionist policy.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Tehran radio, Shamkhani said
that Iran and the regional Muslim countries have no ambition
about each other, adding that "our might belongs to them and
their might belongs to us."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the world's negative reaction to Iran's
Wednesday missile test, reiterating that Iran's policy was and is
to reduce tensions and to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the objective of the propaganda by
foreign powers and Israel against Iran's defense policy is to
justify their presence in the region and to justify Israel's
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Israel has emerged as an arsenal and a depot which is
truly explosive and has all types of weaponry," he said, but the
world propaganda shows no sensitivity to this fact.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani on Saturday confirmed that Iran has "successfully"
tested a missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers by Iranian
experts and "without any assistance from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
His confirmation aroused worldwide criticism about Iran's
policy on military capacities.
</P>
<P>
The United States on Thursday expressed concern after it
detected Iran's test of the Shahab-3 or Meteor-3 missile, which
meant that Iran could target Israel and Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally
in Gulf, and the U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani stressed that the missile test was aimed at
promoting its deterrent capability and its investments on some
defense needs was to maintain peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio in a commentary on Sunday attacked the allegation
that Iran's missile capability would pose a serious threat to the
regional countries, saying that Iran is after a collective defense
system with Muslim countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the conservative daily Tehran Times said that
Iran's access to intermediate missile will "definitively boost
the collective defense power of Muslim countries against their
common enemy (Israel)."
</P>
<P>
The moderate daily Iran News said in an editorial that
"Iran's relations with neighboring countries are so warm that
these countries are not concerned with Iranian missiles, rather
they consider it as a weapon to defend their interests,
too."

<HEADLINE> economic Growth, Poverty Eradication Urgent Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Sunday that the most pressing tasks
before the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) are to accelerate economic growth and eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Koirala said that with the entry
into force of the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA)
in December 1995, economic cooperation has gained momentum in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident that a successful conclusion of the SAPTA
negotiations will enhance the scope of trade and investment in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "sustained economic growth is the only way to
lead South Asia out of poverty."
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations have been completed under
SAPTA, offering over 2,000 items of products for preferential
treatment in the seven member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, exclusive, special and more favorable
treatment and additional measures have been offered to Bangladesh,
Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal, the four least developed countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is now under way toward the removal of
non-tariff barriers and structural impediments, more tariff
concessions and the expansion of lists of products for
preferential trade in the region so that the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) could be preferably obtained by the 2001 as
envisaged by the SAARC leaders in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the tenth SAARC summit will concentrate on
further strengthening economic cooperation among member states
with special consideration for the needs and problems of the least
developed member states," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The main focus of the GEP recommendations is also on an
accelerated economic cooperation," he said. "The Colombo summit
will examine the report in detail," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eminent Persons (GEP) was commissioned last year
as directed by the leaders to make a comprehensive review of SAARC
and map out the future strategy for the regional grouping formed
in December 1985. The 10th SAARC summit is scheduled for July
29-31.
</P>
<P>
On the achievements of SAARC in the past 13 years, the prime
minister said that "the first decade of SAARC was essentially the
formative stage in which it was an essential exercise to create an
atmosphere of trust and confidence between member states."
</P>
<P>
"As South Asia is endowed with abundant natural as well as human
resources, we have to utilize our resource endowment for the
development of South Asia through cooperative programs focused on
the core areas of economy and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
To promote rapid economic development, Nepal initiated in
December 1996 the concept of Growth Quadrangle comprising
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal with a view to jointly
developing the eastern Himalayan rivers.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of the four countries met here on July 17
this year for the second time to consider the working modalities
of the Growth Quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
"Participating states have already identified broad areas of
cooperation under this venture," he added.
</P>
<P>
At their last summit in May 1997, SAARC leaders encouraged the
development of specific projects relevant to the specific
individual needs of three or more member countries.

<P>
BONN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
has said that the European Union (EU) wants to show "a higher
profile" in seeking a peaceful solution to the escalating conflict
in Yugoslavia's Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German Sunday newspaper Bilding am
Sonntag, Kinkel said that EU envoys from Britain, Austria and
Germany, the so-called troika holding the last, current and next
presidency of the EU, would travel to Belgrade and Kosovo next
Tuesday in a new effort to try to end the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that he and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine
had worked out detailed proposals for direct negotiations between
the Kosovo conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
"It is already at the eleventh hour and both sides are
balancing on the brink of an abyss," said Kinkel in describing the
current situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that it might eventually be
inevitable to impose coercive measures in line with Capital VII of
the United Nations Charter to achieve peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that a NATO military intervention remains the
last resort, Kinkel reiterated that such a move would require a
U.N. mandate which had been impossible due to the opposition from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also said in the interview that the German authorities
were examining ways to prevent armed Kosovo rebels from using
funds raised from Kosovo-Albanians living in Germany to purchase
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Arrives in Egypt for Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad arrived in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria Sunday
morning to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and discuss how
to revive the long-stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the arrival, the two presidents held talks at Mubarak's
Ras-El-Teen Palace, focusing on the idea to hold an international
conference on the peace process, Assad's spokesman Nabil Osman
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The idea was jointly put forward by the French and Egyptian
presidents in May to give all parties concerned an opportunity to
discuss relaunching the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Assad is accompanied by Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa during his hours' visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between Assad and Mubarak in four
months.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day state visit to France on July 16-18,
Al-Assad held talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on Mideast peace, including the proposed
conference.
</P>
<P>
Assad has neither rejected nor explicitly accepted the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The idea is not the only option for reviving the peace process,
there are also other proposals, Osman said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Syria has refused to resume talks with Israel unless it returns
the occupied Golan Heights to Syria, a term reportedly promised by
Israel's former Labor government led by assassinated Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

<HEADLINE> Cambodians Vote for Peace, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodians thronged to polling
stations across the country early Sunday to elect a new National
Assembly that is expected to lead the country to peace and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, people were seen waiting in queues outside
polling stations long before the voting began at 7:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the winner will be able to represent the will of the
people. All Cambodians like me want peace, so we would vote for
whichever party can bring about peace to this country," said a
68-year-old street vendor who identified himself only as Jinsong.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for us to make our own
choices. Nobody forces us to come here. We all want to choose what
we like the most," said Jinsong, who had arrived hours before the
polling started.
</P>
<P>
The old man told reporters that all his seven family members
had come to vote, but for different candidates.
</P>
<P>
The election pitted Hun Sen, incumbent co-premier and
vice-president of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), against
Prince Norodom Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of the Sam
Rainsy Party.
</P>
<P>
The three politicians are the major contenders for political
power in the country torn by decades of war.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six other small parties are also scrambling for the 122
seats at the National Assembly. A party needs a two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe that not a single party would be able
to win the required majority and therefore the next government
would likely be a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at polling stations has been peaceful, with no
reports of violence so far. Voters quietly entered makeshift
cabins one by one to cast their secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, whose party carries much weight in the country's
politics, cast his ballot at Tkhmau polling station, seven
kilometers south of Phnom Penh. He was accompanied by his wife,
followed by a few bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
He said the election turned out to be peaceful contrary to
previous predictions, which is a clear indication of victory for
the Cambodian people, the royal government and the international
community which offered moral and material support.
</P>
<P>
"For countries like Cambodia which faces chaos, it is not easy
to organize elections in a peaceful way," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was the first organized by the Cambodians
themselves in almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen compared the election to that in 1993 when tanks and
armored vehicles were seen deployed at polling stations, and said,
"Today you can see no tanks, no armored vehicles, no arms. Even my
bodyguards are bare-handed."
</P>
<P>
The 1993 election, organized by the United Nations, resulted in
the formation of a coalition government led by first-premier
Norodom Ranariddh and co-premier Hun Sen. Ranariddh was ousted in
July last year.
</P>
<P>
Hun said he believed the election would be "free, fair and
without violence."
</P>
<P>
About 700 international and 40,000 local observers are
monitoring the polling across the country.
</P>
<P>
Chheng Phon, chairman of the Cambodian National Election
Committee, told Xinhua that Cambodians have shown great enthusiasm
for the election which they believe would usher in a new era of
peace and development in the impoverished country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Security Tight for SAARC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Security is getting extremely
tight with the 10th summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) drawing near in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have taken maximum possible security measures
for the SAARC sessions to be held here from July 29 to 31, police
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 police personnel will be deployed in Colombo apart
from the security forces. In addition, 50 sniffer dogs will also
be on "duty".
</P>
<P>
About 25 ships and gunboats have been stationed along the coast
of Colombo, a city with 600,000 population, to guard against any
possible rebel attack.
</P>
<P>
Colombo and the routes taken by the heads of state or
government from the seven SAARC member countries have been
declared as high security zone during this period.
</P>
<P>
"Be very strict about strangers, avoid entertaining or giving
employment to outsiders during the period of SAARC sessions,"
Colombo police chief Jagath Jayawardena appealed to the public.
</P>
<P>
Jayawardena asked the residents in Colombo to be extra careful
in the interests of their own safety. Those who are unable to
prove their identities will be taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
He said residents should not allow vehicles of outsiders
including motorcycles, carts and ice cream vans to be parked in
their compounds or outside the houses.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel at roadblocks have been ordered to do a full
search of the vehicles and the passengers.
</P>
<P>
"The security is very tight, I don't think there will be any
chance for the Tamil rebels," said a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting
with Sri Lanka government forces for an independent Tamil state
since 1983. About 55,000 people were killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Three school students were injured recently as a policeman
opened fire at their van, which failed to stop for a check-up at a
police check post.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, a bomb explosion occurred at the World
Trade Center in Colombo, killing thirteen people, including seven
Tamil suicide fighters.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming SAARC summit will focus on regional economic
cooperation, terrorism and drug trafficking, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state or government of the member countries will
arrive in Colombo on July 28.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Justifies Iran Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan has said that Iran has the right to take steps for
strengthening its defense.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks to the reporters when
asked for comments on the news that Iran has tested a missile,
which has a potential range of 800 miles (1,300 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
"Every one knows that the highly advanced Iranian missile
program had been in progress for some time," Gohar said, adding
that "Iran has the right to do so."
</P>
<P>
Iran confirmed Saturday that it has successfully tested a
long-range missile "Shahab 3" that it developed without foreign
help. But Israel has accused Russia of providing equipment and
know-how to the Iranian missile program.
</P>
<P>
Questioned as to why major powers oppose moves by small
countries, especially Islamic states, to strengthen their defense,
Gohar said that it is because of misgiving within the western
world "as some people in the west are sowing seed on mistrust."

<HEADLINE> 200 People Injured in Philippine City's Power Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 people were injured
Sunday when armed policemen tried to disperse supporters of a
deposed mayor who have put up picket lines and barricades for
weeks in Subic Bay Free Port, some 80 kilometers northeast of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that 20 policemen were also injured when a
group of anti-riot policemen, armed with rifles, used tear gas in
dispersing the die-hard supporters of former Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) Chairman Dick Gordon.
</P>
<P>
Gordon, whose term as SBMA chief expired in May this year, was
reappointed for one more term by former president Fidel Ramos in
exchange for his withdrawal from the May 1998 presidential race.
But he was fired by Ramos' successor, President Joseph Estrada,
shortly after Estrada assumed office last month.
</P>
<P>
Police said Gordon's supporters attacked the policemen by
throwing stones and tried to repel advancing cops with knives and
improvised weapons.
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of people were seriously wounded, including a
policeman stabbed in the belly. They were rushed to nearby
hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
But Gordon's loyalists still controlled the building where
Gordon has digged in after he refused to relinquish his post to
the new SBMA chief appointed by Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Gordon was able to get a regional trial court's 22-day
temporary restraining order which allowed him to continue in
office pending the settlement of the legal question regarding
validity of his re-appointment by Ramos.
</P>
<P>
But the order was nullified by a court in the northern city of
Olongapo where Subic Port is located. Gordon appealed the decision
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the power row in the free port is
expected to damage its reputation as the country's largest
economic zone, formerly a major U.S. air base.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Named S. Leone's Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian army officer who toppled
the military junta in Freetown in mid February this year, has
been appointed Sierra Loene's chief of army staff and minister of
internal affairs by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
General Brig.-Gen. Maxwell Khobe was the head of Nigeria's
internal security until his appointment, the newspaper This Day
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the cabinet, Khobe would advise Kabbah's
government on the structure, composition and size of the new
army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier he had been task force commander of the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone. Operating under the
code name Operation Sandstorm, the force captured the Sierra
Leonean capital Freetown from the junta led by Major Johnny Paul
Koroma who seized power in a coup in May last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Khobe's new position will come in
handy in President Kabbah's resolve to try some captured soldiers
of the deposed junta.
</P>
<P>
Following the new posting, the director of operation at the
Nigerian army headquarters, Brig.-Gen. Abu Amodu has become the
second Nigerian officer to command to ECOMOG task force in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The task force was set up about 10 months ago to dislodge
Koroma and his allied rebels from power and from the hinterlands
especially the minerals rich areas of Kailahon in the east where
the remnants of the junta is still holding.

<HEADLINE> Iranian New Minister Wants More Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Musavi Lari is going to request the supreme leader to
appoint him as the acting commander of the security forces in a
bid to promote the status of law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
The leading English-language daily Tehran Times Sunday quoted
an informed source close to the minister as saying that Lari had
expressed his view during a closed-door meeting with Majlis
(Parliament) deputies before the Majlis gave a vote of confidence
on him on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the interior ministry and the security
forces were strained after the government of the moderate cleric
President Mohammad Khatami came to power last August. The supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei did not appoint former Interior
Minister Abdollah Nouri as the acting commander of the forces as
usual.
</P>
<P>
Some moderate groups even blast the security forces for
cooperating with hard-liners to violently attack legal
demonstrations and rallies organized by the moderates.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's constitution, the supreme leader is the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, including the army, the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the security forces.
</P>
<P>
In the past, upon the request of the interior minister, the
leader normally appointed him as the acting commander of the
security forces, Tehran Times said, but Nouri was not appointed
because he did not request during his 10-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
Nouri and his supporters have complained that the interior
ministry could not guarantee law and order because the security
forces were not under his command, while his conservative
opponents argued he lacked the ability to maintain law and order.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was impeached and sacked on June 21 by the
conservative-dominated Majlis.
</P>
<P>
After Lari gained a vote of confidence from the Majlis to
succeed Nouri, moderate newspapers demanded the security forces
to come under the command of the interior ministry in order to
prevent any disorder in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, the interior ministry is
responsible for law and order in the country and security at the
borders. It issues permission for demonstrations, rallies and
activities of political parties and organizations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Union Wants Talks with Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has called for an urgent meeting with President
Robert Mugabe within the next two weeks to resolve its demands
for the scrapping of various taxes.
</P>
<P>
The ending of the five-day national strike will depend on the
outcome of the meeting, the ZCTU said in a communique released
after its general council meeting in Mutare of east Zimbabwe
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has demanded immediate removal of last December's 2.5
percent increase on sales tax, the five percent development levy
and the 15 percent tax on pension fund profits.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government recently agreed to scrap the sales
tax in the next fiscal year, but the development levy is to
remain as it was essentially for rural development. The tax on
pensions is also to remain.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's response to the demands, ZCTU
President Gibson Sibanda said that "in its assessment, the ZCTU
regards the response as disappointing and inadequate to meet the
expectations of workers."
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said that the government had missed a historical
opportunity to take visible steps to create an environment for
further negotiations over long-term sustainable solutions to the
economic crisis, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government had failed to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said President Mugabe
had dismissed all "intermediate structures" in the country, which
included parliament and cabinet ministers. These structures had
become ineffective and President Mugabe was directly in command.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the ZCTU organized a countrywide work
boycott which paralyzed the country's economy, resulting in loss
of business amounting to million of Dollars.

JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Ministry has launched an intensive campaign
to allay the potential damage to relations with the Arab States
that could ensue from the Islamic conference on Jerusalem, due to
open in Morocco on Wednesday. A senior Israeli official said that
one of the most disturbing consequences of the conference could be
a call for a halt to normalization of relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Cronies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
expressed concern Saturday night that an ambush could be waiting
them in the Knesset (parliament) on Sunday in the form of a
no-confidence vote that could bring down the government. They
said that collaboration between Opposition and some "extremist
members" of the governing coalition could form a majority of 61 in
the 120-seat Knesset to bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani will
demand that Netanyahu designate him to be member of the Israeli
negotiation group with the Palestinians on the second redeployment
of the Israeli troops in the West Bank. Kahalani wanted to "save
the peace process" with his influence.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Approves Investment Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar approved a total
of 22 investment projects worth 4 billion U.S. Dollars in the
1997/98 financial year, bringing the total number of investment
projects to more than 220 since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Finance of Zanzibar Amina Salim Ali told the
Isles House of Representatives which is in budget session that
the number of projects approved by the Zanzibar Investment
Promotion Agency (ZIPA) increased compared with 13 projects in
1996/97 fiscal year, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the foundation in 1992, the ZIPA has
approved more than 220 investment projects which have provided
7,000 jobs and contributed a huge part to the Gross National
Product.
</P>
<P>
"The government has during 1997/98 financial year realized
handsome collection of revenue from investment projects in terms
of license fees, hotel levy, stamp duty and other taxes charged
on the projects," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most of the projects are focused on tourism
sector, sea and air transportation and industrial sector while 10
projects were revoked licenses last year for failure to comply
with the investment conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to thrust infrastructural
development to entice potential investors and exporters in the
Isles," Ali said.
</P>
<P>
The glut in the international clove market has forced Zanzibar
to seek for economic options to salvage the indian ocean islands
from further economic deterioration and living hardships.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.7 million people in
central China's Hunan province have plunged into the fight against
the floods, reinforcing dykes and dams where the floods will pass
through.
</P>
<P>
As the water level measured at the east and south parts of the
Dongting Lake and the Chenglingji section of the Yangtze River has
kept rising and is expected to exceed the record high, the
situation is extremely critical, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government authorities have organized relief
workers to the flooded areas to help the people there. The
People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police also joined
in the anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
Relief materials such as rubber boats and life buoys have been
shipped to the flood-hit areas and a group of rescue experts has
also been sent there by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Torrential flood water, resulting from continuous heavy rain in
the province since July 20, broke many dykes alongside the lake,
greatly affecting the industrial production and people's daily
life, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Many farming fields were inundated and lots of residential
houses were destroyed by the floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China underlined its superiority in the diving
pool Saturday by winning two more gold medals, while a Briton and an American
claimed triathlon titles on the seventh day of the 1998 Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
China's Cai Yuyan and Sang Xue outclassed the rest of the field to win the
women's synchronized platform with a total of 297.00 points from five dives,
ahead of Ukraine's Olena Zhupina and Svetlana Serbina, 261.78, and Ute Wetzig
and Anke Piper of Germany, 258.12.
</P>
<P>
Cai, 16, winner of the platform and a runner-up of the platform synchronized
event at this year's Worlds, joined force with the 14-year-old Sang to dominate
the final in a commanding style.
</P>
<P>
They built up a clear margin over their closest rivals after three rounds,
and registered the top two highest scores in the next two dives.
</P>
<P>
The German pair stood a good chance to overtake the Ukraine's duo before the
final outing, but their modest score of 48.60 was too poor to turn the table,
while Zhupina and Serbina got a solid score of 53.10 in the last round.
</P>
<P>
China's Yu Zhoucheng and Xu Hao also dived all the way to take the men's
3-meter synchronized springboard title with a total of 311.46 points, well
ahead of Russia's Alexei Ilyin and Dmitri Baibakov with almost 15 points to
spare.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mesch and Holger Schlepps of Germany, world championships
runners-up, wound up third.
</P>
<P>
The other gold offered today in the diving contest - the women's 3-meter
springboard final - produced some upset.
</P>
<P>
Irina Lashko of Russia, 1998 world champion in both the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard, looked set to add another gold to her 1-meter event title won on
Friday, but she made a big splash on her seventh dive and the poor performance
brought her only 35.10 points.
</P>
<P>
China's Zhang Jing, who teamed up with Guo Jingjing to win the synchronized
platform on Friday, seized the chance to move to second place behind Yuliya
Pakhalina of Russia.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese blew her opportunity on the next round by scoring only
36.12. Guo made a no show dive on her second action and faded to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
With all the big names committing errors, Pakhalina managed to put on a
series of smooth displays to win the gold. Lashko finished third behind
Australian Chantelle Michell.
</P>
<P>
In the triathlon competition, Britain's Simon Lessing defended his title
successfully in the men's section, recording the second-fastest splits in all
three disciplines (swimming, cycling and running). He clocked 20 minutes 34
second in swimming, 54:15 in cycling and 30:20 for a cross-country run.
</P>
<P>
The women's race was won by American Loretta Harrop, who turned in as the
second fastest swimmer and tied for the fastest bike leg.
</P>
<P>
In today's women's soccer semifinals, China beat Norway 4-2 in a penalty
shoot-out after tying 1-1 in 90 minutes, while the United States whitewashed
Denmark 5-0. China will challenge the American team tomorrow in an Olympic gold
medal rematch.
</P>
<P>
Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong saved her team by clearing out a penalty kick
after the two sides deadlocked in the regular time.
</P>
<P>
The American team led the first half 3-0 and went on to humiliate its rivals
in the lopsided game. Mia Hamm hit the target three times and made her career
goals to 95.
</P>
<P>
Saturday also featured wrestling, cycling and mixed pair gymnastics
competitions.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Off to Namibia for Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has gone to Namibia to attend a five-day conference on the Second
Southern Africa International Dialog on "Smart Partnership" (SAID
II).
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Mail newspaper, Mugabe left here
Saturday for the forum to be held in Swakopmund, a resort town on
Namibia's west coast.
</P>
<P>
Several heads of state from the 14 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member states, including South
African President Nelson Mandela and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Bin Mohamad attended the last conference.
</P>
<P>
Smart Partnership seeks to achieve economic success in the
region through cooperation between the private and public sector
and between different states in the region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia plays a crucial role in this international economic
program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported that the
leaders are also expected to discuss a growing conflict in Angola
where more than 200 people were killed last week.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that Angola is on the brink of a renewed war
after the opposition movement of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) failed to implement peace accords
signed in Lusaka in 1994, ending two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has since imposed trade and financial
sanctions on UNITA to try to force it into compliance.

<HEADLINE> "Ugly Ducklings" Take Zookeepers For Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Two 10-day-old "ugly ducklings" at
the zoo in Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, do not yet known they will someday become elegant black
swans. That's because they were artificially hatched and have not
met their real parents.
</P>
<P>
The two little grey creatures, weighing about 200 grams, are
only happy when they see Zhang Ping, the zookeeper who bring them
worms, minced fish, and fruits or vegetables every two hours.
</P>
<P>
"Their real parents failed to hatch eggs last year, so we took
seven eggs they laid last month and put them into incubators,"
said Zhang, "Then, 36 days later, two baby swans were born, but
five others died for various reasons."
</P>
<P>
Black swans usually lay five to seven eggs a year. However,
the parents of these two babies laid another six eggs recently,
and their father is guarding their nest these days.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said they will give the swan parents another chance to
hatch their babies on their own.
</P>
<P>
At present, seven grown black swans are living at the zoo.
This was the first time the zoo hatched black swans artificially.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Umeed-e-Noor", A Home Brimming with Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The 14-year-old Mustafa, who had
been bed-ridden since he was born, made the first step in his life
recently at a special school called "Umeed-e-Noor" (ray of hope).
</P>
<P>
Mustafa is one of the 26 children from age three to 16 with
mental and physical retardation, living at "Umeed-e-Noor", a home
away from home, which has been in existence for nine years.
</P>
<P>
"Umeed-d-Noor" is a non-profit organization funded by
individuals committed to work for the benefit of physically and
mentally handicapped children in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Tucked away in a quiet area covered with greenness in this
capital city, "Umeed-e-Noor" as a special school is offering its
unique services to those mentally and physically disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the children at `Umeed-e-Noor' are abandoned or
orphaned. They are unable to perform simple daily tasks. It is sad
that these children could not enjoy the basic pleasure of life,"
said Noori Hashwani, chairperson of the special school.
</P>
<P>
It is with a wish to create a greater awareness about the
plight of these children and to give them a better tomorrow, this
special school was established, Hashwani said.
</P>
<P>
"There is not much awareness about handicapped children in our
society, and due to lack of education, they are rejected,
ill-treated and shut away, even in their own homes," the
heavyhearted Hashwani said.
</P>
<P>
"Umeed-e-Noor" in its earlier stage was only a family-styled
place to keep a few handicapped children. However, after many
years of hard endeavor, it has become a multi-functioned school.
</P>
<P>
"In a short span of time, we have been able to help a number of
special children. With our round the clock facilities and caring
staff members, these children have found a home away from home,"
Hashwani said.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, "Umeed-e-Noor" has been expanded and
has been able to recruit more of those handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
It is being run by a group of professional teachers, trainers
as well as volunteers from non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
At this special school, under the same roof, these special
children are given treatment, education, speech and physical
therapy.
</P>
<P>
Hashwani, who is keen to take in more children than already
there, said that taking care of special children is "a great
challenge".
</P>
<P>
Looking after special children at home would be a very tough
job on the family. "We are keen to grow and provide more
facilities and open up branches in other cities," she said.
</P>
<P>
The needs of children vary with their age and retardation. Some
19 children at the school are bed-ridden. They need a different
kind of care. Those with mental as well as physical disabilities
have to be looked after another way.
</P>
<P>
Hashwani is proud of her staff, and said that "without them it
would have been impossible to run this school."
</P>
<P>
Gulnar Sultana, a dedicated principal of the school and also a
well-known speech therapist, said that "they (special children)
were like a wild bunch when I first came here."
</P>
<P>
"There were children who had behavior problems, there were
children who had speech and hearing impairment."
</P>
<P>
"Now they have become very disciplined and many of them have
improved after receiving hearing and speech therapy and
physiotherapy," Sultana said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Sultana has 15 years of training in speech therapy. She feels
fortunate to have received her theoretical and practical training
from the first British speech therapist in Pakistan, Margaret
Kulson Taskeenullah, with whom she worked for six years.
</P>
<P>
Talking about children with cerebral palsy and other forms of
retardation, Sultana said that "when they first come here, they
didn't even make an eye contact. But now they respond, laugh and
show their feelings."
</P>
<P>
Sultana believes that the parents' involvement is a must.
"Umeed-e-Noor" invites the parents of these special children every
now and then and holds seminars, giving them guidance on how to
look after these children at home.
</P>
<P>
"It is much better that the special children be sent to the
school on a daily basis and the rest of the time they stay at home
with their parents," said Sultana.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Dismisses Fears About Post-election Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, Cambodia's incumbent
co-premier, said there should be no fear about post-election
violence because he would quit politics if his Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) party failed the poll.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told a press conference at his residence on Sunday,
soon after casting his ballot, that he would lead a country life
if the CPP was defeated in the election.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to his splendid and huge garden compound, Hun Sen
said, "there are so many cocoanut trees and fish ponds for me to
attend to. I could sell cocoanuts and fish if the Cambodian people
did not chose me as their leader."
</P>
<P>
The election, which began early Sunday, pit Hun Sen against
Prince Nordom Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of the Sam
Rainsy Party. The three men are major contenders for political
power in a country torn by decades of war.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears that the CPP, which controls the armed
forces, would resort to force if defeated in the election.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what he would do if his party failed the polls, Hun
Sen said with a smile: "There are so much work to do. I can look
after the house, write newspaper articles and books about
Cambodia. I can play golf as well."
</P>
<P>
He added that he would form an opposition party, "but not in a
way to disturb the government or seek sanctions against Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"If I chose to do so, the government would fall in two months
because I could lead my numerous supporters to demonstrate every
day in Phnom Penh. But that is not the way I'm doing things," Hun
Sen said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was confident his party would succeed in
the election and lead the Cambodian people to lasting peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, Hun Sen, smiling and looking relaxed, walked into
the Takhmau polling station in Kandal Province, seven kilometers
south of Phnom Penh, to cast his ballot. He was accompanied by his
wife and a few bare-handed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
"The world has witnessed the victory of the Cambodian people,"
Hun Sen said in reference to the peaceful and smooth running of
the election.
</P>
<P>
"For a country like Cambodia which faces chaos, it is not easy
to organize the election by themselves in a peaceful way. This is
a victory of the Cambodian people and the royal government," Hun
Sen said. The election is the first organized by the Cambodians
themselves in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The election was "free, fair and without violence," Hun Sen
said, dismissing reports about CPP-inspired intimidation and
violence intended to disrupt the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to pay too much attention to such exaggerated
reports," he said, adding it was up to the National Election
Committee to investigate the reported cases of intimidation and
violence.
</P>
<P>
The election, widely expected to achieve lasting peace in the
war-torn country, will produce deputies to the 122-member National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy cast their ballots in Kompong
Cham Province, 130 kilometers east of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Both men also voiced confidence that their respective parties
would win the election.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Talks on Relations Among China, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States is for good
relations among China, the U.S. and India, U.S. Ambassador to
India Richard Celeste said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If you have to look at what the world would be in 2020 A.D. or
2030 A.D., it is hard to imagine that the world would be peaceful
and prosperous if there are no positive relations among India,
China and the United States," Celeste said in an interview with
the local Doordarshan television.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said his country wanted China to be "good
friends" of both India and the United States, according to a press
release issued by Doordanshan.
</P>
<P>
Celeste ruled out any need for third party mediation in
resolving outstanding issues between India and neighboring
Pakistan, the position maintained by India ever since the nuclear
tests carried by the two countries in May.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship can not be imposed from outside, it can only be
nurtured from inside," Celeste was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Washington wanted India to emerge as a major player in the
global stage, Celeste said, adding however that Washington was not
prepared to recognize India as a nuclear weapon state under the
term of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
He said the issue was whether there was a way for the United
Nations to recognize India's security needs and minimize
requirements to address those needs within the context of the NPT
and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

social order once his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) was elected.
</P>
<P>
Smiling and looking relaxed, Hun Sen walked into the Takhmau
polling station in Kandal Province seven kilometers south of here
soon after Cambodians nationwide began voting early in the day.

Hun Sen said he was confident the CPP would emerge as a winner
in the on-going election, the first organized by the Cambodians

and machine guns stationed around all polling stations, but this
time no weapons were seen. Even my bodyguards came to the station
bare-handed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was "free, fair and without violence," he
said, dismissing reports about CPP-inspired intimidation and
violence intended to disrupt the election campaign but said it was
up to the National Election Committee to investigate the reported
cases of intimidation and violence.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Malaysia Agree to Settle Tiff Over CIQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Malaysia have
agreed to settle as soon as possible the tiff between the two
countries over relocation of Customs, Immigration and Quarantine
(CIQ) check-points, local Chinese Newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in their sideline talks Saturday at the 31th
ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Manila, Singapore Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar and his Malaysian counterpart Datuk Abdullah bin
Ahmad Badawi have reached agreement that the Malaysian CIQ at
Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in southern Singapore will be
relocated at Woodlands in Singapore's northern border but the
movement will not be conducted at the same time when Singapore
moves its own CIQ to Woodlands Train Check Points (WTCP) on August
1.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed that officials from the two sides
hold talks as soon as possible to find way out so as to ensure
continued railway services from Malaysia to Singapore. the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The latest squabble between the two countries emerged Friday
over an interim CIQ relocation arrangements contained in a
statement released Friday by Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Singapore will allow Malaysian CIQ to
operate at Tanjong Pagar with Singapore officials present to "lend
their authority to Malaysian customs officials during the interim
period" after Singapore moved its own CIQ to the new WTCP.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Singapore has agreed to Malaysia's
request to allow Malaysian Immigration to put some desks for its
officers on the passenger platform at the WTCP so as to enable
Malaysian officers to clear passengers for entry into Malaysia
after Singapore has cleared them for exit.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the interim arrangements are "to give
Malaysia time to prepare its legal arguments to back its claim
that it has the right to operate its CIQ at Tanjong Pagar railway
station."
</P>
<P>
In response to the statement, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry
reportedly said "there has been no agreement on interim
arrangements as described by Singapore."
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the ministry as saying that the Singapore's
statement contained "certain factual inaccuracies."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Ministry's Undersecretary for Southeast Asia
Affairs Mohd Arshad Hussain was quoted as saying that "All we are
asking for is co-location inside the Woodlands Train Check Points
as the original plan."
</P>
<P>
Following the reports, Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs
reacted by issuing a fuller statement detailing the negotiations
between the two sides over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The fresh tiff over CIQ operations is the latest in a
protracted dispute over the operation of the Malayan Railways
services here. Singapore and Malaysia signed Points of Agreement
in 1990 outlining the redevelepment of the Malaysian-owned railway
land in Singapore, but deal has not been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Malaysian railway operator, Malayan Railways
(Kretapi Tanah Melayu), owns about 200 hectares of land within
Singapore under a 1918 agreement drawn up by the British, which
gave the operator the land for as long as it operated trains
services.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Malaysia Agree to Settle Tiff Over CIQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Malaysia have
agreed to settle as soon as possible the tiff between the two
countries over relocation of Customs, Immigration and Quarantine
(CIQ) check-points, local Chinese Newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in their sideline talks Saturday at the 31th
ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Manila, Singapore Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar and his Malaysian counterpart Datuk Abdullah bin
Ahmad Badawi have reached agreement that the Malaysian CIQ at
Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in southern Singapore will be
relocated at Woodlands in Singapore's northern border but the
movement will not be conducted at the same time when Singapore
moves its own CIQ to Woodlands Train Check Points (WTCP) on August
1.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed that officials from the two sides
hold talks as soon as possible to find way out so as to ensure
continued railway services from Malaysia to Singapore. the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The latest squabble between the two countries emerged Friday
over an interim CIQ relocation arrangements contained in a
statement released Friday by Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Singapore will allow Malaysian CIQ to
operate at Tanjong Pagar with Singapore officials present to "lend
their authority to Malaysian customs officials during the interim
period" after Singapore moved its own CIQ to the new WTCP.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Singapore has agreed to Malaysia's
request to allow Malaysian Immigration to put some desks for its
officers on the passenger platform at the WTCP so as to enable
Malaysian officers to clear passengers for entry into Malaysia
after Singapore has cleared them for exit.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the interim arrangements are "to give
Malaysia time to prepare its legal arguments to back its claim
that it has the right to operate its CIQ at Tanjong Pagar railway
station."
</P>
<P>
In response to the statement, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry
reportedly said "there has been no agreement on interim
arrangements as described by Singapore."
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the ministry as saying that the Singapore's
statement contained "certain factual inaccuracies."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Ministry's Undersecretary for Southeast Asia
Affairs Mohd Arshad Hussain was quoted as saying that "All we are
asking for is co-location inside the Woodlands Train Check Points
as the original plan."
</P>
<P>
Following the reports, Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs
reacted by issuing a fuller statement detailing the negotiations
between the two sides over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The fresh tiff over CIQ operations is the latest in a
protracted dispute over the operation of the Malayan Railways
services here. Singapore and Malaysia signed Points of Agreement
in 1990 outlining the redevelepment of the Malaysian-owned railway
land in Singapore, but deal has not been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Malaysian railway operator, Malayan Railways
(Kretapi Tanah Melayu), owns about 200 hectares of land within
Singapore under a 1918 agreement drawn up by the British, which
gave the operator the land for as long as it operated trains
services.

PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, Cambodia's incumbent
co-premier and leader of the ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP), pledged Sunday to give priority to political stability and
social order once his party was elected.
</P>
<P>
Smiling and looking relaxed, Hun Sen walked into the Takhmau
polling station in Kandal Province seven kilometers south of this
capital city soon after Cambodians across the country
began voting early in the day.
</P>
<P>
The election, crucial for the future of Cambodia, will produce
deputies to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of Sam Rainsy
Party, two other major contenders for political power, cast their
ballots in Kompong Cham Province, 130 kilometers east of Phnom
Penh.
</P>
<P>
The three men all voiced confidence that their respective
parties would win the election.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. local time in 11,699 polling stations
in 23 constituencies and are due to close at 4:00 p.m.
</P>

than the previous election in 1993, when about 90 percent of the
voters went to the polls. The party which wins most seats at the
top legislature has the right to choose the country's leader.

are expected to be released on August 1. The final outcome will

<HEADLINE> Peru's Oil Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Peru's oil output was down 6.2
percent from an average of 121,700 barrels a day last year to
114,100 barrels a day in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The total output was 20.651 billion barrels in the first six
months, compared to 22.028 billion barrels in the same period last
year, said the Mining, Oil and Energy National Society.
</P>
<P>
The reduced production, said Rafael Samaniego, chairman of the
oil committee of the trade association known as the SNMPE in
Spanish on Saturday, was the result of three major factors.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it was the El Nino phenomenon that brought down the
output of two big oil companies in the country's northern jungle,
Occidental and Pluspetrol, by 7 percent and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, severe weather conditions caused by the abnormally
warm ocean current cut the production of two other oil firms
operating in the central jungle, Maple and Aguaytia, by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, as shown by an SNMPE report, investment into the oil
sector of Peru slowed down considerably in January through June
after the failure in the exploration of five new oil wells.
</P>
<P>
As a result, investment in oil activities has totaled only 70
million U.S. dollars so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the drop of oil prices at the world market, from an
average of 19.20 dollars a barrel in 1997 to 12.50 dollars a
barrel in the year's first four months, depressed the production.

exports and 9.13 billion dollars in imports in the year's first
six months, resulting in a trade deficit of 1.10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, as reported by the Central Bank, was attributed to
the drop in the prices, as well as volumes, of the country's main
exports partly due to the ongoing Asian financial crisis.

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer,
has doubled its domestic consumption to become the biggest coffee

same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as estimations go, vehicle sales will be off 5-10
percent for the entire year.
</P>

The reduction was attributed to the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and a rise in interest rate on credits extended
for personal consumption.

investigation will continue in line with international practices,
Ma Jixian, chief investigator of the Anti-dumping Office under the
State Economic and Trade Commission, said in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The first anti-dumping case, lodged against Canadian, the
Republic of Korean (ROK) and U.S. newsprint exporters to China,
was initiated last December, it reported.
</P>
<P>
After seven months of investigations, the primary determination
was announced on July 9 of this year, declaring that the Canadian,
ROK and U.S. newsprint exports to China have substantially damaged
China's newsprint production industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
The determination required Chinese importers to cash deposits
with Chinese Customs for future newsprint imports from the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the primary determination, the
prosecuted newsprint exporters have 37 days to appeal to SETC or
MOFTEC. But to date, none have submitted any formal statements,
according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the prosecuted side can also request a public
hearing where the two sides can present their own evidence and
hold discussions before the final determination is made.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Not to Join NATO Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will not directly
participate in NATO's possible military intervention in Kosovo,
said Hungarian Prime Minister Orban Viktor.
</P>
<P>
In talks on Saturday with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
at the Western military bloc's headquarters in Brussels, Orban
said his country needs to be prudent towards the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government holds more highly the national
interest of Hungary, Orban was quoted as saying during a one-day
tour of Brussels by reports published in the Hungarian press here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that hundrends of thousands of ethnic Hungarians live
in the Serbian Republic of the Yugoslav Federation calls for the
Hungarian government to explicitly define the extent of its moves,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Orban said, 500 ethnic Hungarian soldiers
recruited by Serbia have been sent to Kosovo, a Yugoslav province
where ethnic Albanians are seeking independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, his government should avoid the occurrence of
fighting among Hungarians of different nationalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hungarian head of government said his country is
willing to offer logistic and medical assistance if NATO launches
military actions in Kosovo.

</P>
<P>
Chang, the two-time Legg Mason defending champion, could not play 14th-seed

"It felt a little stiff when I woke up. I went out and hit some balls and it
was very bad. I had quite a bit of pain in my left wrist," Chang said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Price Cutting Challenges China's Container Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's shipping container
manufacturing sector has become highly competitive as profit
margins are reaching their minimum levels, driving out small
players while strengthening the clout of heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
Several small manufacturers of the containers, which are used
to ship products throughout the world, have been forced to shut
down, while some have been bought out by larger manufacturers.
About 70 percent of nearly 40 container producers throughout the
country are losing money, Business Weekly reported toady.
</P>
<P>
As competition is further intensifying and the profit margin
continues to shrink, many more small firms are expected to quit
the container manufacturing business.
</P>
<P>
China International Marine Containers (Group) Ltd, the world's
leading container maker, haven't escaped the cut-throat
competition unscathed.
</P>
<P>
The company's profit margin has been squeezed sharply even
though its profits have been rising since 1995, it reported.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the public company reported 193 million yuan (23.25
million U.S. dollars) in net profits on sales of 230 million yuan
(27 million U.S. dollars). Its sales grew greatly in the first
half of this year compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Prices for exported containers have seen continuous drops from
2,300 US dollars in 1995 to the current 1,750 US dollars, 400 US
dollars lower than those made in Europe and 200 US dollars lower
than in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some local container producers, with bank loans, have the
financial strength to cut prices to such a point where production
costs are barely covered.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the related State authorities to take effective
measures to clamp down on artificial price cuts," the Weekly
quoted Li Yunqiu, Vice general-secretary of China Container
Industry Association, as saying.

<HEADLINE> Rural Housing Offers New Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Residential housing in China's
vast rural areas has emerged as a new economic growth point at a
time when the country needs to stimulate domestic market demand in
order to grow the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from rural construction departments indicate that
Chinese farmers have amassed disposable income of over 1.6
trillion yuan, including bank savings and cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
Farmers usually save money for marriages and houses, with a
major portion of related funds earmarked for housing. For example,
more than 5.3 million rural households, or 61 percent of the total
number in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have either
constructed, expanded or refurbished houses over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
A related study revealed that close to 10 percent of the
country's rural households build new houses annually, with funds
spent on building materials approaching 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi completed construction of 46.59 million sq.m. of living
space during 1997, with 62.6 percent of the total going to rural
families. Officials note that farmers who earning more than 3,000
yuan annually can easily afford to build new houses. Some 1.04
million rural households in the region earned above that level
during 1997, with the number of related families accounting for 13
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders predict that an increasing number of farmers
will enjoy increased earnings enabling them to spend more on
housing.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong saved a penalty
kick on Saturday to secure her team a 5-3 win over Norway in the women's soccer
semifinals at the Goodwill Games in Long Island, New York.
</P>
<P>
The two teams were deadlocked 1-1 after 90 minutes. But in the penalty kick
shoot-out, the Chinese girls excelled 4-2 to grab the victory, helped by a miss
by Norway in their fourth spot kick.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out started with Norway's Hege Rise, who converted the kick.
However, after Xie Huilin's turn in success, Risse's teammate Goril Kringen
failed to score when the experienced Chinese goal-keeper parried the ball out.
</P>
<P>
With the advantage, the Chinese players made successive three more goals in
the shoot, while Norway made another mistake as Kjershiti Thun kicked the ball
out from the right side, thus deciding the game in China's favor.
</P>
<P>
"The team's spirit helped me make the saves during the penalty kicks," said
Gao Hong after the match. "I think the Norway shooters made errors while we mad
e good kicks," she added.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played a defensive game in the first half, which ended
goalless under a scorching sun at the Nassau County Mitchel Athletics Complex.
The Chinese girls made four shooting attempts while their European rivals made
three. But they were either saved or shot off the target.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, both groups played offensively. Norway opened the
scoring in the 29th minute when forward Marianne Pettersen dribbled the ball in
the right and made a shot which was blocked by Gao, who fell to the ground. But
Pettersen followed up to slot the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
However, two minutes later, the Chinese girls got a corner kick chance.
Midfielder Zhao Lihong passed the ball right to the center and Fan Yunjie
headed it home.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team will play on Sunday against the winner of the other
semifinal between the United States and Denmark Saturday evening.

<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign economic
cooperation has spread rapidly to 180 countries and regions,
according to Cui Mingmo, deputy director of the Foreign Economic
Cooperation Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Ministry .
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, he says, nearly 800 Chinese enterprises
were involved in project engineering, labor services, design,
consultation, and supervision, with 71.7 billion U.S. dollars
worth of contracts in this area that had sent 1.54 million people
abroad to work.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 5.6 billion U.S. dollars
worth of contracts were signed and 4 billion dollars worth of
business done, increases of 9.3 percent and 15.9 percent
respectively over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Trade began in western Asia and North Africa at the end of
the '70s and focused on the Mideast in the '80s, and now centers
on the Asian market, while developing the African market,
recovering the Mideast market, and exploring markets in Europe and
the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese mainly handled small and medium-sized
projects and did 300 to 400 million U.S. dollars worth of business
annually, but now, with the growing amount of capital, technology,
management, and personnel, China has increased the number of
medium-sized and large projects.

PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodians began voting early
Sunday to select deputies to the National Assembly in nationwide
election.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. in 11,699 polling stations in 23
constituencies and are due to close at 4:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
A total of 39 political parties will take part in the contest.

<P>
The three major parties' leaders and candidates -- Hun Sen,
Second Prime Minister and vice-president of Cambodian People's
Party (CPP), Prince Ranariddh of Funcinpec and most critic
opposition party leader Sam Rainsy of Sam Rainsy Party -- voted in
their respective constituencies Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen voted in the Teacher Training College in Takhmau,
capital of Kandal Province, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy in Kompong
Cham where the contest is the most intense.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Take A Closer Look At Shanghai's Retail Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Germans met in
Shanghai recently for a one-day seminar on the chain store
business to study the retail business here, how to increase
consumer demand, and how to run a successful retail business.
</P>
<P>
Even though Shanghai had a year-on-year increase in retail
sales of 9.6 percent from January to June, 2.6 percentage points
more than the national average, there were problems like a falling
sale-to-profit ratio and falling consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Cai Hongsheng, the deputy director of the Municipal Commerce
Commission, told the seminar that future priority will be given to
developing chain stores so that they can do more business than
general merchandisers, by adding 100 to 200 shopping malls and
convenience stores each year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has 2,600 chain stores, which had sales of 14 billion
yuan, accounting for 10.6 percent of the city's total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai, Shanghai will increase reforms in the
commercial sector in the latter half of the year and will reduce
the number of chain-store companies from 14 to 10 to improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Roland Berger and Partner Gmbh, Germany's largest management
consultancy organization, was represented at the seminar as was
the Shanghai Municipal Association of Chain Store Business. Maxi
Mow, a vice-president at Roland Berger, said that there is a
global trend of large department stores getting a shrinking share
of the retail business so new forms are needed for Shanghai's
retail business.

HARBIN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, an old heavy industrial
center in China's Heilongjiang Province, recorded moderate
economic growth in the first half of this year.

<P>
Its GDP was up 9 percent to 33.5 billion yuan by the end of

<P>
Investment in fixed assets grew and consumer spending was
rising gradually.

A city government official says this comes from increased
reforms at state-owned enterprises, more government spending on
fixed assets, and the rapid development of the private economy.

<HEADLINE> 99 Percent of Indonesian Small Enterprises Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- About 99 percent of Indonesian
small enterprises were being affected by the economic and monetary
crisis, Minister for Cooperatives and Small Enterprises Adi Sasono
was quoted by local press Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank interest rate of between 50 and 60 percent were making it
difficult for the people to develop their businesses and those
having money prefer to deposit it with banks, Adi said at an
annual meeting of the Central Primary Workers Cooperative in
Yogyakarta, Central Java, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, small-scale businessmen were having a
hard time surviving and therefore, ways had to be found to help
them overcome their problems, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the search for a solution to the economic crisis, it was
hoped the modern business sector which controlled large assets in
centralized manner would for the time being refrain from
expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adi noted it was the modern business community that had made
large foreign debts in U.S. dollar and this was why, when the
rupiah's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar plunged, it was
them who were in the worst predicament.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been the worst hit by the regional currency
turmoil with the rupiah losing over 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
In the face of such a condition, the minister said, workers'
cooperatives should think innovatively and come up with ideas to
create job opportunities because unemployment was a major threat
to stability.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's unemployment is expected to increase to 15.4
million at the end of this year. The figure, representing 17.1
percent of the country's 90 million work force, was revised upward
from previous estimates of 13.4 million because of the predicted
contraction in the economy.

The temperature hit 38 degree centigrade in Fort Worth early in
the afternoon Saturday and Dallas was close behind.
</P>
<P>
There was no relief in sight. Temperatures over 39 were
expected through Wednesday, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Doug Cain. And the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
"The hottest time of the year starts July 30th through Aug.
8th," The report quoted Cain as saying. "According to the 30-year
average, we are just coming up on the hottest days of the year."
</P>
<P>
The cause of Saturday's break was not yet known. Officials
blamed the first break, which happened late Thursday, on the heat
wave, saying it probably happened because of high demand, metal
fatigue and extremely dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
Many office buildings were deserted Friday because the downtown
area was short of water and air conditioning. Water was knocked
out at two hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Texas heat deaths, Louisiana has reported 26
deaths and Oklahoma 15. Three deaths were reported in Missouri,
two in Pennsylvania and one death each in California and Arizona.

WUHAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The rising water level of the
Yangtze River measured at Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, has exceeded the danger line of 28.28 meters,
approaching 28.30 meters at 8:00 p.m. this evening.
</P>
<P>
The water flow of the Yangtze River at Wuhan Pass Measuring
Station has also reached 65,300 cubic meters per second today.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's anti-flood headquarters held an emergency
meeting of flood control commanders this evening and ordered that
no effort be spared to guarantee the safety of the river
embarkerments, Wuhan city, and the locals' lives and property.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Navigation on the Yangtze River
from Shishou city to Wuhan city, both in central China's Hubei
Province, will be suspended at midnight tonight in order to
safeguard the embarkments against the rising river waters.
</P>
<P>
According to the lastest information from the State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the water levels
measured at Shishou and Wuhan have exceeded or approached
record highs.
</P>
<P>
Rising water levels have been endangering the security of river
embankments on both sides, and waves created by passing ships
remain a serious threat to the embankments.
</P>
<P>
Both the Hubei and Hunan provincial governments have suggested
suspending navigation on the Yangtze before the flood waters
recede.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that navigation will soon be resumed after the
flood peak of the river has passed through, and the pressures on
the embarkments on both sides are alleviated.

<HEADLINE> Indian Defense Minister Sees Encouraging Signs For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes said Saturday there were encouraging signs for relations
between India and the United States after India's nuclear tests in
May.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted Fernandes as saying that
the fourth round of talks between New Delhi and Washington next
month should lead to a thaw to the extent of accepting India as a
nuclear weapon state and easing of sanctions imposed by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
On his way to New Delhi after reviewing security arrangements
in Jammu and Kashmir, Fernandes told reporters that the ongoing
dialogue between Indian Prime Minister's special envoy Jaswant
Singh and Deputy Secretary of State Strob Talbott was moving in
the right direction and there is softening of attitudes.
</P>
<P>
He said on board a special plane of the India Air Force that
the next round of talks between Talbott and Singh in the second
half of August in Washington should see a forward movement.
</P>
<P>
Talbott and Singh held two-day talks earlier without tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he meant by forward movement, Fernandes said this
included acceptance of India's status of a nuclear weapon state
and removal of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want anybody's confirmation about India's status. It
is a question of acceptance of the reality," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the
Defense Minister said complexities are on the U.S. side which has
lot to do with the weaponization program.
</P>
<P>
He said there are certain ideas on the U.S. side which are not
acceptance to India. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India would go ahead with test firing of a new version
of intermediate range Agni ballistic missile with an extended
strike of over 2,500 kilometers, Fernandes said Parliament's
Standing Committee on Defense had urged the government to go ahead
with the program.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Calls for Formation of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Zimbabwe
African National Union (NDONGA) Saturday said the country needs a
transparent and a representative professional national land
redistribution authority for the country's second resettlement
program.
</P>
<P>
The party's Secretary General Edwin Nguwa told a press
conference at the opening of its national executive council
meeting in Harare that the authority should be established and
governed by an act of parliament to ensure all Zimbabweans,
living under squalid conditions, are given a chance to be
resettled despite their political or religious affiliation, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the current forcible settlements by villagers around
the country on some commercial and state farms was a sign of
desperation hence the need for the government to speed up the
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The government needs about 2.2 billion U.S. Dollars to
implement the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
A land conference to drum up donor support for the program is
expected to be held in Harare in September.
</P>
<P>
But according to Nguwa, "the proposed donor conference shows
how the present government is helpless and ill-determined to
resolve the plight of the people of Zimbabwe."
</P>
<P>
He said Zanu (NDONGA) welcomed President Robert Mugabe's idea
to have the country's Lancaster house-brokered constitution
overhauled but said there was need for national convention which
will lead to the formation of a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
"The government, composed of a cross section of our society,
would be tasked with writing a new national constitution and
organize a referendum to seek the approval of the new
constitution by the people," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy

</P>
<P>
The bank, capitalized at 100 million Rand (16 million U.S.

empowerment group, National Empowerment Trust Investment Fund
(NETIF), South African Press Association reported.

Aimed at providing funding for black business and offering

<P>
"A core management team of experienced South African and
Malaysian bankers had been employed by the SBA," said NETIF
Chairman Don Mkhwanazi, who is also the chairman of the SBA board
of directors.

carrier Harry Truman at the port of Norfolk, Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Yemeni FMs Hold Talks on Island Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia and Yemen held talks in Saudi port city of Jeddah on ways
to resolve the crisis resulting from clashes last week on a Red
Sea island claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said the Saudi minister, Saud
Al-Faisal, and his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal
focused on approaches to prevent further clashes on the island and
other areas along their 2,000-kilometer common border.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni and Saudi coastal guards exchanged fire last Sunday on
Duwaima island off the Yemeni coast. Three Yemeni soldiers were
killed and an officer captured in the armed clashes.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts lasted for five hours before a ceasefire is
agreed on. The two countries have decide to maintain the ceasefire
and instruct border committees to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, the sources said the two
foreign ministers' talks covered a proposal for both sides to
evacuate the disputed islands until the completion of land and
border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors on the Arabian peninsula have a decades-old
dispute over three red sea islands and part of the desert region
along their border, where huge oil reserves are expected.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not disclose what the two sides have agreed on
but underlined that there was a joint keenness to prevent new
clashes.
</P>
<P>
They said both the Yemeni and Saudi officials stressed that
their leaders are keen on promoting bilateral relations and
overcoming obstacles, as well as speeding up border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
They said the two officials also stressed the island clashes
would neither affect the course of the border demarcation
negotiations nor the level of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni foreign minister arrived in Jeddah earlier
Saturday. He had been expected in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday or
Wednesday, but the visit was postponed because of domestic events.
</P>
<P>
The top Yemeni diplomat is scheduled to meet Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz later.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Arab world while
Saudi Arabia is one of the richest. Their border dispute has led
to clashes in the past, but both seemed reluctant to raise the
skirmishes openly.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Cancels Scheduled Meeting With U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos Saturday decided to cancel his scheduled meeting with
U.S. State Department coordinator for the Cyprus issue Thomas
Miller who will visit Athens next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision during his visit to the northeastern
border region of Thrace, Pangalos said that the new U.S.
initiative on the divided island, under U.S. envoy Miller, would
not have the "desirable outcome," the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister once again reiterated his criticism of the U.S.
presidents and especially of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
History proved that all U.S. presidents had failed to keep
their promises in resolving the Cyprus issue in accordance with
U.N. resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos also urged Greek Americans not to back any of the U.S.
presidential candidates in the next elections but to offer their
money to Greece's defense needs.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pangalos angrily expressed his dissatisfaction
over Washington's positions towards the settlement of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
He described pre-election promises made by Clinton to help
solve the 24-year division of Cyprus as "gross lies."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Athens Nicholas Burns had reportedly issued
a protest verbally to Pangalos about his remarks. In Washington,
the White House also criticized Pangalos' remarks Friday with
spokesman Mike Mccurry saying that those were remarks unbecoming
for a senior official and close ally of the United States and
inconsistent with what are otherwise close and warm bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> New Daily Appears in Iran to Replace Banned Jameah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A new moderate evening newspaper
Tous appeared on news stands Saturday to replace the banned daily
Jameah (society), pledging to defend human rights and public
freedom in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tous, named after the appellation of ancient city Mashhad in
northeast Iran, comes out after Iran's appeal court confirmed
Thursday the decision of a press court to close down Jameah, a
liberal newspaper which supports President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"Following the ban on Jameah newspaper, from today Tous will be
at the service of the society," reads a headline in the front page
of Tous.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial on "10 principles of Tous," the paper said it
would carefully follow works of the state institutions and
criticize social disorders in order to defend human rights and
public freedom.
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the banned Jameah joined Tous, originally a
provincial weekly published in Mashhad, capital of Khorasan
province, to bring it to national level with a circulation of
100,000.
</P>
<P>
On June 10, the Tehran press court ruled to close down Jameah
and and to ban its managing director Hamidreza Jalaipour from
running publications for one year on charges of "printing
defamatory and untruthful articles."
</P>
<P>
The popular Jameah appeared last February, but came under fire
of the conservatives and hard-liners who accused the paper of
publishing anti-Islamic articles.
</P>
<P>
The paper announced to stop publication as of Saturday after
releasing 120 issues.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani here Saturday confirmed that Iran has "successfully"
tested a missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, Shamkhani said the test was
conducted on Wednesday by experts of Iranian defense industries
"without any assistance from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
The United States on Thursday expressed concern over Iran's
medium-range missile test, which meant that Iran is capable of
hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia and the U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani did not give any details about the testfire. But
U.S. intelligence said the missile flew about 1,300 kilometers and
blew up at the last stage of its flight Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani said that Iran's defense police was and is to promote

<HEADLINE> Turkey's First Water Supply Reaches Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- With the first shipment of Turkish
drinking water arriving in drought-hit northern Cyprus Saturday, a
water project between Turkey and Turkish Cypriots was activated.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, scores of Turkish Cypriots crowded beneath a pipe
gushing water imported from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who came to inaugurate the
water project, said the project has been "just a start and Turkey
has much water to give the Turkish Cypriots," Turkey's Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a cost of 160 million U.S. dollars, includes
shipment of fresh water from Turkey's Soguksu river to northern
Cyprus, construction of dams and irrigation installations in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has signed a deal with the self-declared "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" to ship in 7 million cubic meters of
drinkable water each year to compensate for the water shortage
there.
</P>
<P>
The water is expected to answer the need of more than half of
Northern Cyprus' estimated 200,000 residents, who currently can
only get drinking water twice a week.
</P>
<P>
The fresh water will be initially carried to northern Cyprus in
10,000-cubic meter water bags, which are also called "balloons,"
dragged by a ship.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have said water tankers can be used if the
"balloon" method is found to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway state in the
north in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> WB Encourages Development in Tunisia With Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has provided
Tunisia with 222 million U.S. dollars in loans from July 1997 to
June 1998 for development projects in the country, the
Arabic-language daily Al-Sabah reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loans, whose interest rate was determined in terms of
French franc to be below 4 percent, have a maturity of 15-17 years
with a grace period between three and five years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According the paper, a 42-million-dollar loan was used to raise
farmers' income through optimizing the exploitation of water
resources and enhancing scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Another 50 million dollars was earmarked for a three-year
health sector reform program from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
The WB also allocated 80 million dollars to improve the
enrolling and graduation process in Tunisia's higher education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tunisian transport sector received 50 million
dollars to improve its maritime and railway transport services,
and encourage the involvement of private sector in this field.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Remind Foreigners of Tax Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners entering Russia will
soon get an advisory reminding them of tax legislations of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Starting August 1, incoming aliens clearing the customs will
have the advisory inserted in their passports, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as another attempt by Russia to fill up its gaping
hole in the budget, which is to a large extent the result of tax
evasion by individuals. Of the 250,000 tax dodgers found in the
first half of this year, 170,000 were foreigners, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the advisory, foreigners are to report to the taxation
agencies in the areas where they live of all their incomes in
Russia, the incomes and taxes paid abroad and the hiring of real
estate or other assets, Interfax quoted Anna Komardina, deputy
head of the Income Taxation Department of the State Taxation
Service, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are warned of administrative, financial and criminal
liabilities for tax dodging, Komardina said.
</P>
<P>
Administrative liability refers to a fine of two to 10 times of
minimum wages; financial liability implies a fine equal to the
concealed income, in addition to the amount of tax that should be
paid and a fine equal to 10 percent of the tax collected.
</P>
<P>
Concealment of large incomes in Russia may entail a fine
ranging from 200 to 700 times the minimum wages, or two to five
years in prison, Komardina said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's minimum wage, which changes from time to time, now
stands at 83.49 rubles (about 13.5 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Import Maize from Zimbabwe, South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will import a large amount
of maize from Zimbabwe and South Africa to meet the country's
shortfall in maize supply, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ZANA Saturday in Monze, 120 kilometers
south of Lusaka, Geofrey Godson, national chairman of the
National Food Reserve, said the contracts have already been
signed for the importation of maize from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Zambians that they should not panic over maize
shortage since his agency has finalized all the arrangements to
import enough maize.
</P>
<P>
However, Godson lamented inadequate funding from the
government, saying that his agency has been given only one
billion Kwacha (about 500,000 U.S. Dollars) out of the budget
requirement of 11 billion Kwacha (5.5 million Dollars) to bring
in maize to meet the shortfall in feeding the people.
</P>
<P>
He added that his agency has borrowed money from various
commercial banks within Zambia to meet the shortfall in financial
requirements, but he did not disclose how much has been so far
sourced from the banks.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is facing a serious maize shortage this year but the
National Reserve Agency has taken measures to counter this
deficit, said Godson.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his agency is storing maize in silos and sheds
all over the country, especially in areas it considers to have
great need for extra maize stocks.

899 billion liras (about 596 million dollars) from April, the
Arabic-language daily Al-Hayat reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the latest monthly bulletin from Lebanese

</P>
<P>
Turkey is the biggest importer of Egyptian rice, followed by
Romania, the Al-Alam Al-Youm reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Iraq are expected to sign next month a

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Buys 33 Pct of Malaysian Telecom Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom (BT) has made its
biggest investment in Asia by spending 400 million U.S. dollars
for a 33 percent stake in the Malaysian telecoms company
Binariang, according to British media reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Binariang, launched three years ago, has 22 percent of
Malaysia's mobile phone market, with 450,000 customers. Its fixed
wire network now covers 70 percent of the country's corporate
customers and multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
Experts in telecommunication markets said the move gives BT a
major stake in Malaysia's fast-growing mobile phone industry. It
will also enable Concert, BT's global corporate telecoms business,
to win new deals in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, said, "We have
established partnerships and alliances in our key target markets
with companies which have a strong local base and which share our
vision of the future."
</P>
<P>
Malaysian mobile penetration was only 9 to 11 percent, with
vast growth prospects, Bonfield added.
</P>
<P>
The deal is part of a larger plan by Binariang to raise about
960 million U.S. dollars through links with overseas groups and
debt securities.
</P>
<P>
Apart from BT, Binariang had been recently linked to companies
including Singapore Telecommunications, Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, and Cable and Wireless.

MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Saturday fired head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Nikolai
Kovalyov and named a deputy head of the presidential
administration to replace him.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for Kovalyov's removal, but the Itar-Tass
news agency said he was relieved of his current duties "in
connection with his transfer to another job."
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a meeting between Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and Yeltsin in Shuiskaya Chupa, northwestern
Russia, where the president is recessing.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov's replacement is Vladimir Putin, first deputy head of
the presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 46, entered the former Soviet Union's spy agency, the
USSR State Security Committee (KGB), in 1975 and then spent a long
period of time in Germany, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
He joined the presidential administration in 1996 and was
appointed first deputy head in May 1997.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Lauds PNA for Resuming Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian cabinet minister here
Saturday welcomed the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
decision to resume peace negotiations with Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"It is a wise decision reflecting the Palestinian leadership's
keenness to give peace a good opportunity to be fulfilled," said
Foreign Minister Jawad Anani in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has to respond to the Palestinians'
"constructive stand" and offer a positive stand to show its
desire for peace, Anani added.
</P>
<P>
Anani remarks came one day after PNA President Yasser Arafat
said the Palestinian-Israeli meetings "will resume on a systematic
basis next week."
</P>
<P>
Arafat reversed his earlier decision of suspending the talks
after meeting Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians resumed direct talks with Israel on Sunday,
but broke them off again on Wednesday after three meetings in
which they said no progress on the issue of Israeli redeployment
was made.
</P>
<P>
At stake is the U.S. proposal for Israeli withdrawal from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have
accepted the proposal, but Israel resisted it.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Reopens to Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tourists returned Saturday to
the Capitol, which reopened less than 24 hours after a gunman
fatally shot two policemen and sent a wave of fear through the
building.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, hospitalized under heavy guard, was charged with
murder, but his motives remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
Russell E. Weston Jr., a 41-year-old loner from Rimini,
Montana, was listed in critical condition after undergoing a
second round of surgery for gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
He was charged with murdering a federal officer. An affidavit
filed in U.S. District Court said that when Weston was approached
just inside an entrance to the Capitol by officer Jacob J.
Chestnut, "Weston took out a handgun he had in his possession,
pointed it at Officer Chestnut's head and then fired it."
</P>
<P>
Moments later a second officer was fatally wounded in an
exchange of gunfire. Weston was downed and subdued.
</P>
<P>
Additional charges are pending.
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI affidavit, Weston had "additional
ammunition in his pockets."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Oriaifo at D.C. General Hospital said Weston suffered
multiple gunshot wounds and his chances of survival were "about
50-50."
</P>
<P>
Sergeant Dan Nichols, spokesman for the Capitol Police,
appealed for witnesses to the shooting to call and give their
accounts of what happened.
</P>
<P>
"We're still early into this investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the Secret Service investigated Weston, a former
mental patient, as "a low-level threat" to President Bill Clinton.
Investigators looked for clues to his motives at his cabin in
rural Montana.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Clinton described the Friday afternoon
shooting as "a moment of savagery at the front door of American
civilization."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich delivered the Republican weekly
radio address and asked Americans to join him in prayer.
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol, people left flowers, and many approached police
officers to offer their sympathy.
</P>
<P>
Flags flew at half-staff, and police wore strips of black cloth
across their badges, in tribute to the slain officers.
</P>
<P>
The wounded tourist was released midday Saturday from George
Washington University Hospital, spokeswoman Lisa Saisselin said.
</P>
<P>
Plans already were under way to add the slain officers' names
to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial not far from the
Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Leaves for Meetings on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf left here Sunday for Rabat, capital of Morocco, to
attend meetings of al-Quds (Jerusalem), the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) said.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meetings of the al-Quds Committee of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) is slated for
Wednesday to discuss Israel's decision to expand the
administrative boundaries of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved in June 21 a plan to put a number
of Jewish settlements around Jerusalem under its jurisdiction,
seen by the Palestinians and Arabs as an attempt to annex parts of
the West Bank and judaizing the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is the most sensitive sticking point in the
Middle East peace process. Israel claims it as "undivided and
eternal capital" while the Palestinians want it as the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords singed by Israel and the Palestinians,
the fate of Jerusalem can only be determined in their final status
talks, and neither side should take unilateral action to prejudice
a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry source as saying that
ministerial meetings of the 55-member OIC were called for by King
Hassan II of Morocco, who is also chairman of the al-Quds
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will discuss Israel's illegal measures aimed at
judaizing the city and obliterating its Arab and Islamic identity,
according to INA.
</P>
<P>
The source said that on the sidelines of the meetings,
al-Sahhaf will meet with his counterparts from OIC member states
on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of
common concern.

JIUJIANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- There was large-scale crumbling
of dikes on Saicheng Lake on the western outskirts of the city of
Jiujiang in east China's Jiangxi Province today.
</P>
<P>
The crumbling of 100 meters of dikes directly threaten areas
around the lake and dikes on the Yangtze itself, half a km away,
according to the city's flood control headquarters.
</P>
<P>
At 8:00 pm today, the water level of the lake was 22.2 m,
compared with a record high of 21.7 m in 1995. Water levels on the
river have also broken records.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 citizens and armed police officers have been
sent to repair the dikes, but a local official says that the
safety of the lake can hardly be guaranteed if water levels
continue to rise.

<HEADLINE> Israel Said to Present "New Ideas" to Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said Sunday that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai had presented "new ideas" to advance the direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Palestinian leaders will meet later Sunday to
discuss these ideas, which he said the two sides had agreed to
keep secret for now, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat did not say when and how Mordechai presented the ideas,
but his remarks coincided with information from Mordechai's
office that the defense minister met Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Deputy Chairman Abu Mazen Saturday night and
agreed to resume direct talks.
</P>
<P>
The office said the two officials, who respectively led the
Israeli and the Palestinian teams in the negotiations, held
"personal meeting" in Jerusalem in a "good" atmosphere and
decided that they will personally monitor the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly agreed the negotiations between their
delegations will be held non-stop.
</P>
<P>
The high-level negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians, the first in months and held last Sunday, wounded up
Wednesday without any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians complained that the Israelis had not bring
any new proposals to the talks concerning the American initiative
calling on Israel to withdraw from an additional 13.1 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal, but Israel
has been resisting it.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed on Friday to resume the talks
with Israel this week.

<HEADLINE> Nemtsov Says He Knows Nothing About Government Reshuffle </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov said Sunday that he "knows nothing of the details" of a
possible cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"I was told nothing about it during the trip to Kaliningrad:
either they do not want to make me sad or they do not want to make
me glad," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as saying at a
press conference in Kaliningrad.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov's remarks came one day after President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko discussed "personnel matters"
in Shuiskaya Chupa, northwestern Russia, where the president is
recessing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident one should not fuss on the edge of a precipice,"
Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
"To change anyone in the government 100 days after its
formation means either the lack of knowledge of the country's
standing or bowing to the political situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Probably, it is somebody's wish to get rid of some people on
the quiet. Those wishing to start a leap-frog by changing one
minister with another simply do not want the governmental
anti-crisis program to be fulfilled," Nemtsov said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: SAARC Summit Crucial to S. Asia Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The three days starting from
next Wednesday are crucial for South Asia as the SAARC leaders
converge in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka to review the past and
look into the future and meet bilaterally to iron out, among
others, the problems arising from the nuclear explosions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This will make the 10th summit of the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in the limelight in other parts
of the world as well, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The past 13 years have made Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka become an organic whole,
although not without spots.
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting in December 1985 in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
leaders of the seven countries noted that bound as their countries
were by many common values rooted in their social, ethnic,
cultural and historical traditions, regional cooperation provided
a logical response to problems such as poverty, underdevelopment,
low levels of production, unemployment and pressure of population.
</P>
<P>
Since then, cooperation has been extended to a number of areas
including agriculture, poverty alleviation, economic development
and trade, communications, education, culture and sports,
environment and meteorology, health, population activities and
child welfare, prevention of drug trafficking and abuse, rural
development, science and technology, tourism, transport and women
in development.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995, the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) went into operation, under which two rounds of trade
negotiations offered over 2,000 items of products for preferential
treatment in the member states.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is now under way toward the removal of
non-tariff barriers and structural impediments, wider and deeper
tariff cuts and the expansion of the lists of products for
intra-region preferential trade so as to realize a South Asian
Free Trade Area (SAFTA) preferably by the 2001 as envisaged by the
leaders in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, progress has been made in other areas such as
agriculture, health, telecommunications and rural development.
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted that 13 years of cooperation has not
brought about the expected changes in the region which houses
one-fifth of the humanity.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, underdevelopment, low levels of production,
unemployment and population pressure are still plaguing the
region.
</P>
<P>
It shares a meager one percent in the global trade and the
intra-regional trade accounts for only about 3 percent of the
region's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
But on the pace of cooperation, particularly in the area of
trade and economic development, member countries have different
ideas.
</P>
<P>
The main concern of India, the region's giant, is to further
trade and business links within SAARC, while Pakistan, the
region's another power, wants the cooperation to move in a
measured and deliberate way.
</P>
<P>
For Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal, the region's
four least developed countries, faster and better cooperation is
their choice. Under SAPTA, they enjoy exclusively special and more
favorable treatment and additional measures.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, which proposed to establish SAPTA and has one of the
lowest non-tariff barriers in the region, has been pushing for a
progressive reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers in the
run-up to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
How to evaluate the past achievements and chart the future
course for SAARC is a concern of the leaders as well. At their
last summit in May 1997, they directed that a Group of Eminent
Persons be set up to do the job.
</P>
<P>
At the Colombo summit, they are expected to focus their
attention on the report submitted by the group and make their own
decisions on how to best take the grouping into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The summit comes after India and Pakistan conducted rival
nuclear explosions in May, which raised fear of a nuclear arms
race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif are scheduled to discuss the nuclear
tests and the long-standing issue of Kashmir on the sidelines of
the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAARC Charter rules out deliberations on
contentious bilateral issues at any grouping meetings.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that their first face-to-face contact after the
nuclear tests would help assuage the concerns of their partners in
the region and revive bilateral talks that deadlocked since last
September.
</P>
<P>
Though South Asia is faced with disputes and mutual distrust
between other countries, those between India and Pakistan, the
region's two powers, are the main obstacles to more substantial
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But regional cooperation is a rising trend in the world today.
And for South Asia, one of the poorest regions in the world, its
future all the more lies with the collective efforts as stressed
by its leaders.
</P>
<P>
In consequence, the 10th summit will decide SAARC's performance
in the new millennium and whether it can catch up with its
counterparts in other parts of the world as the meeting serves as
a link between the past and the future.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Guinea Bissau's Government and
rebels have agreed on a cease-fire and talks for a last peace,
reports reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The accord would be signed by representatives of the
government of President Joao "Nino" Vieira and the rebels aboard
the Portuguese naval frigate Corte-Real later Sunday, Portuguese
News Agency was quoted as saying in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Tsf radio said the accord called for formal negotiations on a
permanent peace to be opened within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The reported deal followed the intervention of a mediation
mission from six fellow Portuguese-speaking countries, including
the former colonial power Portugal, which has been in Bissau
since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny against Vieira, whose government is being backed by
troops from neighboring Senegal and Guinea, broke out on June 7,
one day after former armed forces' commander Ansumane Mane was
sacked for being involved in smuggling arms to Senegalese rebels.

<P>
URUMQI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and one
person was reported missing when a boat overturned on Bosten Lake
in the central part of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region on July 19, according to a report that only reached here
today.
</P>
<P>
Heavy winds caused the boat to capsize, according to the
report, but it goes on to say that there seem to have been some
irregularities. The boat belonged to the local government
department that handles navigation on the lake, but the passengers
were a group of visitors from the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous
Prefecture in the western part of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The group was accompanied by a government employee in charge of
toll collections on Kizilsu's highways.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, a boat of this kind was not to be
used for leisure activities like sightseer cruises. And, what is
more, it was overloaded at the time of the mishap, something that
may have been a major cause of the accident.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Worsens in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation has worsened in
Bangladesh as the water levels of most rivers are kept rising
above the danger levels, officials in the Flood Information Center
said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The situation is expected to aggravate further in the northern
districts and in the central part of the country, but will improve
in the southeastern hill basin in the next 24 hours, they said.
</P>
<P>
Official death toll from flood was 73, but press reports here
put the number at more than 140, with over 10 million people
affected in 35 out of the country's 64 districts since the monsoon
season began early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Disaster Management and Relief Ministry on Sunday allocated
600 tons of rice and about 1 million taka (about 21,277 U.S.
dollars) in cash for distribution among the flood victims,
ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has so far granted more than 6.4 million taka
(about 136,170 U.S. dollars) in cash and 4,100 tons of foodgrains
for the flood-hit people.
</P>
<P>
As 70-80 percent of the country's annual rainfall concentrates
in the monsoon season between July and October, flood is very
common in Bangladesh, considering its particular geographical
features, experts said.

<HEADLINE> China Asks Japan to Help Revive Asian Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China Sunday asked Japan to do its
part in resolving the East Asian financial crisis and revive Asian
economies as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi here
Sunday evening, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said, "We
hope that Japan will make its due contributions to overcoming the
financial crisis and achieving economic recovery in Asia as soon
as possible by making use of its economic advantages."
</P>
<P>
He said China is aware of its responsibilities and has done its
best to alleviate the East Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Chinese President Jiang Zemin's planned visit to Japan later
this year, Tang said the trip will be "of great and far-reaching
significance for Sino-Japanese ties and draw extensive attention
from the international community."
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's visit is mainly aimed at exploring with Japan
the building of the framework for 21st century-oriented
Sino-Japanese friendship and relationship.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and
is thus an important year in the two countries' relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister expressed the hope that the two
countries will work together and do a good job in making
preparations for this historic state visit.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who will soon become the Japanese prime minister,
pledged to further promote the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year is of great importance for the two
nations' ties and he called President Jiang's visit to his country
"the most important" diplomatic agenda for Japan this year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will do its utmost to prepare for the
visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi praised China for maintaining the stability of its
currency, the Renminbi, and reaffirmed his support for China's
reform and open policy.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has also worked out a large-scale action
plan for deepening economic reform and stimulating the economy and
it will also make efforts to revive the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang, who arrived here Sunday afternoon to
attend the ASEAN Regional Forum and Post-Ministerial Meeting, also
met Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, Singapore Foreign
Minister S. Jayakumar, Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw and New
Zealand Foreign Minister Charles McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Singapore Foreign Minister Jayakumar, Tang
noted that Singapore will soon become the chairman of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and he expressed
China's readiness to increase consultation and coordination with
Singapore at the ARF, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the
Asia-Europe Meeting and other multilateral forums.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Singapore will continue to play an active role in
boosting the relations between China and the ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar expressed the ASEAN's desire to continue
strengthening its coordination and cooperation with China in
bilateral and multilateral fields.
</P>
<P>
He said China's success in receiving U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who visited China earlier this year is not only
beneficial to Sino-U.S. ties, but also conducive to regional and
world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian Presidents End Lengthy Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad entered a
four-hour lengthy discussion over lunch at this Mediterranean port
city Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents dwelted upon a wide range of topics from the
stalled Middle East peace process, to the American role of
sponsorship and initiative for further Israeli withdrawal, and to
the European effort to push the peace wheel forward.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks at Mubarak's Ras-El-Teen Palace, Assad's
spokesman Nabil Osman told Xinhua that they would focus on the
idea to hold an international conference on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents gave a brief, three-minute press conference
after their talks, whose details were not available.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said "We can not assume the American-sponsored peace
process has been neglected or canceled, neither can we assume the
U.S. initiative (on Israeli redeployment) has failed."
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is to activate the European role, along with
the American role," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between Assad and Mubarak in four
months, and Mubarak said they meet on regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Assad told reporters that the Egyptian-French overture for an
international conference on the peace process "is still on the
table under examination." He showed no sign of endorsing it or
rejecting it.
</P>
<P>
The overture was jointly put forward by Mubarak and French
President Jacques Chirac in May, in order to give all parties
concerned an opportunity to discuss relaunching the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Assad, accompanied by Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, arrived here earlier Sunday. He
has left for home after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Syria has refused to resume talks with Israel unless Israel
agrees to return the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Mideast
War, a term reportedly promised by Israel's late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.

<HEADLINE> High Turn-out in Cambodia's Trouble-Free Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodians defied fears of
violence and turned out to vote in large numbers Sunday in a
largely trouble-free general election.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) said the
election proceeded "in a peaceful and smooth way" except for some
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
A large turnout had been seen in the polling which started at
7:00 a.m. (local time), and by 16:00 p.m. most stations had been
closed, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The NEC estimated that by 11:00 a.m., most of the 5.4 million
registered voters had cast their ballots with high turn-out rates
between 80 to 90 percent in different areas.
</P>
<P>
A final estimation will be given later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a NEC spokesman said a government position was
attacked by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Anlong Veng Province near
the border with Thailand shortly before the polling.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing fighting left 10 people dead, including one
guerrilla, two government soldiers and seven civilians. Two other
guerrillas were captured, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said there was no clear evidence that the
attack was intended to hamper the election, and polling went on
undisturbed in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, the second prime minister, said after casting his
ballot that the peaceful election was a victory for the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful election was "a victory for the Cambodian people,
the royal government and the international community which has
offered moral and material support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, also the vice-president of the ruling Cambodian
People's Party, was locked in a fierce competition with Prince
Norodom Nanariddh of the Funcinpec party and Sam Rainsy of the Sam
Rainsy Party for seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A new government will be formed according to the seats obtained
by the parties.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian people expect a government that will lead to
lasting peace and economic development in the war-ridden country.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Seek India's Help for Repatriating Bhutanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will seek India's help for
repatriating Bhutanese refugees who came to Nepal eight years ago,
Sri Lankan official radio reported Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will raise the
issue to Bhutan during the South Asian association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) summit scheduled to be held on July 29-31 in
Colombo, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Koirala will ask for help repatriating 100,000 Bhutanese
refugees who fled their Homeland in 1990 to escape harsh cultural
reforms, it said.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of talks between Nepal and Bhutan on the issue
have failed to agree on the repatriation terms.
</P>
<P>
With increased strain on its economy, Nepal wants all the
Bhutanese refugees to go home. But Bhutan insists that those who
left "voluntarily" cannot return, saying it will only take back
those who were forcefully evicted, the radio added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Turns Down Reports on Compromise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel has not given up its
demand that the Palestinian National Council (PNC) revise the
Palestinian Charter before an Israeli redeployment in the West
Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks, which Israel Radio said was made by Netanyahu
during a weekly cabinet meeting, contradicted reports that in the
newly-resumed talks with the Palestinians Israel would make a key
compromise concerning the revision of the Palestinian Charter.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that Israel, which has demanded
the 460-member NPC to convene and reaffirm the deletion of
sections in the Charter that call for the destruction of Israel,
would now agree to a ratification of the revision by the smaller
100-member Palestinian Liberation Organization's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Israel is prepared to back down from
its position in a hope that the Palestinians would agree to its
proposals that some part of the 13.1 percent of the West Bank due
to be handed over to the Palestinians under an American initiative
be designated as a "nature reserve," over which the Palestinians
will have limited jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the so-called "nature reserve" was said to be one
of the major disputes between the two sides which stalled their
talks just resumed last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting Netanyahu also called on his ministers
to refrain from meeting with the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) without coordinating him or Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who led the Israeli delegation in the talks.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a series of visits by several
senior Israeli officials, including Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani, to the PNA in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held a 90-minute meeting with Kahalani in Ramallah last
Friday, during which he agreed to hold another round of direct
negotiations with Israel and decided that Kahalani will hold
several meetings with his deputy, Abu Mazen, this week.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani has said that his meetings with Abu Mazen will focus
on daily affairs, not the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the PNA gave a warm welcome Thursday to Netanyahu's
coalition chairman, Meir Sheetrit, who said he had proposed some
"new ideas" during his talks with Arafat. The Palestinian leader
promised that he would consider them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Sheetrit said Netanyahu was well aware of his ideas, which
called for a summit between the Israeli prime minister and
Arafat, but Netanyahu said at Sunday's cabinet meeting that he
was "not happy" about Sheetrit's visit but he had not wanted to
cancel it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu said at the meeting he expected the
high-level Israeli-Palestinian talks, which ended last Wednesday
with no breakthrough, to be renewed "in the coming days."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Strike Is Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The ground crew union of the
Philippine Airlines (PAL) ended its five-day strike after signing
an agreement with the management on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was reached after nearly 15 hours of non-stop, all
night negotiations between the airlines' management and the
striking PAL Employees Association and a series of marathon talks
since the airlines' ground crew struck on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the pact, which was reached in the interest
of industrial peace and harmony, both parties recognized the need
to pursue measures to "rightsize" PAL's workforce.
</P>
<P>
Both parties agreed to reduce the airline's workforce by 1,800
employees, all the association members, who will be encouraged to
voluntarily avail of the rightsizing program.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada Sunday welcomed the speedy resolution
of the work stoppage in PAL and expressed the hope that the
management and labor would join hands in putting PAL's economic
house back in order.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came after Estrada himself had been actively
involved in the settlement of the PAL dispute by holding separate
meetings with both the management and the labor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the resolution of the labor dispute was good news
not only to the management and employees but more so to the
economy and he expected PAL operations which have been scaled down
due to the strike to be back to normal.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven Sri Lankan refugees,
including 15 women and 5 children, were feared drowned early
Sunday when their boat capsized along the Rameswaram coast in
south India, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The boat carrying 52 people from Pudukudiyiruppu in Northern
Sri Lanka had sunk at the confluence of Bay of Bengal and Indian
Ocean, about 10 nautical miles from Tamil Nadu coast of India, PTI
said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, which had avoided the normal route to escape
detection by Sri Lanka Navy and India Coast Guard, had gone
further off course and got trapped in a swirl in the rough sea
amid gusty wind conditions.
</P>
<P>
Five people swam to safety and reached Rameswaram, a coastal
city in Tamil Nadu, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Coast Guard and Sri Lanka Navy personnel have launched
search operations for the missing refugees, but chances of finding
survivors were bleak due to rough sea conditions, PTI quoted
officials sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survivors stated that the boatmen had entered into the sea
despite warning by local fishermen against it in view of
unfavorable weather.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened two hours after the refugees had left on
their clandestine voyage from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of any immediate help was also ruled out in
view of the unusual route taken by the boat, said the officials.

</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, turnout appears to have been very high, at least in
Phnom Penh," he continued in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the Joint International Observer Group
and other nations should not leap to any quick conclusions and
should not certify the election in any way until they have
completed a comprehensive evaluation of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) said
the elections were conducted "in a peaceful and smooth way" except
for some technical problems.
</P>
<P>
The NEC reported a large turnout for the polling that started
at 7:00 a.m. and ended at 16:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the elections, there had been reports about
intimidation, violence and killings designed to frighten away
voters, giving rise to speculation that the elections would be
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Cambodian People's Party led by incumbent
co-premier Hun Sen and the FUNCINPEC party under Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy's party is a major contender for seats of
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A new government will be formed according to the seats obtained
by the parties in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The NEC estimated that by 11:00 a.m. most of the 5.4 million
registered voters cast their ballots, with turnout rates ranging
from 80 to 90 percent in different areas. A final estimation will
be given later.
</P>
<P>
The conducting of the peaceful elections was "a victory for the
Cambodian people, the royal government and the international
community which has offered moral and material support," Hun Sen
said after casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian people expect the elections to produce a
government that will lead them to lasting peace and economic
development in a country torn by decades of war.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Rebel Leader Sent Home for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebel leader Foday
Sankoh, detained in Nigeria for more than one year, was flown
back Saturday to his home country to face treason charges, the
Post Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who led the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel
movement in Sierra Leone, was flown back to the capital Freetown
alongside three Russian pilots arrested with him.
</P>
<P>
The RUF leader was arrested and put into house arrest in March
1996 when he arrived in Nigeria ostensibly on a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Following his arrest, a division arose within the RUF ranks on
whether to continue or abandon the rebellion the armed group
launched since early 1990s against successive governments.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was appointed the second person of Sierra Leone by
Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who led the May 25, 1997 military coup
to overthrow the legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 RUF combatants became allied to the junta forces
following the second day of the coup.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Sankoh, some 40 soldiers of the former Sierra
Leonean armed forces are already on trial for treason in
connection with their role in the coup last year.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta and allied RUF rebels are still
holding parts of minerals-rich areas in the east and north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led west African peace-keeping force, which
restored Kabbah's government in March this year, is stepping up
its mopping-up exercise for an early removal of the forces.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Earns More from Coffee Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A sum of 410.8 million U.S.
Dollars has been earned from coffee export during the just-ended
1997/98 fiscal year, according to the Coffee and Tea Authority of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The earnings in the fiscal year from July 8, 1997 to July 7,
1998 had risen by 15 percent and 47 percent against the fiscal
years of 1996/97 and 1995/96 respectively, Tsegaye Berhane,
General Manager of the authority, said recently.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald newspaper Sunday quoted Berhane as saying
that the authority had an initial plan of earning 436.6 million
U.S. Dollars by exporting 160,000 tons of coffee during the
fiscal year, but it only achieved 94 percent of the target.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of major coffee producers and exporters in
Africa. It produces about 300,000 tons of coffee yearly and
coffee generates 60 percent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings every year. The private sector now exports 84 percent of
coffee annually.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the Ethio-Eritrean border dispute on May
6 this year, the authority has opened a branch office in Djibouti
to treat the export of coffee.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says Missile Deterrent Is Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani stated on Sunday that Iran's newly acquired missile
capability is not against the regional countries, but a
deterrent against Israel's expansionist policy.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Tehran radio, Shamkhani said
that Iran and the regional Muslim countries have no ambition
about each other, adding that "our might belongs to them and
their might belongs to us."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the world's negative reaction to Iran's
Wednesday missile test, reiterating that Iran's policy was and is
to reduce tensions and to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the objective of the propaganda by
foreign powers and Israel against Iran's defense policy is to
justify their presence in the region and to justify Israel's
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Israel has emerged as an arsenal and a depot which is
truly explosive and has all types of weaponry," he said, but the
world propaganda shows no sensitivity to this fact.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani on Saturday confirmed that Iran has "successfully"
tested a missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers by Iranian
experts and "without any assistance from foreign countries."
</P>
<P>
His confirmation aroused worldwide criticism about Iran's
policy on military capacities.
</P>
<P>
The United States on Thursday expressed concern after it
detected Iran's test of the Shahab-3 or Meteor-3 missile, which
meant that Iran could target Israel and Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally
in Gulf, and the U.S. forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani stressed that the missile test was aimed at
promoting its deterrent capability and its investments on some
defense needs was to maintain peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio in a commentary on Sunday attacked the allegation
that Iran's missile capability would pose a serious threat to the
regional countries, saying that Iran is after a collective defense
system with Muslim countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the conservative daily Tehran Times said that
Iran's access to intermediate missile will "definitively boost
the collective defense power of Muslim countries against their
common enemy (Israel)."
</P>
<P>
The moderate daily Iran News said in an editorial that
"Iran's relations with neighboring countries are so warm that
these countries are not concerned with Iranian missiles, rather
they consider it as a weapon to defend their interests,
too."

<HEADLINE> economic Growth, Poverty Eradication Urgent Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Sunday that the most pressing tasks
before the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) are to accelerate economic growth and eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Koirala said that with the entry
into force of the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA)
in December 1995, economic cooperation has gained momentum in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident that a successful conclusion of the SAPTA
negotiations will enhance the scope of trade and investment in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "sustained economic growth is the only way to
lead South Asia out of poverty."
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of trade negotiations have been completed under
SAPTA, offering over 2,000 items of products for preferential
treatment in the seven member states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, exclusive, special and more favorable
treatment and additional measures have been offered to Bangladesh,
Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal, the four least developed countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is now under way toward the removal of
non-tariff barriers and structural impediments, more tariff
concessions and the expansion of lists of products for
preferential trade in the region so that the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) could be preferably obtained by the 2001 as
envisaged by the SAARC leaders in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the tenth SAARC summit will concentrate on
further strengthening economic cooperation among member states
with special consideration for the needs and problems of the least
developed member states," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The main focus of the GEP recommendations is also on an
accelerated economic cooperation," he said. "The Colombo summit
will examine the report in detail," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eminent Persons (GEP) was commissioned last year
as directed by the leaders to make a comprehensive review of SAARC
and map out the future strategy for the regional grouping formed
in December 1985. The 10th SAARC summit is scheduled for July
29-31.
</P>
<P>
On the achievements of SAARC in the past 13 years, the prime
minister said that "the first decade of SAARC was essentially the
formative stage in which it was an essential exercise to create an
atmosphere of trust and confidence between member states."
</P>
<P>
"As South Asia is endowed with abundant natural as well as human
resources, we have to utilize our resource endowment for the
development of South Asia through cooperative programs focused on
the core areas of economy and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
To promote rapid economic development, Nepal initiated in
December 1996 the concept of Growth Quadrangle comprising
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal with a view to jointly
developing the eastern Himalayan rivers.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of the four countries met here on July 17
this year for the second time to consider the working modalities
of the Growth Quadrangle.
</P>
<P>
"Participating states have already identified broad areas of
cooperation under this venture," he added.
</P>
<P>
At their last summit in May 1997, SAARC leaders encouraged the
development of specific projects relevant to the specific
individual needs of three or more member countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
has said that the European Union (EU) wants to show "a higher
profile" in seeking a peaceful solution to the escalating conflict
in Yugoslavia's Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German Sunday newspaper Bilding am
Sonntag, Kinkel said that EU envoys from Britain, Austria and
Germany, the so-called troika holding the last, current and next
presidency of the EU, would travel to Belgrade and Kosovo next
Tuesday in a new effort to try to end the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that he and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine
had worked out detailed proposals for direct negotiations between
the Kosovo conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
"It is already at the eleventh hour and both sides are
balancing on the brink of an abyss," said Kinkel in describing the
current situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the belief that it might eventually be
inevitable to impose coercive measures in line with Capital VII of
the United Nations Charter to achieve peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that a NATO military intervention remains the
last resort, Kinkel reiterated that such a move would require a
U.N. mandate which had been impossible due to the opposition from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also said in the interview that the German authorities
were examining ways to prevent armed Kosovo rebels from using
funds raised from Kosovo-Albanians living in Germany to purchase
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Arrives in Egypt for Talks on </HEADLINE>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad arrived in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria Sunday
morning to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and discuss how
to revive the long-stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the arrival, the two presidents held talks at Mubarak's
Ras-El-Teen Palace, focusing on the idea to hold an international
conference on the peace process, Assad's spokesman Nabil Osman
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The idea was jointly put forward by the French and Egyptian
presidents in May to give all parties concerned an opportunity to
discuss relaunching the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Assad is accompanied by Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa during his hours' visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between Assad and Mubarak in four
months.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day state visit to France on July 16-18,
Al-Assad held talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on Mideast peace, including the proposed
conference.
</P>
<P>
Assad has neither rejected nor explicitly accepted the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The idea is not the only option for reviving the peace process,
there are also other proposals, Osman said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Syria has refused to resume talks with Israel unless it returns
the occupied Golan Heights to Syria, a term reportedly promised by
Israel's former Labor government led by assassinated Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

<HEADLINE> Cambodians Vote for Peace, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodians thronged to polling
stations across the country early Sunday to elect a new National
Assembly that is expected to lead the country to peace and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, people were seen waiting in queues outside
polling stations long before the voting began at 7:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the winner will be able to represent the will of the
people. All Cambodians like me want peace, so we would vote for
whichever party can bring about peace to this country," said a
68-year-old street vendor who identified himself only as Jinsong.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for us to make our own
choices. Nobody forces us to come here. We all want to choose what
we like the most," said Jinsong, who had arrived hours before the
polling started.
</P>
<P>
The old man told reporters that all his seven family members
had come to vote, but for different candidates.
</P>
<P>
The election pitted Hun Sen, incumbent co-premier and
vice-president of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), against
Prince Norodom Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of the Sam
Rainsy Party.
</P>
<P>
The three politicians are the major contenders for political
power in the country torn by decades of war.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six other small parties are also scrambling for the 122
seats at the National Assembly. A party needs a two-thirds
majority, or 82 seats, to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Many observers believe that not a single party would be able
to win the required majority and therefore the next government
would likely be a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere at polling stations has been peaceful, with no
reports of violence so far. Voters quietly entered makeshift
cabins one by one to cast their secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, whose party carries much weight in the country's
politics, cast his ballot at Tkhmau polling station, seven
kilometers south of Phnom Penh. He was accompanied by his wife,
followed by a few bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
He said the election turned out to be peaceful contrary to
previous predictions, which is a clear indication of victory for
the Cambodian people, the royal government and the international
community which offered moral and material support.
</P>
<P>
"For countries like Cambodia which faces chaos, it is not easy
to organize elections in a peaceful way," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was the first organized by the Cambodians
themselves in almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen compared the election to that in 1993 when tanks and
armored vehicles were seen deployed at polling stations, and said,
"Today you can see no tanks, no armored vehicles, no arms. Even my
bodyguards are bare-handed."
</P>
<P>
The 1993 election, organized by the United Nations, resulted in
the formation of a coalition government led by first-premier
Norodom Ranariddh and co-premier Hun Sen. Ranariddh was ousted in
July last year.
</P>
<P>
Hun said he believed the election would be "free, fair and
without violence."
</P>
<P>
About 700 international and 40,000 local observers are
monitoring the polling across the country.
</P>
<P>
Chheng Phon, chairman of the Cambodian National Election
Committee, told Xinhua that Cambodians have shown great enthusiasm
for the election which they believe would usher in a new era of
peace and development in the impoverished country.

<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Security is getting extremely
tight with the 10th summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) drawing near in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have taken maximum possible security measures

<P>
Some 6,000 police personnel will be deployed in Colombo apart

About 25 ships and gunboats have been stationed along the coast

possible rebel attack.
</P>
<P>
Colombo and the routes taken by the heads of state or

"Be very strict about strangers, avoid entertaining or giving
employment to outsiders during the period of SAARC sessions,"
Colombo police chief Jagath Jayawardena appealed to the public.

prove their identities will be taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
He said residents should not allow vehicles of outsiders
including motorcycles, carts and ice cream vans to be parked in
their compounds or outside the houses.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel at roadblocks have been ordered to do a full
search of the vehicles and the passengers.
</P>
<P>
"The security is very tight, I don't think there will be any
chance for the Tamil rebels," said a senior police officer.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting
with Sri Lanka government forces for an independent Tamil state
since 1983. About 55,000 people were killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Three school students were injured recently as a policeman

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Justifies Iran Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan has said that Iran has the right to take steps for
strengthening its defense.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the remarks to the reporters when
asked for comments on the news that Iran has tested a missile,
which has a potential range of 800 miles (1,300 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
"Every one knows that the highly advanced Iranian missile
program had been in progress for some time," Gohar said, adding
that "Iran has the right to do so."
</P>
<P>
Iran confirmed Saturday that it has successfully tested a
long-range missile "Shahab 3" that it developed without foreign
help. But Israel has accused Russia of providing equipment and
know-how to the Iranian missile program.
</P>
<P>
Questioned as to why major powers oppose moves by small
countries, especially Islamic states, to strengthen their defense,
Gohar said that it is because of misgiving within the western
world "as some people in the west are sowing seed on mistrust."

<HEADLINE> 200 People Injured in Philippine City's Power Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 200 people were injured
Sunday when armed policemen tried to disperse supporters of a
deposed mayor who have put up picket lines and barricades for
weeks in Subic Bay Free Port, some 80 kilometers northeast of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that 20 policemen were also injured when a
group of anti-riot policemen, armed with rifles, used tear gas in
dispersing the die-hard supporters of former Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) Chairman Dick Gordon.
</P>
<P>
Gordon, whose term as SBMA chief expired in May this year, was
reappointed for one more term by former president Fidel Ramos in
exchange for his withdrawal from the May 1998 presidential race.
But he was fired by Ramos' successor, President Joseph Estrada,
shortly after Estrada assumed office last month.
</P>
<P>
Police said Gordon's supporters attacked the policemen by
throwing stones and tried to repel advancing cops with knives and
improvised weapons.
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of people were seriously wounded, including a
policeman stabbed in the belly. They were rushed to nearby
hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
But Gordon's loyalists still controlled the building where
Gordon has digged in after he refused to relinquish his post to
the new SBMA chief appointed by Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Gordon was able to get a regional trial court's 22-day
temporary restraining order which allowed him to continue in
office pending the settlement of the legal question regarding
validity of his re-appointment by Ramos.
</P>
<P>
But the order was nullified by a court in the northern city of
Olongapo where Subic Port is located. Gordon appealed the decision
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the power row in the free port is
expected to damage its reputation as the country's largest
economic zone, formerly a major U.S. air base.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Named S. Leone's Army Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian army officer who toppled
the military junta in Freetown in mid February this year, has
been appointed Sierra Loene's chief of army staff and minister of
internal affairs by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
General Brig.-Gen. Maxwell Khobe was the head of Nigeria's
internal security until his appointment, the newspaper This Day
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the cabinet, Khobe would advise Kabbah's
government on the structure, composition and size of the new
army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier he had been task force commander of the west African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone. Operating under the
code name Operation Sandstorm, the force captured the Sierra
Leonean capital Freetown from the junta led by Major Johnny Paul
Koroma who seized power in a coup in May last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Khobe's new position will come in
handy in President Kabbah's resolve to try some captured soldiers
of the deposed junta.
</P>
<P>
Following the new posting, the director of operation at the
Nigerian army headquarters, Brig.-Gen. Abu Amodu has become the
second Nigerian officer to command to ECOMOG task force in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The task force was set up about 10 months ago to dislodge
Koroma and his allied rebels from power and from the hinterlands
especially the minerals rich areas of Kailahon in the east where
the remnants of the junta is still holding.

<HEADLINE> Iranian New Minister Wants More Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Musavi Lari is going to request the supreme leader to
appoint him as the acting commander of the security forces in a
bid to promote the status of law and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
The leading English-language daily Tehran Times Sunday quoted
an informed source close to the minister as saying that Lari had
expressed his view during a closed-door meeting with Majlis
(Parliament) deputies before the Majlis gave a vote of confidence
on him on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the interior ministry and the security
forces were strained after the government of the moderate cleric
President Mohammad Khatami came to power last August. The supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei did not appoint former Interior
Minister Abdollah Nouri as the acting commander of the forces as
usual.
</P>
<P>
Some moderate groups even blast the security forces for
cooperating with hard-liners to violently attack legal
demonstrations and rallies organized by the moderates.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's constitution, the supreme leader is the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, including the army, the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the security forces.
</P>
<P>
In the past, upon the request of the interior minister, the
leader normally appointed him as the acting commander of the
security forces, Tehran Times said, but Nouri was not appointed
because he did not request during his 10-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
Nouri and his supporters have complained that the interior
ministry could not guarantee law and order because the security
forces were not under his command, while his conservative
opponents argued he lacked the ability to maintain law and order.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was impeached and sacked on June 21 by the
conservative-dominated Majlis.
</P>
<P>
After Lari gained a vote of confidence from the Majlis to
succeed Nouri, moderate newspapers demanded the security forces
to come under the command of the interior ministry in order to
prevent any disorder in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, the interior ministry is
responsible for law and order in the country and security at the
borders. It issues permission for demonstrations, rallies and
activities of political parties and organizations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Union Wants Talks with Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) has called for an urgent meeting with President
Robert Mugabe within the next two weeks to resolve its demands
for the scrapping of various taxes.
</P>
<P>
The ending of the five-day national strike will depend on the
outcome of the meeting, the ZCTU said in a communique released
after its general council meeting in Mutare of east Zimbabwe
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has demanded immediate removal of last December's 2.5
percent increase on sales tax, the five percent development levy
and the 15 percent tax on pension fund profits.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government recently agreed to scrap the sales
tax in the next fiscal year, but the development levy is to
remain as it was essentially for rural development. The tax on
pensions is also to remain.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's response to the demands, ZCTU
President Gibson Sibanda said that "in its assessment, the ZCTU
regards the response as disappointing and inadequate to meet the
expectations of workers."
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said that the government had missed a historical
opportunity to take visible steps to create an environment for
further negotiations over long-term sustainable solutions to the
economic crisis, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government had failed to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai said President Mugabe
had dismissed all "intermediate structures" in the country, which
included parliament and cabinet ministers. These structures had
become ineffective and President Mugabe was directly in command.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the ZCTU organized a countrywide work
boycott which paralyzed the country's economy, resulting in loss
of business amounting to million of Dollars.

JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Ministry has launched an intensive campaign
to allay the potential damage to relations with the Arab States
that could ensue from the Islamic conference on Jerusalem, due to
open in Morocco on Wednesday. A senior Israeli official said that
one of the most disturbing consequences of the conference could be
a call for a halt to normalization of relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Cronies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
expressed concern Saturday night that an ambush could be waiting
them in the Knesset (parliament) on Sunday in the form of a
no-confidence vote that could bring down the government. They
said that collaboration between Opposition and some "extremist
members" of the governing coalition could form a majority of 61 in
the 120-seat Knesset to bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani will
demand that Netanyahu designate him to be member of the Israeli
negotiation group with the Palestinians on the second redeployment
of the Israeli troops in the West Bank. Kahalani wanted to "save
the peace process" with his influence.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Approves Investment Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar approved a total
of 22 investment projects worth 4 billion U.S. Dollars in the
1997/98 financial year, bringing the total number of investment
projects to more than 220 since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Finance of Zanzibar Amina Salim Ali told the
Isles House of Representatives which is in budget session that
the number of projects approved by the Zanzibar Investment
Promotion Agency (ZIPA) increased compared with 13 projects in
1996/97 fiscal year, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the foundation in 1992, the ZIPA has
approved more than 220 investment projects which have provided
7,000 jobs and contributed a huge part to the Gross National
Product.
</P>
<P>
"The government has during 1997/98 financial year realized
handsome collection of revenue from investment projects in terms
of license fees, hotel levy, stamp duty and other taxes charged
on the projects," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most of the projects are focused on tourism
sector, sea and air transportation and industrial sector while 10
projects were revoked licenses last year for failure to comply
with the investment conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to thrust infrastructural
development to entice potential investors and exporters in the
Isles," Ali said.
</P>
<P>
The glut in the international clove market has forced Zanzibar
to seek for economic options to salvage the indian ocean islands
from further economic deterioration and living hardships.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.7 million people in
central China's Hunan province have plunged into the fight against
the floods, reinforcing dykes and dams where the floods will pass
through.
</P>
<P>
As the water level measured at the east and south parts of the
Dongting Lake and the Chenglingji section of the Yangtze River has
kept rising and is expected to exceed the record high, the
situation is extremely critical, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government authorities have organized relief
workers to the flooded areas to help the people there. The
People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police also joined
in the anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
Relief materials such as rubber boats and life buoys have been
shipped to the flood-hit areas and a group of rescue experts has
also been sent there by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Torrential flood water, resulting from continuous heavy rain in
the province since July 20, broke many dykes alongside the lake,
greatly affecting the industrial production and people's daily
life, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Many farming fields were inundated and lots of residential
houses were destroyed by the floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China underlined its superiority in the diving
pool Saturday by winning two more gold medals, while a Briton and an American
claimed triathlon titles on the seventh day of the 1998 Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
China's Cai Yuyan and Sang Xue outclassed the rest of the field to win the
women's synchronized platform with a total of 297.00 points from five dives,
ahead of Ukraine's Olena Zhupina and Svetlana Serbina, 261.78, and Ute Wetzig
and Anke Piper of Germany, 258.12.
</P>
<P>
Cai, 16, winner of the platform and a runner-up of the platform synchronized
event at this year's Worlds, joined force with the 14-year-old Sang to dominate
the final in a commanding style.
</P>
<P>
They built up a clear margin over their closest rivals after three rounds,
and registered the top two highest scores in the next two dives.
</P>
<P>
The German pair stood a good chance to overtake the Ukraine's duo before the
final outing, but their modest score of 48.60 was too poor to turn the table,
while Zhupina and Serbina got a solid score of 53.10 in the last round.
</P>
<P>
China's Yu Zhoucheng and Xu Hao also dived all the way to take the men's
3-meter synchronized springboard title with a total of 311.46 points, well
ahead of Russia's Alexei Ilyin and Dmitri Baibakov with almost 15 points to
spare.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mesch and Holger Schlepps of Germany, world championships
runners-up, wound up third.
</P>
<P>
The other gold offered today in the diving contest - the women's 3-meter
springboard final - produced some upset.
</P>
<P>
Irina Lashko of Russia, 1998 world champion in both the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard, looked set to add another gold to her 1-meter event title won on
Friday, but she made a big splash on her seventh dive and the poor performance
brought her only 35.10 points.
</P>
<P>
China's Zhang Jing, who teamed up with Guo Jingjing to win the synchronized
platform on Friday, seized the chance to move to second place behind Yuliya
Pakhalina of Russia.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese blew her opportunity on the next round by scoring only
36.12. Guo made a no show dive on her second action and faded to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
With all the big names committing errors, Pakhalina managed to put on a
series of smooth displays to win the gold. Lashko finished third behind
Australian Chantelle Michell.
</P>
<P>
In the triathlon competition, Britain's Simon Lessing defended his title
successfully in the men's section, recording the second-fastest splits in all
three disciplines (swimming, cycling and running). He clocked 20 minutes 34
second in swimming, 54:15 in cycling and 30:20 for a cross-country run.
</P>
<P>
The women's race was won by American Loretta Harrop, who turned in as the
second fastest swimmer and tied for the fastest bike leg.
</P>
<P>
In today's women's soccer semifinals, China beat Norway 4-2 in a penalty
shoot-out after tying 1-1 in 90 minutes, while the United States whitewashed
Denmark 5-0. China will challenge the American team tomorrow in an Olympic gold
medal rematch.
</P>
<P>
Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong saved her team by clearing out a penalty kick
after the two sides deadlocked in the regular time.
</P>
<P>
The American team led the first half 3-0 and went on to humiliate its rivals
in the lopsided game. Mia Hamm hit the target three times and made her career
goals to 95.
</P>
<P>
Saturday also featured wrestling, cycling and mixed pair gymnastics
competitions.

</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Mail newspaper, Mugabe left here
Saturday for the forum to be held in Swakopmund, a resort town on
Namibia's west coast.
</P>
<P>
Several heads of state from the 14 Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member states, including South
African President Nelson Mandela and Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Bin Mohamad attended the last conference.
</P>
<P>
Smart Partnership seeks to achieve economic success in the
region through cooperation between the private and public sector
and between different states in the region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia plays a crucial role in this international economic
program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported that the
leaders are also expected to discuss a growing conflict in Angola
where more than 200 people were killed last week.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that Angola is on the brink of a renewed war
after the opposition movement of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) failed to implement peace accords
signed in Lusaka in 1994, ending two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has since imposed trade and financial
sanctions on UNITA to try to force it into compliance.

<HEADLINE> "Ugly Ducklings" Take Zookeepers For Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Two 10-day-old "ugly ducklings" at
the zoo in Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, do not yet known they will someday become elegant black
swans. That's because they were artificially hatched and have not
met their real parents.
</P>
<P>
The two little grey creatures, weighing about 200 grams, are
only happy when they see Zhang Ping, the zookeeper who bring them
worms, minced fish, and fruits or vegetables every two hours.
</P>
<P>
"Their real parents failed to hatch eggs last year, so we took
seven eggs they laid last month and put them into incubators,"
said Zhang, "Then, 36 days later, two baby swans were born, but
five others died for various reasons."
</P>
<P>
Black swans usually lay five to seven eggs a year. However,
the parents of these two babies laid another six eggs recently,
and their father is guarding their nest these days.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said they will give the swan parents another chance to
hatch their babies on their own.
</P>
<P>
At present, seven grown black swans are living at the zoo.
This was the first time the zoo hatched black swans artificially.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Umeed-e-Noor", A Home Brimming with Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The 14-year-old Mustafa, who had
been bed-ridden since he was born, made the first step in his life
recently at a special school called "Umeed-e-Noor" (ray of hope).
</P>
<P>
Mustafa is one of the 26 children from age three to 16 with
mental and physical retardation, living at "Umeed-e-Noor", a home
away from home, which has been in existence for nine years.
</P>
<P>
"Umeed-d-Noor" is a non-profit organization funded by
individuals committed to work for the benefit of physically and
mentally handicapped children in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Tucked away in a quiet area covered with greenness in this
capital city, "Umeed-e-Noor" as a special school is offering its
unique services to those mentally and physically disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the children at `Umeed-e-Noor' are abandoned or
orphaned. They are unable to perform simple daily tasks. It is sad
that these children could not enjoy the basic pleasure of life,"
said Noori Hashwani, chairperson of the special school.
</P>
<P>
It is with a wish to create a greater awareness about the
plight of these children and to give them a better tomorrow, this
special school was established, Hashwani said.
</P>
<P>
"There is not much awareness about handicapped children in our
society, and due to lack of education, they are rejected,
ill-treated and shut away, even in their own homes," the
heavyhearted Hashwani said.
</P>
<P>
"Umeed-e-Noor" in its earlier stage was only a family-styled
place to keep a few handicapped children. However, after many
years of hard endeavor, it has become a multi-functioned school.
</P>
<P>
"In a short span of time, we have been able to help a number of
special children. With our round the clock facilities and caring
staff members, these children have found a home away from home,"
Hashwani said.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, "Umeed-e-Noor" has been expanded and
has been able to recruit more of those handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
It is being run by a group of professional teachers, trainers
as well as volunteers from non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
At this special school, under the same roof, these special
children are given treatment, education, speech and physical
therapy.
</P>
<P>
Hashwani, who is keen to take in more children than already
there, said that taking care of special children is "a great
challenge".
</P>
<P>
Looking after special children at home would be a very tough
job on the family. "We are keen to grow and provide more
facilities and open up branches in other cities," she said.
</P>
<P>
The needs of children vary with their age and retardation. Some
19 children at the school are bed-ridden. They need a different
kind of care. Those with mental as well as physical disabilities
have to be looked after another way.
</P>
<P>
Hashwani is proud of her staff, and said that "without them it
would have been impossible to run this school."
</P>
<P>
Gulnar Sultana, a dedicated principal of the school and also a
well-known speech therapist, said that "they (special children)
were like a wild bunch when I first came here."
</P>
<P>
"There were children who had behavior problems, there were
children who had speech and hearing impairment."
</P>
<P>
"Now they have become very disciplined and many of them have
improved after receiving hearing and speech therapy and
physiotherapy," Sultana said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Sultana has 15 years of training in speech therapy. She feels
fortunate to have received her theoretical and practical training
from the first British speech therapist in Pakistan, Margaret
Kulson Taskeenullah, with whom she worked for six years.
</P>
<P>
Talking about children with cerebral palsy and other forms of
retardation, Sultana said that "when they first come here, they
didn't even make an eye contact. But now they respond, laugh and
show their feelings."
</P>
<P>
Sultana believes that the parents' involvement is a must.
"Umeed-e-Noor" invites the parents of these special children every
now and then and holds seminars, giving them guidance on how to
look after these children at home.
</P>
<P>
"It is much better that the special children be sent to the
school on a daily basis and the rest of the time they stay at home
with their parents," said Sultana.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Dismisses Fears About Post-election Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, Cambodia's incumbent
co-premier, said there should be no fear about post-election
violence because he would quit politics if his Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) party failed the poll.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told a press conference at his residence on Sunday,
soon after casting his ballot, that he would lead a country life
if the CPP was defeated in the election.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to his splendid and huge garden compound, Hun Sen
said, "there are so many cocoanut trees and fish ponds for me to
attend to. I could sell cocoanuts and fish if the Cambodian people
did not chose me as their leader."
</P>
<P>
The election, which began early Sunday, pit Hun Sen against
Prince Nordom Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of the Sam
Rainsy Party. The three men are major contenders for political
power in a country torn by decades of war.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears that the CPP, which controls the armed
forces, would resort to force if defeated in the election.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what he would do if his party failed the polls, Hun
Sen said with a smile: "There are so much work to do. I can look
after the house, write newspaper articles and books about
Cambodia. I can play golf as well."
</P>
<P>
He added that he would form an opposition party, "but not in a
way to disturb the government or seek sanctions against Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"If I chose to do so, the government would fall in two months
because I could lead my numerous supporters to demonstrate every
day in Phnom Penh. But that is not the way I'm doing things," Hun
Sen said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was confident his party would succeed in
the election and lead the Cambodian people to lasting peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, Hun Sen, smiling and looking relaxed, walked into
the Takhmau polling station in Kandal Province, seven kilometers
south of Phnom Penh, to cast his ballot. He was accompanied by his
wife and a few bare-handed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
"The world has witnessed the victory of the Cambodian people,"
Hun Sen said in reference to the peaceful and smooth running of
the election.
</P>
<P>
"For a country like Cambodia which faces chaos, it is not easy
to organize the election by themselves in a peaceful way. This is
a victory of the Cambodian people and the royal government," Hun
Sen said. The election is the first organized by the Cambodians
themselves in nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The election was "free, fair and without violence," Hun Sen
said, dismissing reports about CPP-inspired intimidation and
violence intended to disrupt the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to pay too much attention to such exaggerated
reports," he said, adding it was up to the National Election
Committee to investigate the reported cases of intimidation and
violence.
</P>
<P>
The election, widely expected to achieve lasting peace in the
war-torn country, will produce deputies to the 122-member National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy cast their ballots in Kompong
Cham Province, 130 kilometers east of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Both men also voiced confidence that their respective parties
would win the election.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States is for good
relations among China, the U.S. and India, U.S. Ambassador to
India Richard Celeste said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If you have to look at what the world would be in 2020 A.D. or
2030 A.D., it is hard to imagine that the world would be peaceful
and prosperous if there are no positive relations among India,
China and the United States," Celeste said in an interview with
the local Doordarshan television.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said his country wanted China to be "good
friends" of both India and the United States, according to a press
release issued by Doordanshan.
</P>
<P>
Celeste ruled out any need for third party mediation in
resolving outstanding issues between India and neighboring
Pakistan, the position maintained by India ever since the nuclear
tests carried by the two countries in May.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship can not be imposed from outside, it can only be
nurtured from inside," Celeste was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Washington wanted India to emerge as a major player in the
global stage, Celeste said, adding however that Washington was not
prepared to recognize India as a nuclear weapon state under the
term of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
He said the issue was whether there was a way for the United
Nations to recognize India's security needs and minimize
requirements to address those needs within the context of the NPT
and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

bare-handed," he said.

ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Manila, Singapore Foreign Minister
S. Jayakumar and his Malaysian counterpart Datuk Abdullah bin
Ahmad Badawi have reached agreement that the Malaysian CIQ at
Tanjong Pagar Railway Station in southern Singapore will be
relocated at Woodlands in Singapore's northern border but the
movement will not be conducted at the same time when Singapore
moves its own CIQ to Woodlands Train Check Points (WTCP) on August
1.

their authority to Malaysian customs officials during the interim
period" after Singapore moved its own CIQ to the new WTCP.

request to allow Malaysian Immigration to put some desks for its
officers on the passenger platform at the WTCP so as to enable
Malaysian officers to clear passengers for entry into Malaysia

reportedly said "there has been no agreement on interim
arrangements as described by Singapore."

statement contained "certain factual inaccuracies."

asking for is co-location inside the Woodlands Train Check Points
as the original plan."

reacted by issuing a fuller statement detailing the negotiations
between the two sides over the issue.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, Cambodia's incumbent
co-premier and leader of the ruling Cambodian People's Party
(CPP), pledged Sunday to give priority to political stability and
social order once his party was elected.
</P>
<P>
Smiling and looking relaxed, Hun Sen walked into the Takhmau
polling station in Kandal Province seven kilometers south of this
capital city soon after Cambodians across the country
began voting early in the day.
</P>
<P>
The election, crucial for the future of Cambodia, will produce
deputies to the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh of Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy of Sam Rainsy
Party, two other major contenders for political power, cast their
ballots in Kompong Cham Province, 130 kilometers east of Phnom
Penh.
</P>
<P>
The three men all voiced confidence that their respective
parties would win the election.
</P>
<P>
Polls opened at 7:00 a.m. local time in 11,699 polling stations
in 23 constituencies and are due to close at 4:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
A total of 39 political parties are expected to take part in
the contest.

Election officials predict that voter turnout will be higher
than the previous election in 1993, when about 90 percent of the
voters went to the polls. The party which wins most seats at the
top legislature has the right to choose the country's leader.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here believed none of the party will win the
quorum to form a new government by its own. Cambodia's next
government will be a coalition one.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting will begin Monday and initial results of the poll
are expected to be released on August 1. The final outcome will
not be released before August 29.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Oil Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Peru's oil output was down 6.2
percent from an average of 121,700 barrels a day last year to
114,100 barrels a day in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The total output was 20.651 billion barrels in the first six
months, compared to 22.028 billion barrels in the same period last
year, said the Mining, Oil and Energy National Society.
</P>
<P>
The reduced production, said Rafael Samaniego, chairman of the
oil committee of the trade association known as the SNMPE in
Spanish on Saturday, was the result of three major factors.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it was the El Nino phenomenon that brought down the
output of two big oil companies in the country's northern jungle,
Occidental and Pluspetrol, by 7 percent and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, severe weather conditions caused by the abnormally
warm ocean current cut the production of two other oil firms
operating in the central jungle, Maple and Aguaytia, by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, as shown by an SNMPE report, investment into the oil
sector of Peru slowed down considerably in January through June
after the failure in the exploration of five new oil wells.
</P>
<P>
As a result, investment in oil activities has totaled only 70
million U.S. dollars so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the drop of oil prices at the world market, from an
average of 19.20 dollars a barrel in 1997 to 12.50 dollars a
barrel in the year's first four months, depressed the production.

African counterpart Nelson Mandela signed two agreements on July
23 on cooperation and future assistance in the war against drug,

SANTIAGO -- Chile registered 8.03 billion U.S. dollars in
exports and 9.13 billion dollars in imports in the year's first
six months, resulting in a trade deficit of 1.10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, as reported by the Central Bank, was attributed to
the drop in the prices, as well as volumes, of the country's main
exports partly due to the ongoing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer,
has doubled its domestic consumption to become the biggest coffee
consumer worldwide second only to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's domestic coffee consumption is projected to grow from
6.5 million bags, each weighing 60 kilograms, in 1960 to 12.6
million bags this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's yearly coffee output is 27 million bags, and a
record high of 33 million bags is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Sales of motor vehicles in Chile amounted to 76,377
units during the first half of the year, down 2.6 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as estimations go, vehicle sales will be off 5-10
percent for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was attributed to the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and a rise in interest rate on credits extended
for personal consumption.

The project, the largest of its kind in China, is located
in Shacheng in north China's Hebei Province,.
</P>
<P>
The 660 million yuan investment in the winery will be provided
solely by China Great Wall Wine.
</P>
<P>
The company has already completed a 2,000 ha vineyard to supply
grapes for the winery.
</P>
<P>
China Great Wall Wine is a joint venture between Zhangjiakou
Great Wall Wine Company of Hebei, China National Cereals, Oils and
Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp and a Hong Kong partner.

<P>
Industry experts say the majority of Chinese-made dry red wines
are now processed from imported grapes. This project will help
improve the quality of Chinese wines and lower their cost.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Newsprint Firms Still Face Dumping Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's first anti-dumping
investigation will continue in line with international practices,
Ma Jixian, chief investigator of the Anti-dumping Office under the
State Economic and Trade Commission, said in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The first anti-dumping case, lodged against Canadian, the
Republic of Korean (ROK) and U.S. newsprint exporters to China,
was initiated last December, it reported.
</P>
<P>
After seven months of investigations, the primary determination
was announced on July 9 of this year, declaring that the Canadian,
ROK and U.S. newsprint exports to China have substantially damaged
China's newsprint production industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
The determination required Chinese importers to cash deposits
with Chinese Customs for future newsprint imports from the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the primary determination, the
prosecuted newsprint exporters have 37 days to appeal to SETC or
MOFTEC. But to date, none have submitted any formal statements,
according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the prosecuted side can also request a public
hearing where the two sides can present their own evidence and
hold discussions before the final determination is made.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Not to Join NATO Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will not directly
participate in NATO's possible military intervention in Kosovo,
said Hungarian Prime Minister Orban Viktor.
</P>
<P>
In talks on Saturday with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
at the Western military bloc's headquarters in Brussels, Orban
said his country needs to be prudent towards the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government holds more highly the national
interest of Hungary, Orban was quoted as saying during a one-day
tour of Brussels by reports published in the Hungarian press here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that hundrends of thousands of ethnic Hungarians live
in the Serbian Republic of the Yugoslav Federation calls for the
Hungarian government to explicitly define the extent of its moves,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Orban said, 500 ethnic Hungarian soldiers
recruited by Serbia have been sent to Kosovo, a Yugoslav province
where ethnic Albanians are seeking independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, his government should avoid the occurrence of
fighting among Hungarians of different nationalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hungarian head of government said his country is
willing to offer logistic and medical assistance if NATO launches
military actions in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Price Cutting Challenges China's Container Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's shipping container
manufacturing sector has become highly competitive as profit
margins are reaching their minimum levels, driving out small
players while strengthening the clout of heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
Several small manufacturers of the containers, which are used
to ship products throughout the world, have been forced to shut
down, while some have been bought out by larger manufacturers.
About 70 percent of nearly 40 container producers throughout the
country are losing money, Business Weekly reported toady.
</P>
<P>
As competition is further intensifying and the profit margin
continues to shrink, many more small firms are expected to quit
the container manufacturing business.
</P>
<P>
China International Marine Containers (Group) Ltd, the world's
leading container maker, haven't escaped the cut-throat
competition unscathed.
</P>
<P>
The company's profit margin has been squeezed sharply even
though its profits have been rising since 1995, it reported.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the public company reported 193 million yuan (23.25
million U.S. dollars) in net profits on sales of 230 million yuan
(27 million U.S. dollars). Its sales grew greatly in the first
half of this year compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Prices for exported containers have seen continuous drops from
2,300 US dollars in 1995 to the current 1,750 US dollars, 400 US
dollars lower than those made in Europe and 200 US dollars lower
than in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Some local container producers, with bank loans, have the
financial strength to cut prices to such a point where production
costs are barely covered.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the related State authorities to take effective
measures to clamp down on artificial price cuts," the Weekly
quoted Li Yunqiu, Vice general-secretary of China Container
Industry Association, as saying.

<HEADLINE> Rural Housing Offers New Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Residential housing in China's
vast rural areas has emerged as a new economic growth point at a
time when the country needs to stimulate domestic market demand in
order to grow the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from rural construction departments indicate that
Chinese farmers have amassed disposable income of over 1.6
trillion yuan, including bank savings and cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
Farmers usually save money for marriages and houses, with a
major portion of related funds earmarked for housing. For example,
more than 5.3 million rural households, or 61 percent of the total
number in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have either
constructed, expanded or refurbished houses over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
A related study revealed that close to 10 percent of the
country's rural households build new houses annually, with funds
spent on building materials approaching 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi completed construction of 46.59 million sq.m. of living
space during 1997, with 62.6 percent of the total going to rural
families. Officials note that farmers who earning more than 3,000
yuan annually can easily afford to build new houses. Some 1.04
million rural households in the region earned above that level
during 1997, with the number of related families accounting for 13
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders predict that an increasing number of farmers
will enjoy increased earnings enabling them to spend more on
housing.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong saved a penalty
kick on Saturday to secure her team a 5-3 win over Norway in the women's soccer
semifinals at the Goodwill Games in Long Island, New York.
</P>
<P>
The two teams were deadlocked 1-1 after 90 minutes. But in the penalty kick
shoot-out, the Chinese girls excelled 4-2 to grab the victory, helped by a miss
by Norway in their fourth spot kick.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out started with Norway's Hege Rise, who converted the kick.
However, after Xie Huilin's turn in success, Risse's teammate Goril Kringen
failed to score when the experienced Chinese goal-keeper parried the ball out.
</P>
<P>
With the advantage, the Chinese players made successive three more goals in
the shoot, while Norway made another mistake as Kjershiti Thun kicked the ball
out from the right side, thus deciding the game in China's favor.
</P>
<P>
"The team's spirit helped me make the saves during the penalty kicks," said
Gao Hong after the match. "I think the Norway shooters made errors while we mad
e good kicks," she added.
</P>
<P>
The two teams played a defensive game in the first half, which ended
goalless under a scorching sun at the Nassau County Mitchel Athletics Complex.
The Chinese girls made four shooting attempts while their European rivals made
three. But they were either saved or shot off the target.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, both groups played offensively. Norway opened the
scoring in the 29th minute when forward Marianne Pettersen dribbled the ball in
the right and made a shot which was blocked by Gao, who fell to the ground. But
Pettersen followed up to slot the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
However, two minutes later, the Chinese girls got a corner kick chance.
Midfielder Zhao Lihong passed the ball right to the center and Fan Yunjie
headed it home.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team will play on Sunday against the winner of the other
semifinal between the United States and Denmark Saturday evening.

BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign economic
cooperation has spread rapidly to 180 countries and regions,
according to Cui Mingmo, deputy director of the Foreign Economic
Cooperation Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Ministry .
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, he says, nearly 800 Chinese enterprises
were involved in project engineering, labor services, design,
consultation, and supervision, with 71.7 billion U.S. dollars
worth of contracts in this area that had sent 1.54 million people
abroad to work.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 5.6 billion U.S. dollars
worth of contracts were signed and 4 billion dollars worth of
business done, increases of 9.3 percent and 15.9 percent
respectively over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Trade began in western Asia and North Africa at the end of
the '70s and focused on the Mideast in the '80s, and now centers
on the Asian market, while developing the African market,
recovering the Mideast market, and exploring markets in Europe and
the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese mainly handled small and medium-sized
projects and did 300 to 400 million U.S. dollars worth of business
annually, but now, with the growing amount of capital, technology,
management, and personnel, China has increased the number of
medium-sized and large projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Take A Closer Look At Shanghai's Retail Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Germans met in
Shanghai recently for a one-day seminar on the chain store
business to study the retail business here, how to increase
consumer demand, and how to run a successful retail business.
</P>
<P>
Even though Shanghai had a year-on-year increase in retail
sales of 9.6 percent from January to June, 2.6 percentage points
more than the national average, there were problems like a falling
sale-to-profit ratio and falling consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Cai Hongsheng, the deputy director of the Municipal Commerce
Commission, told the seminar that future priority will be given to
developing chain stores so that they can do more business than
general merchandisers, by adding 100 to 200 shopping malls and
convenience stores each year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has 2,600 chain stores, which had sales of 14 billion
yuan, accounting for 10.6 percent of the city's total retail sales.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai, Shanghai will increase reforms in the
commercial sector in the latter half of the year and will reduce
the number of chain-store companies from 14 to 10 to improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Roland Berger and Partner Gmbh, Germany's largest management
consultancy organization, was represented at the seminar as was
the Shanghai Municipal Association of Chain Store Business. Maxi
Mow, a vice-president at Roland Berger, said that there is a
global trend of large department stores getting a shrinking share
of the retail business so new forms are needed for Shanghai's
retail business.

HARBIN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, an old heavy industrial

<HEADLINE> 99 Percent of Indonesian Small Enterprises Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- About 99 percent of Indonesian
small enterprises were being affected by the economic and monetary
crisis, Minister for Cooperatives and Small Enterprises Adi Sasono
was quoted by local press Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank interest rate of between 50 and 60 percent were making it
difficult for the people to develop their businesses and those
having money prefer to deposit it with banks, Adi said at an
annual meeting of the Central Primary Workers Cooperative in
Yogyakarta, Central Java, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, small-scale businessmen were having a
hard time surviving and therefore, ways had to be found to help
them overcome their problems, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the search for a solution to the economic crisis, it was
hoped the modern business sector which controlled large assets in
centralized manner would for the time being refrain from
expansion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adi noted it was the modern business community that had made
large foreign debts in U.S. dollar and this was why, when the
rupiah's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar plunged, it was
them who were in the worst predicament.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been the worst hit by the regional currency
turmoil with the rupiah losing over 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
In the face of such a condition, the minister said, workers'
cooperatives should think innovatively and come up with ideas to
create job opportunities because unemployment was a major threat
to stability.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's unemployment is expected to increase to 15.4
million at the end of this year. The figure, representing 17.1
percent of the country's 90 million work force, was revised upward
from previous estimates of 13.4 million because of the predicted
contraction in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Continues in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- On the 20th straight day of
nearly 38 degree centigrade heat, a major water main broke
Saturday for the second time in Fort Worth, Texas of the United
States, flooding streets and leaving thousands of homes with only
a trickle.
</P>
<P>
It was the same main that broke just two days earlier in the
middle of a heat wave blamed for at least 93 deaths in the state.
The heat also is responsible for the loss of 1.5 billion dollars
in crops and more than 6,700 wildfires, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide the heat has caused 141 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The temperature hit 38 degree centigrade in Fort Worth early in
the afternoon Saturday and Dallas was close behind.
</P>
<P>
There was no relief in sight. Temperatures over 39 were
expected through Wednesday, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Doug Cain. And the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
"The hottest time of the year starts July 30th through Aug.
8th," The report quoted Cain as saying. "According to the 30-year
average, we are just coming up on the hottest days of the year."
</P>
<P>
The cause of Saturday's break was not yet known. Officials
blamed the first break, which happened late Thursday, on the heat
wave, saying it probably happened because of high demand, metal
fatigue and extremely dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
Many office buildings were deserted Friday because the downtown
area was short of water and air conditioning. Water was knocked
out at two hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Texas heat deaths, Louisiana has reported 26
deaths and Oklahoma 15. Three deaths were reported in Missouri,
two in Pennsylvania and one death each in California and Arizona.
